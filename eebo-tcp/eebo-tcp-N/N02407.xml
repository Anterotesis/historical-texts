            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Now his parents went to Jeruſalem every year at the feaſt of the paſſover; and when He was twelve years old they went up to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem after the cuſtom of the feaſt.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a ſweet and pleaſant <hi>Chapter</hi> before us, fill'd with a grateful variety reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the birth and circumciſion of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and his preſentation in the Temple; how the <hi>multitudes of the heavenly Hoſts</hi> praiſed God on the one occaſion, and how <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> ſpake of him on the other.</p>
            <p>IN the verſe before my text we have a ſhort account of the infancy and childhood of our <hi>Lord,</hi> ver. 40. <hi>And the child grew, and waxed
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002854_0004_0FE6790548C915A0"/>ſtrong in ſpirit, filled with wiſdom and the grace of God was upon him.</hi> This was indeed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Son of God:</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> on the place.</note> "That whereas other children are <hi>weak</hi> in underſtanding and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution He was <hi>strong</hi> in ſpirit; whereas other children have <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> bound up in their hearts, which appears in all they ſay and do, He was filled with <hi>wiſdom;</hi> and whereas the <hi>corruption</hi> of nature early and ſtrongly appears in other children, nothing but the <hi>grace</hi> of God appear'd in him".</p>
            <p>"MY text begins the <hi>only</hi> paſſage of ſtory recorded concerning our bleſſed <hi>Lord,</hi> from his infancy to the day of his ſhewing to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at 29 years of age". The <hi>parents</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> are the perſons here ſpoken of; <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo reputed and called, and <hi>Mary</hi> his holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The thing related of them is very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and honourable; namely, their conſtant annual journey to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the feaſt of the <hi>paſſover.</hi> This was required of the <hi>males</hi> by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the women were excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Yet they that would attended, and the Mother of Chriſt was too devout not to do it. She was ſtrong in body, as well as in ſpirit, by the favour of God, and was as conſtant at the feaſt as her gracious husband. (A <hi>feaſt</hi> which had moſt of Goſpel in it, and to which ſhe was more related than ſhe knew of; her holy Son being the <hi>lamb of God,</hi> the great Antitype of all the <hi>paſchal</hi> lambs.) Such (ſays Mr.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002854_0005_0FE678970562D860"/>
               <hi>Burkit</hi>) as will go no further than they are forc'd in religious exerciſes, are ſtrangers to the <hi>Virgins</hi> piety and devotion.</p>
            <p>BUT here is <hi>one</hi> particular year ſpecified when <hi>Jeſus</hi> went up with them to the feaſt. It was when he was <hi>twelve</hi> years old. It is not ſaid that he had not gone up with them any year before that: it may be this was not the <hi>firſt</hi> time; as doubtleſs it was not the <hi>laſt,</hi> tho' it be the only time we read of.</p>
            <p>"THE <hi>Jews</hi> tell us that at <hi>thirteen</hi> year old a child was reputed with them <hi>a Son of the commandment:</hi> that is to ſay, obliged to the duties of <hi>adult Church memberſhip;</hi> having been from his infancy and circumciſion a Son of the <hi>covenant.</hi>" Now <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being ſo much in wiſdom and ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his years, we may well ſuppoſe that 'ere this time he had been at the <hi>paſſover.</hi> But this time is recorded and not the reſt, for the ſake of that wonderful conference which he now had with the <hi>Doctors</hi> in the Temple.</p>
            <p>I might offer many profitable <hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> from the text, but ſhall ſelect <hi>four</hi> only to ſpeak to.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. THAT the conſtant devout obſervation of the feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> was ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. THAT the religious among them were very <hi>strict</hi> in the obſervation of it, and of the other religious feaſts, ſtatutes and ordinances of that diſpenſation.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002854_0006_0FE6789E61932760"/>
3. THAT <hi>parents</hi> ſhould take care to go before their children in the obſervation of Divine inſtitutions.</item>
               <item>4. THAT <hi>children</hi> ſhould be early in the worſhip of God; and in their preparation for an approach to the table of Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THAT the conſtant and devout obſervation of the paſſover was ſtrictly required of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THREE</hi> times in a year they were to keep a feaſt unto the Lord; when all their <hi>males</hi> were to appear before him. Exod. 23.14, 17. This was a ſtatute for <hi>Iſrael</hi> and a law of the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> The feaſt of <hi>unleavened bread,</hi> which was the <hi>paſſover,</hi> was the <hi>firſt</hi> and chief of theſe <hi>three</hi> great feſtivals. It was inſtituted to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon the day of their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be a ſtanding memorial to them thro'out their generations of that their deliverance &amp; redemption. Exod. 12.14. <hi>This day ſhall be unto you for a memorial, and ye ſhall keep it a feaſt unto the Lord thro'out your generations; you ſhall keep it a feaſt by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for ever.</hi> Deut. 16.3. That thou may'ſt remember the day wherein <hi>thou cameſt forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE omiſſion or neglect of this inſtitution was very ſeverely threatned by God. Num. 9.13. <hi>But the man that is clean and not in a Journey, and forbeareth to keep the paſſover, even the ſame ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he brought not the offering of the Lord in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002854_0007_0FE6459D461DC008"/>his appointed ſeaſon, that man ſhall bear his ſin.</hi> Nothing could excuſe a jew from this appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſervice, but his being under ſome legal uncleanneſs which rendred him unfit for it; or his being ſick or in a journey which made it impracticable for him to be at the Lord's place: And in this caſe it was provided, that ſuch a perſon ſhould keep the paſſover a month after the appointed time. So carefully did the law provide againſt the <hi>omiſſion</hi> of the duty required. Numb. 9.10, 11. <hi>If any man of you, or of your posterity ſhall be unclean by reaſon of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he ſhall keep the paſſover unto the Lord; the fourteenth day of the ſecond month, at even, ſhall they keep it.</hi> And the ordinance was the ſame for the <hi>ſtranger,</hi> a proſelyte of the jewiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as for him that was <hi>born</hi> in the land. Num. 9.14. Only the <hi>profanation</hi> or careleſs performance of this holy ſervice was alſo as ſtrictly forbidden and ſeverely condemned: Levit. 7.20. <hi>The ſoul that eateth of the fleſh of the ſacrifice of peace offerings that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanneſs upon him, even that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people.</hi> And yet where there was a <hi>preparation of heart,</hi> and ſomething unavoidable hinder'd the exact ceremonial purifications which the law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and which the worſhipper would have complied with if he could; in ſuch a caſe (upon extraordinary occaſions) the gracious God ſometimes excuſed the want of <hi>legal puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and accepted the worſhipper and his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002854_0008_0FE6789E86AEC508"/>ſervice: As it was the caſe of many of the people in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s great paſſover. 2 Chron. 30.18. <hi>A multitude of the people out of Ephraim, Iſſachar and Zebulun, had not cleanſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet did they cat the paſſover otherwiſe than it was written: but Hezekiah prayed for them, ſaying, The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleanſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purification of the ſanctuary: And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS ſtrictly has God always required of his people <hi>obedience</hi> to his poſitive laws, and the careful <hi>obſervation</hi> of his ſtatutes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
            <p>I will not now go into the <hi>reaſons</hi> of this ſeverity of the Law in theſe injunctions. It might be ſaid,
<list>
                  <item>1. SUCH poſitive laws, ſtatutes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are the high declarations of God's <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> and ſovereighty, his abſolute <hi>will</hi> and authority; and He will be obey'd and ought to be ſo. It is indignity and rebellion for us to heſitate or delay when we know his will.</item>
                  <item>2. THEY are the inſtances of that <hi>open ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and publick acknowledgement, which as a <hi>church</hi> and people of God we render to him; whereby he is confeſſed in ſolemn and ſtated manner, glorified before others, and all are provoked to glorify him.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002854_0009_0FE6789FEB5C7AA8"/>
3. THEY are ſtanding memorials of his <hi>grace</hi> favour and mercy to a people, of his <hi>preſence</hi> among them and of his <hi>covenant</hi> with them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>AND to the people of God they are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>ſigns</hi> and appointed <hi>means</hi> of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred covenanting with God, and ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Him.</p>
            <p>BUT there needs no more to be ſaid than this, <hi>What if God will? and who ſhall ſay to him, what doeſt thou?</hi> He never ask'd his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what law he ſhould give him. And whatever it be, 'tis to be ſure holy and juſt. And the penalty in caſe of diſobedience can be no leſs than exciſion from God; which is to ſay everlaſting infinite miſery.</p>
            <p>NOW that which remains is to bring home this matter to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and argue from the <hi>Lord's paſſover</hi> under the law, unto his <hi>holy ſupper</hi> under the goſpel. For certainly theſe <hi>two ſacramental rites</hi> or actions do bear a great affinity likeneſs and relation one to the other; and what the one was to the church under the <hi>law,</hi> ſuch the other is to it under the <hi>goſpel.</hi> And it is very manifeſt in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as from the nature of the thing, ſo from the time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, that it comes in the place and room of the <hi>poſſover;</hi> by the will of Him who is the Lord our paſſover ſacrificed for us. And our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> has poſitively and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely required of us both the obſervation and ſanctification of this ordinance of the <hi>Supper,</hi> as he did enjoyn that of the <hi>paſſover</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002854_0010_0FE678A0181F00C8"/>under the law. It is his ſpecial law to us now, as much as that was to them by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> He has ſaid to us, <hi>This do ye in remembrance of me:</hi> And his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> has ſaid to us, <hi>I received of the Lord,</hi> that which I delivered unto you, <hi>that the Lord Jeſus</hi> the ſame night in which he was betrayed <hi>took bread</hi> &amp;c. It is therefore called the <hi>Lord's table</hi> and the <hi>Lord's ſupper.</hi> His <hi>authority</hi> has appointed it, and it is a ſtanding memorial of his <hi>love,</hi> a publick and perpetual <hi>honour</hi> to his name; and to us the ſtated ſign and means of our <hi>covenanting</hi> and communion with him.</p>
            <p>AND if theſe things be ſo, then what can we think or ſay, in excuſe of the eaſie <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> obſervation of this ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> Will not the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> as much enquire after and require for <hi>this</hi> thing among us, as he did of old among his people about the <hi>paſſover?</hi> Certainly he will. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> therefore ſays all thoſe awful words on this occaſion, 1 Corin. 11. <hi>ult. Let a man examine himſelf and ſo let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup: for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf: for this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you and many ſleep: for if we would judge our ſelves we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſum then is, That people ſhould not dare to live in the <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>Lord's table,</hi> as they commonly do; and that they ſhould be very <hi>devout</hi> and ſpiritual, very <hi>careful</hi> and ſerious in the obſervation of it: as the <hi>Jews</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002854_0011_0FE6788FE4251510"/>of old were obliged to be very conſtant and careful in their attendance on the <hi>paſſover feaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. MY next <hi>note</hi> is, <hi>That the Religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews were very strict and exact in the obſervation of the paſſover,</hi> and other poſitive ordinances of the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY text informs us that the <hi>parents of Chriſt</hi> were ſo: <hi>Every year they went up at the feaſt of the paſſover,</hi> and they <hi>fulfilled the days,</hi> and <hi>performed all things according to the law of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"NO difficulties hinder'd their attendance; they came up <hi>early</hi> to it, and <hi>ſtaid</hi> all the time of it. Neither <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s calling, nor the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Virgins</hi> houſhold buſineſs could keep them at home, nor haſten 'em home, before the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was entirely over. All worldly buſineſs muſt give place to divine offices, and we muſt attend God's ſervice to the end of it, if we would carry away the bleſſing.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT is indeed no evidence of the <hi>truth</hi> of grace to frequent the publick aſſemblies; yet it is an infallible ſign of the <hi>want</hi> of grace cuſtomarily to neglect them. We read of the holy parents of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> namely <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, that they were both righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, walking in all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ordinances of the Lord, blameleſs.</hi> This is a high and happy account of <hi>husband</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002854_0012_0FE678A6DFBB90D0"/>and <hi>wife,</hi> and it ſhould be ſaid of every mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried couple: If they <hi>would</hi> be righteous before God they ſhould be walking together in all the ordinances of the Lord blameleſs; and if they <hi>are</hi> righteous before God they will do ſo. Such a happy pair were <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah;</hi> they <hi>went up yearly to worſhip and to ſacrifice unto the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh: ſo they did year by year,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.3, 7. Indeed multitudes did thus attend the yearly feaſts in <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were not pious people, and ſome who were irreligious did no doubt neglect them, but <hi>all</hi> that were pious went up to the ſolemn feaſts. <hi>David</hi> ſings of their doing ſo in ſome of his moſt pleaſant <hi>pſalms:</hi> Pſal. 42. &amp; 122. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid to me, let us go into the houſe of the Lord: our feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates, O Jeruſalem! whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the teſtimony of Iſrael, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord: For I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the houſe of God, with the voice of joy and praiſe; with a multitude that kept holy-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>reflections</hi> which now naturally occur to us are ſuch as theſe. How comes it to paſs that we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not as <hi>careful</hi> and exact, as <hi>conſtant</hi> and conſcientious in attending on the ordinance of the <hi>Lord's ſupper;</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were in the obſervation of the <hi>paſſover</hi> and other ordinances of the <hi>law?</hi> Should not a People profeſſing the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhew their reverend and religious regard to the <hi>memorial of his death?</hi> and ſhould not people
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002854_0013_0FE678A704DE23B8"/>of gravity and ſeriouſneſs in the chriſtian Church hold themſelves bound and tied up by the command of their <hi>dying Saviour?</hi> For if the <hi>Law</hi> given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was reverend and awful, is it not yet more ſo when the <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf is come, and has ſpoken to us? And are not his laſt will and words, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, memorable indeed and ſacred? When God told <hi>Moſes</hi> of a <hi>Prophet like to him,</hi> but greater, whom he <hi>would raiſe up</hi> to his people, and <hi>put his word in his mouth;</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded — <hi>And whoſoever will not hearken to my words which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of him.</hi> Now make the application in <hi>this</hi> particular inſtance. The <hi>great Prophet</hi> of the church has come and ſpoken to us in the name of God, and one of his laſt words was this, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> and if we do <hi>not hearken to theſe words</hi> which He has ſpoken to us, God ſays <hi>he will require it:</hi> and when he requires an account of us, why we did it not, what ſhall we <hi>anſwer?</hi> we muſt be <hi>ſpeechleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEAR what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays on this head thro' his epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews: Therefore</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Heb. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip: For if the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward; how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002854_0014_0FE678A8360D8258"/>which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard it. Wherefore holy brethren,</hi>

               <hi>partakers of the heavenly calling, conſider the Apoſtle and high prieſt of our profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus, who was faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo Moſes was faithful in all his houſe. For this Man was counted worthy of more glory than Moſe,—who verily was faithful as a ſervant, — but Chriſt as a Son over his own houſe: — wherefore as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To day if you will hear his voice. Let us therefore fear</hi>

               <hi>brethren, boldneſs to enter in-the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way which he has conſecrated for us thro' the vail, that is to ſay his fleſh; and having an high prieſt over the houſe of God; let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed as with pure water. Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering, — not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together as the manner of ſome is; — for if we ſin wilfully after we have received the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002854_0015_0FE678A8841CFE68"/>knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins. He that deſpiſed Moſes law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without mercy; of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God —? See then that ye refuſe not Him that ſpeaketh,</hi>
               <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Heb. 12.25, 26 &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi> But as we <hi>receive a kingdom which cannot be moved</hi> (the goſpel-diſpenſation which is to remain for ever) <hi>let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a conſuming fire. Let us go forth unto Him, which ſuffered without the gate,</hi>

               <hi>bearing his reproach: by Him let us offer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe unto God continually, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the <hi>strain</hi> of that excellent <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> It calls upon the <hi>Chriſtian church</hi> to be as obſervant of the Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ever were of the law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> It ſhows that our obligations riſe higher than theirs, and that it will be worſe in us and for us to be inobſervant than it ever was in them, or will be for them in the day of judgment.</p>
            <p>I will only add <hi>two</hi> more reflections here,
<list>
                  <item>1. THAT we be <hi>caution'd</hi> not to reſt our ſelves in the meer <hi>outward</hi> obſervation of God's ordinances, as the <hi>Jews</hi> generally did: and as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002854_0016_0FE678B0A4505F18"/>the generality of chriſtians do thro' <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> at this day: But let us remember that as he <hi>was not a Jew that was one outwardy in the fleſh,</hi> ſo he only is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that is one <hi>inwardly,</hi> and baptiſm is <hi>that of the heart, in the ſpirit and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God,</hi> Rom. 2.29. And again, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſame <hi>Apostle</hi>'s words, Phil. 3 3. <hi>We are the circumciſion that worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. REMEMBER that inſtead of doing <hi>leſs</hi> than what the law of God requires of us in outward obſervations, we ſhould rather do <hi>more.</hi> I mean not by <hi>inventions</hi> of our own, or in way of <hi>addition</hi> to the commandments of God; but in the devour <hi>obſervation</hi> of thoſe which God has appointed. As in the <hi>text;</hi> altho' <hi>Mary</hi> was not obliged by the law to go up yearly to the paſſover with her husband; yet the law permitting her to go ſhe gladly went, as <hi>Hannah</hi> and other holy women were wont to do before her.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus the <hi>firſt Christians</hi> having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> about his <hi>Supper</hi> (the <hi>breaking of bread</hi> in remembrance of <hi>his broken body</hi>) they not only <hi>ſtedfaſtly continued</hi> in this doctrine and fellowſhip of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but they did it <hi>daily, from houſe to houſe,</hi> with a ſingle and joyful heart, Acts 2.42, 46. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they came together it ſeems to have been to break bread; the <hi>Lord's day</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lord's ſupper</hi> met together: <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>Upon the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002854_0017_0FE67889B7F9E908"/>firſt day of the week, when the diſciples came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to break bread, Paul preached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD has not tied us up to ſo many preciſe times, juſt how often to pray, and hear and communicate: We ſhould be ſure then rather to go beyond the law, than to come ſhort of its injunctions, in the diſcharging of theſe duties. And if ſo, then when the goſpel ſays, As <hi>often</hi> as ye eat this bread, (which ſuppoſes we do it often) what will they ſay to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who have never <hi>once</hi> done it?</p>
            <p>BUT this for the <hi>ſecond Note,</hi> That the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> were conſtant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in the ſtrict obſervation of the <hi>paſſover: Every year they went up at the feast,</hi> and took care to do every thing <hi>after the cuſtom of the feaſt.</hi> The next <hi>Note</hi> that I would offer is this,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>THAT parents ſhould go before their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the obſervation of the holy Institutions of God in his worſhip.</hi> So did the gracious <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> in the text; and if they had had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of children and ſervants to have learn'd of them, their landable example would have well inſtituted them in the obſervation of the paſſover. And truly ſo ought <hi>Chriſtian parents</hi> to lead their houſhoulds to the <hi>table of Chriſt,</hi> and in the reverend ſanctification of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and a religious obſervation of all the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of God's houſe.</p>
            <p>THE word of God requires parents <hi>diligently to teach their children</hi> the will and ways of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002854_0018_0FE678B0C966D858"/>God, as well as to have the ſame always in <hi>their own hearts,</hi> Deut. 6.6, 7. And when the <hi>paſſover</hi> was firſt appointed to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it was accompanied with this precept to them, Exod. 13.8, 14. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſon in that day, ſaying, This is done becauſe of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt: And it ſhall be for a ſign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy eyes; that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth; for with a ſtrong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHILDREN naturally enquire and learn of their parents; but more of their examples as they grow up than they do of their precepts. If then it be the duty of parents to teach by words, it is more their duty to teach by their practice and good example. If they ſhould take pains to inſtruct them in the reaſons of God's laws, and in the meaning of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and require them to obſerve the ſame, much more ſhould they teach and lead 'em by their own example. For with what face or with what efficacy can a parent tell his ſon, that Chriſt has required ſuch a duty and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and as he grows up he muſt be ſure to obſerve it; and yet let his child ſee that he lives in the neglect of that duty himſelf. It is incumbent therefore on parents, that they teach and lead their children in the worſhip of God by their own example; that they go before them in the reverend obſervation of his holy inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002854_0019_0FE678B20CCE5200"/>
SO did <hi>Abraham:</hi> He firſt circumciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then his ſon, and his houſhold: And this is the honour done him by God; <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>I know Abraham that he will command his children and houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> He could command them with authority &amp; efficacy when he firſt obeyed himſelf: his words had not elſe come with power and been receiv'd with reverence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DAVID</hi> could with authority inſtruct his ſon in the ordinances of God, becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſo great a lover of them, ſo devout an obſerver of them. His being a <hi>King</hi> did not give ſo much power to his words as his being a Saint. Prov. 4.3. <hi>I was my fathers ſon, tender and only beloved in the ſight of my mother; he taught me alſo and ſaid unto me, Let thine heart retain my words, keep my commandments and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SO the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> taught the <hi>Churches</hi> effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Phil. 4.9. <hi>Thoſe things which ye have both learned and received, and heard and ſeen in me do: and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SO <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught his family, and all that are <hi>his</hi> ought ſo to teach theirs. John 13.15. <hi>I have given you an example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREFORE let parents firſt take <hi>heed</hi> to themſelves, and then take <hi>care</hi> of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For if they require their children to reverence the Inſtitutions of God and do not obſerve the ſame themſelves, perhaps their children will ſoon loſe all reverence both to God and them. Or if parents ſay nothing to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002854_0020_0FE678B2309ADF00"/>their children about the matter, as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will not, then the honour their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do naturally bear <hi>them</hi> will tempt them to make light of the diſhonour done to <hi>God</hi> in the neglect of his ordinances.</p>
            <p>LET thoſe parents conſider this who live in the neglect of the <hi>Lord's ſupper</hi> in the ſight of their children. Think you, that they do not obſerve and mind it? Yes, and will be ready to take any licence which your example gives them. It ought therefore to be a tender argument with parents to be religious for the ſake of their <hi>children:</hi> for next to their own <hi>Souls</hi> are theſe. But if men will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on for the ſake of their <hi>own</hi> ſouls, how ſhould they by being pleaded with for the children of their bowels? It is to be fear'd that parents who do not come to the <hi>Lord's table,</hi> do not ſpeak at all to their children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout preparing for it: or if they do it can be with little force.</p>
            <p>BUT the injury is greater to <hi>God,</hi> who gives us our children with this charge, to bring them up for <hi>Him;</hi> and intruſts us with them as ſo many living ſouls which are more <hi>His</hi> than ours. And if we fondly love their little bodies, but are negligent of their precious ſouls, as it is a brutal and irreligious thing in us, ſo he will require it of us; as he did of his people of old: Ezek. 16.20. <hi>Thou haſt taken thy ſons and thy daughters, whom thou hast born unto Me, and thoſe haſt thou ſacrificed to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002854_0021_0FE678B7EE4E6A78"/>thine idols, to be devoured: thou hast ſlain my children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE moſt unnatural wrong we can do to our children is to neglect and hurt their <hi>ſouls:</hi> And this is one of the greateſt wrongs we can do to God, who challenges a ſpecial property in our children; and therefore he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us that as ſoon as they are born we do give them up to him, and bind our ſelves to educate them for him. O the pitileſs as well as profane hearts of thoſe parents that neglect their own and their childrens ſouls! they in effect ſacrifice 'em to devils after they have devoted them to God! they rob God of his children, and rob them of their title to God and his covenant bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Finally, WHAT an <hi>unnatural precept</hi> and direction muſt be given to the children of ſuch parents, who live in the open neglect of the ordinances of Chriſt? How hard is it to be forc'd to ſay to your children, — and yet we muſt ſay it — <hi>Do not learn of your parents in this thing!</hi> do not imitate 'em; they do wrong, very wrong, and you muſt not follow them. This would be <hi>harſh</hi> kind of doctrine, and muſt needs ſound ſo in the ears both of parents and children. Yet if parents will live in the neglect of the Lord's ordinances, we muſt ſpeak thus to their children. "Do not think to excuſe your ſelves by your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents example, how much ſo ever you love and honour them: It will not do in the day of Chriſt: <hi>the ſoul that ſins ſhall die; the ſoul
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002854_0022_0FE678B814FBA4A0"/>of the father and the ſoul of the ſon:</hi> Ezek. 18.4. You muſt mourn for your parents in the caſe ſuppoſed and pray for them; and you may reverently ask of them the cauſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their neglect, and beſeech them to lead you to all the ordinances of Chriſt; but if you prevail not on them be not diſcouraged your ſelf, and reſtrained from doing your duty.</p>
            <p>BUT this for the third <hi>Note:</hi> Parents ſhould go before their children in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the inſtitutions of Divine worſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>CHILDREN ought to be early in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and preparing for the Table of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is taught us by our <hi>Lord's example</hi> in the text: the <hi>Child Jeſus</hi> when he was <hi>twelve</hi> years old, went up with <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> to the feaſt of the paſſover. And we read that <hi>he tarried behind in Jeruſalem,</hi> and when they found him it was <hi>in the Temple,</hi> and when they reaſoned with him upon his ſtaying there his anſwer was, <hi>Waſt ye not that I must be about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CERTAINLY the holy Child <hi>Jeſus</hi> is here exhibited as an example to children and young people; to teach and require them to give God an early poſſeſſion of their ſouls, and in their youth to keep cloſe to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice. "Eſpecially ſuch children as are forward in other things, ſhould be put forward in religion". It is the pleaſure of Chriſt and much for his honour, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be betimes in the temple, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002854_0023_0FE678BA2E308238"/>that young people ſhould be at his table.</p>
            <p>IN the 22. <hi>verſe</hi> of the <hi>chapter</hi> we read how the parents of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> brought him in his early infancy to preſent him in the temple, and to offer as the law required: And now in the <hi>text</hi> we find him coming in his early youth to the temple, to dedicate himſelf to the Lord in his appointed way. So thoſe of our children that are in their infancy dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God in baptiſm, ſhould be call'd upon as they grow up to come to the <hi>Goſpel paſſover,</hi> the Lord's ſupper, and joyn themſelves to the Lord and his Church by their own act and deed. But let them take care to do it with knowledge and ſeriouſneſs.</p>
            <p>SOME children may much ſooner be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the table of Chriſt than others. Do thou <hi>child</hi> deſire to be among the firſt; the moſt ripe, the moſt ready. Therefore learn diligently, and ſeek to God earneſtly: get forward in Chriſt's School: be not the leaſt and laſt there: enter thy ſelf betimes, and learn now in thy learning age.</p>
            <p>A great part of the duty of baptiſed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is to look forward to the Lord's table, and to keep their eye upon it; ſaying often to themſelves, "I have been given up to Chriſt in baptiſm, and I muſt be preparing to give my ſelf up to him at his table.</p>
            <p>AND a great part of the duty of parents lies in <hi>this,</hi> to inſtill this conſideration into the tender hearts of their children, &amp; ſo bring
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002854_0024_0FE678BA551CC900"/>them on to the recognition of their covenant engagements at the table of Chriſt. But not to do it lightly, curſorily &amp; as a thing of form; but intelli ently, deliberately &amp; awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: as <hi>David</hi> taught &amp; charg'd his ſon, 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>And thou Solomon my ſon, know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart &amp; with a willing mind; for the Lord ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the thoughts: if thou ſeek him he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a point of great care, and calls for much concern and labour; and moſt parents are great ſtrangers to this religious watch over their children: It is evident by their not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to the table of Chriſt, and by the neglect of their houſholds: and yet they know this to be the leaſt they owe unto Chriſt, to their own ſouls, and to the ſouls of their family.</p>
            <p>BUT if this be the duty of <hi>parents,</hi> then <hi>children</hi> owe it as much unto Chriſt, unto their parents and to their own ſouls, to learn God's will betimes, to get knowledge &amp; underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the holy ways of God, and to live unto Him who made them, who alſo has bought and bound them to be his. And you, <hi>children,</hi> that are conſecrated to God in <hi>baptiſm,</hi> who are inſtructed in the word and law of God, and your obligations to him, by parents &amp; miniſters; be you exhorted and warned to be <hi>early</hi> in your choice of God and of his ways.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:002854_0025_0FE678BF9A7047B0"/>
AND now to cloſe all, <hi>Let parents and grown children be together exhorted, to be ſound together at the Lord's table.</hi> What is there more <hi>ſit,</hi> and what could be more <hi>pleaſant</hi> than this? <hi>Parents,</hi> go your ſelves to the Lord's paſſover, as the parents of Chriſt did: And <hi>children</hi> come with your parents: or if they neglect themſelves come you before them; don't ſtay for 'em. Or if they do not put you upon this duty as they ſhould, remember that your Miniſters put you in mind of it, and that you are now admoniſhed thereof.</p>
            <p>MAY the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> teach and incline you by his <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> May you be ſuch as he was in his childhood and youth; ſuch to God, ſuch to your parents, and ſuch to his church. That if you die young you may like <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> be taken up to God: or if you live in the world you may be examples to others, fruitful Chriſtians, full of goodneſs, full of good works, to the honour of Chriſt, and the edification of others: Like good <hi>Obadiah,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord from your youth; and like gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Timothy,</hi> betimes knowing in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and wiſe to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>I will urge what has been ſaid both to elder and younger perſons, only with one <hi>motive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>WE are all dying and going to judgment, we know not which firſt, whether the parent or the child.</hi> The <hi>graves</hi> are ready for us, and are not we ready, ſhould we not be ready for the <hi>table of Chriſt?</hi> We are dropping into the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002854_0026_0FE678BFC00F9060"/>grave every week, ſome elder people and many younger; and ſhould we not be quickned to be getting into Chriſt, that we may be found in him, let death come as ſoon and as <hi>ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to us, as it has done to others.</p>
            <p>PARENTS and children are both dying, and are alike concerned to be getting ready for a dying hour; let them take the <hi>table of Chriſt</hi> in their way, there to ſet their ſouls <hi>in order</hi> for their going to him, and for their being <hi>found of their Judge in peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LOOK into the <hi>Congregation of the dead</hi> and ſee how they ly <hi>mixt,</hi> here a parent and there his children; here an aged perſon, and there divers in their youth, and more in their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: read the inſcriptions on the grave-ſtones and ſee how many under twenty and thirty to one above fifty or ſixty ly interr'd there; their ſpirits gone to God that gave them, and into a moſt bleſſed or miſerable Eternity. And ſhall it not be thus in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the living</hi> and at the Lord's <hi>table?</hi> which has ſo particular an aſpect on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance of Chriſt, and on our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a ſolemn appearance before Him, to give an account to him, and to hear our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from the mouth of the <hi>Lamb?</hi> Are not the <hi>funerals</hi> of every week, month and year ſo mixt? parents following their children to the grave, <hi>the houſe appointed for all the living,</hi> and children following their parents? and while they live together in this dying world, ſhall they not <hi>come together into one place to eat the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002854_0027_0FE6459D3743C038"/>Lord's Supper?</hi> How ſtrangely then muſt we ſuppoſe that they <hi>both</hi> forget that they are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, they know not which <hi>firſt,</hi> and that <hi>after death is the judgment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET parents and children both conſider, that their <hi>ſouls</hi> are alike precious, &amp; <hi>eternity</hi> is before them: that <hi>all ſouls are</hi> Chriſt's, <hi>the ſoul of the Father and the ſoul of the ſon:</hi> that Chriſt has given his <hi>life</hi> a ranſom for both, has ſhed his <hi>blood</hi> for both, and has extended his <hi>covenant</hi> unto both; commanding his miniſters to <hi>feed</hi> both, <hi>his ſheep and his lambs;</hi> that in the ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> they ſhould labour to <hi>turn the hearts of fathers and children</hi> together to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>to make ready a people prepared for the Lord; leſt he come and ſmite the earth with a curſe.</hi> See Mal. 4.6. and Luk. 1.17.</p>
            <p>I ſcruple not to ſay, that in the laſt &amp; moſt dreadful ſenſe <hi>Death</hi> is that curſe, which <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the earth;</hi> the <hi>bodies</hi> of all, old &amp; young; and the <hi>ſouls</hi> of all that will not be a people made ready for the Lord: for his glory ſervice and worſhip here, and for his table kingdom and glory for ever.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Parent!</hi> look on thy ſelf and thine as <hi>mortal,</hi> and going to an eternal judgment, and ſo govern thy ſelf toward them. You are your ſelf haſtning to the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of Chriſt; but have you taken care of a never dying <hi>ſoul</hi> for which Chriſt has died? And what care of the precious ſouls of an immortal <hi>offſpring?</hi> You expect to die before your children, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſire to leave them behind you; or to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002854_0028_0FE6788FC1252EB0"/>be ſure you muſt ſoon follow 'em to the <hi>bar</hi> of God: But what account do you think of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to God of them?</p>
            <p>WILL not the two firſt enquiries put to thee by God the Father of Spirits be <hi>theſe,</hi> What care thou haſt taken of thy <hi>own</hi> ſoul, and what of the ſouls of the <hi>children</hi> which he has given thee? how then can you think of dying your ſelves, or of your childrens dying, without being able to give an account with joy and not with grief?</p>
            <p>AND you know not whether God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>you</hi> another week or day to yours, or <hi>them</hi> to you; what therefore <hi>your hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might,</hi> for there is no wiſdom or working in the grave whither thou art going. It may be you are <hi>cumbring</hi> your ſelves about many things for yours that are to live after you, but <hi>one thing is needful,</hi> your own ſoul and theirs: chuſe the <hi>good part</hi> that can never be taken from you, nor you from that. Remember the care of the good <hi>mother</hi> for her <hi>two</hi> ſons: Mat. 20.21. and dropping the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, let us improve her piety and imitate her wiſdom: <hi>Lord, that my two ſons may ſit, the one on thy right hand and the other on thy left in thy kingdom.</hi> Had ſhe liv'd in our days her deſire and care would have been to have ſeen them both, with her, at the <hi>Table</hi> of Chriſt, in the way to his <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND what ſhould our <hi>Children</hi> now ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, or unto us, upon the preſent diſcourſe? Should they not take up the <hi>anſwer</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:002854_0029_0FE6459AF648B698"/>of our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> (in our context) to his <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> when they had ſought him ſorrowing, and at laſt found him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> among the <hi>Doctors, Wiſt you not that I ſhould be about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> Yes, you ſhould be early about the great buſineſs of your ſouls, <hi>the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out your ſalvation, the making your calling and election ſure.</hi> And therefore you muſt be early in the <hi>temple</hi> of God, waiting daily at <hi>wiſdoms' gates,</hi> and coming to the <hi>ſpecial</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the goſpel. And the <hi>younger</hi> you come, if it be intelligently and affectionately, with underſtanding and grace, in the fear of God and from love to him; you will be the more <hi>welcome</hi> and the more <hi>beloved</hi> of Chriſt: like <hi>Iohn</hi> the youngeſt diſciple, and <hi>him whom Ieſus loved,</hi> who leaned on his <hi>boſome</hi> at his laſt paſſover ſupper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi> That both parents and children may happily meet at the <hi>Table</hi> of Chriſt here, and in his <hi>Kingdom</hi> hereafter: That in the day of Chriſt, <hi>we</hi> may be able to ſay to Him, and <hi>He</hi> may ſay of us and ours unto his Father, <hi>Behold I and the children which thou haſt given me.</hi>
