            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WE are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations, by all the means in our power to protect and defend their veſſels and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the ſeas near our ſhores, and to recover and reſtore the ſame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are uſed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with thoſe nations to make compenſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:031414_0042_0FEC51AE190E71A8"/>THOUGH we have no ſimilar treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of the Preſident, that we ſhould uſe towards that nation the ſame rule, which under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high ſeas, and brought into our ports, if done by veſſels which had been armed within them.</p>
               <p>HAVING, for particular reaſons, forbore to uſe all the means in our power for the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the three veſſels mentioned in my letter of Auguſt 7th, the Preſident thought it incumbent on the United States to make compenſation for them: And though nothing was ſaid in that letter of other veſſels taken under like circumſtances, and brought in after the 5th of June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the ſame forbearance had taken place, it was and is his opinion, that compenſation would be equally due.</p>
               <p>AS to prizes made under the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the Preſident determined, that all the means in our power ſhould be uſed for their reſtitution. If theſe fail, as we ſhould not be bound by our treaties to make compenſation to the other powers in the analogous caſe, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But ſtill if any caſes ſhall ariſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to that date, the circumſtances of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031414_0043_0FEC51B24D89DDB8"/>
which ſhall place them on ſimilar ground with thoſe before it, the Preſident would think compenſation equally incumbent on the United States.</p>
               <p>Inſtructions are given to the governors of the different ſtates, to uſe all the means in their power for reſtoring prizes of this laſt deſcription found within their ports. Though they will of courſe take meaſures to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of them, and the general government has given them the aid of the cuſtom-houſe officers for this purpoſe, yet you will be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as ſhall depend on yourſelf, or any perſon under your direction, in order that the governors may uſe the means in their power for making reſtitution.</p>
               <p>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot reſtore it. It will always be beſt to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you ſhall be pleaſed to ſend to me alſo at any time ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to them as quickly as diſtance will permit.</p>
               <p>Hence you will perceive, Sir, that the Preſident contemplates reſtitution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in the caſe before the 7th of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſt; and after that date, reſtitution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you ſhould ſubſtantiate the fact, that ſuch prizes are in our ports or waters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:031414_0044_0FEC51BB1A273C78"/>Your liſt of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to loſſes by detention, waſte, ſpoliation ſuſtained by veſſels taken as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and Auguſt 7th, it is propoſed as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſional meaſure, that the collector of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the diſtrict, and the Britiſh conſul, or any other perſon you pleaſe, ſhall appoint perſons to eſtabliſh the value of the veſſel and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which ſhe is brought, according to their value in that port. If this ſhall be agreeable to you, and, you will be pleaſed to ſignify it to me, with the names of the prizes underſtood to be of this deſcription, inſtructions will be given accordingly, to the collector of the cuſtoms where the reſpective veſſels are.</p>
