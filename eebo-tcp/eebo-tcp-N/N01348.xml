            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OF FAITH.</head>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>WHAT is Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a work of God's Almighty Quickning Power, wrought by the Miniſtry of the Word and Spirit of God, whereby the Heart is weaned from all Confidence in the Fleſh, and believeth in God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Whether doth Faith or Repentance go before, in the Work of Converſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You may diſcern in the Counſel <hi>Peter</hi> gives, and works upon thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Peter</hi> calls them to Repentance. Is that the firſt work? It is the firſt, after they were pricked in heart; but that they were pricked in heart, doth preſuppoſe that they did believe, that it was Jeſus whom they had Crucified, &amp; ſo <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. they ſaw it was Chriſt whom they had thus abuſed, and mourned for him, and it was not a meer legal mourning, for then they would not have come to the Apoſtle to know what to do, there is ſo much Faith as to ſee their own Wickedneſs againſt Chriſt, and which is more, here is an act of Reverence, <hi>Men and Brethren;</hi> their ſcoffing ſpirits are made low, to come to him,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001604_0003_0FB3E5ACF7F63F88"/>
that wounds them: which is an act of Faith. There is a threefold act of Faith, and ſo a threefold act of Repentance; firſt which is an aſſent by which a man knows the Will of God, and aſſents to it, this is the Will of God, but I have walked contrary to it, and this now pierceth the heart, and ſo is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which is an act of Repentance; but then there is another act of Faith, and that is adhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, cleaving to God, and from thence ſprings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother work of Repentance, to turn to him in humble Confeſſion, in humble Supplication, in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſires after Grace and Covenant: After this there ſprings another act of Faith, God Revealing his Covenant; then ſprings another act of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that we ſhould Sin againſt ſo good a God, and thereupon turns with all his heart to God, and labours to turn others? <hi>Come and ſee what God hath done for my Soul.</hi>

            <head>Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> his twelve Fundamental Articles of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The denial whereof after once or twice Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition <hi>[he conceives]</hi> makes a man an Heretick.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE firſt is touching the Perſons in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that there be Three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and all but One God, this is a known Principle of our Chriſtian Faith, and held forth in every Creed: and that it is of the Foundation, appears by this, 1 Joh. 2 23. <hi>Whoſoever denieth the Son, the ſame hath not the Father;</hi> therefore when a man upon pretence there is but one God, will have no more Perſons but One, and the Son he will not have to be as he is, God, this
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001604_0004_0FB3E5AE80BFF4A0"/>
man overthroweth the Foundation of Chriſtian Religion, as <hi>Arius</hi> did, and others after him; the Holy Ghoſt is joyned together with the reſt in our Baptiſm; <hi>I Baptiſe thee into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> this is a Profeſſion of part of our Chriſtianity, and a great part of it too, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is another Article, and Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Chriſtian Religion, that the Lord hath Made, and doth Govern all the World, and is a Rewarder of Good and Evil. That he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder with Bleſſing of that which is Good, and taketh Vengeance on every one that doth Evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him.</hi> Gen. 1.1. He muſt know this, he that comes to God muſt believe this, if he believe not this, there is no hope of Salvation for ſuch an one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is another Fundamental Article of our Chriſtian Faith? That this God alone is to be Worſhipped, with Religious Worſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> If a man Worſhip any other God, beſides the Lord, or if a man Worſhip any other God, the Lord will cut off them that Swear by the Lord, and that Swear by <hi>Malcham.</hi> If a man Worſhip Angels, he holds not the Head: <hi>Get thee behind me Satan</hi> in ſuch a Caſe. <hi>Avante.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This is the Fourth. That this Worſhip of God is to be offered to him according to his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word. I ſay, this Worſhip that is acceptable to him, is written in his Word; if any man ſhall worſhip God by the Precepts of men, it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>according to the Will of God: <hi>To the Law and to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001604_0005_0FB3E5B079021DC0"/>
the Teſtimony? If any man ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.16, 17. the whole Scripture (the written Word of God, is of Divine Inſpiration, <hi>and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof,</hi> &amp;c. The Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith and Manners, that is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Fifth Article is, That for our own part, we have not ſo Worſhipped God, from the Fall of our Firſt Parents. We and our Fathers before us, we have all Sinned, and were Born in Sin from our Mothers Womb. <hi>If any man ſay, he hath no Sin</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>there is no truth in him.</hi> We have not kept the Ordinances and Statutes of the Lord, and ſo have deceived our ſelves of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which the Lord hath promiſed to them that diligently ſeek him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 11, 23 And inſtead of being under a Reward of Bleſſing, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Sixth Article which a man muſt know; or he cannot be ſaved, (and if he hold againſt it, and know what he holds, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any true Grace in him) is, that we of our ſelves are utterly unable to reſcue our ſelves from this Miſery, by any ſtrength of our own; but we are utterly unable to help our ſelves; It's that which the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaks to, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help</hi> And as we have fallen in our Firſt Parents, ſo in falling, we are only fit to fall: Where is then our help? It is in God. We were Born not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the will of Man, but of God; not of Blood, that is, our Converſion to God, comes not by the Blood of our Anceſtors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor by the Will of the Fleſh,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001604_0006_0FB3E5B18A015EF0"/>
not the Will of Corrupt Nature; Nor by the Will of man, that is, of our moſt holy Parents, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or other Good men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Seventh Article is, That Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of the Eternal Father, in fulneſs of time took upon him our Nature, and became man, and hath Redeemed his Church (by his perfect Obedience to his Father) from Sin and Miſery: <hi>The Word that was from the Beginning was made fleſh, and we ſaw his glory, as the glory of the only Begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and truth,</hi> Joh. 1.14. This is a Foundation of Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that confeſſeth not Jeſus Chriſt come in the Fleſh, is not of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal 3.13.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Eighth Article is, This Salvation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt is freely given in the Goſpel, unto every Soul that believes in his Name; &amp; Faith is alſo freely given, that we may believe. I ſay, this Chriſt that works this Salvation and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is given only to ſuch as believe in his Name. <hi>For God ſo loved the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>And if you believe not in me,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have no life in you,</hi> no Salvation by me, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, you ſhall die in your Sins,</hi> and the Lord in giving you his Son, gives you Faith to believe in his Son, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. and both at the ſame inſtant, that if you have not Chriſt you have not Faith, and if you have not Faith, you have not Chriſt, Chriſt dwells in your heart by Faith; <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name,</hi> Joh. 1.12. No man can come to Jeſus Chriſt, that is, believe on him, except the Father draw him: No
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001604_0007_0FB3E5B2F28C3F20"/>
man can come, there is an impoſſibility of reaching him, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Lord put forth his Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Thoſe whom the Lord draws by his Word and Spirit to believe on Chriſt, them he Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies freely by his Grace in Chriſt: I ſay, thoſe whom the Lord draws to Chriſt by Faith, he juſtifies freely by his rich Grace in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24. This is a Foundation of our Chriſtian Faith alſo. <hi>By the deeds of the Law, ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his ſight:</hi> So then Chriſt is God and man, he is come, and hath Redeemed us, this Redemption is given to the Faith of his People, this Faith is wrought by the Word and Spirit of God, it is the power of God to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to them that believe. Where this Faith is, there is Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Where the Soul is Juſtified, it is alſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>For except ye be born a-new, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Except ye Repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luk. 13.5.</p>
            <p n="11">11. This Regeneration in us is imperfect, by reaſon we conſiſt partly of Fleſh, and partly of Spirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Therefore gifts of Grace to be given, and Sins to be mortified, it is a fundamental point of Religion. Therefore the Apoſtle crieth out of his own Miſery, that he was not able to wreſtle againſt his own Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="12">12. All men ſhall Riſe again at the Laſt Day, both ſuch as are Regenerated, and ſuch as are not Regenerate; and both ſhall be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their works, the Righteous to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation, the Wicked to Everlaſting Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001604_0008_0FB3E5B475E23080"/>
So then put all theſe things together, and you have all the neceſſary Points of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which whoſo obſtinately oppoſeth, or is ignorant of, he cannot be found in a State of Grace that Accompanies Salvation, this is the Summe of the Articles; and he that overthrows any one of theſe, and obſtinately perſiſteth therein, brings himſelf to Eternal Damnation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>If any man ask, Why we ſhould look at any Fundamental Articles of Chriſtian Religion, beſides them that are in the Creed of the twelve Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer, There be ſome things there that are not Fundamental Articles, and there are ſome Fundamental Articles that are left out; as that Chriſt deſcended into Hell, it is no Fundamental Article of Chriſtian Religion, though it be taken for his Deſcending into the Grave; nor do I think this Creed was made by the Apoſtles, much leſs that Article; and there are other Fundamental Articles which are not there, as the Word to be a Rule of Faith and Manners; little alſo is ſaid in the Creed of Juſtification or Regeneration.</p>

               <p>By Gifts and Grace, I mean Holy Qualities, the ſame which Philoſophers call Vertues, Habits, or good Diſpoſitions, whereby the faculties and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Soul, which by Corrupt Nature are ſet upon a mans ſelf and Earthly Things, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſavour the things of God (and ſo are ſaid to be dead) are hereby ſanctified and lifted up to God, and ſet upon him, and Heavenly Things; and ſo are ſaid to be <hi>quickned and made alive unto God;</hi> whence we are ſaid to be <hi>begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. And the Faith of the Righteous is oppoſed to the dead Faith of vain men. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.20. Theſe Gifts (we ſay) are wrought or created by the Holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the fruits or the effects of the Spirit of God in us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>Wrought by his Almighty Creating Power</hi> (out of nothing) Col. 2.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. and thereby making us <hi>Spiritual men,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.15. <hi>Living Stones,</hi> and fit inſtruments for Gods <hi>Spiritual Service,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. and therefore every one of thoſe gifts and graces whereby any faculty or affection of the Soul is ſanctified; it is called the Spirit of ſuch a faculty or affection, as the ſanctified diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, is called the Spirit of a <hi>Sound Mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. The ſpirit of faith is the gift of faith; the Spirit of Love, or of the fear of the Lord, are the Gifts of Holy Love and Fear, ſanctifying ſuch affections. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2.

neither the Holy Ghoſt himſelf (for then one Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſhould be added to another) or one part of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be added to another) nor are the actions of the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from us; for theſe things are in us, and abounding in us, and conſequently abiding in us, and they cauſe us to bring forth actions meet for Chriſtian profeſſion, for they are ſaid to make us <hi>fruitful in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> ver. 8.

The former Propoſition or Major is plain, becauſe the diſtinction is immediate, there is no middle way can be given, but either we muſt live a created life, by ſome gifts of ſpiritual grace created in us; or elſe we muſt live the uncreated life of the Holy Ghoſt communicated to us. The latter Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or Minor) is as plain; for no Creature (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finite) can live an increated life which is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
