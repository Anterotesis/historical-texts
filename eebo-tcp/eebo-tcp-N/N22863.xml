            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE object of the following work is, to give the people of this happy land a ſtriking and experimental proof of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effects of anarchy and infidelity.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of ſuch an undertaking, at this time, would have been, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, precluded, had our public prints been conducted with that impartiality and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted adherence to truth, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the community and of ſuffering humanity demanded from them. But, ſo far from this, the greateſt part of thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles of information have moſt induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed, or gloſſed over, the actions as well as the motives of the ruling powers in France; they have extenuated all their unheard-of acts of tyranny, on the falſe but ſpecious pretence, that they were conducive to the eſtabliſhment of a free government; and, one of the editors has not bluſhed to declare, that <q>It would be <hi>an eaſy matter to appologize for all the maſſacres,</hi> that have taken place in that country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſeen, indeed, ſome exceptions; ſome few prints that have not diſhonoured themſelves by going this length: but even theſe have obſerved a timid ſilence, and

If they have, now and then given way to a juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, this has been done in ſuch a manner, and has been ſo timid, as to do them but little honour.

They have, in ſhort, inveighed againſt the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the fallen aſſaſſins, while they have, in the ſame breath, applauded the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, on which they acted, and on which their ſurvivers and their partizans do ſtill act.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT will be recollected by the greateſt part of my readers, that, ſoon after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the French Revolution, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly conceived the plan of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the religion of their forefathers. In order to effect this they ſeparated the Gallican church from that of Rome, and impoſed an oath on the clergy, which they could not take, without becoming apoſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the fulleſt ſenſe of the word. All the worthy and conſcientious part of that body refuſed of courſe, and this refuſal was made
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030205_0013_0FE5117C7362C518"/>
a pretext to drive them from their livings, and fill the vacancies with ſuch as had more pliant conſciencies, principles better adapted to the impious ſyſtem, which the leaders in the Aſſembly had prepared for their too credulous countrymen.</p>
               <p>The ejectment of the prieſthood was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with numberleſs acts of moſt attroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wanton cruelty: theſe have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the <hi>Abbé Barruel,</hi> in a work en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>The Hiſtory of the French Clergy;</hi> and, though what is here to be found will dwindle into nothing, when compared to what I have extracted from other works, yet it could not be wholly omitted, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Soon after the firſt National Aſſembly had decreed, that the Comtat of Avignon belonged to the French nation, an army of aſſaſſins, of whom one Jourdan, ſur-named the Cut-throat, was the commander, took poſſeſſion of the unfortunate city of Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. The churches were immediately pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged, the ſacred vaſes profaned and carried off, and the altars levelled to the ground. The priſons were ſoon filled, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy victims were releaſed only to ſuffer death. A deep pit was dug to receive their dead bodies, ſix hundred of which were thrown into it, mangled and diſtorted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ten o'clock the next day. Among them was Mr. Nolhac, a prieſt, in the eighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year of his age. He had been thirty years rector of St. Symphorien, a pariſh which he prefered to all others, and which he could not be prevailed on to quit for a more lucrative one, becauſe he would not deſert the poor. During his rectorſhip he had been the common father of his pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners, the refuge of the indigent, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter of the afflicted, and the friend and counſellor of every honeſt man.

His appearance and his ſalutation, were thoſe of a conſoling an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel: <q>I come, my children, to die with you: we ſhall ſoon appear in the preſence of that God whom we ſerve, and who will not deſert us in the hour of death.</q> He forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their drooping courage, adminiſtered the laſt conſolatory pledges of his love, and, the next day embraced and cheered each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual as he was called forth by the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.

It was at laſt diſcovered by the caſſock, and the crucifix which he

                  <p>After having ſpoken of the conduct of the magiſtrates and mob at Bourdeaux, the hiſtorian mentions the death of Mr. Langoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran and the Abbé Dupuis, thus:</p>
                  <p>At the entrance of the court-houſe, the Abbé Dupuis received a firſt wound; others ſoon levelled him to the ground. A young lad, of about fifteen or ſixteen, cut a hole in the cheek with a knife, to hold up the head by, while others were employed in haggling it from the body, which was ſtill in agonies. This operation not ſucceeding in ſuch a crowd, they took hold of the legs, and dragged the carcaſe about the ſtreets, and round the ramparts.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Langoiran had but juſt ſet his foot on the firſt ſtep of the ſtairs, when he was knocked down. His head was hacked off in an inſtant, and a ruffian held it up, crying aloud: <q>off with your hats! long live the nation</q> The bareheaded populace anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: "long live the nation" The head was then carried round the town in ſignal of a triumph, gained by a tumultuous populace and ten thouſand ſoldiers under arms, over a poor defenceleſs prieſt.</p>

                  <p>The 14th of July, ſo famous in the annals of the Revolution, was this year celebrated at Limoges, by the death of Mr. Chabrol. He was a moſt uſeful member of ſociety; diſtinguiſhed round his neighbourhood as a bone-ſetter; he was at once the ſurgeon and the paſtor of his pariſhioners; and among his murderers were ſome of thoſe who owed to him the uſe of their limbs. He was of a quick and impetuous temper, and indued with uncommon bodily ſtrength. His death certainly was not that of a chriſtian martyr; but it deſerves particular notice, as a ſtriking proof of the cowardly ferocity of the French populace.</p>
                  <p>He had taken ſhelter at a magiſtrates, and begged leave to elude the mob by going out of the houſe the back way; but the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate durſt not comply. He was forced to face his blood-thirſty purſuers. The indignant prieſt met them at the door; the attack in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly began. Without a ſingle weapon of defence, he had to encounter hundreds of the mob, armed with clubs, guns, ſabres, and knives; but, notwithſtanding the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inequality, he held them a long time at bay. Some he felled to the ground, others ran from him; he tore a bayonet out of his

                  <p>As ſoon as the unfortunate Louis XVI. had been transfered from his throne to a loathſome priſon, the National Aſſembly formed a plan for the total extirpation of the prieſts, and with them the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The miniſters of the altar were ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thrown into priſon, or tranſported, from every part of the country. At Paris about three hundred of them were ſhut up, in order to be maſſacred, and were actually put to death during the firſt and ſecond weeks of September, 1792.</p>

One received a ball, another a blow, and another a ſtab: ſo that, when arrived in the ſanctuary they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a ſcene, the moſt heart-piercing that eyes ever beheld. Some were dragged in wounded, others quite dead. Even here, though ſurrounded by a detachment of ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the blood-thirſty mob ruſhed in upon them, and murdered ſeveral at the very altar. The ſanctuary of a chriſtian church was, for the firſt time ſince the bleſſed Redeemer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among men, filled with a promiſcuous group of the living, the dying, and the dead. The marble pavement was covered with dirt and gore and mangled carcaſes, and the ſides of the altar ſplaſhed with blood and brains.</p>
                  <p>The ſoldiers had not been brought to ſave the lives of the prieſts: the commiſſary who headed them was to execute a plan of more deliberate murder. The ſurviving

prieſts were called out two at a time, and murdered in the preſence of the commiſſary, who took ther names down in a book, as he was anſwerable for their aſſaſſination. Of all that were found here, only four or five eſcaped.—The like undiſtinguiſhed carnage was exhibited at the other priſons.</p>
                  <p>Every one of theſe men might have ſaved his life by taking the proffered oath, yet not one of them condeſcended to do it. Let the infidel ſhow us, if he can, any thing like this in the annals of his impious ſect.</p>

                  <p>At the gate of the priſon of La Force, the aſſaſſins were placed in two rows: the two ruffians, called judges, who gave the ſignal of death, were placed at the gate; and as ſoon as the priſoner paſſed them, the aſſaſſins diſpatched him with their knives or ſabres, throwing the bodies in a heap at the end of the line. At the foot of this trophy of dead bodies, ſays the hiſtorian, we muſt now exhibit a ſcene of a different kind, in the murder of the princeſs of Lamballe. She had retired in ſafety to London; but her attachment to the royal family would not ſuffer her to remain in her aſſylum, while
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030205_0023_0FE511A3AB16D2A0"/>
they were expoſed. Her fidelity was a crime that the infidelity of her enemies could never forgive.</p>
                  <p>When this illuſtrious victim was brought forth, ſhe was aſked to ſwear an eternal hatred to the king, the queen, and to roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. <q>The oath, ſaid ſhe, is foreign to the ſentiments of my heart, and I will never take it.</q>—She was inſtantly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to the miniſters of death. Theſe ruffians pretend to careſs her, ſtroke her cheeks with their hands yet reeking with human blood, and thus conduct her along the line. Amidſt all theſe inſults her courage never deſerted her. When arrived at the heap of dead bodies, ſhe was ordered to kneel, and aſk pardon of the nation: "I have never injured the nation," ſhe replied, "nor will I aſk its pardon."— "Down," ſaid they, "and aſk pardon, if you wiſh to live." "No," ſaid ſhe, "I ſcorn to aſk pardon from aſſaſſins that call themſelves the nation: I will never bend my knee, or accept of a favour at ſuch hands."</p>
                  <p>Her ſoul was ſuperior to fear. <q>Kneel and aſk pardon</q> was heard from a thouſand voices, but in vain. Two of the aſſaſſins now ſeized her arms, and, pulling her from ſide to ſide, nearly diſlocated her ſhoulders. "Go on, ſcoundrels," ſaid the heroic prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030205_0024_0FE511A536076BC0"/>
"I will aſk no pardon."—In a rage to ſee themſelves thus overcome by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of a woman, they daſhed her down, and ruſhed in upon her with their knives and poignards. Her head ſoon appeared hoiſted upon a liberty pike, and her heart, after <hi>being bit</hi> by one of the ruffians, was put into a baſon. Both were carried in triumph through the ſtreets of Paris. At laſt, after having feaſted the eyes of the multitude, the bearers took them to the Temple, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a priſon, where one of the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries that guarded the king, called him to the window, that he might ſee it; but his companion, a little more humane prevented the unfortunate monarch from approaching. A fainting fit, from hearing of the event, fortunately ſaved the queen from the heart-rending ſight.</p>
                  <p>The body, ſtripped naked and the bowels hanging out, was expoſed to view on the top of the murdered victim, where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till the maſſacre was over.</p>

                  <p>When the Counteſs was dead, they brought ſix prieſts, and, cutting off ſome of the roaſted fleſh, preſented them each a piece to eat. They ſhut their eyes, and made no anſwer. The oldeſt of the prieſts was then ſtripped, and tied oppoſite the fire. The mob told the others, that perhaps they might prefer the reliſh of a prieſts' fleſh to that of a Counteſs; but they ſuddenly ruſhed into the flames. The barbarians tore them out to prolong their torments; not, however, before they were dead, and beyond the reach even of Pariſian cruelty.</p>

After the execution was over, the tribunal, ever as capricious as bloody, feigned remorſe, and were proceeding to condemn the father; but the National Convention, informed of the affair, annulled the proceſs, and publicly

                  <p>At Rheims lived a man, who, from the number of his years, might be called the dean of Chriſtendom; and, from the fame of his virtues, the prieſt, by excellence. He had long been known by no other name than that of the holy prieſt. This was Mr. Pacquot, rector of St. John's. When the revolutionary aſſaſſins broke into his orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they found him on his knees. A true and faithful diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, he yielded himſelf into the hands of his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners without ſo much as a murmur, and ſuffered himſelf to be led before the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

magiſtrate, as a lamb to the ſlaughter. He croſſed the ſtreet ſinging the pſalms of David, while the ſanguinary ruffians that conducted him, endeavoured to drown his voice by their blaſphemies. At the threſhold of the town-hall an attempt was made to murder him, but the mayor interfered, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people, <q>What are you about? This old fellow is beneath notice. He is a fool: fanaticiſm has turned his brain.</q>— Theſe words rouſed the venerable old man. <q>No, Sir, ſays he, I am neither a fool nor a fanatic, nor ſhall my life take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge under ſuch an ignominious ſhelter. I wiſh you to know, that I was never more in my ſober ſenſes. Theſe men have rendered me an oath, decreed by the National Aſſembly. I am well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of this oath: I know that it is impious, and ſubverſive of religion. They leave me the choice of the oath or death, and I chooſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I hope, Sir, I have convinced you, that I am in my ſenſes, and know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well what I am about.</q>—The nettled magiſtrate immediately abandoned him to the mob.

horde of ruffians. <q>Let me embrace you then,</q> ſays Mr. Pacquot; which he actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, and prayed to God to forgive him. This done, the hard-hearted villain gave him the firſt blow, and his companions bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their bayonets in his emaciated breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The reader's heart, I hope, will teach him the love and veneration, that every chriſtian ought to feel for the memory of this evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical old man.</p>
                  <p>If the death of all the murdered prieſts was not marked with ſuch unequivocal proofs of conſtancy and fidelity as that of Mr. Pacquot, it was, perhaps, becauſe a like opportunity did not always preſent itſelf. One thing we know; that, by taking an oath contrary to their faith, they might not only have eſcaped the knives of their aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, but might have enjoyed an annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Their refuſing to do this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible teſtimony, that they were no impoſtors or hypocrites, but ſincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of the religion they taught, and that they valued that religion more than life it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and, this is the beſt anſwer that can poſſibly be given to all the ſcandalous and atrocious calumnies that their enemies and the enemies of Chriſtianity have vomited forth againſt them.</p>

                  <p>The grand ſcene of deſtruction and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre was opened, in the once-flouriſhing and opulent city of Lyons, by a public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of all thoſe things, that had been looked upon as ſacred. The murderers in chief, choſen from among the members of the National Convention, were a play-actor and a man who, under the old government, had been a bum-bailiff. Their firſt ſtep was to brutify the minds of the populace; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the remaining ſparks of humanity and religion, by teaching them to ſet heaven and an hereafter at defiance; in order to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030205_0032_0FE511C0580BC6E8"/>
prepare them for the maſſacres, which they, were commiſſioned to execute.</p>
                  <p>A mock proceſſion was formed, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe obſerved by the catholic church. It was headed by a troop of men bearing in their hands the chalices and other vaſes which had been taken from the plundered churches, At the head of the proceſſion there was an Aſs, dreſſed in the veſtments of the prieſts that the revolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary army had murdered in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the city, with a mitre on his head. This beaſt, a beaſt of the ſame kind on which our Redeemer rode, now bore a load of crucifixes, and other ſymbols of the chriſtian religion; having the old and new teſtament tied to his tail. When this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion came to the ſpot which had been fixed on for the purpoſe, the bible was burnt, and the Aſs given to drink out of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cup, amidſts the ſhouts and rejoicing of the blaſphemous aſſiſtants.</p>
                  <p>Such a begining plainly foretold what was to follow. An undiſtinguiſhed butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all the rich immediately commenced. Hundreds of perſons, women as well as men, were taken out of the city at a time, tied to trees, ſhot to death, ſtabbed, or elſe knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the head. In the city the guillotine never ceaſed a moment; it was ſhifted three times; holes were dug at each place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030205_0033_0FE511C32FA18EC8"/>
the blood, and yet it ran in the gutters.</p>
                  <p>It were impoſſible to deſcribe this ſcene of carnage, or to give an account of each act of the, till now, unheard-of barbarity: two or three, however, demand a particular mention.</p>

                  <p>At Lyons the prieſts met with the ſame treatment as at other places, and honoured their deaths with the ſame unſhaken forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

to flow, and the affrighted inhabitants ventured out of their houſes, they were ſeen walking along the ſtreets with their eyes fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ground: men no longer ſtopped, ſhook hands, and gave each other good morrow. The fear of death was ſtamped on every face: children durſt not aſk after their parents, nor parents aſk after their children.</p>
                  <p>The villages round about ſhared in the fate of the city.

                  <p>What I am now going to relate, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of future generations will hear with affright.—A child of ten years of age had been ſcolded, perhaps whipped, by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               </argument>
               <p>THE work which we are now entering on was publiſhed at Paris during the laſt year; but, as an introduction to the facts
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030205_0042_0FE511E1A5FD24B8"/>
extracted from it, it will be neceſſary to give the reader a conciſe ſketch of the progreſs of the Revolution down to the epoch when the work was publiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Sates-General, conſiſting of the three orders, the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Tiers-Etat, or commonalty, were aſſembled on the 4th of May, 1789. The deputies were all furniſhed with written inſtructions in which they were poſitively enjoined to make no innovations as to the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Notwithſtanding this, it is well known, they framed a conſtitution by which the government was totally changed, the nobility aboliſhed, and the church rent from that of Rome. Their conſtitution, however, though eſtabliſhed at the expence of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of lives, and though one of the moſt ridiculous ſyſtems of government that ever was invented, did not fail to meet with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans; and we have heard it exotolled in this country as the maſter-piece of human wiſdom.</p>
               <p>This firſt Aſſembly, which has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Conſtituent Aſſembly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded its benificent labours on the 30th of September, 1791, and was immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by another, which took the name of the Legiſlative Aſſembly. Moſt men of ſenſe foreſaw that the ſecond Aſſembly would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove upon the plan of deſtruction marked
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030205_0043_0FE511EDFA362538"/>
out by the firſt. The Clergy and many men of family and fortune had been already driven from their homes and poſſeſſions, it remained for the Legiſlative Aſſembly to finiſh the work by ſeizing on their property and expoſing it to ſale: this they failed not to do. Perſecution and maſſacre increaſed daily; but as the ſmall remains of power left in the hands of the king was ſtill an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, or rather as the monarchy itſelf was an obſtacle, they were determined to get rid of it. On the 10th of Auguſt, 1792, the king was dethroned (his fate is well known) and the daggers of the aſſaſſins were from that moment drawn, never more to be ſheathed, but in the heart of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent victim. We have already ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the maſſacres which followed this event at Paris and other places; but even theſe are trifles to what was to follow.</p>
               <p>On the 21ſt of September, 1792, the third Aſſembly, generally called the National Convention, opened their ſeſſions, and, though every individual member had repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly taken an oath to maintain the authority of the king, they at once declared France to be a republic.</p>
               <p>After the murder of the king, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention declared war againſt a great part of the powers of Europe; and, in order to be in a ſituation to make head againſt their
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030205_0044_0FE511EF8AA82640"/>
enemies, ſeized on all the precious metals in the country, or rather they enacted ſuch laws as obliged the poor oppreſſed people to bring it to their treaſury, and receive in exchange a vile and worthleſs paper money. The churches were inſtantly pillaged, and no perſon dared appear with a watch, or any other article in gold or ſilver.</p>
               <p>The violation of property was only a part of their plan. The hearts of the lower or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people were to be hardened; they were to be rendered brutal; all fear of an hearafter was to be rooted from their ſouls, before they could be fit inſtruments in the hands of this helliſh Aſſembly. With this object in view, they declared our bleſſed Lord and redeemer to be an Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, forbade the acknowledgement of him, and the exerciſe of his worſhip. The chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were turned into priſons, ſtables, &amp;c. and over the gateways of the burial grounds were written: <q>This is the place of <hi>eternal ſleep.</hi>
                  </q> Never ſurely was there a better plan for transforming a civilized people into a hoard of cut-throats. It ſucceeded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly. The blood now flowed at Paris in an unceaſing ſtream. A permanent tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was eſtabliſhed, whoſe only buſineſs was to condemn, and certify to the Convention that the executions went on according to the liſts ſent from its committees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:030205_0045_0FE511F26473A270"/>Beſides legions of executioners there were others of aſſaſſins. The command of theſe latter was given to thoſe members of the Convention who were ſent into the different parts of the country. Terror preceded theſe harbingers of death, and their footſteps were marked with blood. The ſword, the fire, and the water, all became inſtruments of deſtruction.</p>
               <p>During this murdering time, which has juſtly aſſumed the name of the <hi>reign of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> the leaders of ſeveral factions of the revolutioniſts themſelves received their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on a ſcaffold, and, among others, Robeſpierre and his accomplices. When theſe men fell, the Convention, according to its uſual cuſtom, aſcribed all the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, committed during ſometime before their death, to them alone, and the people, always eager for blood, now demanded the heads of thoſe whom they had aſſiſted in the murder of their countrymen. By ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing theſe its inſtruments, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſaw a fair opportunity of removing the infamy from itſelf, and of perpetuating its power. In conſequence, many of them were tried and executed, and among others Carrier (a member of the Convention) who had been ſtationed at Nantz, with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the revolutionary committee of that unfortunate town. From the trial of theſe
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030205_0046_0FE511FBD89453F0"/>
men it is that I have ſelected the facts which are to compoſe this chapter. The trial was before the tribunal at Paris, to which place the accuſed were carried from Nantz.</p>
               <p>It has been repeatedly aſſerted, by thoſe who ſeem to have more attachment to the cauſe of the French than to that of truth, that the barbarities committed in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have been by the hands of foreigners. Such a ſtory is impoſſible, and even ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; but however, it has induced me to inſert here a liſt of the barbarous wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es who were ſo long the ſcourge of the city of Nants, from which it will appear, that they were all Frenchmen, born and bred. This is an act of juſtice due to other nations.</p>

               <p>Carrier was the great mover, the aſſaſſin-general; the committee were his agents. Some of them were always aſſembled in their hall, to give directions to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murderers, while the others took repoſe, or were diſpatched on important expedition, ſuch as the ſhooting or drowning of hundreds at a time. They ſtood in need, however, of ſubaltern cut-throats, more determined and bloody than the people in general; and therefore they raiſed a company, who took the title of the company of Marat, compoſed of the vileſt wretches that were to be found. Theſe being aſſembled together took the following oath before their employers.</p>

                     <hi>Tronjolly,</hi> a witneſs, informs the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that the Company of Marat was at firſt compoſed of ſixty perſons; that Goullin openly propoſed that none but the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous villains ſhould be admitted into it: and, at each nomination, cried out, <q>Is there no greater ſcoundrel to be found?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 24th of October, ſays the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I heard Goullin and his colleagues ſay, that they were going to give a great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that the priſoners ſhould be all ſhot. I atteſt that this ſcene was ſtill more horrible than that of the 22d and 23d of September. The Company of Marat were carouſing round a table, and at the ſame time it was deliberated whether the priſoners ſhould not be maſſacred by hundreds. In this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, Coullin was for indiſcriminate death: and thus were the priſoners, without ever being interrogated, or heard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die. There exiſted no proofs of guilt againſt theſe unfortunate priſoners; they were what were called <hi>ſuſpected perſons;</hi> the felons, and all <hi>real</hi> criminals were ſet at liberty.</p>
                  <p>Carrier, in quality of member of the Convention, had placed a vile wretch at Pain-boeuf, name Foucault, to whom he gave an abſolute power of life and death.</p>

                  <p>Old men, women with child, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were drowned, no diſtinction. They were put on board of lighters, which were railed round to keep the priſoners from jumping overboard if they ſhould happen to diſengage themſelves. There were plugs made in the bottom, or ſides, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pulled out, the lighter ſunk, and all in it were drowned. Theſe expeditions were firſt carried on by night, but the ſun ſoon beheld the murderous work.

The young men and women were picked out from among the maſs of ſufferers, ſtripped naked, and tied together, face to face. After being kept in this ſituation about an hour, they were put into an open lighter; and, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſeveral blows on the ſkull with the but of a muſket, thrown into the water.

In order to have a pretext for doing this, ſaid Goudet, we ſhall give out, that there exiſts a conſpiration againſt the republic. I am to make the general beat early in the morning. The ſans-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottes<note n="*" place="bottom">This degrading term, which is become the glory of modern patriots, literally means, <hi>men without breeches;</hi> but it was ever uſed by the French to deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vile, raſcally people, the dregs of ſociety; and as ſuch we ought now to underſtand it.</note>, informed beforehand, are to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade at their different poſts; the rich, and the timid, will, according to cuſtom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their houſes; to theſe houſes the ſans-culottes are to repair, pillage all they have, and convey them to priſon.</p>

them for common thieves, and <hi>therefore our alarm was not ſo great;</hi> but, to our ſorrow, we were ſoon convinced by the voice of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, that they were the patriots of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary committee. Our family was compoſed of women and one old man. There was myſelf; four ſiſters-in-law, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly nuns; two old relations above eighty years of age, and my huſband. The houſe and yard were ſtripped of every thing, and the ruffians were talking of ſetting fire to the buildings. One of my ſiſters had made ſhift to preſerve 800 livres; ſhe offered them theſe to ſave the houſe; they accept the conditions, receive the money, and then burn the houſe to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Our perſons were now all that remained to be diſpoſed of. There was a one-horſe chair; but which was too good for any of us; it was faſtened to the tail of a cart into which we were put (my huſband, an old and infirm man being obliged to walk in the rear) and thus were dragged, preceded by our plundered property, to that gang of cut-throats, called the revolutionary committee. Here our complaints were in a moment ſtiffled. Pinard ſaid, that his orders were to burn all, and kill all. The committee were aſtoniſhed and offended at his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and reprimanded him ſeverely for not having murdered us according to his orders.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030205_0057_0FE5126F73798168"/>I, my ſiſters, and our poor old relations were ſent to one priſon, and my huſband to another. My huſband died, and we are only left alive to weep and ſtarve.</p>
                  <p>It is well worth the readers while to hear what this Pinard ſaid in his defence, on this head.</p>

                  <p>We acted, ſays he, by the order of the Repreſentative of the People, Carrier. When I went, at my return, to carry him the church-plate that I had taken from the nuns, he would inſiſt upon my drinking out of the chalice (or ſacramental cup) and aſked me why I had not killed all the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bitches.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here obſerve, once for all, that theſe volumes contain a ſeries of robberies of this ſort. Sometimes the plunder was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among the plunderers, ſometimes it was delivered to Carrier, and at others it was depoſited with the revolutionary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. Theſe latter impoſed immenſe taxes, or rather contributions, on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

under pretence of aſſiſting the ſans-cullottes, but which were applied to their own uſes. It is juſt to obſerve alſo, that the tribunal at Paris, before which they were brought to anſwer for their crimes, appears to have ſnown much more anxiety about the gold and ſilver, than about the lives of the murdered perſons.</p>

                     <hi>Mariotte,</hi> a witneſs, informs the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal that he was detached on a party to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles diſtant from Nantz. The party, ſays the witneſs, went into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the foreſt of Rincé, and took up their quarters in a houſe occupied by Mrs. Chauvette. Five days after our arrival, came Pinard, about midnight, and told us that we were in the houſe of an ariſtocrat. He bragged of having that evening killed ſix women, and ſaid that Chauvette ſhould make the ſeventh. He threatened her, and, to add to her torment, told her to comfort herſelf, for that her child ſhould die firſt. It is Pinard, adds he, that now ſpeaks to you; Pinard, that carries on the war againſt the female ſex. I drew my ſword, continues the witneſs, and told Pinard that he ſhould
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030205_0059_0FE51277C48B9300"/>
paſs over my dead body to come at the woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commerais,</hi> who was another of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, informs the tribunal, that Pinard being thus ſtopped, Aubinet one of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſaid, ſtand aſide while I cut open the guts of that bitch. He did not ſucceed, however, adds this witneſs. Now Marieuil came up, and ſwore he would have her life; but finding us in his way, he ſaid, you look like a good b—ger enough; I have a word to ſay in your ear.—We only want, ſays he, to know where ſhe has hidden 60,000 livres belonging to a gentleman in the neighbourhood. I anſwered, give me your word not to hurt the woman nor her child, and I will bring her forth. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and I brought them out. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſeeing that ſhe was conducted to a ſort of cellar, cried out, I know I am brought here to be murdered, like the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whoſe throats were cut in this place yeſterday. All the favour I aſk, ſaid ſhe, is that you will kill me before you kill my child. She was now queſtioned about the money; but ſhe continued her proteſtations of knowing nothing of it. Pinard and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet prepared again to aſſaſſinate her; but they did not ſucceed for this time.</p>

                  <p>The ſame witneſs relates another adventure. When we were going hence, ſays he, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the foreſt of Rincé, we heard a man, in a little wood, crying for help. We found Pinard, and two other horſemen each hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a piece of linen under his arm. We left them, and ſoon after ſaw two poor pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants running away. In going along among the bruſhwood, ſays the witneſs, I heard ſomething ruſtle almoſt under my feet: I knocked the buſhes aſide with my muſket; what ſhould it be but two children. I gave one of them, who was ſeven years old, into the care of Cedré, and kept the other, of five years old, myſelf. They both cried bitterly. Their cries brought to us two women, their mothers, who were alſo hid among the buſhes; they threw themſelves upon their knees, and beſought us not to kill their children. In quitting the wood Pinard came up with us, he had ſeveral wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom I ſaw him chop down, and murder with his ſabre. What, ſays he to me, are you going to do with thoſe two children? ſtand away, ſays he, till I blow out their brains. I oppoſed him, and while we were in diſpute, two volunteers brought an old man, ſtone-blind. This we now
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030205_0061_0FE5127995EF5B40"/>
found was the grandfather of the children. Pray, ſaid the poor old man, take my life, and preſerve my little darlings. I told him that we would take care of them; he wept and ſqueezed my hand. This unfortunate old man, adds the witneſs, was murdered as well as the women.</p>
                  <p>Pinard quitted the high road in returning, for no other purpoſe but that of murdering. He and his companions killed all they came at, men women and children of all ages. To juſtify his barbarity, he produced the decree that ordered him to ſpare neither ſex nor age.</p>
                  <p>My reader will recollect, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Convention of France had aboliſhed <hi>negro-ſlavery;</hi> and he will alſo recollect, that the <hi>humanity</hi> of this meaſure has been much applauded by thoſe who have not penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to ſee their motive in ſo doing.</p>

As ſoon as the decree aboliſhing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro-ſlavery appeared, theſe people claimed their rights as citizens; and, having no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030205_0062_0FE5121BA5232FD8"/>
they were taken into the ſervice of the republic, and placed under the orders of the revolutionary committee. A party of theſe citizens were ſent to aſſiſt in the murders round the city, and we ſhall ſee that they were by no means wanting in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their employers.</p>

                  <p>Two days after, continues the witneſs, the <hi>Americans,</hi> ſatiated with their captives, left them.

                  <p>The revolutionary hoſpital, ſays the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was totally unprovided with every nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary. The jail-fever made terrible ravages in all the houſes of detention; ſeventy five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or thereabout, died daily in this hoſpital. There were nothing but rotten mattraſſes, on each of which more than fifty priſoners had breathed their laſt.</p>
                  <p>I went to Chaux, one of the committee, to aſk for relief for the unhappy wretches that remained here. We cannot do anything, ſaid Chaux; but, if you will, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the cauſe of <hi>humanity</hi> by a way that I will point out to you. That raſcal Phillippes has 200,000 livers in his clutches which we cannot come at.

thoſe who were eſteemed rich, men of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, virtue and humanity.</p>
                  <p>I accuſe this committee of having ordered, to my knowledge, the ſhooting or drowning of between four and five hundred children, the oldeſt of which were not more than fourteen years of age.</p>
                  <p>Minguet, one of the committee, had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me an order to chooſe two from among the children, whom I intended to ſave from death and bring up. I choſe one of eleven years old, and another fourteen. The next day I went to the priſon, called the <hi>Entrepot,</hi> with ſeveral of my friends, whom I had prevailed on to aſk for ſome of theſe children. When we came, we found the poor little creatures ſtood no longer in need of our interpoſition. They were all drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I atteſt, that I ſaw in this priſon, but the evening before, more than four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                  <p>Having received an order from the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commiſſioners to go to the <hi>Entrepot,</hi> to certify as to the pregnancy of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of women, I found, in the entering this horrible ſlaughter-houſe, a great quantity of dead bodies, thrown here and there. I ſaw ſeveral infants, ſome yet palpitating, and others drowned in tubs of human ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement. —I hurried along through this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

women: they had been accuſtomed to ſee none but their butchers. I encouraged them; ſpoke to them the language of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I found that thirty of them were with child; ſeveral of them ſeven or eight months. Some few days after I went again to ſee theſe unhappy creatures, whoſe ſituation rendered them objects of compaſſion and tenderneſs; but—(adds the witneſs with a faultering voice) ſhall I tell you, they had been moſt inhumanly murdered.</p>
                  <p>The further I advanced, continues the witneſs, the more was my heart appalled. There were eight hundred women and as many children confined in the <hi>Entrepot</hi> and in the <hi>Mariliere.</hi> There were neither beds, ſtraw, nor neceſſary veſſels. The priſoners were in want of every thing. Doctor Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin and myſelf ſaw five children expire in leſs than four minutes. They received no kind of nouriſhment.—We aſked the women in the neighbourhood, if they could not lend them ſome aſſiſtance.

                     <hi>Lacaille,</hi> keeper of another priſon, called the <hi>Bouffay,</hi> gives a circumſtantial account of one of the drownings.</p>
                  <p>The horrid night, ſays the witneſs, of the 23d of October, two ſoldiers of the Company of Marat came to the <hi>Bouffay,</hi> each with a bundle of cords. About nine o'clock they told me there were one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty five priſoners, whom they were to transfer to Belle—Iſle, to work at a fortreſs. About an hour after arrived thirty or forty more of theſe ſoldiers. An order from the committee was produced for the delivery of one hundred and fifty five of my priſoners. I obſerved to them, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the priſoners on the liſt were now at liberty, or in the hoſpitals.</p>
                  <p>They now ſet down to table, and after having ſupped, and drank heartily, they brought out their cords, and diverted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030205_0075_0FE51299E0749BE8"/>
a while in tying each other, as they intended to tie the priſoners. I then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to the rooms where the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were lodged. They inſtantly fall to work tying the poor trembling wretches two and two.</p>
                  <p>Grand-Maiſon now entered the court yard, and hollowed out to them to diſpatch. Goullin came ſtamping and ſwearing, becauſe the number on the liſt could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. There were ſo many ſick and dead that they could not well be made up. I ſent you fifteen this evening, ſays Goullin, what have you done with them? I told him they were up-ſtairs. Down with them, ſays he. I obeyed, and they were tied, like the reſt. Inſtead of one hundred and fifty five, Goullin at laſt conſented to take one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty nine; but this number not being complete, the equitable and tender-hearted Goullin orders the remainder to be taken from the priſoners indiſtinctly; and when this was done he marches off at the head of the aſſaſſins to conduct them to the river, where they were all drowned.</p>

                  <p>I complained, ſays this poor woman, to Perrocheaux of a violent ſore throat. That is good, ſaid he, the guillotine will cure you of that.</p>

                  <p>In the houſe where we were confined, there were a great number of beautiful pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                  <p>We were in want of every neceſſary. Seven hundred of us were confined in this houſe, which, even as a priſon was too ſmall for two hundred. Forty were crammed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one little chamber. During ſix or ſeven months we had no infirmary, or rather each appartment was one. The ſick and dead were often extended on the floor among the living. How many have I ſeen ſtruggling in the pangs of death by my ſide.</p>

                  <p>My old ſervant went to ſollicit for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, repreſenting me as dangerouſly ill. Perrocheaux ſaid to her: let her die, you ſilly bitch, and then we ſhall have her houſe, and you will fare better with us than with her.</p>

buſy conſtructing the lighters for drowning the priſoners; and ſoon after, ſays the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſaw, brought to be drowned at the Crepuſcule, a great number of women, many of whom had ſucking children in their arms. They ſcreamed and cried moſt piteouſly. Oh! ſaid they, muſt we be put to death without being heard!</p>
                  <p>Several poor women of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ran and took a child a piece, and ſome two, from them.

                  <p>Many of theſe women were far advanced with child. All were taken into the boats; a part were immediately diſpatched, and the reſt put on board the Dutch ſloop, till the next day.</p>

They were faſtened under hatches, where they were left for forty eight hours. When the hatches were opened, they were ſixty of them ſtiffled. Other priſoners that were now on board were obliged to take out the bodies. Robin ſtood on the deck with his drawn ſword in his hand, and ſuperintended the work. This done, all the priſoners on board were ſtripped naked, men, women and children of all ages from fourſcore to five; their hands were tied behind them, and they were thrown into the river.</p>
                  <p>Here the judge, if we ought to call a ſans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culotte ruffian a judge, aſked the witneſs if this drowning was performed by day, or by night. By open day, anſwers the witneſs. She adds, I obſerved that the drowners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very familiar with the prettieſt of the women; and ſome few of them were ſaved, if it can be called ſaving, to endure the more than infernal embraces of theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>

                     <hi>Bourdin,</hi> a witneſs, gives an account of ſeveral ſhootings. The laſt that I ſaw, adds he, was of eighty women. They were firſt ſhot, then ſtripped, and left expoſed on the ſpot during three days.</p>
                  <p>I carried a young lad off from the <hi>Entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot.</hi> He was thirteen years of age. When the revolutionary committee ordered all the children, thus preſerved to be given up, Jolly, who ſaid he was the judge of all the priſoners, permitted me to keep this boy; but my neighbour Aignes, who could not obtain a like favour, gave up a lad of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, agreeable to the order of the committee, and the next day we ſaw him ſhot.</p>
                  <p>When the ſhooting <hi>en maſſe</hi> firſt began the priſoners were ſuffered to retain their cloths till they were dead. As they were
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030205_0097_0FE512C0B96F3770"/>
conducted to the place of execution, and even after they arrived on the ſpot, the old-cloths dealers were ſeen bargaining with the ſoldiers for their cloths. The poor unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate creatures had the mortification to ſee their own towns-men and women buying the poor remains of their fortunes on their backs; and, the inſtant they fell, the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ruſhed in, tearing the new-acquired property from their bodies, yet ſtruggling in the pangs of death.—But, the revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary butchers found that this was but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>productive ſale: the cloths being ſhot through ſunk their value; and this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance determined them to ſtrip the priſoners naked before execution.</p>

                  <p>One day, ſays a witneſs, I begged Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to have mercy on the little children. I pleaded their innocence, and repreſented their infancy, and the injuſtice of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for the faults of their parents. Bachelier anſwered coolly, if I did not know you, I ſhould take you for an ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. You do not perceive then, that theſe children have ſucked ariſtocratic milk; that the blood that runs in their veins is impure, and incapable of being changed into repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican blood? I compare them, added he, to an oil-barrel, which, in ſpite of all the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſcrubbing you can give it, will for ever retain its ſtink. It is juſt ſo with theſe
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030205_0103_0FE5132F712E1A68"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bachelier</hi> anſwers to this. With reſpect, ſays he, to the children of the ariſtocrats, I own that I ſaid, they were hard to be made good republicans; and that it was much to be feared, that the children of fanaticks would <hi>one day</hi> reſemble their parents. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, mayor of Nantz, who is known for a ſound patriot and a <hi>humane man,</hi> ſaid on this ſubject, that the <hi>cats</hi> eat the <hi>young rats,</hi> and that they were in the right of it; for it was the only way of deſtroying the breed. I am perſuaded, adds Bachelier, that no true republican will blame me for ſaying and thinking like Renard, who was a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent patriot.</p>
                  <p>There was, it ſeems, another reaſon for murdering the ariſtocrats; for when the propoſal was made for killing them <hi>en maſſe,</hi> Robin ſaid (VOL. III.

                     <hi>Creſpin,</hi> one of the company of Marat, informs the tribunal, that he was at a drowning on board a lighter, where the priſoners were faſtened down under boards, nailed from ſide to ſide. They uttered, ſays he, the moſt piteous cries. Some of them put their hands folded in a ſupplicating poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through the openings between the boards; and I ſaw the members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee chop off thoſe hands and fingers. One of them plunged his ſabre down in amongſt the priſoners, and we heard a man cry out, oh! the raſcal! he has ſtabbed me! —Our ears, adds the witneſs, were now ſtunned with the cry of, oh! you raſcally, brutal ſavages! this is the mercy, this the humanity of republicans!</p>

Yes, b—ger, ſays Carrier. I am your man then, ſaid Naud.</p>
                  <p>The new Marat was diſpatched to call the <hi>judges</hi> to the repreſentative of the people; and when Philippes ventured to tell him that, among thoſe whom he had ordered to the guillotine from the Bouffay, there were two children of fourteen years of age, and two others of thirteen, Carrier fell in a violent paſſion; damned b—gers, ſays he, in what country am I got? <hi>All milk-hearted raſcals alike!</hi>

                     <hi>Fontbonne</hi> informs the tribunal, that, at the requeſt of Delille, he went to the <hi>Entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot</hi> to endeavour to ſave an innocent and amiable family of females, the youngeſt of which was about thirteen years of age. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lille went with me. When we came to the priſon, we were conducted to a horrid ſtinking hole under a ſtair-caſe. We aſked for a candle, and, after ſome time, we got into this ſort of dungeon. Here we found the mother and four daughters lying cloſe to each other upon ſome wet and filthy ſtraw; and round about them there were ſeveral dead women. The youngeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom alone we had obtained permiſſion to take was covered up in her mothers gown to keep her warm.—When we told the poor mother our errand; no, ſaid ſhe, my child ſhall ſtay and die with myſelf; we have lived, and we will die together.—We thought ourſelves juſtified, adds the witneſs, in uſing force. When the mother perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our reſolution, ſhe uttered ſuch dreadful lamentations as are impoſſible to be deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My child! oh! my dear, darling child! were the laſt words her daughter ever heard from her. The child never recovered the

I ruſhed through them, and had the good fortune to ſave eight of the children, the oldeſt of which was twelve years of age; the reſt were ſhot with their fathers and mothers.</p>

                  <p>The name of Marat has been ſo often mentioned, it may not be improper, or out of place, to give the reader here ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that famous cut-throat.</p>
                  <p>Before the Revolution, he was an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure beggarly fellow, that was daily liable to be brought before the officer of police to give an account of the manner in which he got his bread. But, when this grand event took place; when murderers were wanted in every quarter of the country, he began to cut a figure on the ſcene. He publiſhed a gazette, in which he inculcated the neceſſity of lopping off the heads of thouſands at a time, and of watering, as he called it, the tree of liberty with the blood of the ariſtocrats, as the only means of rendering it fruitful.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and ſuch like ſentiments, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the notice of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030205_0114_0FE512E28C7B05C8"/>
he obtained their confidence, and was one of the <hi>organizers</hi> (to uſe a french term) of the maſſacres of the 2nd and 3rd of September, 1792, of which I have ſpoken in the firſt chapter of this work. On this occaſion he was an actor alſo, and is ſaid to have cut above fifty throats with his own hands.</p>
                  <p>It would have been ſomething unjuſt if a man like this had been forgotten, when the Convention was to aſſemble. He was not. The people of Paris, who had been eye-witneſſes of his merit, choſe him for one of their repreſentatives; and he was faithful in the execution of his truſt; for he never talked about any thing but of throats to cut, ſtabbing, and guillotining.</p>
                  <p>His career, however, was but ſhort. His own neck was not made of iron: a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate woman, who had adopted his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ruſhed into his apartment, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the world of one of the greateſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that ever diſhonoured it.</p>
                  <p>There was ſomething horrible in the look of this villain. He was very ſhort and thick, had a black beard aſcending nearly to the extreme corners of his eyes. This beard was uſually long, and his hair ſhort, ſticking up like briſtles. He had ever been dirty, and it may be imagined, that the faſhions of a revolution which has made it
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030205_0115_0FE51340DD10B450"/>
a <hi>crime</hi> to be <hi>well-dreſſed,</hi> had not improved his appearance: in ſhort, he was at the very beſt, a moſt diſguſting mortal, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he came out of the priſon of La Force, all covered with filth and gore, wielding a piſtol in one hand and a dagger in the other, no wonder that even the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary mob ran back for fear.</p>

                  <p>She was not what is commonly called an ariſtocrat; but a patriot of another faction than Marat. She was, as it is ſaid, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the party of Briſſot, who, from the accompliſhments of Marat, were affraid that he would totally engroſs the favour and affections of the people. Poor Charlotte received her reward on the ſcaffold; and a very juſt reward too; but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſhocking in the behaviour of her executioner, that it ought not to be omitted in a collection of this kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="unknown:030205_0116_0FE512EADB656D80"/>She was a beautiful young woman; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fair; and, in any other country, would have brought tears of compaſſion from the ſpectators. The executioner, after having cut off her head, ſeized it by the fine long hair, and, holding it up by one hand, the brutal ruffian gave her a ſlap in the face with the other. <q>The bitch bluſhes, cried he, at any rate.</q> This trait of hangman wit, excited the ſavage mirth of the populace.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſomething very remarkable that her face, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the body, ſhould bluſh; but it is a real fact, as appears from an eſſay lately republiſhed at Philadelphia, in Gatreau's gazette.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt now return to Nantz, where we ſhall find the revolutionary committee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in writing to their friends at Paris.</p>
                  <p>Before they began to drown and ſhoot by hundreds, they had ſeized on the perſons of one hundred and thirty two of the moſt oppulent men in the city, and ſent them off to Paris to be tried as <hi>ſuſpected perſons.</hi> It appears, from the whole courſe of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on this head, that the detachment of patriots who conducted them, were, if any pretence could be found, to murder them all by the way. This, however, did not
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030205_0117_0FE5134B9D1D56B0"/>
happen. The priſoners arrived ſafe at Paris, and the committee were obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to other means, to prevent their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. The one that they adopted was to inſure their guillotining at Paris; and, for this purpoſe, they wrote to the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary committee of the the ſection of Lepelletier.—Their letter is, and I hope it ever will be, a curioſity in this country.

                  <p>In a ſecond viſit that I made here, I found the poor unhappy creatures in a worſe ſituation than before.

                  <p>It ſeems, from the evidence of ſeveral wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that, while theſe villains were but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chering, or ſtiffling their own countrymen, they took care to treat foreign priſoners with ſome ſort of humanity.

He called on Robin as a witneſs of his bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and told us the manner in which he proceeded.—I had remarked, ſays O'Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, that the butchers killed the ſheep by plunging their knife in underneath the ear; ſo, when I had a mind to kill a priſoner, I came up to him, and, clapping him on the ſhoulder in a jocular way, pointed to ſome object that he was obliged to turn his head

                  <p>The reader's curioſity may, perhaps, lead him to wiſh to know the whole number of perſons put to death at Nantz; but, in this, it would be difficult to gratify him.

                  <p>It has been generally computed that the number of perſons, belonging to this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate city and its environs, who were drowned, ſhot <hi>en maſſe,</hi> guillotined, and ſtifled or ſtarved in priſon, amounted to about <hi>forty</hi> thouſand.

The number of perſons murdered in the ſouth of France, during the ſpace of a very few months, is reckoned at a hundred thouſand.

               <p>AFTER having led the reader through ſuch rivers of blood, it ſeems indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to inſert a few facts, ſhowing by whoſe authority that blood was ſpilt; for, it could anſwer no good purpoſe to excite his deteſtation, without directing it towards the proper object.</p>
               <p>When the French firſt began that career of inſurrection, robbery and murder, which aſſumed the name of a Revolution, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this country, or at leaſt the moſt numerous part of them, felt uncommon anxiety for its ſucceſs. The people were deceived; but the deception was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one; the word <hi>Revolution</hi> had of itſelf very great charms, but when that of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> was added to it, it could not fail of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing enthuſiaſm. This enthuſiaſm was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, nearly general; and this alone was a ſufficient inducement for the public prints to become the partizans of Condorcet and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabeau. All the avenues to truth were at
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030205_0133_0FE5130DAEB36608"/>
once barred up; and, though the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioniſts every day changed their creed, though one revolving moon ſaw them make and break their oaths, all was amply atoned for by their being engaged in a Revolution.</p>
               <p>As the Revolution advanced the enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm increaſed; but from the moment that the French nation declared itſelf a <hi>Republic,</hi> this enthuſiaſm was changed to madneſs. All the means by which this change of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was to be accompliſhed were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally overlooked; nothing was talked or dreamed of but the enfranchiſement of the world; the whole univerſe was to become a republic, or be annihilated; and happy was he who could bawl loudeſt about a certain ſomething, called <hi>liberty and equality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this political madneſs, however, now and then a trait of ſhocking barbarity, in ſpite of all the endeavours of the public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, burſt in upon us, and produced a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid interval; but theſe intervals have never yet been of long duration; becauſe every ſubterfuge, that intereſted falſehood can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, has been made uſe of to give our abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a direction contrary to that which it ought to have taken. We have heard Briſſot, Danton, Marat, and Robeſpierre, all accuſed in their turns of ſhedding inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood; but the <hi>National Aſſembly</hi> itſelf, they tell us has ever remained worthy of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030205_0134_0FE5136DE759BEE8"/>
our admiration. The poor unſucceſsful agents of this terrible divan have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to execration, as tyrants, while their employers have been, and are yet held up to us as the friends of liberty and the lovers of mankind.</p>
               <p>Without further remark, I ſhall add ſuch facts as, I imagine, will enable every reader to judge for himſelf.</p>
               <p>To begin with the conſtituent aſſembly; one proof of their approving of murder will ſuffice. They honoured with the title of <hi>vanquiſhers,</hi> a blood-thirſty mob, who after having taken two men priſoners, cruelly maſſacred them, and carried their heads about the ſtreets of Paris on a pike. <hi>See Rabaud's hiſtory of the French Revolution</hi> page 106.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Aſſembly, when they received advices of the murders of Jourdan and his aſſociates at Avignon, as mentioned in the firſt chapter of this work, threatened the member who communicated the news, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had called the murderers <hi>brigands,</hi> and not <hi>patriots.</hi> See <hi>La Gazette Univerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> for the month of May 1792.—And, how did this Aſſembly behave, when informed of the maſſacres in the priſons of Paris, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the firſt days of September, 1792? <hi>Tallien</hi> (of whom we have lately heard ſo
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030205_0135_0FE513116AB4B570"/>
much) came to the National Aſſembly, and informed them of the murdering in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarkable words: <q>The commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have done all they could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the <hi>diſorders</hi> (the maſſacreing the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners is what he calls <hi>diſorders</hi>) but they have not been able to ſtop the, in ſome ſort, <hi>Juſt vengeance</hi> of the people.</q>—The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly heard this language very quietly, and Doctor Moore, from whoſe journal (page 178) the fact is taken, makes an apology for the Aſſembly, by ſaying that they were <hi>overawed;</hi> but it has ſince fully appeared, that the leading members were the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who contrived the maſſacre, with the aid of Petion, Manuel, and Marat.—It is a well known fact, recorded by the Abbé Barruel (page 334) that <hi>Louvet,</hi> one of the members of the preſent Aſſembly, gave, the day after the September maſſacre, an order on the public treaſury, in the following words: <q>On ſight, pay to the four bearers each twelve livres, for aiding in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching of the prieſts at the priſon of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.

<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030205_0136_0FE5136F707015E0"/>
was <hi>the editor of a gazette!</hi>—People ſhould be cautious how they boaſt of relationſhip with the legiſlators in that country of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>As it will no longer be pretended, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that this ſecond Aſſembly diſapproved of the murders that were committed under their reign, I will now turn to the third Aſſembly, which we commonly call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.

                  <p>It is time, ſays Goullin, to tear aſide the veil.

                  <p>After this the counſellor for the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee aſks this citizen Bo, what was the real motive for bringing the committee to trial; and the other confeſſes, that it was for their having <hi>miſapplied the treaſures</hi> taken from

the priſoners. He pretends (page 60) though he had taken the place of Carrier at Nantz, and though the water of the river could not be drank, on account of the dead bodies that were floating on it; though a hundred or two of ditches had been dug to put the people into that were ſhot, and though the city was filled with cries and lamentations; notwithſtanding all this, he pretends that he could ſay nothing, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>about the murders.</hi>

                  <p>One thing, however, remains to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; and that is, how ſo great a part of the nation were led to butcher each other; how they were brought to that pitch of brutal ſanguinary ferocity, which we have ſeen ſo amply diſplayed in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters.

               <hi>AN INSTRUCTIVE ESSAY,</hi> Tracing all the horrors of the French Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their real cauſes, the licentious Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics and infidel Philoſophy of the preſent Age.</head>
            <p>THAT the French were an amiable people the whole civilized world has given abundant teſtimony, by endeavouring to imitate them. There was not a nation in Europe but had, in ſome degree, adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their language and their faſhions; and all thoſe individuals, belonging even to their haughty rival enemy, who travelled in their country, were led by an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary impulſe into an imitation of their manners.</p>
            <p>The prominent feature in their national character was, it is true, <hi>levity;</hi> but, though levity and ferociouſneſs may, and often do, meet in the ſame perſon, no writer, that I recollect, had ever accuſed the French of being cruel. If we are to judge of their
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030205_0141_0FE513797688CCD8"/>
diſpoſition by their national ſports and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, we ſhall find no room to draw a concluſion againſt their humanity. Theſe cruel diverſions, where men become the bullies of brute creatures, and laugh at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them goad, and bite, and tear each other to pieces, were never known in France. Even in their theatrical performances a dead body was never exhibited on the ſcene: ſuch a ſpectacle was thought to be too much for the feelings of the audience. The works of their favourite authors generally breathe the greateſt tenderneſs and humanity. The nation that could produce, and admire, a Marmontel and a Racine, could not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally bloody-minded.</p>

            <p>Theſe verſes, extracted from the moſt elegant of poems, dictated by the beſts of hearts, contain the juſteſt character of the French nation, that I have ever yet ſeen. To this character I am ready to ſubſcribe: for, I too have been charmed with their gentle manners and their ſocial eaſe: I too have felt the power of thoſe arts which endear mind to mind: I have been a witneſs of their urbanity, their reſpectful deference and attention to the ſofter ſex, their paternal tenderneſs, and their veneration for old age.</p>
            <p>Whence, then, the mighty, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change? What is it that has transfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med a great portion of this airy humane people into a horde of ſullen aſſaſſins? What is it that has converted theſe thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs realms; this gay ſprightly land of mirth, this bright domain, into a gloomy wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs watered with rivers of human blood? This ought to be the great object of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries:
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030205_0143_0FE5137E240AE5F0"/>
this ought to fix all our attention. Without determining this point, we can draw no profit from the preceding relation, and, without attempting it, I ſhould have undertaken the unpleaſant taſk of holding the French people up to reproach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation to no manner of purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It has been aſſerted, again and again, by the partizans of the French revolution, that all the crimes which have diſgraced it, are to be aſcribed to the hoſtile operations of their enemies. They have told us, that, had not the Auſtrians and Pruſſians been on their march to Paris, the priſoners would not have been maſſacred, on the 2nd and 3rd of September, 1792. But, can we poſſibly conceive how the murder of 8,000 poor priſoners, locked up and bound, could be neceſſary to the defence of a Capital, containing a million of inhabitants? Can we believe that the ſabres of the aſſaſſins would not have been more effectually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt the invaders, than againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs prieſts and women. The deluded populace were told not <q>to leave the wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in the fold while they went to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack thoſe that were without.</q> But theſe wolves, if they were ſuch, were in priſon; were under a guard an hundred thouſand times as ſtrong as themſelves, and could have been deſtroyed at a moment's
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030205_0144_0FE51321353C8270"/>
warning. There is ſomething ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cowardly in this juſtification, that it is even more baſe than the crime. Suppoſe that a hundred thouſand men had marched from Paris, to make head againſt the Auſtrians and Pruſſians, there were yet nine hundred thouſand left to guard the unhappy wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that were tied hand and foot. Where could be the neceſſity of maſſacreing them! Where could be the neceſſity of hacking them to pieces, tearing out their bowels, and biting their hearts?</p>
            <p>Subſequent events have fully proved, that it was not danger that produced theſe bloody meaſures: for, we have ever ſeen the revolutioniſts moſt cruel in times of their greateſt ſecurity. Their butcheries at Lyons and in its neighbourhood did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, till they were completely triumphant. It was then, at the moment when they had no retaliation to fear, that they commenced their bloody work. Carrier, lolling at at his eaſe, ſent the victims to death by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds. The blood never flowed from the guillotine in ſuch torrents, as at the very time when their armies were driving their enemies before them in every direction.</p>
            <p>Charles Fox (who, by the bye, would not have made a bad cut-throat general) Charles Fox had the folly and impudence to ſay, in the Britiſh Houſe of Commons,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030205_0145_0FE5137FD06A4540"/>
that the maſſacres in France ought to be attributed to the Allied Powers. <q>You hunt them like wild beaſts,</q> ſaid this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and honeſt ſwindler, <q>and then you complain of them for being ferocious.</q> How this hunting, as Fox calls it, could drive the French to butcher one another, I cannot ſee; but if it was a juſtifiable reaſon for them, it might certainly be applied with much more juſtice to their enemies; for theſe have been oftener obliged to fly than the French. The revolutionary armies have overrun an extent of territory equal to one third of their own country: the Savoyards, the Germans, the Flemings, the Dutch, the Spaniards, and the Engliſh, have been obliged to fly before them; but we have heard of no maſſacres among theſe people. The French moſt unmercifully put to death eight thouſand of their country people, who were in the priſons of Paris, and, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for this, they tell us that the Duke of Brunſwick had invaded the province of Champagne; but they themſelves have overrun all the United Netherlands, and even taken poſſeſſion of the capital; and we have not heard, that the Dutch have as yet been guilty of a ſingle maſſacre. They have found but one place in all their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, where the people could be prevailed on to erect a guillotine, and that was at
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030205_0146_0FE513815815C968"/>
Geneva. Here their army was more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than the whole population of the ſtate, and therefore their ſyſtem was fully adopted; yet even here, among this little debaſed and tyranized people, there were to be found no villains infamous enough to imitate their maſters in murdering women and children. That was a ſpecies of ſlaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſerved for the French nation alone.</p>
            <p>The French revolution has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that of America, and I have heard ſome men, calling themſelves Americans, who have not been aſhamed to ſay, that as great cruelties were committed in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as in that. I would now aſk theſe men, who are ſo anxious to be thought as bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as the ſans-culotte French, if they can give me one inſtance of the Americans mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their towns-men at the approach of the enemy? When the Britiſh army ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that of the Congreſs at Philadelphia, did the continental troops murder all the Tories, before they quitted the city? Can theſe generous friends of the French revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution tell us of any maſſacres that took place in this country? Did they ever hear of women and children being drowned and ſhot by hundreds? Seven years of civil war deſolated theſe ſtates; but the blood of one ſingle woman or child never ſtained the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="unknown:030205_0147_0FE513EAD2682C68"/>If the doctrine of the proſligate Charles Fox be admitted, if a people be juſtifiable in entering on a ſeries of maſſacres, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant they are preſſed by an enemy from without, what ſafety can there be for any of us? If a declaration of war is to unſheath the daggers of all the aſſaſſins in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, civil ſociety is the greateſt curſe that ever fell upon mankind. Much better and ſafer were it for us to ſeparate, and prowl about like ſavages, nay like beaſts, than to live thus, in continual trepidation, in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear for our throats.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething ſo exceedingly cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly and ridiculous in this juſtification, that even the French revolutioniſts are aſhamed of it. They have recourſe to another ſtill more diſhonourable, it is true, but leſs cowardly. They tell us, that all the aſſaſſins in France have been in the pay of Great Britain; or, to make uſe of their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, have been excited to action by the <hi>"gold of Pitt."</hi>

If it was the gold of Pitt that paid for all the French blood that has been ſpilled, it muſt have been that gold that paid for the inhuman murder of Meſſrs. Launy and Fleſſel, and it muſt have been that gold which induced the conſtituent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030205_0151_0FE513EF004B8FC0"/>
to ſanction the murder, by giving the aſſaſſins of theſe gentlemen the title of <hi>heroes</hi> and <hi>conquerors,</hi> and by inſtituting a national feſtival in their honour.</p>
            <p>The Revolution was begun, and has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been maintained by the ſhedding of innocent blood; therefore, if it was the gold of Pitt that paid for that blood, it is to the gold of Pitt that the revolution is to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, and not to that patriotic ſpirit and love of liberty, with which we have been ſo long amuſed. In the fifth chapter of this work, it is inconteſtibly proved, that the ſeveral National Aſſemblies authoriſed, or approved of all the maſſacres which have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced their country; if, then, theſe maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres were paid for by Mr. Pitt, muſt we not inevitably conclude that the National Aſſemblies were in the ſame pay? If Mr. Pitt paid for the blood of the family of Bourbon, for that of the king's guards, of the nobility, the clergy, the bankers, the merchants, in ſhort, of all the rich or ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats, as they are called, it was Mr. Pitt who deſtroyed the monarchy: it was he who cauſed France to be called a Republic, and who gave riſe to the doctrine of <hi>equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Thoſe, therefore, who talk of the gold of Pitt, muſt ceaſe all their fulſome eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiums on theſe gallant republicans; for,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030205_0152_0FE5138FE64F1930"/>
if they are to have a republic, it will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own confeſſions, be the work of the Engliſh miniſter.</p>
            <p>This vindication, throwing the blame on the gold of Pitt, amply participates in the misfortune of all the vindications that have lately appeared amongſt us; that is, it takes up a bad cauſe, and makes it worſe. The reader will certainly feel, with me, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible indignation at a people, who, becauſe an hoſtile army was on their fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, could be prevailed on to butcher thouſands upon thouſands of their innocent countrymen; who could cut the throats of their fathers and mothers, rip up the bowels of women with child, and carry about the trophies of their baſe and ſavage triumph on the points of their pikes and bayonets; but, what will be his feelings, what will contain his ſwelling heart, when he is told, that all this was undertaken and perpetrated for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign gold? The revolutioniſts, by accuſing Mr. Pitt of being at the bottom of their maſſacres, do not perceive, without doubt, that they are heaping ten times ten-fold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy on themſelves and their nation.</p>
            <p>By alledging this influence of Britiſh gold, the writer I have above quoted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces himſelf and the partizans of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution to a moſt diſtreſſing dilemma. He owns that rivers of French blood have flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030205_0153_0FE513F0858E60E8"/>
at Paris, in the departments, on the frontiers, and in the colonies; and he tells us, that this blood was paid for with the gold of Pitt. Now, admitting this to be true, this blood has been ſhed, and this gold received, by <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> To what, then, will our author aſcribe this ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary avarice? He muſt either aſcribe it to the <hi>natural diſpoſition</hi> of his countrymen; or, <hi>a change</hi> in that natural diſpoſition, <hi>produced by the revolution.</hi> It is uncertain which of theſe he may chooſe, but it is very certain, chooſe which he will, that he has held up the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his nation, or the principles of the revolution to deteſtation, and abhorrence. This is the way he has juſtified the French in the eyes of the people of this country. Infinitely better were it for ſuch juſtifiers to ſuffer the preſs to reſt in eternal inaction. All that a good Frenchman can do, is, to weep over the diſgrace of his country; for, ſo long as murder, horrid, barbarous, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage murder, ſhall admit of no excuſe, ſo long ſhall the actions of the French revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutioniſts remain unjuſtifiable.</p>
            <p>It is more than probable, that a writer of this ſtamp might be willing to allow, that his countrymen were always naturally fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and bloody-minded, rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that this diſpoſition has been produced by the principles of the revolution: for,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030205_0154_0FE513916EED0408"/>
patriots of this kind are ever ready to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the honour of their country to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their ſyſtems. But juſtice demands from us to reject with diſdain every ſuch concluſion. We have ſeen the French peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſprightly, beneficent, humane and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; let us, now, follow them ſtep-by-ſtep into the awful oppoſite, and ſee for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by what diabolical means the change has been effected.</p>
            <p>The firſt National Aſſembly had hardly aſſumed that title, when they diſcovered an intention of overturning the government, which they had been called together, and which their conſtituents had enjoined them, to ſupport, and of levelling all ranks and diſtinctions among the different orders in the community. To this they were not led, as it has been ſo falſely pretended, by their love of liberty and deſire of ſeeing their country happy; but by envy, curſed envy, that will never let the fiery demagogue ſleep in peace, while he ſees a greater or richer than himſelf. It has been objected to this, that there were among the revolutioniſts men who already enjoyed diſtinguiſhed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; but it is forgotten at the ſame time, that ambition will be at the top, or no where; that it will deſtroy itſelf with the envied object, rather than act a ſubaltern part. The motto of a demagogue is that
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030205_0155_0FE513FB5432DA48"/>
of Milton's Satan: "rather reign in hell than ſerve in heaven."</p>
            <p>This taſk of deſtruction was, however, an arduous one. To tear the complicated work of fourteen centuries to pieces at once, to render honours diſhonourable, and turn reverential awe into contempt and mockery, was not to be accompliſhed but by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means. It was evident that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt change hands, that the beſt blood of the nation muſt flow in torrents, or the project muſt fail. The Aſſembly, to arm the multitude on their ſide, broached the popular doctrine of <hi>equality.</hi> It was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of the plan of theſe reformers to ſeduce the people to their ſupport; and ſuch was the credulity of the unfortunate French, that they ſoon began to look on them as the oracles of virtue and wiſdom, and believed themſelves raiſed, by one ſhort ſentence iſſued by theſe ambitious impoſtors, from the ſtate of <hi>ſubjects</hi> to that of <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</hi>

What dreadful carnage, what indelible diſgrace, the nation would have eſcaped! Hardly had the word <hi>equality</hi> been pronounced, when the whole kingdom became a ſcene of anarchy and confuſion.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpect, all that they had reverenced and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red even, began to excite contempt and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Birth, beauty, old age, all became the victims of a deſtructive equality, erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a law by an Aſſembly of ambitious ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, who were ready to deſtroy every thing that croſſed their way to abſolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>One of the immediate effects of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of this doctrine was the murder of Monſieur Foulon and his ſon-in-law Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier, who, without ſo much as being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with any crime, were taken by the people, conducted to Paris and cruelly
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030205_0157_0FE513FD3B3D15B8"/>
maſſacreed. I will ſay nothing (ſays <hi>Du Gour</hi> in his eloquent <hi>Memoire</hi> page 35) I will ſay nothing of the ſavage cruelties committed on Foulon and Berthier; I will not repreſent the bloody head of the father-in-law, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſon to kiſs, preſſed againſt his lips, and afterwards put under his feet; I will not repreſent the inhuman aſſaſſins ruſhing on Berthier, tearing out his heart, and placing it, quivering and ſtill palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, on the table of the town-hall, <hi>before the magiſtrates</hi> of the commune.—After this their heads were ſtuck on pikes, and the heart of Berthier on the point of a ſword. In this manner they were carried through the ſtreets, followed by the exulting popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace (ſee <hi>Rabaut's</hi> Hiſt. Of the French Revolution, page 117.) Nor let it be pretended that the Aſſembly could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this ſhameful, this bloody deed. They had the abſolute command of Paris at the time, and had two hundred thouſand armed men ready to obey their nod. But the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly never oppoſed the murder of thoſe whom they looked upon as their enemies; nay, Rabaut, their partial hiſtorian (who was one of their body) even juſtifies the murder.</p>
            <p>When the word <hi>equality</hi> found its way to the colonies it was only a ſignal for aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At Port-au-Prince the Chevalier de
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030205_0158_0FE5139E0377D140"/>
Mauduit, a brave and generous officer, who rendered eſſential ſervices to this country during the laſt war, was murdered by his own ſoldiers. The villains had the inſolence to order him to kneel down before them: "No," ſaid he, like a ſoldier as he was, <q>it ſhall never be ſaid, that Thomas Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit bent his knee before a ſet of ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels,</q> —His head was cut off; he was torn limb from limb; his bowels were trail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the ſtreet, as butchers do thoſe of beaſts in a ſlaughter houſe. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the different members of his body, and morſels of his fleſh, were ſeen ſtrewed about oppoſite his houſe, and his bloody and ghaſtly head placed on the ſtep of the door way.— We know, we have before our eyes the proofs of what havock, diſtreſs and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this deteſtable word has ſince produced in the unfortunate iſland of St. Domingo.</p>
            <p>It was now that the ſovereign people, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their reign, firſt took the famous plundering motto: <hi>"La guerre aux cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaux et la paix aux chaumiéres";</hi> that is, <hi>War to the gentlemen's houſes and peace to the cottage;</hi> or, in other words, <hi>war to all thoſe who have any thing to loſe.</hi> This motto is extremely comprehenſive; it includes the whole doctrine of equality. It was not a vain declaration in France; but was put in practice with that patriotic zeal which
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030205_0159_0FE513FEEFA44DE8"/>
has marked the whole courſe of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. To be rich or of a good family became a crime, which was often expiated by the loſs of life. Men took as much pains to be thought obſcure vagabonds, as they had formerly done to be thought wealthy and of honeſt deſcent; and, what diſtinguiſhes the French revolution from all others in the world, to have a ragged pair of breeches, or to be totally in want of that ſo neceſſary article of dreſs, was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the ſureſt mark of pure patriotiſm, and was the greateſt recommendation to public favour.</p>
            <p>But the National Aſſembly, though hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſeconded by myriads of ragged popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, knew, however, that they could not long depend upon ſuch a promiſcuous ſupport. The citizens were, therefore, to be ſoldiers at the ſame time, and placed under the command of the creatures of the Aſſembly. To this end the territory of the nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent a new diviſion, on the levelling plan. The provinces of France were melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down into a rude undigeſted maſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, diſtricts, and municipalities. All the old magiſtrates were replaced by the vileſt wretches that could be found. There were forty four thouſand municipalities, each of theſe had ſeveral municipal officers,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030205_0160_0FE5139F8D1FF470"/>
and each of theſe latter his troop of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary myrmidons. There could not be leſs than <hi>three millions</hi> of men in arms, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burn, cut and ſlay at a moment's warning. Nothing was to be ſeen or heard but the patrolling of theſe ſons of equality. The Aſſembly pretended to hold out the olive branch, while they were forming the nation into a camp. The peaceable man trembled for his life. One muſt have been an eye witneſs of the change produced by theſe meaſures, to have the leaſt idea of it. All was ſuſpicion and dread. The bell that had never rung but to call the peaceful vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers to the altar, was converted into a ſignal of approaching danger, and the tree, beneath which they formerly danced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an alarm poſt. The ragged greaſy magiſtrates, with their municipal troops at their heels, were for ever prowling about for their prey, the property of others. Theſe little platoons of cut-throats ranged the country round, crying havock burning and laying waſte where ever they came. They had not yet begun to murder frequently, but it was little conſequence to a man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his brains were blowed out or not, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſeen himſelf and family reduced, in the ſpace of a few hours, from affluence to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

houſe of a gentleman in Provence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that his perſon ſhould be delivered into their hands. The ſervants defended the houſe for ſome time, but in vain; they advanced to the front door, when the lady of the houſe appeared with a child in her arms, and endeavoured to pacify them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her huſband was gone out at the back door. The ruffians inſtantly ſet fire to the houſe. When the lady perceived this, ſhe confeſſed that her huſband was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in one of the garrets. The houſe was now on fire; ſhe left her child and ruſhed through the flames to call her huſband from his retreat, but ſhe was ſtifled in the paſſage, and burnt to death, and her huſband ſhared in her fate, leaving a helpleſs infant to the mercy of the murderers of its father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—A hundred volumes like this could not contain the horrors that theſe revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary robbers committed in the name of <hi>liberty and equality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this, Americans, be a leſſon to you, throw from you the doctrine of <hi>equality,</hi> as you would the poiſoned chalice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this deteſtable principle gains ground to any extent, ruin muſt inevitably enſue. Would you ſtifle the noble flame of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and encourage ignorance and idleneſs? Would you inculcate defiance of the laws? Would you teach ſervants to be diſobedient
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030205_0162_0FE513A113862370"/>
to their maſters, and children to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? Would you ſow the ſeeds of envy, hatred, robbery, and murder? Would you break all the bands of ſociety aſunder, and turn a civilized people into a horde of ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? This is all done by the comprehenſive word equality.—But they tell us, we are not to take it in the unqualified ſenſe. In what ſenſe are we to take it then? Either it means ſomething more than liberty, or it means nothing at all. The miſconſtruction of the word liberty has done miſchief enough in the world; to add to it a word of a ſtill more dangerous extent, was to kindle a flame that never can be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by the total debaſement, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, of the ſociety, who are ſilly or wicked enough to adopt its uſe. We are told, that every government receives with its exiſtence the latent diſeaſe that is one day to accompliſh its death; but the government that is attacked with this political apoplexy is annihilated in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
            <p>The civil diſorganization of the ſtate was but the forerunner of thoſe curſes which the Aſſembly had in ſtore for their devoted country. They plainly perceived, that they never ſhould be able to brutify the people to their wiſhes, without removing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable barriers of religion and morality.
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030205_0163_0FE5140CF1F52F40"/>
Their heads were turned, but it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to corrupt their hearts.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the leaders in the Aſſembly were profeſſed <hi>modern philoſophers;</hi> that is to ſay, atheiſts or deiſts. Camus and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorcet openly taught atheiſm, and Ceruti ſaid with his laſt breath, <q>the only regret I have in quitting the world, is, that I leave a religion on earth.</q> Theſe words, the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of an expiring demon, were applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the aſſembled legiſlators. It was not to be wondered at, that the vanity of ſuch men ſhould be flattered in the hope of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>moſt chriſtian</hi> country into the <hi>moſt infidel</hi> upon the face of the earth; for, there is a ſort of fanaticiſm in irreligion, that leads the profligate atheiſt to ſeek for proſelytes with a zeal that would do honour to a good cauſe, but which employed in a bad one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſcourge of ſociety.</p>
            <p>The zeal of theſe philoſophers for extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the truth, was as great at leaſt, as that ſhown by the primitive chriſtians for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation. But they proceeded in a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner. At firſt ſome circumſpection was neceſſary. The more effectually to deſtroy the chriſtian religion altogether, they began by ſapping the foundations of the catholic faith, the only one that the people had been taught to revere. They formed a ſchiſm with the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030205_0164_0FE513AB6663BA70"/>
church of Rome, well knowing that the opinions of the vulgar, once ſet afloat, were as likely to fix on atheiſm as on any other ſyſtem; and more ſo, as being leſs oppoſed to their levelling principles than the rigid though ſimple morality of the goſpel. A religion that teaches obedience to the higher powers, inculcates humility and peace, ſtrictly forbids robbery and murder, and, in ſhort, enjoins on men to do as they would be done unto, could by no means ſuit the armed ruſſians, who were to accompliſh the views of the French Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The preſs, which was made free for the worſt of purpoſes, lent moſt powerful aid to theſe deſtructive reformers. While the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic religion was ridiculed and abuſed, no other chriſtian ſyſtem was propoſed in its ſtead; on the contrary, the profligate wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who conducted the public prints, among whom were Mirabeau, Marat, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorcet and Hebert, filled one half of their impious ſheets with whatever could be thought of to degrade all religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. The miniſters of divine worſhip, of every ſect and denomination, were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as cheats, and as the avowed enemies of the ſublime and ſentimental ſomething, which the Aſſembly had in ſtore for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="unknown:030205_0165_0FE5140ED021AB50"/>Moſt of my readers muſt have heard of the magnificent church of St. Genviève, at Paris. It was one of the moſt noble ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that the world had ever ſeen, and had beſides the honour of being conſecrated to the worſhip of Chriſt. This edifice the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers ſeized on as a receptacle for the remains of their <hi>"great men."</hi> From a chriſtian church, they changed it into a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan temple, and gave it the name of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon.</hi> Condorcet, pre-eminent in infamy, propoſed the decree, by which the name of God and that of St. Genviève were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be effaced from the frontiſpiece.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Pantheon</hi> the aſhes of Voltaire were firſt tranſported, and the Aſſembly ſpent no leſs than three days in determining whether thoſe of <hi>Rouſſeau</hi> ſhould not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them. This diſtinction, paid to two of the moſt celebrated deiſts of the age, was a full declaration of the principles as well as the intentions of the majority of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have not had the patience to wade through the lies and blaſphemies of Voltaire, know his principles from report. <hi>Rouſſeau</hi> is not ſo well known; and, as he was, and ſtill continues to be, the great oracle of the revolutioniſts, I am perſuaded a page or two on his character, and that of his works, will not be loſt here; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030205_0166_0FE513AD3428C498"/>
as I have heard both mentioned with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in this country, by perſons apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the beſt intentions.</p>
            <p>The philoſopher Rouſſeau, the pagod of the regenerated French, was born at Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va; and, at a proper age, bound an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to an artiſt. During his apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he frequently robbed his maſter as well as other perſons. Before his time was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired he decamped, fled into the dominions of the king of Sardinia, where he changed the preſbyterian for the catholic religion. This beginning ſeemed to promiſe fair for what followed. By an unexpected turn of fortune he became a footman, in which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity he did not forget his old habit of ſtealing. He is detected with the ſtolen goods; ſwears they were given him by a maid ſervant of the houſe; the girl is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with him, ſhe denies the fact, and weeping preſſes him to confeſs the truth; but the young philoſopher ſtill perſiſts in the lie, and the poor girl is driven from her place in diſgrace.—Tired of being a ſerving-man, he went to throw himſelf on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a lady, whom he had ſeen once before, and who he proteſts was the moſt <hi>virtuous</hi> creature of her ſex. This lady had ſo great a regard for him, that ſhe called him her <hi>little darling,</hi> and he called her <hi>mama. Mama</hi> had a footman, who ſerved her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:030205_0167_0FE514105AA37928"/>
in another capacity very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of a huſband; but ſhe had a moſt tender affection for her adopted ſon <hi>Rouſſeau,</hi> and, as ſhe feared he was forming connections with a certain lady that might ſpoil his morals, ſhe herſelf, out of pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, took him—to bed with her!—This vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous effort to preſerve the purity of Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau's heart, had a dreadful effect on the head of the poor footman, and ſo he poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf—Roſſeau fell ſick, and <hi>mama</hi> was obliged to part with <hi>little darling,</hi> while he performed a journey to the ſouth of France, for the recovery of his health. On the road he dines with a gentleman, and lies with his wife. As he was returning back, he debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with himſelf whether he ſhould pay this lady a ſecond viſit or not; but, fearing he might be tempted to ſeduce her daughter alſo, <hi>virtue</hi> got the better, and determined the <hi>little darling</hi> to fly home into the arms of his <hi>mama;</hi> but, alas! thoſe arms were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with another. <hi>Mama's</hi> virtue had prompted her to take a ſubſtitute, whom ſhe liked too well to part with, and our philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher was obliged to ſhift for himſelf. I ſhould have told the reader, that the <hi>little darling,</hi> while he reſided with his <hi>mama,</hi> went to make a tour with a young muſician. Their friendſhip was warm, like that of moſt young men, and they were, beſides, enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030205_0168_0FE513AEBAF52F78"/>
to take particular care of each other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their travels. They travelled on for ſome time, agreed perfectly well, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an everlaſting friendſhip for each other. But, the muſician, being one day taken in a fit, fell down in the ſtreet, which furniſhed the faithful Rouſſeau with an opportunity of ſlipping off with ſome of his things, and leaving him to the mercy of the people, in a town where he was a total ſtranger.</p>
            <p>We ſeldom meet with ſo much villainy in a youth. His manhood was worthy of it. He turned apoſtate a ſecond time, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from within the walls of his native city of Geneva, as an incendiary, and an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of anarchy and infidelity; nor did he forget how to thieve.—At laſt the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher marries; but like a philoſopher; that is, without going to church. He has a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of children, and, like a kind philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal father, for fear they ſhould want after his death, he ſends them to the <hi>poor-houſe</hi> during his lifetime!—To conclude, the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher dies, and leaves the philoſophereſs; his wife, to the protection of a friend; ſhe marries a footman, and gets turned out into the ſtreet.</p>
            <p>This is a brief ſketch of the life of Jean Jacques Rouſſeau, the oracle of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated French, a thief, a whoremaſter, an adulterer, a treacherous friend, an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030205_0169_0FE51411E4CECE48"/>
father, and twice an apoſtate.—There wants only about a hundred murders to make him equal to the immortal Marat, whom we have ſeen compared to Jeſus Chriſt. This vile wretch has the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſay, in the work that contains a confeſſion of theſe his crimes, that no man can come to the throne of God, and ſay, <hi>I am a better man than Rouſſeau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His writings, though they have very great literary merit, contain ſuch principles as might be expected from ſuch a man.

vogue, may gueſs at the effect that this phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical canonization of Rouſſeau produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Every thing was <hi>a la Rouſſeau;</hi> his works were hawked about, mouthed in the National Aſſembly (often by thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them not) recommended in all the prints, and ſpouted at the ſans-culotte clubs. His old booriſh ſayings became the livelieſt traits of wit, all his manners were imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be cruſty and ill-bred was like Jean Jacques, and, what was particularly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to every juſt mind, his loathſome down-looking portrait, that portrait which ſeems to be the choſen ſeat of guilt, was ſeen at every corner, and in every hand.</p>
            <p>Having thus prepared the public mind, the Aſſembly made a bold attack on the church. They diſcovered, by the light of philoſophy, that France contained too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny churches, and, of courſe, too many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. Great part of them were therefore to be ſuppreſſed, and to make the innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on go down with the people, all tithes were to be abolliſhed. The meaſure ſucceeded; but what did the people gain by the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tithes? not a farthing; for, a tax of twenty <hi>per cent</hi> was immediately laid on the lands in conſequence of it. The cheat was not perceived till it was too late.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="unknown:030205_0172_0FE513BB7811ED78"/>But, the abolition of the tithes, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motive of which was to debaſe the clergy in the opinions of the people, was but a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle to what was to follow. The religious orders, that is to ſay, the communities of monks and nuns, poſſeſſed immenſe landed eſtates, and theſe the honeſt Aſſembly had marked for their own. As a pretext for the ſeizure they firſt decreed, that the wealth of the religious orders <hi>belonged to the nation,</hi> to that indefinite being, that exiſts every where and no where, and that has devoured all, without receiving any thing.</p>
            <p>As this act of ſeizing the eſtates of the regular clergy, was one of thoſe that gave a deciſive blow to property as well as religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in France, and one that has received the greateſt applauſes in this country, I ſhall enter a little at length into the flagrant inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of it.

            <p>How the eſtates of the religious orders became the property of a certain ſomebody called the nation, in 1791, is to me wholly inconceiveable; ſeeing that there never was a time, when they belonged to that ſociety of men, now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

part of the monaſteries had been founded five, ſix, ſeven hundred years, and ſome above a thouſand years before the moſt worthleſs of the French took it into their heads to be ſo many ſovereigns. The founders were men of pious and auſtere lives, who, wiſhing to retire from the world, obtained grants of uncultivated land, generally in ſome barren and ſolitary ſpot. There they formed little miſerable ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, by their frugality and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in time became rich meadows, farms and vineyards. A French hiſtorian, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. Etienne, ſays: <q>In 1058, he retired to Citeaux, then a vaſt foreſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited only by wild beaſts. Here, with the help of his followers, he built a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of the wood of the foreſt; but, at firſt, it was no more than a group of ſhabby huts. Every thing bore the marks of extreme poverty: the croſs was of wood, the cenſers of copper, and the candle-ſticks of iron. All the ornaments were of coarſe woolen or linnen. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was the only means of ſubſiſtence with the monks of Citeaux. For many years bread was their only food, and they were often reduced to a ſcarcity of even that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In time this foreſt became a cultivated and flouriſhing eſtate, and the ſucceſſors of
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030205_0174_0FE513BD76EA0B60"/>
the firſt proprietors were not only at their eaſe, but even rich. The monaſtery, which was at firſt but a clump of ill-ſhaped huts, built with the limbs of trees, bark and turf, was become a magnificent pile. The church was beautiful beyond deſcription. Inſtead of wood and copper and iron, the ſymbols of religion and the ſacred vaſes were now of gold, ſilver and precious ſtones. This abbey, at the time of the ſeizure by the Conſtituent Aſſembly, had an annual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of 120,000 French livres, or, about 6,000 pounds ſterling.</p>
            <p>Now, I aſk any honeſt man; was this the property of the French nation, or not? By what rule of right, by what principle of law or juſtice, could this eſtate belong to any other than the <hi>lawful</hi> ſucceſſors of the firſt proprietors; that is to ſay, the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors at the epoch of the ſeizure? No title ever framed by man could be ſo good as theirs.

The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries were long an aſſylum to thoſe chriſtians, who fled from the oppreſſions of the Goths and Vandals. The little learning that remained in the barbarous and dark ages, was preſerved in the cloiſters. It is to them we owe all the moſt precious remains of antiquity, as well as many modern inventions.</q>—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, under the great diſpoſer of all events, it is to them we owe that we are chriſtians; that we poſſeſs the word of God, our guide to eternal life.

the French nation, and to the human mind, have iſſued from the cloiſter. And yet, we have ſeen theſe men robbed of their eſtates, ſtripped of even their furniture and their veſtments, driven from beneath their roofs, hunted like wild beaſts, and, what I am aſhamed to ſay, many of us have had the folly, or rather baſeneſs, to applaud their unprincipled and blood-thirſty purſuers<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot help obſerving here, that theſe unjuſt and inhuman applauders have not always been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the mob. An <q>Oration <hi>on the</hi> Progreſs of Reaſon.</q> delivered at a Public Commencement in the Univerſity of Cambridge, Maſſachuſetts, on the 18th of July, 1792, contains a phillipic againſt the injured French monarch and Clergy, the moſt illiberal that ever diſgraced the lips of a petulant ſelf-ſufficient pedant. The <hi>Orator</hi> diſcovers but little knowledge of any branch of his ſubject, and more particularly of the character of Louis XVI. of that of the French Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and of the nature of the old government; againſt all which he runs on in a ſtrain of invective, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the brutal abuſiveneſs of Calvin, than any thing we ought to expect to hear from the chair of a ſeminary, at the cloſe of the "<hi>enlightened</hi> eighteenth century".—Like many others, this <hi>Orator</hi> looked upon the French Revolution as happily terminated; as the dawn of univerſal peace, liberty, and virtue: he has ſince had time to ſee his error, to ſee the effects of his "Progreſs of Reaſon," ſome of which I have related in the former part of this volume; If he be candid, therefore, he will publicly retract this error. If he ſhould not do this, I ſhall take the liberty, one of theſe days, of convincing him that he has erred.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:030205_0177_0FE51422B3FB6B38"/>We are told that the monks were become too rich. Indeed this was their great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the eyes of an Aſſembly, whoſe motto was: <q>War to the rich and peace to the cottager.</q> But we have ſeen that the foundation of theſe riches was laid by the labour of their predeceſſors, and we may obſerve that they were augmented, not by oppreſſion, as has been falſly aſſerted, but by a prudent management of their eſtates. Thoſe communities that cultivated their own lands, were noted for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner of their cultivation, and for the ſuperior quality of their produce; and thoſe that rented out their farms, let them at a low rate, ſo as to enable the farmer to enrich the land at the ſame time that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched himſelf. It was by ſuch means that their eſtates became the moſt valuable in the country, a circumſtance that poor ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-headed Paine has brought againſt them as a heinous offence. They were gentle humane maſters and landlords: a man look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his fortune as made, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the tenant of a religious order.</p>
            <p>And, how were theſe riches ſpent? Not in horſes and coaches; people ſhut up in a cloiſter had no uſe for theſe. Not in balls and plays: for there they could never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Not in rich attire and coſtly repaſts; for the greateſt part of them were clothed
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030205_0178_0FE513C08B7DAE50"/>
worſe than common beggars, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the uſe of meat, and even of wine, the common drink of their country. Their riches did not go to agrandize their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; becauſe, as no individual could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs any thing, ſo he could bequeath or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of nothing. Who, then, profited from theſe riches?—Go aſk the poor, who were happy in the neighbourhood of their convents. Go aſk the aged, the infirm, the widow and the orphan. And, aſk them, too, what aid and conſolation they have received from the thieving philoſophers of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>This charge of being <hi>too rich,</hi> is the moſt abſurd as well as the moſt vile that could poſſibly be invented. Do we ſay to a man, who has acquired an immenſe fortune by the labour of his father, or by any other means; you are <hi>too rich,</hi> and therefore your proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty belongs to the nation?—There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity at Bethlehem, very much reſembling thoſe we have here been ſpeaking of. What ſhould we think of a ſcoundrel legiſlator, who ſhould propoſe to ſtrip theſe people of their property, and turn them out to beg their bread, merely becauſe the value of their lands is increaſed? Such was he who firſt propoſed the ſeizure of the church lands in France.</p>

               <pb n="179" facs="unknown:030205_0179_0FE5142C20305B40"/>Some of the convents in France had been founded by lay perſons, upon ſuch and ſuch conditions; and, in caſe of failure on the part of the community, the property was to revert to the heirs of the donor. Foundations of this kind were exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe we frequently ſee among us, of hoſpitals, ſeminaries, &amp;c. and the deeds were ſtill in exiſtence at the time of the ſeizure; but an Aſſembly that paid no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a right of preſcription, founded on a thouſand years of uninterrupted poſſeſſion, could not be expected to pay attention to the contents of a bit of old parchment.</p>
            <p>We ought not to be aſtoniſhed at hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the author of <hi>The Age of Reaſon</hi> attempt to juſtify this act of impudent fraud; but let us ſee how his doctrine would ſuit, if applied to ourſleves: for this is the only way to determine on its merits.

drive the congregation from the altar, ſtrip the miniſter of his caſſock, ſeize on the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental cup, and turn the Church into a ſtable; I aſk how ſhould we like this?— But, we are told, there is a vaſt difference; that the monks were ſuperſtitious drones, uſeleſs to ſociety.—Ah! let us beware. Let us take care not to condemn, becauſe we are proteſtants, a religion that differs from our own in form only; a religion that has yet more votaries than any other chriſtian profeſſion can boaſt of. And, as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders being uſeleſs to ſociety, we have no proofs of this, but ſtrong preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ones of the contrary; for, we know, that France was great and happy, that it had been increaſing in extent, wealth and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſince the exiſtence of theſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, However, I can by no means take upon me to prove the public utility of the monaſtick life; nor is it neceſſary; for, if no man is to poſſeſs property, unleſs he can prove his utility to ſociety, I am afraid that few of us would be ſecure. How many hundreds of proprietors do we ſee, who are much <hi>worſe</hi> than uſeleſs to ſociety! Surely the public is as much benefited by a man who ſpends his life in a convent, as by one who ſpends it in a tavern, at a billiard-table, or in a play-houſe. Thouſands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands there are who never worked a ſtroke,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030205_0181_0FE5142E3B820A10"/>
nor ſtudied a ſingle hour; vegetating mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, who ſeem to live only to eat and drink and be carried about. Yet we have never thought of ſeizing their eſtates. No; utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or inutility has nothing to do with the matter; the queſtion before us is a ſimple queſtion of right. Whether monks were neceſſary or uſeful in France, or not, we know there were ſuch people, and that they poſſeſſed property legally acquired; and, every honeſt man, capable of diſtinguiſhing between right and wrong, will hold in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence the Aſſembly that dared to rob them of it.</p>
            <p>When we hear of ſuch crying acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice as this, we are naturally led to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire who were the firſt promoters of them. The reader will be aſtoniſhed to hear, that the decree for this national robbery was firſt propoſed by a biſhop. Of a hundred and thirty eight French biſhops, there were only <hi>four</hi> to be found, who would give their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to this deed, and one of theſe four was he who propoſed the decree. The Abbé Barruel ſpeaks of him in the following terms: <q>The Aſſembly thought it high time to conſumate their deſigns upon the church, by ſeizing what ſtill remained of its poſſeſſions, This meaſure was ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contrary to every principle of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and common honeſty, that it was not

            <p>To obtain the ſanction of the people to this act, they were told, that the wealth of the church would not only pay off the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional debt, but render taxes in future un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. No deception was ever ſo bare faced as this; but even this was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the people themſelves had already begun to taſte the ſweets of plunder. Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice tempted the trading part of the nation to approve of the meaſure. At the time of paſſing the decree they were ſeen among the firſt to applaud it. They ſaw an eaſy means of obtaining thoſe fine rich eſtates the poſſeſſion of which they had, perhaps long coveted. In vain were they told, that the purchaſer would partake in the infamy of the robbery; that, if the title of the communities could not render property ſecure, that ſame property could never be ſecure under any title the plunderers could give. In vain were they told, that in ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the ſeiſure of the wealth of others, they were ſanctioning the ſeiſure of their
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030205_0183_0FE514308D0CCE18"/>
own, whenever that all-devouring monſter, the ſovereign people, ſhould call on them for it. In vain were they told all this: they purchaſed: they ſaw with pleaſure the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered clergy driven from their dwellings; but ſcarcely had they taken poſſeſſion of their ill-gotten wealth, when not only that, but the remains of their other property were wrenched from them. Since that we have ſeen decree upon decree launched forth againſt the rich: their account books have been ſubmitted to public examination; they have been obliged to give drafts for the funds they poſſeſſed even in foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; all their letters have been intercepted and read. How many hundreds of them have we ſeen led to the ſcaffold, merely becauſe they were proprietors of what their ſovereign ſtood in need of! theſe were acts of unexampled tyranny; but, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the perſons who applauded the ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of the eſtates of the church, they were perfectly juſt. Several of theſe avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purchaſers have been murdered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walls of thoſe buildings, whence they had aſſiſted to drive the lawful proprietors: this was juſt: it was the meaſure they had meted to others. They ſhared the fate of the injured clergy, without ſharing the pity which that fate excited. When dragged
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030205_0184_0FE513CB8BD64218"/>
forth to ſlaughter in their turn, they were left without even the right of complaining: the laſt ſtab of the aſſaſſin was accompanied with the cutting reflection, that it was juſt.</p>
            <p>I have dwelt the longer on this ſubject, as it is, perhaps, the moſt ſtriking and moſt awful example of the conſequences of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of property, that the world ever ſaw. Let it ſerve to warn all thoſe who wiſh to raiſe their fortunes on the ruin of others, that, ſooner or later, their own turn muſt come. From this act of the Conſtituent Aſſembly we may date the violation, in France, of every right that men ought to hold dear. Hence the ſeizure of all gold and ſilver as the property of the nation: hence the law preventing the ſon to claim the wealth of his father: hence the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tyranny of requiſitions; and hence thouſands and thouſands of the murders, that have diſgraced unhappy France.</p>
            <p>Since the ſeizure of the church-eſtates, there has not, in fact, been any ſuch thing as private property in France; for, though the Conſtituent Aſſembly did not paſs a decree of this import, they knew perfectly well how to paſs decrees and eſtabliſh regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations amounting to the ſame thing. Some of their enormous contributions on the rich, were called <hi>patriotic gifts;</hi> but he who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pay the <hi>gift</hi> inſerted in the liſt, knew
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030205_0185_0FE4FDA48FE5AFD8"/>
he had but a few hours to live. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and jewels, depoſited at the bar of the Aſſembly and on the altar of the country, amounted to immenſe ſums. Theſe were held out as a proof of a general approbation of their meaſures; but had the Aſſembly been candid, they would have confeſſed, that theſe offerings were the pure effect of fear, of a panic that had ſeized all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors in the nation, and that each giver's hatred to their cauſe might be meaſured by the ſum he depoſited. It was not a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful free-will offering, but a ſacrifice, that the trembling wretch came to offer at the ſhrine of tyranny, in order to ſave his houſe from the flames, or his own head, or that of ſome dear relation or parent, from the ſcaffold. Could a man, reduced to acts like this, be ſaid to <hi>poſſeſs</hi> any thing?</p>
            <p>The ſucceſſors of the Conſtituent Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly laid aſide the maſk, as no longer neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. On the 13th of March, 1794, all the Merchants of Bourdeaux (known for one of the moſt infamouſly patriotic towns in the kingdom) were arreſted in one day, and condemned, in preſence of the guillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, to a fine of <hi>one hundred millions</hi> of French livres, upwards of <hi>four millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> On the 18th of April, the rich Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, La Bord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of his riches confiſcated. On the 10th of May, twenty ſeven rich Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-General were executed, becauſe they had amaſſed riches under the monarchy. Finally, on the 27th of June, all property, of whatever deſcription, was decreed <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the nation,</hi> and was put in a ſtate of requiſition accordingly, as the <hi>perſons</hi> of the whole of the inhabitants had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The milk-and-water admirers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Aſſembly pretend to be ſhocked at theſe meaſures; but, what are theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more than an improvement on thoſe of that Aſſembly? The progreſs was not only natural, but even neceſſary to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the revolution. Had there been ſtill church-eſtates to ſeize, und monks to murder, it is probable, that the tyrants, who have ſucceeded the Conſtituent Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, would not have ſurpaſſed their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; but, that ſource being exhauſted, they were obliged to find out others, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to order and obedience. And, I ſhould be glad to know, if the property of one individual, or one ſociety, was become the property of the ſovereign people by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a decree of one Aſſembly, why the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> claim ſhould not be made to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of other individuals, or other ſocieties. Nor can I believe, whatever Atheiſts and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030205_0187_0FE5144FDF04CFA8"/>
Deiſts may ſay to the contrary, that it was any more unjuſt to guillotine Bankers and Merchants, or even <hi>members of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Aſſembly,</hi> than to guillotine or maſſacre poor, defenceleſs, friendleſs Prieſts. There is ſuch an intimate connection between the ſecurity of property, and that of the perſon to whom that property belongs, that one can never be ſaid to be ſafe, while the other is in danger. Tyrant princes, tyrant aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, or tyrant mobs, when once they are ſuffered to take away with impunity the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the innocent man, will feel little ſcruple at taking away his life alſo. Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and murder are the natural auxiliaries of each other, and, with a people rendered ferocious and hardened by an infidel ſyſtem that removes all fear of an hereafter, they muſt for ever be inſeparable.</p>
            <p>Before the decree was paſſed for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the eſtates of the regular clergy, every calumny that falſhood could invent, and every vexation that Tyranny could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, were employed to debaſe the whole body of the clergy and the religion they taught. Songs and caricatures were ſung, or hawked about, by ſhameleſs ſtrumpets in the pay of the Aſſembly. In theſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the clerical functions and the lives of the clergy were ridiculed, but even the life of

Jeſus Chriſt and the Virgin Mary. The <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our Saviour became the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>farce,</hi> in the ſmutty language of Pariſian fiſh-women. Who were the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in this farce, I leave the ſhuddering reader to conceive.</p>
            <p>A decree, in form of an <hi>invitation,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">"Invitations from ſuperiors," ſays ſome one, "favour ſtrongly of commands." This was ſo much the caſe in the preſent inſtance, that the prieſt who dared to diſobey, was ſure to expiate his diſobedience with his life. The magiſtrates often entered the church and ſeized the chalices on the altar, during the celebration of the maſs. Such are revolutionary <hi>invitations.</hi>
               </note> was iſſued, for bringing the gold and ſilver from the churches to the mint. It was well known, that there were none of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in the churches, except the vaſes, the crucifixes, and other ſymbols, hitherto held ſacred. What an effect the coining up of theſe muſt have on the minds of the giddy multitude, is not difficult to imagine. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, however, even of the moſt depraved, felt a momentary horror; but this horror the Aſſembly knew how to do away. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, I might ſay thouſands, of abandoned ſcriblers were employed to propagate the new principles. Their little filthy ditties were ſpread through all the departments, <hi>at the expence of the nation.</hi> Some of theſe
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030205_0189_0FE5143C726605F8"/>
were catechiſms in rhyme, in which the Conſtitution was ſubſtituted for God, the Aſſembly for the ſaints, and both recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the adoration of the French pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots. The journal, or Letter, as it was called, of <hi>Pere du Chêne,</hi> written by one Hebert, and of which it is ſaid fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand copies were ſtruck off daily, was ſent into the towns and villages by the carriers of the decrees of the Aſſembly. This He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, whoſe Strumpet has ſince been ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Paris, as the Goddeſs of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> was a profeſſed atheiſt. His journal contained the moſt outrageous abuſe of all that was reſpectable and ſacred, interlarded with oaths and execrations without number. I have one now before me, which has for ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: <q>Lettre du veritable Pere du Chêne, bougrement patriotic.</q> in Engliſh: <q>Letter of the true Father du Chêne b—gerly patriotic;</q> I would here inſert an extract from this letter; but, I truſt I ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, when I ſay, the contents are fully anſwerable to the title. Such were the agents of Condorcet and his colleagues: thus did they corrupt the morals of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; thus did they lead them from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of vice to another; thus were they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened up to rob and to murder; and thus
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030205_0190_0FE513DBB3006198"/>
did the boaſted Conſtituent Aſſembly lay the foundation of all thoſe horrors we have ſince heard of.</p>
            <p>The magiſtrates in the different munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, choſen from the ſcum of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſtributed theſe infernal writings among the people in their precincts, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly among the young people. If, by chance, ſome magiſtrate was found, too ſcrupulous to execute their will, means were ſoon invented to get rid of him. Some pretext or other was never wanting to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the mob to put an end to him and his reſiſtance. Chatel, Mayor of St. Denys was one of this deſcription. The mob were told that this man was the cauſe of the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of bread. They flew to his houſe, and obliged him to reduce the price accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their will; though it was well known, that he had not the power to reduce it at all unleſs at his own expence. The rabble were diſperſing; but they had not fulfilled the bloody wiſhes of the revolutionary agents, who had nothing leſs in view than the lowering of the price of bread. They were inſtigated to return to the unfortunate magiſtrates. Firſt, they attempted to hang him; but, wearied with his reſiſtance, one of them took out his knife, and cut his head partly off, while ſeveral others prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with their bayonets. The unhappy
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030205_0191_0FE5143E4F5AF050"/>
victim was ſtill alive after the back of his neck was cut aſſunder, and was heard to groan out: <q>for heaven's ſake kill me! kill me! you make me ſuffer too long!</q>—The ſanguinary villain, who had begun to cut his head off, now threw away his knife, and borrowed that of his comrade, with which he finiſhed the work. When he found that his own knife was not ſufficient, he ſaid, with a cool indifference: <q>lend me your knife, for mine is not worth a curſe.</q> That which was lent him was a little two-penny knife with a wooden handle.—During this time, other aſſaſſins gave him ſeveral ſtabs, with their knives, in the belly and ſtomach; one of them turned his knife ſlowly in the flank of the dying man, and ſaid to him, laughing: <q>Does that enter well? Don't you find the day-light peep into you?</q>—He at laſt expired, after the moſt inconceivable torments. His body was dragged along the ſtreets of St. Denys with his head tied to his feet.—A reſolution of the town has ſince declared him innocent of any offence whatever: he had given abundant aſſiſtance to the poor the winter before: the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had juſt made in the price of bread was at his own expence; and this barbarous puniſhment was his recompence. His wife went diſtracted, and has ever ſince been in a mad-houſe. His aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Examples of this kind, and ſuch were wanting in very few parts of the country, could not fail to inſure an implicit obedience on the part of the magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>The debaſement of religion was nearly completed by the public ſale of the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed churches and monaſteries. The groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt indecency preſided at all theſe demoniac ſcenes. When the vile agent of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, hammer in hand, had exhauſted his auctioneer rhetoric, in recommending a church as an excellent barn, ſtable, or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, it was knocked down to the baſe and avaricious ſpeculator, while the hireling mob ſhouted applauſe. The church of St. Aldegonde at St. Omers (I love to cite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) the higheſt in that ancient town, and for hundreds of years the pride of its inhabitants, was ſold to a <hi>Jew</hi> of Dunkirk, for the pitiful ſum of 20,000 French livres in aſſignats, not more than 200 pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; not half the coſt of one of the pillars. This beautiful edifice by the ſpire of which the town was known at a great diſtance, had been choſen for deſtruction, that the humiliation of religion might be the more ſtriking. It met with ſuch treatment as
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030205_0193_0FE5143FD7413F40"/>
might be expected from the hands of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel. Its lofty ſpire was tumbled to the earth in leſs than a month: the body of the church was turned into a ropewalk, and the <hi>Jew</hi> proprietor, to complete the degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity, left a repreſentation of the Lord's Supper uneffaced in the chancel. What muſt be the grief, what the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thinking and pious part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of St. Omers, thus to ſee their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite church, the ſanctuary of their God, and the God of their fathers, delivered, for a bundle of depreciated paper-money, into the hands of a deſcendant of the murderers of him, to whoſe worſhip it was conſecrated!</p>
            <p>To give the reader a juſt idea of the ribaldry of the ſcenes of brutal impiety, exhibited at the pillage of the convents, is totally impoſſible. A dozen or two of carts rattling along with a commiſſary at their head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llowed by an eſcort of ragamuffins, decorated with a bit of three coloured ribbon, and armed with hammers, axes, crow-bars and ſpades, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally formed the corps for ſuch an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Hardly were the doors opened when the vaults rang with their hammering and their oaths. In a few hours the whole was gutted. The decorations of the altar, the prieſt's veſtments, ſtatues, pictures, books, manuſcripts, the moſt precious pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of antiquity, the productions of long and
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030205_0194_0FE513DEC5C93B50"/>
laborious lives of ſtudy, were hauled away as ſo much rubbiſh. The paintings on the doors, walls, ceilings, and other fixtures, were effaced or disfigured; the fury of the <hi>enlightened</hi> ruffians deſcended even to the graves of the deceaſed fathers.</p>
            <p>At the expulſion of the nuns, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the revolutioniſts, was, if poſſible, ſtill more ſwiniſh and cruel. While the gibing commiſſary pulled aſide their veils to examine their faces, his blackguard at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants congratulated them on the <hi>pleaſures</hi> they were going to enjoy in the world, and this in a language calculated to raiſe a bluſh on the cheek of a common ſtreet-walker. They ſeemed to enjoy their tears, and even to make ſome ſacrifices to augment them. Had any one a piece of needle-work which ſhe wiſhed to preſerve, it was rent to pieces before her face. A ſinging bird that had the misfortune to have been the companion of the ſolitary hours of its miſtreſs, was ſure to be taken from her and killed. To theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and defenceleſs females, every inſult and indignity was offered, not forgetting the laſt of which beaſtly libertines can be guilty.</p>
            <p>In a country where the crucifix was ſent to the mint, where churches were put up at auction; where the half-worn caſſock, the ſurplice, and the veil, made part of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortment of a dealer in old-cloths, and were
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:030205_0195_0FE51442A9DC3B78"/>
expoſed to public ſale on the market-place; where the miniſters of the goſpel were ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at, reviled, and frequently murdered with as little ceremony as one would kill a dog; where the moſt daring blaſphemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s were uttered and publiſhed and ſpread through the country, not only with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of its governors, but by their direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in a country where all this was prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, religion could not be of long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Religion, and even the Catholic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, did, however, ſtill ſubſiſt in France, at leaſt, in <hi>form.</hi> The Aſſembly had as yet paſſed no poſitive decree for its abolition. They had robbed the church, had ſtripped its altars, and degraded its miniſters; but ſtill the moſt pious and active of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were left in the exerciſe of their functions. The parochial clergy, though deprived of the tithes, had a ſtipend allowed them. They yet remained with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, many of whom, indeed nearly all the elderly and ſober part of them, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as firmly attached to their paſtors, as at any former period.</p>
            <p>Things were not ſuffered to remain long in this ſtate. The Conſtituent Aſſembly well knew, that they and religion could never exiſt for any length of time in the ſame country. The parochial clergy were
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030205_0196_0FE514CD873DDDD8"/>
men of talents and induſtry. They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally decided all the little diſputes between their pariſhioners; to which amicable capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they often joined that of phyſician or ſurgeon; and theſe their beneficent ſervices were always rendered without fee or reward. Even the atheiſts and deiſts themſelves had repeatedly acknowledged their virtuous modeſty, and the great utility they were of to the community at large. Such a body of men, immoveably attached to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they taught, was truly formidable to the new tyrants. Religion had received a ſevere blow; but, if theſe men retained their cures, it might recover. Nay, what was ſtill more dreadful, the monarchy it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might recover along with it; and it is not difficult to conceive, how an idea like this muſt haunt the minds of the pupils of the ſavage and impious Diderot, who hoped to ſee <q>the laſt of kings ſtrangled with the guts of the laſt of prieſts.</q> In ſhort, the parochial clergy, were the only men on earth they had now to fear, and theſe they got rid of by a ſtratagem worthy of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the leaders of which joined to the moſt hardened wickedneſs, the profoundeſt diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>They laid aſide the <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the famous conſtitution, from which they took the adjunct to their name,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030205_0197_0FE5148FE2CF6C38"/>
and which we have ſince ſeen burnt by the hands of the common hangman (or rather common guillotiner) in that very city of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, where it had been iſſued amidſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes and even adorations of the populace. They laid aſide the diſcuſſion of this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſhort-lived and ridiculous memory, to draw up another, which they were pleaſed to call, "the Civil Conſtitution of the Clergy." They were conſtitution mad, abſolutely frantic.</p>
            <p>It might be ſufficient to ſay of this latter conſtitution, that it was juſt as ſubverſive of religion as their other conſtitution was of every principle of government and ſound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. They knew it to be in direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the very nature of the catholic reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: yet they had the aſſurance to tell the people, that it was not; they even went ſo far as to proteſt, that they would live and die in the religion of their forefathers, at the very moment when they were taking the ſureſt meaſure in the world for deſtroying it. They were led to this hypocritical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration from a fear that the body of the people were not yet ripe for a total abolition of religion, and, as we ſhall ſee in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, this fear was not entirely unfounded. By perſuading the people, that nothing was intended againſt their faith, they had an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional handle againſt the clergy, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030205_0198_0FE4FDC1CEE32458"/>
them as unfriendly to their "Civil Conſtitution," merely becauſe it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ſupport of the <hi>Rights of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This inſtrument did not, however, paſs into a law, without conſiderable reſiſtance. There were yet ſome honeſt and virtuous men even among the members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Aſſembly. Theſe had remained with them, not to aid in overturning the government, and effecting the dreadful revolution that has ſince rendered the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a ſlaughter-houſe, but to oppoſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive meaſures of the philoſophers, and, if poſſible ſave the ſinking ſtate. At the head of theſe was the learned and eloquent Abbé Maury. He oppoſed this "Civil Conſtitution," with all the powers of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and all the charms of eloquence: but it was caſting pearls before ſwine. When was an atheiſt open to conviction. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſſed, and was ſoon after followed by another, obliging the clergy to ſwear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and maintain the "Civil Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." This oath they could not take without breaking that which they had taken at entering into the prieſthood; and that the Aſſembly had every reaſon to ſuppoſe they would not do. Whether they did or not, however, the end of their tyrants was anſwered: if they refuſed, they were to be driven from their livings; if they complied,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030205_0199_0FE5149217741EB0"/>
they muſt be looked upon as apoſtates, and be deſerted by all thoſe who were ſtill attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. In either caſe the tottering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of religion muſt come to the ground. The clergy, and indeed the whole nation, and all Europe, ſaw the real object of this inhuman and impious decree; but the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, ſurrounded with their <hi>enlightened</hi> myrmidons, the Pariſian mob, bid defiance to earth and heaven.</p>
            <p>Generally ſpeaking, the clergy were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to take the oath. <q>Loſe no time, ſaid the Abbé Maury, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of your challenge. By ſhedding our blood you may ingratiate yourſelves with your conſtituents. Loſe, then, not a ſingle moment. Your victims are here; they are ready. To their torments add not that of ſuſpence. Why not vote at once for our execution, glut your hatred, and quench for a little your thirſt for blood? Haſten, I ſay, while the power is in your hands; for remember, I now foretell, <hi>your reign will be of ſhort durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This prophetic addreſs, which we have ſeen ſo fully verified, ſerved only to inflame. Eight days only were given the clergy to determine on compliance or refuſal, during which no ſtratagem that baſe and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030205_0200_0FE4FDC9D50EAFA0"/>
tyranny could deviſe, was left uneſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to intimidate them. This was ever their practice, when they had an important blow to ſtrike. Rochefoucauld, formerly a duke, declared, at the time the decree for the ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of the monaſteries was under delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <q>the lives of the biſhops and prieſts, in the Aſſembly, depended upon the paſſing of it;</q> and, in order to ſilence all thoſe who oppoſed it, a liſt of their names was ſtuck up on the walls, with a promiſe of a reward of <q>
                  <hi>twelve hundred livres</hi> to any patriot, who would aſſaſſinate them.</q> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this laudable cuſtom, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of French liberty, when the day for taking the oath, or, as it was well termed, "the for-ſwearing day" arrived, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly took care to call in the aid of the fiſh-women and mob. <q>To the lamp-poſt with the non-juring biſhops and prieſts!</q> was echoed from the ſtreets and the galleries. The ruffians were prepared for murder, and were howling for their prey, like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wolves round a ſheep-fold.</p>
            <p>Let the reader imagine himſelf in the ſituation of one of theſe unfortunate cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen: an oath of apoſtacy before him, and a halter behind his back, and then let him give me his opinion of the <hi>rights of man.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="201" facs="unknown:030205_0201_0FE51493AAAE7F98"/>This did not intimidate the clergy, only thirty of whom could be prevailed on to ſubmit, and theſe were already known to have abandoned their religion. When the oath was tendered to the biſhop of Agen: <q>Gentlemen, ſays he, I lament not the loſs of my fortune; but there is another loſs which I ſhould ever lament; the loſs of your eſteem and my faith. I could not fail to loſe both, if I took the oath now propoſed to me.</q> The old biſhop of Poitiers, fearing he might loſe ſo fair an opportunity of bearing teſtimony of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, advanced to the tribune, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the preſident to command ſilence; <q>Gentlemen, ſaid he, I am ſeventy years old; I have been thirty years a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: I will never diſgrace my gray hairs by an oath of apoſtacy.</q> Upon this manly declaration of the reverend old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, the clergy roſe from their ſeats, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his example, and told the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly he had expreſſed their unanimous ſentiments.</p>
            <p>Not being a Roman Catholic, I hope I ſhall be excuſed, when I freely declare, that I much queſtion, whether the miniſters of any proteſtant communion, in a moment ſo terrible, ſurrounded with aſſaſſins and without a ſingle friend, would have ſhown ſuch a noble intrepidity. <q>They have

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Prieſtley (Faſt Sermon of 1794, page 46.) ſays: <q>When I was myſelf in France in 1774, I ſaw ſufficient reaſon to believe, that <hi>hardly any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of eminence,</hi> in <hi>church</hi> or ſtate, and eſpecially in the leaſt degree eminent in <hi>philoſophy,</hi> or literature, was a believer in chriſtianity; and no perſon will ſuppoſe, that there has been any change in favour of chriſtianity <hi>in the laſt twenty years</hi>
                  </q>—The Doctor will allow, I ſuppoſe, that biſhops are <q>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>eminence</hi> in the <hi>church;</hi>
                  </q> if he does, it will appear that he knew but very little of thoſe of the French church, and that he formed a very raſh opinion (to ſay the beſt of it) concerning their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in chriſtianity; for, of <hi>one hundred and thirty eight</hi> biſhops, only four, namely, Taillerand, Brienne, Jarante, and Gobet, took the oath of apoſtacy. But, he will ſay: I meant, <q>thoſe <hi>eminent</hi> in <hi>philoſophy</hi> and literature.</q> Ah! eminent in <hi>philoſophy!</hi> here he is right. No, no; not one of the <hi>philoſophical divines</hi> believed in chriſtianity; they looked upon Chriſt, as the Unitarians do; that is, as a ſort of "teacher:" but, to the honour of the French bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, there were but four of theſe philoſophers amongſt them. As to the other <hi>hundred and thirty,</hi> if they have not given a proof of their belief, I ſhould be glad to know from the Doctor, what proof he will pleaſe to be ſatisfied with.—Their refuſal to take the oath could be dictated by nothing but their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in chriſtianity, and their determination not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour it. Had not this been the caſe, they would have taken the oath, and preſerved their fortunes. They were in a country were the mob do not, like thoſe of Birmingham, content themſelves with the execution of an <hi>effigy;</hi> they execute the perſon. Yet they remained at their poſt: they did not <hi>decamp in diſguiſe.</hi> Even if they eſcaped the knives of the cut-throats, they knew that poverty, beggary, a linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exiſtence, muſt be the price of their refuſal. They could not <hi>bring an action againſt the city of Paris:</hi> no <hi>damages</hi> are granted by a jury in that country. They could not <hi>preach and prate againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with impunity? they could not <hi>transfer their property,</hi> and <hi>emigrate in open day.</hi> There are ſuch things as national guards, municipalities, paſſports, halters, daggers, knives, drowning-boats, and <hi>the rights of man,</hi> in France. We have ſince ſeen ſeveral of theſe biſhops, or men "of eminence in the church," refuſe with the bloody poignard at their breaſts, to take this oath. Would they have done this, had they been what Doctor Prieſtley has repreſented them to be? would they have done this, had they been atheiſts, or deiſts? nay, would they have done this, had they been <hi>Unitarians!</hi> If we are to judge from the conduct of the Doctor, they would not.—I will not take upon me to ſay, that the philoſophical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical divine meant to propagate an attrocious calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by this ſermon of his: I ſhall only obſerve, that the ſermon was preached long after the French biſhops had given theſe undeniable proofs of their faith and ſincerity.</note> And, if this was
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030205_0203_0FE514A0932AB530"/>
the caſe, what had the Aſſembly done? If, to <hi>preſerve honour,</hi> it was neceſſary to refuſe an obedience to their decrees, what ſort of decrees muſt thoſe be?</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly were diſconcerted by this firm reſiſtance on the part of the clergy? they knew the clergy in general would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take the oath, but they did not imagine
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030205_0204_0FE4FE71F9D66968"/>
that thoſe amongſt themſelves, would, amidſt the vociferations of their cannibals, have the courage to give ſuch a poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. For a moment they felt abaſhed; but they were gone too far to think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating. The apoſtate Abbé Gregoire, whom we have ſince ſeen amongſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizers of a pagan feſtival, was, on this occaſion choſen to convince the clergy, that the oath might be taken, without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their faith. After this, in order to deprive the clergy of an opportunity of defending their opinions in oppoſition to the oath, they were ordered to advance and take it at once. This decree had no effect: not a man advanced. Now the matter was brought to a point: the decree for enforcing the oath muſt be repealed, or the clergy muſt be driven from their livings, and thoſe in the Aſſembly from their feats. It is hardly neceſſary to ſay that the latter was adopted: one tyrannical meaſure is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and inevitable conſequence of another.</p>
            <p>A decree was now paſſed for the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the non-juring biſhops and prieſts, and for the chooſing of others in their ſtead. From this day, it may be ſaid, there was no ſuch thing as an eſtabliſhed religion in France. The ax had long been laid to the root of the tree; it was ready to fall, and this ſtroke levelled it with the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="unknown:030205_0205_0FE514A262C7B3A8"/>Had the diſpute been about this or that tenet; had the oath been impoſed with an intention of exchanging one religion for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the caſe would have been different; the expulſion might have taken place without any very conſiderable injury to the morals of the people. But, the ſtruggle was that of religion againſt irreligion, that of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity againſt atheiſm.</p>
            <p>It was (I hope it is ſo no longer) the opinion of Doctor Prieſtley, and many other <hi>philoſophical divines,</hi> that <hi>any change what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> was preferable to the continuation of the catholic religion in France. There is a paſſage in Moore's journal, which contains ſo complete an anſwer to every thing theſe gentlemen have advanced on this ſubject, that I am ſurpriſed, conſidering the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the journaliſt and his companion Lauderdale, that it ever found a place in that volume.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, being at Abbeville, met with a proteſtant clergyman, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated on the deliverance of himſelf and his brethren, from the vexation of Romiſh perſecution. The clergyman ſeemed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that along with the ſpirit of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that of religion daily diminiſhed. <q>Upon which, ſays the Doctor, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that, as nothing could be more oppoſite to true religion than a ſpirit of
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030205_0206_0FE4FE77E29AE6E8"/>
perſecution, the former, it was to be hoped, would return without the latter; but, in the mean time, the proteſtants were happy in not only being tolerated in the exerciſe of their religion, but alſo on being rendered capable of enjoying every privilege and advantage which the catholics themſelves enjoy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We are not allowed thoſe advantages, reſumed the clergyman, from any regard they bear to our religion, but from a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal indifference of their own.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Whatever may be the caſe, replied I, the effect is the ſame with regard to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No, ſaid he, the effect might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only with reſpect to us, but to all France; for the ſpirit of perſecution might have diſappeared, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference for all religion coming in its place: and in that caſe there would have been more probability of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion gaining ground; for it is eaſier to draw men from an erroneous doctrine to a true one, than to impreſs the truths of religion on minds which deſpiſe all religion whatever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But, although you may not be able to make converts of them, I replied, ſtill you may live happy among them, in the quiet poſſeſſion of your own religion and all your other advantages.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="unknown:030205_0207_0FE514A3EDA6A928"/>
               <q>I doubt it much, reſumed he; being perſuaded that, in a country where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſentiments are effaced from the minds of the bulk of the people, crimes of the deepeſt guilt will prevail in ſpite of all the reſtraints of law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How fully, alas! has the opinion of this good clergyman been confirmed! here we ſee a man living upon the ſpot, a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a proteſtant, lamenting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the catholic religion, and trembling for the conſequences. This man plainly perceived the drift of the philoſophical le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators: he ſaw that the deſtruction of all religion was their object, while they pretended to be correcting its abuſes. Very far was he from ſaying, with our zealous reformers, that <q>any change was preferable to the continuation of popery,</q> and yet, I think, we ought to allow him to be as much intereſted in a change, and as good a judge of its conveniences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, as perſons on this ſide the ſea; except, indeed, that he might not be <hi>enlightened</hi> by the rays of modern philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Some of the French proteſtants, however, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed widely from this good man. The Calviniſts of Nimes began maſſacreing the Catholics at an early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the revolution, under the pretext that they were <hi>ariſtocrats.</hi> About ſix hundred perſons, of both ſexes and of all ages, were butchered in their houſes, in the ſtreets and public ſquares, before they could even ſuſpect their danger. Theſe monſters attacked the convent of the Capuchins, forced it open, and purſued the venerable fathers to their dormitories and ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>. Five of them were left weltering in their blood at the altar's foot. One of theſe a very old man, craved five minutes while he committed his ſoul to God. The cool and deliberate villains granted his requeſt. The intended butcher held a piſtol in one hand and a watch in the other, and, when the five minutes were expired, ſhot him through the head. <hi>See Hiſt. of the French Clergy, page</hi> 71. <hi>French edition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This fact fully proves, that proteſtants can be as cruel as catholics. Let us not, then, imagine that we are ſecure from events of this kind, merely becauſe the catholic religion is not eſtabliſhed here. It was not a zeal for the Calviniſtical religion that led the proteſtants of Nimes to commit theſe acts of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: their knives were pointed, not againſt catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, as ſuch, but as <hi>ariſtocrats.</hi>

The pariſh prieſts ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally followed the example of their biſhops in refuſing to take the oath. Others were, of courſe, appointed to replace them. <hi>Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerand Perigorde,</hi> whom we have ſeen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the aſſumption of the church-eſtates, was now become a ſort of Pope to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern church, and was buſily employed, laying <hi>unholy hands</hi> on the heads of the new biſhops. <hi>Gobet,</hi> one of the four bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030205_0209_0FE514A6AA36B788"/>
who had forſworn themſelves, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for his apoſtacy by the biſhoprick of Paris. Vagabond philoſophical abbés, who had never been able to obtain admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the prieſthood under the old government, were now not only accepted, but ſought after. To theſe were added the ſecular prieſts and monks who had apoſtatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Even the wretches who had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed from their cures, or orders, for irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or criminal conduct, were now called in from Germany and the low-countries. What a fight muſt it be, to thoſe who yet preſerved ſome reſpect for their religion and their country, to ſee theſe ſtrollers, with their ſtrumpets at their heels, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take on them the care of the morals and fouls of a numerous people! after all, the number of apoſtates was inſufficient: a great many pariſhes remained without any prieſt at all.</p>
            <p>The inſtallment of the new prieſts was commonly, not to ſay always, attended with tumult and violence. Many of their predeceſſors were knocked down, ſtabbed, or ſhot, at their church doors, the day, or day after, they had refuſed to conform. The prieſt of the village of Spet-Saux, while he was explaining to his pariſhioners his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for refuſing to take the oath, received

            <p>Where there was no reſiſtance but on the part of the prieſt, an aſſaſſination put an end to the ſtruggle; but, in ſome places, the reſiſtance was more general. The pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners were divided; one part the champions of the apoſtate, and the other, thoſe of the old prieſt. Church time was the moment for deciding theſe diſputes, and the Church-yard the field of action. Theſe affrays were often bloody; victory ſometimes leaned to the ſide of juſtice; but, as the apoſtate appeared in perſon at the head of his troops, as he had the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally on his ſide, and always the mob and municipal officers, with their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional guards, he ſeldom failed to keep the field. Some of theſe wretches have been ſeen conducted to the altar to the ſound of drums and trumpets, at the very moment when their partizans were murdering on the outſide of the church.</p>
            <p>The expelling of the parochial clergy tried the real ſentiments of the body of the French people more than any one act of their tyrants ever did, before or ſince. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, the trial was honourable to them; for, if we except Paris, and ſome other places immediately under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the revolutionary clubs, they wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030205_0211_0FE514AF12150B28"/>
to retain their ancient paſtors, and did not ſcruple to declare that wiſh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the vociferations of hundreds of mob in the pay of the Aſſembly; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe petty aſſemblies of ſubaltern tyrants, called municipal officers, who came to order them to receive an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, <hi>in the name of the law;</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thouſands of ſpies and aſſaſſins, ever ready to betray and murder them; in ſpite of all theſe, whole pariſhes flocked round their prieſts, preſſed them to continue, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to the fields, and left the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates to ſay maſs to the bare walls. Many of the latter, though they continued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the revolutionary ſalary for upwards of two years, never could boaſt of above three or four voluntary hearers.</p>
            <p>Wherever this obſtinate attachment to religion appeared, the Aſſembly knew how to make the refractory feel their authority. True tyrants, they ſuffered no one to thwart their will with impunity. Property, honour, conſcience, all muſt yield to their ſultanic decrees!</p>
            <p>Condorcet, the atheiſt Condorcet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed flagellation; and this was pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly inflicted on the women and children who aſſiſted at the maſſes of the non-juring clergy. The Abbé Barruel (page 79 of the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030205_0212_0FE4FE7F1BD53A98"/>
French edition) tells us, that three ſiſters of one of the Charity-houſes at Paris, expired under the rods of the aſſaſſins. Ungrateful monſters! the lives of theſe women had been totally devoted to the ſervice of the ſick, the lame and the blind. By their vow they were excluded from the pleaſures of the world, without being excluded from its pains. They had made a voluntary ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all they poſſeſſed, had aſſumed the garb, and ſubmitted to the auſterities of the monaſtic life, in order to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the mournful occupation of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>poor</hi> who laboured under infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It was ſaid, they did this to ſecure themſelves, a place in heaven; and moſt certainly they took the ſureſt way. I feel a reluctance to call ſuch people <hi>ſuperſtitious;</hi> for, if they were ſo, their ſuperſtition was of a moſt amiable kind, and ſurely nothing ſhort of the principles of this helliſh revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could have hardened the hearts of men to ſcourge them to death, and that merely becauſe they would not diſgrace themſelves by receiving the ſacrament from the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated hands of an apoſtate.</p>
            <p>It were endleſs to enumerate all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts of perſecution exerciſed againſt thoſe who remained attached to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Little children were beaten half to death; the hair and ears of women were
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030205_0213_0FE514B0DC89B9A0"/>
cut off; they were mounted on aſſes, and led about in the moſt unſeemly and ſhocking guiſe. The inſtance of John Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabel deſerves particular notice. Cantabel was an honeſt peaſant, ſincerely attached to the religion of his fathers. He happened to have a little catechiſm which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the non-juring clergy; it was found in his houſe; and this was a ſufficient crime. A committee of municipal officers ordered the catechiſm to be burnt; a great fire was made; Cantabel was brought forth, and commanded to throw the book into it. "No," ſays the heroic peaſant, <q>it contains the principles of my religion; it has been my guide and my comfort, and it now gives me the courage to tell you, that I will never commit it to the flames.</q> Upon this he was threatened, but ſtill he remained reſolute. One of the ruffians ſeized a flaming torch, and held it under his hand. "Burn on," ſaid he, <q>you may burn not only my hand, but my whole body, before I will do any thing to diſhonour my religion.</q> He was afterwards mounted on a horſe, his back to the head, and the tail in his hand, and was thus conducted about amidſt the ſhouts of the rabble. The vile wretches, when tired with their ſport, ſuffered him to creep home, more dead than alive.—This is the <hi>liberty of
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030205_0214_0FE514519D9CA488"/>
conſcience</hi> in the <hi>"Age of Reaſon.!"</hi> This is the <hi>toleration</hi> we might expect from atheiſts, from theſe infidel philoſophers, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exclaiming againſt the prejudices of their forefathers, and againſt the ſad effects of bigotry and religious zeal. In the cant of theſe <hi>enlightened</hi> reformers, this peaſant was a <hi>fanatic,</hi> an <hi>ariſtocrat,</hi> a <hi>rebel to the law,</hi> and, as ſuch, they will tell you that he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the partial oppoſition the apoſtates met with, and the horror their conduct, as well as their miniſtry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in all good minds, they, at laſt, found themſelves in poſſeſſion of the churches, to the excluſion of the ancient prieſts. Such of theſe latter as had eſcaped death, were now bereft of all means of ſubſiſtence; they were therefore obliged to become a charge to their faithful pariſhioners. Had there been any ſuch things as toleration and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under the Conſtituent Aſſembly, theſe unfortunate men might ſtill have found a retreat amongſt their wealthy neighbours, that would have left them no reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the loſs of their ſalaries. But the greateſt part of their wealthy neighbours were already reduced to their own ſituation, and thoſe who were not, knew that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a non-juring prieſt would amount to a proof of <hi>ariſtocracy,</hi> ſufficient to lead
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030205_0215_0FE514B262EF3CC0"/>
them to the guillotine. The expulſed prieſts were, then, obliged to take ſhelter in ſome obſcure and miſerable cabin, and often was the terror ſo great, that, like perſons infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the plague, no one would admit them beneath his roof.</p>
            <p>From ſuch a ſtate of miſery and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſome fled in diſguiſe to the countries ſurrounding France; ſome to receſſes in the foreſts, whither the peaſants of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood brought them the means of exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Numbers, however, ſtill remained in their towns and villages. Seeing the whole country ſwarming with aſſaſſins, they thought, perhaps, they might as well wait the ſtab in their own pariſhes as to ſeek it at a diſtance. Many, too, from age and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, were abſolutely incapable of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and, beſides the ſmall remainder of a life ſo full of bitterneſs, could not, with ſuch men, be an object of ſufficient impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to induce them to abandon thoſe of their pariſhioners, who ſtill ſought their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and conſolation. Some were retained by their affection to their relations, or their parents; it is ſo hard to break the bands of nature, to tear oneſelf from all one holds dear, that the riſk of death in competition with ſuch a ſeparation, loſes half its terrors.</p>
            <p>The ancient prieſts who remained in their pariſhes, or near them, though often oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030205_0216_0FE5145326F95F08"/>
to ſecret themſelves, and though, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, generally ſhunned, were reſorted to by great numbers, particularly of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly people. I have already obſerved, that, among the youth, there was a pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bias toward the apoſtates. Hence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſuch ſcenes of diviſion and perſecution as no country on earth except France ever witneſſed. Friends were divided againſt friends; one branch of a family againſt another. It often happened that the parents treated their children as apoſtates, and the children their parents as ariſtocrats; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and bloodſhed were as often the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. We have ſeen (page 29 of <hi>this volume</hi>) a ſon cut off the heads of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, becauſe they refuſed to attend at the maſs of an apoſtate, carry the heads to his club, and receive applauſes for the deed. Acts like this were not frequent; but others very near approaching it, were not only frequent but general. Sons, and even daughters, have been known to beat and lacerate their parents in the moſt cruel manner. Hundreds of both ſexes have been led to priſon and publicly accuſed by their children. A man at Faulconberg in Artois, blew his wife's brains out with his muſket, and left her wallowing in her blood on the hearth with ſeven ſmall children cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round her!</p>

            <p>The apoſtate prieſts failed not to fan the flames of diſcord and diviſion. To ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves with the young and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, they mixed in all their amuſements and debauches, treated them at their own houſes, and inſtituted civic feſtivals for the mob, with whom they were continually ſurrounded. Their maſſes were ſung midſt the ſhouts of robbers and murderers, and
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:030205_0218_0FE51454F79ED4A0"/>
often interrupted by the arrival of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent conſcientious perſon, dragged in to aſſiſt at what he looked upon as a profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their churches reſembled guard-houſes, rather than places of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. In proportion as they perceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neglected and deſpiſed, their wrath againſt their unſhaken predeceſſors increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Vexed and humiliated to find, that all the reſpectable part of their pariſhioners took as much pains to avoid them, as to ſeek a communication with their old paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the whole weight of their vengeance fell on theſe latter. In their exiſtence itſelf they ſaw a memento of their own infamy. There is not a ſpecies of cruelty, that the moſt obdurate can deviſe, which they left uneſſayed. They hunted them from their retreats, from the houſes of their friends and relations, from the woods and caverns even, to expoſe them to inſult and murder. The infirmities of age, the tears of parents, nothing could ſoften the hearts of theſe apoſtate wretches. We have ſeen enough of the ſufferings of the old clergy in the firſt Chapter of this work; but there is yet one inſtance which I muſt quote. <q>I was at <hi>Trois Rivieres</hi> (ſays <hi>le voyageur de la Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>) a little village in Picardy. I ſaw ſeveral women running by the inn where I had put up; they all ſeemed much
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030205_0219_0FE514BDDE6AD998"/>
alarmed. I aſked the landlord what was the matter: he told me that the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary prieſt, provoked to find that none of the village attended at his maſs, had been that morning to <hi>Ville D' Eu</hi> for a party of national guards, to aid him in driving the former prieſt from a little cottage, where he and his mother had taken ſhelter. The man gave me a moſt affecting account of this good prieſt, who was upwards of fourſcore years of age, and who had been the rector of that place for more than fifty years. On the day he was to deliver his cure into the hands of the apoſtate, he ſummoned his little flock to meet him in the church for the laſt time. Not a ſoul was abſent: old or young. The women carried their infants in their arms, and two old people, not able to walk were carried on couches. <hi>My children,</hi> ſays the old man, <hi>I have preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your tender hands on the baptiſmal font: I have ſung the requiem for the ſouls of your fathers: I muſt now bid you an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal farewel, deprived of the conſolation of leaving my aſhes amongſt you.</hi>—Here he ceaſed; tears ſtifled his voice: the ſobs and cries of his audience rendered the ſcene too much for him.—While the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord was ſpeaking, we heard a diſcharge of muſkets, and a loud ſhriek of woman.
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:030205_0220_0FE5145F848DD908"/>
We ran to the ſpot. The peaſants of the village, about forty in number, had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled round the cottage with clubs to defend their paſtor; but, the enemy hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire arms, they had been obliged to give way, leaving two of their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dead and ſeveral wounded. I now beheld a fight ſufficient to melt the heart of a tyger. Two ruffians of the national guard were dragging out this venerable old man by the hair of his head, by thoſe locks as white as ſnow. He had received a wound in his cheek, from which the blood ran down on his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In this ſituation was he led off, bare headed and bare footed, towards <hi>Ville D' Eu,</hi> while his poor old parent, who had been many years blind and dumb, remained on her bed, happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the ſorrows of her ſon. As the villains pulled him along, all the words he was heard to utter, were, My Mother! Oh! My Mother!—The women and children of the village followed the eſcort with cries and lamentations, till the ſavages drove them back with the points of their bayonets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were thoſe of the laity ſpared, who reſorted to the old clergy for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the rites which they looked upon as eſſential. A new married couple hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuſed to have the ceremony perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

by one of the apoſtates, a party of his myrmidons broke in upon them, the wedding night. The huſband made his eſcape: the wife, in a ſwoon, became the prey of the party. They gratified their brutal paſſion, without gratifying their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity. They tore off her breaſts, as a tyger might have done with his claws, and threw them on the floor. They then left her to wait till death relieved her from her horrible ſituation.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>I ſhould have ſcrupled inſerting a fact like this, though taken from ſo reſpectable a work, if the former part of this volume did not contain others, if poſſible ſurpaſſing it: I ſay <hi>if poſſible;</hi> for I declare I know not which is moſt ſhocking, the tearing off a woman's breaſts, or the ripping a child from her womb, and ſticking it on the point of a bayonet. Indeed, the greateſt part of the facts related here, are ſo much more ſhocking and terrific than any thing
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030205_0222_0FE514611981ADA8"/>
we have ever before had an idea of, that common murders appear as trifling.</p>
            <p>By means like theſe, the old clergy and their adherents were extirpated, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion along with them. The buſineſs of the new clergy (if the wretches deſerve the name) was not to eſtabliſh one church on the ruins of another: it would be as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous to ſuppoſe that an Aſſembly of Atheiſts and Deiſts had any ſuch intention, as to ſuppoſe that a horde of apoſtates were calculated for the work. Theſe latter were, in fact, ſo many miſſionaries of blaſphemy and murder, ſent into the provinces pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to deſtroy the ancient prieſthood. The aſſembly foreſaw that, when that was done, their new prieſts would at any time become the apoſtles of infidelity.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed that theſe legiſlators did not want for cunning: an elegant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has lately called them "architects of ruin;" and, indeed, they poſſeſſed the art of deſtroying in its utmoſt perfection. Their calculations with reſpect to their new prieſts were extremely juſt; they came out to an unit. When they had annihilated their predeceſſors, they were not only ready to ſecond the decrees for the abolition of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity altogether; they were not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental therein, but they had led the way. Several began to teach the religion

of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the Jacobin clubs, of which they were all members, and even in the pulpit. The garb of a prieſt itſelf became a burthen to them, and they humbly aſked leave to quit it for the more honourable one of the national guard. The apoſtate biſhop of Moulin, who had been conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unhallowed hands of <hi>Tailler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> and the mitre. It was this vile wretch, who firſt cauſed to be written on the gate of the burying ground: <hi>"this is the place of everlaſting ſleep.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Three weeks after this communication of the biſhop of Moulin, <hi>Gobet,</hi> the new bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Paris, with his Grand-Vicars and three other revolutionary biſhops, came to the hall of the legiſlators and there abdicated chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity in form. They begged pardon of the injured nation for having ſo long kept them in the dark, by duping them into a belief of the divinity of an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> whoſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they now threw off with abhorrence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in future to acknowledge no other deity than <hi>Reaſon</hi> alone!</p>
            <p>It was not more than four days after this that a pagan feſtival was held in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church of Paris. A woman named Memoro, the wife of another man, but the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030205_0224_0FE514630AF1E528"/>
ſtrumpet of the vile Hebert, <hi>alias</hi> Father du Chêne, was dreſſed up as the <hi>goddeſs of Reaſon.</hi> Her throne was of green turf; an altar was erected at ſome diſtance, on which the prieſts burnt incenſe, while the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and the brutified Pariſian herd were proſtrated before the throne of the goddeſs <hi>Reaſon, alias</hi> Memoro, <hi>alias</hi> du Chêne.</p>
            <p>About this epoch appeared the paganiſh republican calendar, with a decree ordering its adoption. This was intended to root from the poor tyranized people the very memory of religion; to dry up the only ſource of comfort they had left. They had been robbed of all they poſſeſſed in this world, and their inexorable tyrants wiſhed to rob them of every hope in the next. Some ſay that this calendar itſelf was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by an apoſtate prieſt, others, that it was the work of a writer of farces, named Des Moulins. Whoever may be author, we know who has the honour of re-printing it and retailing it in this country.</p>
            <p>It is true the laſt mentioned acts, the conſummation of the moſt horrid blaſphemy that ever man was witneſs of, took place under the Convention; but, what were they more than a neceſſary conſequence of the meaſures of the Conſtituent Aſſembly? nay; the leaders in that Aſſembly boaſted,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030205_0225_0FE514C2C3FE8D70"/>
when they had obtained the decree againſt the non-juring prieſts, that they had tricked the people out of their religion, before they perceived it. Nor is there at this time one of thoſe who voted for that decree, who will not tell you, that chriſtianity is a farce, fit only for the amuſement of old folks, and that he rejoices in its abolition in France. This is not mere ſurmiſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed, that their ſucceſſors have only fulfilled their wiſhes, in this reſpect, there can be no doubt, if any judgment of the wiſhes of men is to be formed from their principles, their words and their actions. Who, I aſk, that wiſhed to preſerve religion, would have paſſed a decree for the expulſion of every prieſt that refuſed to forſwear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? who, that did not wiſh to deſtroy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, would have paſſed a decree for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to the care of apoſtates? Was it not clear, that ſuch men would ſtick at nothing? That, at the nod of their maſters, they would at any time be ready to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the God they pretended to adore? On the contrary, the Aſſembly knew, that there was no hope of their ſyſtem taking root, while the ancient clergy remained in their cures. Among men, who gave up their all, and expoſed themſelves to almoſt certain death, rather than falſify their faith, they could not hope to find a <hi>Gobet.</hi> They
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030205_0226_0FE5146493B8B4C0"/>
could not hope to find ſupple villains that would voluntarily depoſe the emblems of their religion on the altar of a ſtrumpet, and confeſs themſelves to have been the crafty miniſters of an <hi>arch impoſtor.</hi>—</p>
            <p>The oath tendered to the clergy was the touch-ſtone; it was to prove them; to know whom the Aſſembly could depend on for the accompliſhment of their projects, and whom they could not depend on. The enforcing of the oath was the laſt blow to public religion in France, and therefore the deſtruction of that religion, with all its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral and murderous conſequences, is due to the Conſtituent Aſſembly, and to them alone. It is as nonſenſical as unjuſt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this or that faction, or even the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention itſelf, of exchanging Chriſtianity for a ſyſtem of paganiſm; infidels who adore an idol are as good as infidels who adore none; and where is the difference, whether the adored idol be Jean Jacques Rouſſeau or Madame Memoro? An adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs is as good a goddeſs as an adulterer is a god at any time.</p>
            <p>Let the reader now look back, and he will eaſily trace all the horrors of the French Revolution to the decrees of the Conſtituent Aſſembly. It was they that rent the government to pieces; it was they that firſt broached the deſtructive doctrine
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030205_0227_0FE5146E8394D6F0"/>
of equality; it was they that deſtroyed all ideas of private property; and finally, it was they that rendered the people hardened, by effacing from their minds every principle of the only religion capable of keeping man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind within the bounds of juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Look alſo at their particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and you will ſee them breaking their oaths to their conſtituents and to their king; you will ſee their agents driving people from their eſtates, beating and killing them; you will ſee them ſurrounded with a ſet of hireling writers and aſſaſſins, employed to degrade and murder peaceable people at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the religion of their forefathers; and you will ſee them not only pardoning murders, in ſpite of their poor humiliated monarch, but even receiving the aſſaſſins at their bar, covering them with applauſes, and inſtituting feſtivals in their honour. What have the members of the Convention and their agents done more than this? They have murdered in greater numbers. True; but what have numbers to do with the matter? The principle on which thoſe murders were committed was ever the ſame; it was more or leſs active as occaſion requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The wants of the Convention were more preſſing than thoſe of the Conſtituent Aſſembly. The Aſſembly were not driven to the expedient of <hi>requiſitions,</hi> nor was
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030205_0228_0FE51470274690C0"/>
the hour yet arrived for the promulgation of the paganiſh calendar. Conſequently they met with leſs oppoſition, and therefore leſs murders were neceſſary; but, had they continued their fittings to this day the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation of every kind would have been the fame that it has been.</p>
            <p>The whole hiſtory of the revolution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with nothing but a regular progreſs in robbery and murder. The firſt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for inſtance, begin by flattering the mob, wheedling their king out of his title and his power; they then ſet him at defiance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe or put to death his friends; and then ſhut him up in his palace, as a wild beaſt in a cage. The ſecond Aſſembly ſend a gang of ruffians to inſult and revile him, and then they hurl him from his throne. The third Aſſembly cut his throat. What is there in all this but a regular and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural progreſſion from bad to worſe. And ſo with the reſt of their abominable actions.</p>
            <p>To throw the blame on the ſucceſſors of the firſt deſpotic Aſſembly is ſuch a perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of reaſon, ſuch an abandonment of truth, that no man, who has a ſingle grain of ſenſe, can hear of with patience. As well might we aſcribe all the murders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at Nantz to the under cut-throats, by whom they were perpetrated, and not to the Convention by whoſe order, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030205_0229_0FE4FDBEF7BADC68"/>
whoſe protection, theſe cut-throats acted. The Conſtituent Aſſembly knew the conſequences of their decrees, as well as Foucault (<hi>See page</hi> 66) knew the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his order for throwing forty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from the cliff Pierre-moine into the ſea; and it is full as ridiculous to hear them pretend, that they did not wiſh thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to follow, as it would be to hear Foucault pretend, that he did not wiſh the forty women ſhould be drowned. True, the Convention are guilty of every crime under heaven: aſſaſſins and blaſphemers muſt ever merit deteſtation and abhorrence, from whatever motive they may act, or by whomſoever taught and inſtigated; but ſtill the pre-eminence in infamy is due to their teachers and inſtigators: the Convention is, in relation to the Conſtituent Aſſembly, what the ignorant deſperate bravo is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his crafty and ſculking employer.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as I have hitherto ſpoken of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Aſſembly in a general way, to make ſome diſtinctions with reſpect to the perſons who compoſed it. I am very far from holding them all up as objects of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, or even of cenſure. There were many, very many, men of great wiſdom and virtue, who were elected to the Sates-General, and even who joined the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030205_0230_0FE514721CE92F20"/>
after it aſſumed the epithet <hi>National.</hi> It would be the height of injuſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach theſe men with the conſequences of meaſures, which they oppoſed with ſuch uncommon eloquence and courage. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will make honourable mention of their names, when the epitome I have here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted will be loſt and forgotten. Suffice it then to ſay, that the weight of our cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of the cenſure of all juſt and good men, ought to fall on thoſe licentious poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians and infidel philoſophers alone, who ſanctioned the decree for the annihilation of property and religion.</p>
            <p>Here, too, we ought to diveſt ourſelves of every thing of a perſonal or party na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and direct our abhorrence to princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alone. As to the actors, they have, in general, already expiated their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or folly by the loſs of their lives. We have ſeen the atheiſt Condorcet obliged to fly in diſguiſe from the capital, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of which he had corrupted, and by whom he had been adored as the great lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of the age: we have ſeen him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the garb and the ſupplicating tone of a common beggar, lurking in the lanes and woods, like a houſeleſs thief, and, at laſt, literally dying in a ditch, leaving his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe a prey to the fowls of the air, and his memory as a leſſon to future apoſtles of
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030205_0231_0FE514CF678445A0"/>
anarchy and blaſphemy. Scores, not to ſay hundreds, of his coadjutors have ſhared a fate little different from his own; and thoſe who have not, can have little reaſon to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late themſelves on their eſcape. The tornado they had raiſed for the deſtruction of others, has ſwept them from the ſeat of their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſcattered them over every corner of the earth. Thoſe haughty uſurpers who refuſed the precedence to the ſucceſſors of Charlemagne, are now obliged to yield it to a peaſant or a porter. They who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the "Folding-Doors of the Louvre ſhould fly open at their approach," are now glad to lift the latch of a wicket, and bend their heads beneath the thatch of a cabin. And, what language can expreſs the vexation, the anguiſh, the cutting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, that muſt be the companions of their obſcurity! When they look back on their diſtracted country, when they behold the widows, the orphans, the thouſands and hundreds of thouſands of murdered victims, that it preſents; when they behold the frantic people, carrying the dagger to the hearts of their parents, nay, digging their forefathers from their graves, and throwing their aſhes to the winds; when they behold all this, and reflect that it is the work of their own hands, well might
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030205_0232_0FE5147509A5F0B0"/>
they call on the hills to hide them. The torments of ſuch an exiſtence who can bear? Next to the wrath of heaven, the maledic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one's country is ſurely the moſt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous and inſupportable.</p>
            <p>Now, what is the advantage we ought to derive from the awful example before us?—It ought to produce in us a watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a ſteady reſolution to oppoſe the advances of diſorganizing and infidel princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I am aware that it will be ſaid by ſome, that all fear of the progreſs of theſe principles is imaginary; but, conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation aſſures me, that it is but too well founded. Let any man examine the change in political and religious opinions ſince the eſtabliſhment of the general government, and particularly the change crept in along with our ſilly admiration of the French Revolution, and ſee if the reſult of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, does not juſtify a fear of our falling under the ſcourge, that has brought a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and gallant people on their knees, and left them bleeding at every pore.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for America, Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has thrown from her the principles of the French revolutioniſts with indignation and abhorrence. This, which one would
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030205_0233_0FE514D0F4541288"/>
imagine ſhould have had little or no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on us, has ſerved, in ſome meaſure, as a guide to our opinions, and has been one of the principal motives for our actions. A combination of circumſtances, ſuch as, perhaps, never before met together, has ſo ſoured the minds of the great maſs of the people in this country, has worked up their hatred againſt Great Britain to ſuch a pitch, that the inſtant that nation is named, they loſe not only their temper but their reaſon alſo. The dictates of nature and the exerciſe of judgment are thrown aſide: whatever the Britiſh adopt muſt be rejected, and whatever they reject muſt be adopted. Hence it is, that all the execrable acts of the French legiſlators, not forgetting their murders and their blaſphemy, have met with the moſt unqualified applauſes, merely becauſe they were execrated in the iſland of Britain.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Republic</hi> has alſo done a great deal. France is a <hi>Republic,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the legiſlators were neceſſary to maintain it a Republic. This <hi>word</hi> out-weighs, in the eſtimation of ſome perſons (I wiſh I could ſay they are few in number) all the horrors that have been, and that can be, committed in that country.

            <p>Nor are men of the ſame ſtamp wanting among the native Americans. There is not a ſingle action of the French revolutioniſts, but has been juſtified and applauded in our public papers, and many of them in our public aſſemblies. Anarchy has its open advocates.

of the French. Even their calendar, the frivolous offspring of infidelity is propoſed for our imitation. Where perſons, whoſe livelihood depends on their daily publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are to be found who are ever ready to publiſh articles of this nature, it were the groſſeſt folly not to believe, that there are hundreds and thouſands to whom they give pleaſure.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a truth that no one will deny, that the News-papers of this country are become its ſcourge. I ſpeak with a few exceptions. It is ſaid that they enlighten the people; but their light is like the torch of an incendiary, and the one has the ſame deſtructive effect on mind as the other has on matter. The whole ſtudy of the editors ſeems to be to deceive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found.

that the convives were not of the moſt deſpicable claſs.

            <p>If theſe men of blood had ſucceeded in plunging us into a war; if they had once got the ſword into their hands, they would have mowed us down like ſtubble. The word <hi>ariſtocrat</hi> would have been employed to as good account here, as ever it has been in France. We might 'ere this, have ſeen our places of worſhip turned into ſtables; we might have ſeen the banks of the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, like thoſe of the Loire, covered with human carcaſes, and its waters tinged with blood: 'ere this we might have ſeen our parents butchered, and even the head of our admired and beloved Preſident rolling on a ſcaffold.</p>
            <p>I know the reader will ſtart back with horror. His heart will tell him, that it is impoſſible. But, once more, let him look at the example before us. The man who, in 1788, ſhould have predicted the fate of the laſt humane and truly patriotic Louis, would have been treated as a wretch or a

madman. The attacks on the character and conduct of the irreproachable <hi>Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> have been as bold, if not bolder, than thoſe which led to the downfall of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate French Monarch. His impudent and unprincipled enemies have repreſented him as cankered with every vice that mark a worthleſs tyrant; they have called him the betrayer of the liberties of his country, and have even drawn up and publiſhed <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of accuſation</hi> againſt him! Can it, then, be imagined, that, had they poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the power, they wanted the will to dip their hands in his blood?
