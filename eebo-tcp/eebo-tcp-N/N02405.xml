            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>TO THE</hi> Loyal Proteſtant READER.</head>
            <p>IF I had not been perſwaded that the <hi>Text,</hi> and and this ſhort <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> upon it here preſented to thee, breaths the heart and ſoul of the <hi>Churches in New-England,</hi> both <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> I ſhould not have bro't the <hi>one</hi> into the <hi>pulpit</hi> upon the preſent <hi>occaſion,</hi> nor have permitted the <hi>other</hi> to go into the <hi>preſs</hi> at the <hi>deſire</hi> of thoſe who heard it. But as I am <hi>conſcious</hi> of no motive in the choice of the Subject, but I truſt a ſincere and fervent zeal for the Religion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion</hi> in the Royal Family; ſo I am <hi>confident</hi> that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who have asked this <hi>copy</hi> of what they heard, did it on no other <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> And if it may in any meaſure help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and increaſe a dutiful and loyal affection to CHRIST, his truths and ſpiritual worſhip; and to our rightful <hi>King</hi> as the <hi>Defender</hi> of them; I ſhall not repent the making ſo <hi>minute</hi> an offering at the <hi>Temple</hi> on ſo <hi>great</hi> an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Name of the great <hi>King William</hi> was ever dear to theſe his loyal <hi>New-Engliſh Colonies,</hi> and that beyond expreſſion; but there is no <hi>one</hi> thing
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002852_0004_0FE677ACE6618020"/>by which his Immortal Memory is more endear'd to us, than the wiſe and juſt <hi>proviſion</hi> by Him made for the <hi>Succeſſion of the Crown in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we ſaw it take place in a manner ſo <hi>peaceful,</hi> after ſo much reaſon to fear the contrary, <hi>our mouths were-filled with laughter and our tongues with ſinging.</hi> Our Churches rang with the high <hi>praiſes</hi> of God, and with continued <hi>prayers for the life of the King and of his Son.</hi> We truſted in God that he was building a <hi>ſure Houſe</hi> for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cauſe, and <hi>ſpeaking of it for a great while to come</hi> in the Perſon of His ROYAL HIGHNESS and his numerous <hi>Illuſtrious Offſpring;</hi> as <hi>the Lord gave to David a Lamp in Jeruſalem, to ſet up his Son after him and to eſtabliſh his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we were ſoon ſtruck with <hi>horror</hi> and juſt deteſtation at the helliſh plots and <hi>rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,</hi> formed by a reſtleſs <hi>party</hi> in the Nation, whom no oaths could bind, nor clemency conquer, nor the rebukes of a righteous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence deter: Nor were we from time to time leſs affected wiah a ſincere and dutiful <hi>joy,</hi> to hear how God brought their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to light, and cover'd the abetters of them with infamy; while at the ſame time the <hi>fame</hi> of the felicity of the Nation under the <hi>Kings</hi> wiſe adminiſtration reached us, and of the vaſt influence of his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and power upon the grand affairs of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002852_0005_0FE677C483CFC4E0"/>
When ſome of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> doubly ſworn to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Faith</hi> he defended, appear'd to head the vile attenpts to diſturb a <hi>Proteſtant Reign,</hi> we readily took the Occaſion given us to declare our aſtoniſhment at and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the perfidy and impiety. For what were thoſe <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> falſly ſo called, plotting to introduce, but the two tranſcendent plagues of <hi>popery</hi> and <hi>ſlavery</hi> upon the Nations? With amazement and diſdain the <hi>proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> beheld the <hi>villany,</hi> and cry'd to the God of Heaven againſt the men, his enemies more than ours. The mean while it was their humble <hi>truſt</hi> in the mercy of God, that while his <hi>Majeſty</hi> was aſſerting the rights of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and reſtoring to God his Throne in the <hi>Soul</hi> of man, God would not fail to defend his Servant on the <hi>Britiſh Throne.</hi> God anſwer'd the faith and prayer of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and return'd the wickedneſs of the <hi>Kings</hi> enemies on their own head.</p>
            <p>This was the language of the <hi>Addreſſes</hi> from the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> at their annual <hi>Conventions;</hi> and I have preſum'd to tranſcribe a <hi>paragraph</hi> or two of them, for an abiding <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of their ſervent <hi>loyalty to Chriſt and the Proteſtant Royal Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thanks be to God the Proteſtant Succeſſion lives in his preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi> King <hi>GEOROE the Second;</hi> and accordingly the tyde of Joy has run as high among us in the happy Succeſſion

            </p>
            <p>May the Clemencies of his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extend always to theſe <hi>American Churches,</hi> which know not of <hi>one</hi> ſingle perſon in their <hi>Communion</hi> that is not loyally affected to <hi>Him</hi> and to his <hi>Houſe.</hi> May he ſhine long at the head of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> its powerful Friend and Protector; and reign always in the hearts of all his <hi>proteſtant Subjects,</hi> being ever to them <hi>as the light of the Morning, and as the breath of their Noſtrils.</hi>

As to the <hi>firſt</hi> we can only ſay with certainty, that <hi>he was of the children of Benjamin or Judah,</hi> and one of the <hi>chief Captains,</hi> a Collonel or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officer that had Captains under him.

            <p>AS to the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of his coming to <hi>David</hi> and ſpeaking as he did, the <hi>Chapter</hi> gives this plain account of it: "That before and after the death of <hi>Saul</hi> many Perſons of diſtinction, and men of war fit for the battel, appeared openly for <hi>David</hi> and went over to him; to aſſert his right to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and to bring about a <hi>Revolution</hi> in God's time.

Upon the notice of their approach <hi>David went out to meet them;</hi> either to ſhew them the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and do 'em honour, or rather in ſome fear and jealouſy of their deſign: For he had lately met with many <hi>treacheries</hi> from his own <hi>Tribe,</hi> and his caution now was wiſe and juſt. Wherefore he met them on his guard, and ſaid to 'em, <hi>If ye be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart ſhall be knit to you; but if ye be come to betray me to my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſeeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our Fathers look thereon and rebuke it.</hi> What could be ſaid with more piety, probity and prudence on ſuch an occaſion? The wiſdom and honeſty of the <hi>man</hi> equally ſhine forth in this <hi>divine ſentence,</hi> worthy the mouth of a <hi>King.</hi> My <hi>text</hi> is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>Amaſai</hi> unto theſe words of <hi>David;</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heroic Anſwer.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002852_0010_0FE677B4844D3240"/>
WHEREFORE in the next place let us note the <hi>Spirit,</hi> wiſdom and fortitude with which he ſpake: <hi>The ſpirit came upon Amaſai and he ſaid.</hi> 
               <q>The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> came upon him: not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Prophecy</hi>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Henry.</note>, but a ſpirit of wiſdom and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſuitable to the preſent occaſion. Words were put into his mouth moſt proper to ſatisfy <hi>David,</hi> and to animate himſelf and company.</q> Nothing could be ſaid more fine and great on a ſudden. His words breathe <hi>the ſpirit of love, and power and of a ſound mind.</hi> The man ſpake as one <hi>inſpir'd</hi> on the occaſion. He was carried away in the Spirit, and ſpake above himſelf, to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of all that heard him. Here was the ſpirit of wiſdom and might, the ſpirit of courage and of the fear of the Lord. The ſincerity and zeal, the vehemence and eloquence are equal; and ſo the loyalty to <hi>David</hi> and the devotion towards God. It was <hi>ſpiritus audaciae et fortitudinis,</hi> a ſpirit of fortitude and boldneſs, as became a religious <hi>Soldier</hi> and a <hi>chief Captain. David</hi>'s words to him and his company were very moving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging; and no doubt but <hi>Amaſai</hi>'s heart was full before, what and how to ſpeak when he came into <hi>David</hi>'s preſence; but he ſeems to drop all that he had premeditated, and anſwers under a ſudden impulſe of Spirit, and as in an extaſie of love and joy; <hi>Thine are we David, and on thy ſide, thou Son of Jeſſe!</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Before he came to <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Camp,</hi> it was obſerv'd of him, that he was valorous and <hi>prudent and the Lord was with him.</hi> 1 Sam. 16.18.

Thine by <hi>conqueſt,</hi> for <hi>thou haſt ſaved us from our enemies and from the hand of them that hate us, that we ſhould ſerve thee without fear in holineſs and righteouſneſs before thee all the days of our life.</hi> Thine truly and indeed if ſubdued by thee, and made <hi>thy willing people in the day of thy power!</hi> For then we may know alſo that we are Thine by the <hi>donation</hi> of the Father; <hi>for all whom the Father hath given thee ſhall come unto thee!</hi> And whoſoever does ſo is thine to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by thee; eternally and unchangeably <hi>Thine,</hi> to be <hi>bleſſed</hi> in thee for ever and ever, and that thou mayeſt be <hi>magnified</hi> and admired in them thro' the ages of Eternity.</p>
            <p>THIS is the Covenant of Grace made with us in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> Ezek. 34.23, 24. <hi>I will ſet up one ſhepherd over them, and he ſhall feed them; even my ſervant David, He ſhall feed them and ſhall be their ſhepherd: And I the Lord will be their God, and my
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002852_0020_0FE677BB7939C7C0"/>ſervant David a prince among them; I the Lord have ſpoken it, and I will make with them a Covenant of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS every way, and by all poſſible bonds, we are <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s: His to ſerve him, his to enjoy him; his to glorify him on earth, and his to be glorified by him and with him for ever: His and <hi>on his ſide;</hi> his People our People and his God our God. We are <hi>his</hi> and for none elſe; none in compariſon of him, none in competition with him; We <hi>call no Man Maſter on Earth</hi> but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to him; <hi>for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi> Mat 23.10.</p>
            <p>AND as this is our <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion,</hi> Thine are we <hi>David!</hi> ſo <hi>ſecondly</hi> this is our <hi>prayer</hi> for his Church and people, kingdom and intereſt, <hi>Peace, peace be to it</hi> and to its <hi>helpers.</hi> So has God ſent forth the <hi>Spirit of his Son</hi> into the hearts of the true members of his Church, the <hi>Spirit of grace and ſupplication,</hi> teaching and inſpiring them to <hi>pray for the peace</hi> of it. Every devout Soul, man woman and child can do this, and are ready to do it; they abundantly <hi>owe</hi> it to the <hi>Houſe of the Lord their God;</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> whoſe the Houſe is, and to <hi>them</hi> that belong to it; and for the ſake of <hi>both</hi> they are heartily inclined to pray always <hi>this</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Pſalm. 122. <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeruſalem: They ſhall proſper that love thee: Peace be within thy walls and proſperity within thy palaces: For my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and companions ſake I will now ſay, Peace be within thee: Becauſe of the Houſe of the Lord our God I will ſeek thy good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>leſs</hi> can we wiſh and ask for <hi>the whole Iſrael of God</hi> than this? <hi>Grace be with all them that love
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002852_0021_0FE677D3F082C708"/>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity! Peace be to the Brethren, and love with faith from God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! The Lord of peace bleſs his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with it; give them peace always by all means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> was a type of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his ſpiritual reign in and over elect Souls. Peace was the bleſſing of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s reign, and this is the bleſſing of Chriſt's kingdom, who is <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> who is <hi>our peace,</hi> whoſe <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WELL then may we wiſh and cry <hi>peace, peace</hi> to this Kingdom of <hi>the Son of David,</hi> in whom <hi>righteouſneſs and peace have met and kiſſed each other; that glory may dwell in our land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD has <hi>ſpoken</hi> peace to the Church and kingdom of his <hi>Son,</hi> and therein directed us to pray for it. Iſa. 66.12. <hi>I will extend peace to her as a river, and the glory of the Gentiles as a flowing ſtream.</hi> Pſal. 72.3, 7. <hi>The mountains ſhall bring peace to the people, and the little hill, by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in his days the righteous ſhall flouriſh, and abundance of peaee ſo long as the moon endureth.</hi> Theſe <hi>promiſes</hi> of a gracious God we muſt turn into <hi>prayers,</hi> and make <hi>pleas</hi> of them in our prayers. Gal. 6.16. <hi>Peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> 1. Pet. 5. ult. <hi>Peace be with all that are in Chriſt Jeſus, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now in the <hi>third</hi> and laſt place, let us conſider the <hi>aſſurance</hi> we have of being heard in this <hi>prayer,</hi> and put our <hi>Amen</hi> to it, — It <hi>is ſo</hi> and it <hi>ſhall be</hi> ſo; <hi>Peace</hi> will and muſt be to the Church and kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> — <hi>for his God helpeth him.</hi>

HE who eſtabliſh'd the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> will much more build up and eſtabliſh the Kingdom of <hi>his dear Son.</hi> The <hi>promiſes to David</hi> and his kingdom were but <hi>typical and prophetical</hi> of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and perpetuity of the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in him they are fulfilled in their utmoſt extent. I need only turn you to that famous place, Pſalm. 89.20,—29. <hi>I have found DAVID my ſervant, with my holy oil have I anointed him: with whom my hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed, my arm alſo ſhall ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him; I will beat down his foes before him, and plague them that hate him; My faithfulneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall be with him, and in my name ſhall his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>MANY like promiſes of <hi>peace</hi> and ſucceſs to <hi>Chriſts</hi> kingdom, under the type of <hi>David,</hi> we find in the <hi>Book</hi> of God. And <hi>he muſt reign till all his enemies are put under his feet. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw this in his dream: He ſaw <hi>a ſtone that ſmote the Image</hi> of jealouſie, Idolatry and and all falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and impiety, <hi>and the ſtone became a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and filled the whole earth:</hi> As <hi>Daniel</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter, ſo we have ſeen it, <hi>The God of heaven hath in theſe latter days ſet up a Kingdom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be deſtroyed, which ſhall break in pieces and conſume all theſe, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Dan. 2.35, 44.</p>

THE Churches <hi>help</hi> ſtands in the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord; and if He help, the Church muſt ſtand and prevail. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> bids his weak and timerous <hi>Flock</hi> not fear, for it is <hi>the Father's good pleaſure to give them the kingdom.</hi> If he <hi>help</hi> who ſhall withſtand and oppoſe? On this <hi>rock</hi> he has built his Church, <hi>God ſhall help her and that right early; God is in the midſt of her ſhe ſhall not be moved: The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</hi> Pſal. 46 5, 6.</p>
            <p>NOW this is a ſufficient <hi>reaſon</hi> 1. for the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> we make to <hi>Chriſt, Thine are we, for thy God helpeth thee:</hi> And 2. for the <hi>prayer, Peace, peace</hi> be to thee and thine, <hi>for thy God helpeth thee.</hi> This aſſures <hi>peace</hi> to the Church, this the rock of ſalvation to it; <hi>thy God helpeth thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Lord liveth, and bleſſed be my rock, and let the God of my Salvation be exalted.</hi> He <hi>creates peace, peace. Faithful is He that has promiſed, who alſo will do it.
