            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>JER. xxxiii.16.</bibl>

            <p>WHoever is but a little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Nature of Man in general, and the Impurity of his own Heart in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I am perſwaded he muſt acknowledge that Self-Righteouſneſs is the laſt Thing that is taken out of the Heart. We are all <hi>Arminians,</hi> we are all <hi>Legaliſts</hi>; nay I may venture to affirm we are all <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is true indeed, we pretend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Doctrine of Merit; we will not pretend to affirm in ſo many Words that we deſerve any Thing for our Works: But then I believe if we examine our Hearts to the Bottom, we ſhall find that the moſt of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make Jeſus Chriſt only an imperfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and tho' they do it not in ſo many Words, yet as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>We go about to eſtabliſh a</hi> particular <hi>Righteouſneſs of our own.</hi> For indeed it muſt needs be ſo
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005090_0003_1016A35A899FAF20"/>
according to the Nature of Things: being born under a Covenant of Works, it is natural for us to fly to a Covenant of Works again for Salvation, and the Language of every one of our Hearts by Nature is, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit eternal Life?</hi> Tho' when we come to be put to the Trial we can do nothing at all. I am verily perſwaded, they that have been wro't upon by God, they that have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged of Self, and been enabled to lay hold on a naked Chriſt, have found in their own Hearts what I have ſaid to be true. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deſign of the Chriſtian Revelation to point out to us a better Righteouſneſs than our own; it ſhows that we muſt be accepted <hi>not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done,</hi> but by the Righteouſneſs of another being imputed to us: Which was intimated to our firſt Parents immediately after the Fall, for we are told that God made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> Coats of Skins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now if Fleſh was not allowed to be eaten at that Time, we may in all Probability, nay with a great deal of Confidence affirm, that Sacrifices were made, and that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were cloathed with the Skins of the Beaſts that were ſlain, in Commemoration of the great Sacrifice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after was to die an accurſed Death upon the Croſs; and that as the Skins were put
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005090_0004_1016A35D908E6B28"/>
upon the naked Bodies of our firſt Parents, ſo the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was hereafter to be put on &amp; applied to their poor naked Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Goſpel here then was preached to our firſt Parents; and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that ſpoke from that Time to the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in the Fleſh, ſpoke of this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, of an imputed Righteouſneſs; but none more clearly and in expreſs Terms than the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and in no Place does he ſpeak more explicitly than this we have choſen for the Subject of our preſent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; where he affirms that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to be <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore from theſe Words, as God ſhall be pleaſed to give me Freedom &amp; Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, firſt, endeavour to explain who you are to underſtand by the Perſon here, <hi>The Lord.</hi> 2<hi>dly.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhow you how the Lord is to be <hi>our Righteouſneſs.</hi> 3<hi>dly.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to anſwer ſome of the moſt plauſible <hi>Objections</hi> that are generally bro't againſt this Doctrine of the <hi>Lord's</hi> being our Rigteouſneſs. 4<hi>ly</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhow the <hi>Abſurdities</hi> that will follow from <hi>denying</hi> this Doctrine. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conclude with an Exhortation to all poor Sinners to come, juſt as they are, in all their Blood, in all their Filth, to Jeſus Chriſt, to lay hold on him by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005090_0005_1016A36171B762F0"/>
Faith, that by an Application of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to their Hearts, they may be made to cry out, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I am to ſhow you who you are to underſtand by the Perſon here termed <hi>The Lord. And this is his Name wherewith he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Here then, if Curioſity hath brought any <hi>Arminians</hi> or <hi>Socinians</hi> this Morning to hear this Fooliſhneſs of Preaching, read the Words of the Text, and be aſhamed of your deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles, for the Perſon here called, <hi>The Lord,</hi> is the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> that made us, &amp; by whoſe Power all Things do now conſiſt. That it is ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is plain from the Context, it is plain from the very Words going before the Text; ſays the Prophet in the 5th Verſe, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Days ſhall come that the Lord will raiſe unto</hi> David <hi>a righteous Branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute Judgment and Juſtice in the Earth; in his Day</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely. And this is his Name wherewith he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Now all muſt certainly agree, and do agree, that the <hi>righteous Branch</hi> here ſignifies the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and he that is called the <hi>righteous Branch</hi> in the 5th Verſe, is called the <hi>Lord</hi> in the 6th Verſe. The Word <hi>Lord</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005090_0006_1016A362F78D40A0"/>
in the Original is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Name of the eternal God himſelf; and if Jeſus be Lord, this ſays that Jeſus Chriſt muſt be really, truly and properly God. The Perſon here then ſpoken of is Chriſt, and he is repreſented as very God, as co-eſſential, co-equal, and co-eternal with the Father. For indeed if Jeſus Chriſt be not God, my dear Friends, I am ſure I ſhould never preach the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt again. For, what Comfort can a poor convinced Sinner have, what Hope can he have, when he ſees the infinite Deſert of Sin, unleſs he ſees his Help laid upon one that is Mighty and Almighty? I can never think that an <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch, that have felt the Power of Chriſt's Blood upon their Soul. They that have felt this Power, I am perſuaded, will not ſpeak ſo light of this dear Redeemer. And I am amazed that <hi>Arians</hi> ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Men of Senſe, and yet broach ſuch an abſurd Opinion, that Jeſus Chriſt is a created God. Was there ever ſuch a Contradiction in Terms; a God, and yet created, a God, and yet limited. <hi>Arians</hi> generally cry out againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> but<hi>Arian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> is <hi>Popery</hi>; it is Idolatry to worſhip the Lord Jeſus Chriſt if he be a Creature, tho' a Creature of the higheſt Order; it is as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005090_0007_1016A365E0B45468"/>
much Guilt to worſhip him, as for Papiſts to worſhip the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What renders their Worſhip Idolatry is, becauſe the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> is a Creature; and if Jeſus Chriſt be a Creature, tho' of the higheſt Order, it's Idolatry to put up our Prayers to him. As for the <hi>Socinians,</hi> their Principle, if the Word of God be true, it muſt condemn them, muſt damn them for ever; for the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, that Jeſus was only a good Man, and that he died for Sinners to be an Example of ſuffering patiently. The <hi>Socinians</hi> do not refuſe to call Jeſus Chriſt their Saviour, and yet they make him only a Man; where their own Principles condemn them, for what ſays the Scripture, <hi>Curſed is the Man that truſts in an Arm of Fleſh</hi> Now if we believe Chriſt to be only a meer Man, and yet put our Truſt in him for eternal Salvation, if the Scripture be true, that Perſon is an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later. But I would ſain hope there are few or none ſuch among you, that deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Jeſus Chriſt. Take away this, and you ſap the Foundation; take away the Divinity or Chriſt, and the Goſpel is ſunk, nothing remains but Morality; <hi>Plato</hi> and other Philoſophers will make as good Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours as Jeſus Chriſt, if Jeſus Chriſt be not really, truly and properly God. This then is the Foundation of our Religion, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005090_0008_1016A36772C1BA88"/>
of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. He is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of under this Character in the Text, and this is a Character that he will maintain to the End of the World; and whoever may diſpute his Divinity now, they will both ſee and feel it to their eternal Sorrow when the Lord Jeſus comes to Judgment. But I hope I need not ſpend Time among you to prove the Divinity of the Son of God. It may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be more ſuitable to go on to,</p>
            <p>The Second Thing, to ſhow you how this <hi>Lord,</hi> even the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is to be the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> And that is in one Word, by <hi>Imputation</hi>; it is to be accounted of and made over to us as ours, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is to be imputed to us. And when I ſpeak of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, I do not confine my Idea of it to his Death, as moſt People do; they talk of the Merits of Chriſt, but then they generally think of the Death of Chriſt, but we muſt remember that the Obedience of Jeſus Chriſt is to be imputed likewiſe, for Jeſus Chriſt not only died, but Jeſus Chriſt lived for us, lived in our ſtead, fulfilled the Covenant of Works which we had broken, in our ſtead, and by his Death he made an Attonement for the Guilt we had contracted by breaking God's Law. God made Man upright, in the Image of God made he Man.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005090_0009_1016A36947D2DE60"/>
Now when Man was in this State, tho' God might have inſiſted upon his Obedience for ever, without promiſing any Reward; yet God was pleaſed to condeſcend, (O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Condeſcenſion it was!) to enter into a Covenant or Agreement with his Creature, promiſing him eternal Life if he continued in his Obedience, (and he had Power given him to do that,) but threatned him with eternal Damnation if he brake his Law. Now <hi>Adam</hi> was our Repreſentative and the Head of all Mankind; and had we then been alive, and God had put it to our Choice, then Terms were ſo reaſonable, we ſhould all with one Conſent have agreed that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have acted in our ſtead, it could never have enter'd into our Heart to think that that Man could fall from his Obedience; therefore it is the greateſt Folly to charge God with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice for imputing his Sin to us. Here then, God made a Covenant with Man, but the Devil envying Man's Happineſs, tempted him, Man was ſeduced by him to eat the forbidden Fruit, whereby he immediately died, became liable to eternal Death; We died in him, and became the Objects of God's eternal Wrath. And God might juſtly have left the whole Race of Mankind, as he did the fallen Angels, whom he hath reſerved in Chains of Darkneſs to the Judgment of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005090_0010_1016A36EAFE26858"/>
great Day. But rejoice, O Heavens, and be glad, O Earth, Tho' the fallen Angels are left to periſh, behold, fallen Man is taken into Mercy. Juſtice demanded Satisfaction, yet Mercy interpoſed. After we had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Law, we were obliged to obey the Law as much as ever, but as ſoon as we did eat the forbidden Fruit, we loſt our Power. Beſides, Satisfaction muſt be made to Juſtice. <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> Now if God be juſt, we muſt be puniſhed; and if Man muſt be puniſhed, he muſt always be ſatisfying, and never ſatisfy infinite Juſtice. Now then, God did that for us which we could not do for our ſelves. Behold, God the Father, unknown to us, entered into an eternal Contract with his Son, and made him the Repreſentative and Head of the Elect, of an immenſe Multitude which the Father gave into his Hand. Jeſus Chriſt then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to bring in an everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for them; and that all God's Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes might now triumph, behold, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to take to himſelf our humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to fulfil the Moral Law that we had broken; and rather than we ſhould be damned, Jeſus Chriſt deſired his Father to ſheath the Sword of his Juſtice in his Breaſt. And therefore, O wonderful Love! that our dear Redeemer, tho' he was in the Form of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005090_0011_1016A3730D8545F0"/>
God, tho' he thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, yet took upon him the Form of a Servant, in that Form lived a painful Life, fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and at laſt died an accurſed ignominious Death upon the Croſs; whereby he ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, procured an Union betwixt God and our Souls; and by his Obedience wrought out a compleat all ſufficient Righteouſneſs, for all thoſe who ſhould hereafter be enabled to lay hold on his Righteouſneſs. This then is what I underſtand by the Word <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And I am ſure it is glad Tydings of great Joy to all that feel their Miſery, and that are hungering and thirſting after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I know it is ſweet Soul reviving Doctrine to all that are ſick of Sin. But precious as it is to convinced Sinners, yet it grates the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man's Heart. For we have contracted ſuch a Pride by our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> that if we cannot be ſaved by our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we will venture to be damned. This is the Temper of all by Nature.— And therefore tho' this be Soul-raviſhing Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to all that know themſelves aright, yet perhaps there is not a Doctrine that has met with more Oppoſition in the World. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of <hi>Objections,</hi> no doubt have been ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt it. It would be endleſs for me to anſwer every thing. But however I ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005090_0012_1016A3749FFDBA50"/>
now <hi>Thirdly</hi> undertake by the Divine Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to anſwer ſome of the moſt plauſible <hi>Objections</hi> generally urged againſt this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
            <p>And firſt, It is obſervable, that thoſe who object againſt an imputed Righteouſneſs would fain be great Advocates for <hi>Morality,</hi> yet I generally find they are a Company of the moſt immoral People themſelves; they cry out for Morality, yet I do not find that they have ſo much Morality themſelves; true Morality is above their Power; They may ſee what they ought to do, but they want Power, becauſe they do not believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However, they bring Scripture for their Purpoſe, and it is no Wonder when the Devil brought Scripture. They tell us that Jeſus Chriſt preached Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in his <hi>Sermon on the Mount</hi>; you will find there Chriſt preaching Morality, and you are always preaching Faith. But I would deſire to know with what Eyes they have read our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount. It's true, Jeſus Chriſt does recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Morality, and every Goſpel-Miniſter does preach Morality, but he will preach Faith in Jeſus Chriſt as the Foundation of Morality. There can be no true Morality which is not bottomed upon Jeſus Chriſt. That they can get no Argument from <hi>Chriſt's
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005090_0013_1016A378F07E3710"/>
Sermon on the Mount,</hi> is evident from this, that before Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks of good Works, he pronounces them bleſſed that are <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> that are <hi>pure in Heart,</hi> that are holy <hi>Mourners,</hi> that <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs</hi>; and then ſays he, <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before Men,</hi> that is, Evidence this divine Life in your Heart by good Works, <hi>that Men may ſee your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Here Jeſus Chriſt lays down <hi>hungering and thirſting after Righteouſneſs,</hi> (no doubt, his imputed Righteouſneſs,) as the Foundation of Morality. Bring People to Chriſt firſt, and then they will live well; but to bid them live well firſt, is to bid them build with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Foundation.</p>
            <p>But then ſay they, This is the Way to open a Door to <hi>Licenciouſneſs.</hi> This is an old trite Argument, and I am much amazed that Men of Senſe ſhould take an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of an Infidel and Unbeliever's Mouth; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> introduces an Infidel making this Objection, and anſwers it by ſaying, <hi>Shall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound?</hi> We do not preach down good Works, but only thus far, that they cannot <hi>juſtify</hi> us in the Sight of God. We are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied without any Regard to our Works paſt, preſent or to come. Our Works have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005090_0014_1016A37A77BEC080"/>
to do as to our Juſtification in the Sight of God. They are no Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God to have Pity upon us. We are <hi>juſtified freely by Grace</hi> without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any Foreſight of our Works: But then, my dear Friends, Do we preach down Works, when we ſay ſo? No, we preach up Works, we exhort to Morality. Let Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lay hold on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fire will immediately fill their Souls, the Love of God will be ſhed abroad in their Heart, and out of Love to God for what he has done for their Soul, it will be the Language of their Heart, <hi>Lord Jeſus, what ſhall I do</hi>? not to recommend me to God, but only to give thee ſome Token of my Love for what thou haſt done for my Soul. This is the genuine Fruit of the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith. <hi>The Doctrine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs is the Article by which the Church ſtands or falls,</hi> ſays <hi>Luther.</hi> By this Doctrine, the Reformation was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. If we deſire to have true Religion and Piety to abound among us, we muſt preach more and more of the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Objection, we may affirm that <hi>the Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet they will bring Scripture again, another plauſible Objection they have is from
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005090_0015_1016A37D66F40FA8"/>
the <hi>Young Man</hi> in the Goſpel; they ſay, he was to be juſtified by Works, therefore the Doctrine of the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt muſt fall. Well then, let us examine the Hiſtorian. There was a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came to Chriſt and I wiſh there were more young Gentlemen doing ſo,) he ſays, <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal Life</hi>? A proper Queſtion for all. Well, ſays Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Thou knoweſt the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, defraud not</hi>; Now ſay they, Becauſe Chriſt refers this Man to his Commands, therefore he refers him to be juſtified by his Works. But my dear Friends, this was of purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him that he was to be ſaved by a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Righteouſneſs than his own. What was the End of Jeſus Chriſt in referring him to his Commands, but that the young Man comparing his Life with theſe Commands, might find that he had broken all theſe Commands, and therefore that <hi>the Law</hi> might be <hi>a Schoolmaſter</hi> to lead him to Jeſus Chriſt, that he might be convinced that eternal Life was not to be got by his Works. It is true the young Man ſays, <hi>All theſe Things have I obſerved from my Youth</hi>; but he ſhould have ſaid, All theſe Things have I bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from my Youth. If he had never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005090_0016_1016A3809C88A830"/>
himſelf, and make him ſee the Neceſſity of relying upon another Righteouſneſs than his own.</p>
            <p>But they ſay, Jeſus Chriſt <hi>loved</hi> this Man, and would he love him if he were not a good Man? No doubt but we are to love every Thing that is good in every Man; but there was a great Difference betwixt the Love that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt bore to this Man, and the Love that he bore to <hi>Lazarus, Martha,</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> There be many of you that have ſweet natural Tempers, and have many good Qualities; a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt cannot but love you ſo far as he ſees theſe Things in you. But there is a great Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Love that they bear to a moral good Man, and that Love they bear to thoſe that are united to Jeſus Chriſt. The Love that Chriſt bore this young Man was far from that peculiar Love that he bore to all thoſe who are united to him. So that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Objection, we may ſay, <hi>The Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another Objection taken from the 25<hi>th Matth<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> where, ſay they, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are <hi>judged</hi> by their Works, therefore we are to be juſtified by our Works. But there is no ſuch Thing here: it is remarkable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſpeaks of their good Works, he determines their State; he places ſome on
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005090_0017_1016672386F4DA70"/>
his right Hand and ſome on his left, before he comes to paſs Sentence upon them. We own, that Works done by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt will be rewarded, and the more good Works we do for the Sake of Jeſus Chriſt, the greater will our Reward be in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. But then, my dear Friends, it is remarkable, that theſe People did not depend upon theſe. <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me Meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was ſick, and ye viſited me, I was in Priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi>  But that this Reward was of Grace, and that their good Works were only Evidences of their Love to him, and that they did not depend upon them for their Juſtification, is plain, becauſe they ſay, <hi>When ſaw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave the Drink? when ſaw we thee a Stranger, and took thee in, or naked and cloathed thee? or when ſaw we thee ſick, or in Priſon, and came unto thee?</hi> They were ſo far from depending upon their Works for Juſtification, that they really forgot that they had done them, and were filled with holy Bluſhing, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould mention, much more that he ſhould reward their little Services, their Tokens of Love to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005090_0018_1016A38735586AF8"/>But then, they retort upon us the latter Part of the Chapter. Jeſus Chriſt damned the one ſort for not doing well, and if he damned them for not doing well, it's plain he ſaved the other for doing well. Which is no good Conſequence at all; for, according to the Covenant of Works, one evil Thought cuts off for ever, without another Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and after we have done all we can do, we muſt acknowledge ourſelves <hi>unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servants,</hi> and rely upon a better Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs than our own. Tho' the one be juſtly damned for their Sins, yet the other was rewarded only by free Grace, and they all cry out, <hi>Grace, Grace</hi>! Therefore we may ſay, <hi>The Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Fourthly, there is another Way of arguing; from the <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> that will follow <hi>denying</hi> any Propoſition. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no greater Abſurdities can follow from denying any Propoſition, than do from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this, of imputed Righteouſneſs. I believe no Body here will think it proper that Man ſhould <hi>glory in himſelf</hi>; but if the Doctrine of imputed Righteouſneſs be not true, Man muſt glory in himſelf. We are every where declared to be ſaved by Grace, to be juſtified freely; that Man is not to glory in himſelf, but that he that glorieth muſt glory in the Lord. If any Thing I
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005090_0019_1016A38A4FD3E528"/>
can do and ſuffer can recommend me to the Favour and Mercy of God, I may ſo far glory in it, and I may ſay, not in thee, but in mine own free Will, mine own good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition do I glory. Therefore if you glory only in the Lord, come out of yourſelves, and ſay, <hi>The Lord our Rigteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, I believe we all cry out againſt <hi>Popery</hi>; but, my dear Friends, Are we not Papiſts if we deny the Doctrine of an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs, and exclude the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Jeſus Chriſt. Now ſuppoſe I were to come and preach that Doctrine, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is not ſufficient of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but you muſt get Angels to interceed for you, would you like this Doctrine? would you not ſay, this is rank Popery? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſhould refine a little on it, and preach this Doctrine, that the Death of Jeſus Chriſt is not ſufficient of itſelf, but you muſt join your own Works with Chriſt, and then God will have Mercy upon you, would you not ſay, This is doing Diſhonour to the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Death, as if the Death of Chriſt were not ſufficient? Now make the ſame Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his Obedience: if it's Blaſphemy, to join any thing with the Death of Chriſt, is it not equally Blaſphemy to join our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with the Obedience of Chriſt, as if the Obedience of Jeſus Chriſt were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005090_0020_1016A38BE82275B8"/>
It is plain therefore, that we are Papiſts in our Heart, if we deny the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of imputed Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>I remember a Story of a Gentleman abroad; after he had been talking of <hi>doing</hi> along Time, the Miniſter endeavoured to convince him of the inviſible Realities of another World; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever after a long Conference he parted with theſe Words, Well, my Lord, if there be no ſuch thing as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no ſuch thing as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> what will become of <hi>me</hi>? But, my Lord, if there be ſuch a thing as <hi>Hell,</hi> what will become of <hi>you</hi>? I make Application of this to Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs. If there be no ſuch thing as Chriſt's imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as certainly there is, what will become of thee, O Man, that dare build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy rotten Righteouſneſs for Salvation? What a fooliſh Abſurdity is it, to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sand, when you may have a Rock to build upon? <hi>Bellermine</hi> himſelf, that great Enemy of imputed Righteouſneſs, was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to own and confeſs, conſidering the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of depending upon our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is ſafeſt to depend upon the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt. And certainly it is beſt for every Man to follow and chooſe that which is ſafeſt. Therefore we may with great Confidence affirm, that <hi>the Lord is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:005090_0021_1016A38FBAB70D38"/>Now, my dear Friends, I have been too long upon the doctrinal Part. To preach to your Head, without preaching to your Heart, is doing you no Good. If I know any thing of my Heart, I came not here to tickle your Ears, but to do Good to your Souls; therefore I come to make <hi>Application</hi> of what has been ſaid. I believe, many of you may rejoice to hear one come from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (where our Articles are ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,) ſpeaking on the Doctrine of Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs. Curioſity may have brought you to hear a Stranger. But then, my dear Friends, give me Leave to put one important Queſtion, Have you felt this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in your Heart? Can you ſay, <hi>The Lord is your Righteouſneſs</hi>? For, to ſay that Jeſus died for others, without you can ſay Jeſus died for you, can do you no Service; an unapplied Chriſt will do you no Service. The great Queſtion therefore is, Whether any of you have felt yourſelves damned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Nature? Did you ever feel your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and helpleſs Condition? Did you ever ſee that you were poor, miſerable, blind and naked? Were you ever hungering and thirſting after the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? And did God enable you to ſtretch out the Hand of Faith, to embrace the dear Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in your Heart? Were you ever in a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005090_0022_1016A3914664AC48"/>
Soul-Rapture of Love, made to lye down at the feet of Chriſt, and cry out, <hi>My Lord, and my God</hi>? Did you ever apply Chriſt ſo as to ſay, <hi>My Lord and my God! Who can lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? It is Chriſt that died, ye rather that is riſen again.</hi> Without cloſing with Chriſt, without making Application of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, all your Religion is nothing; you are yet out of Chriſt, and if out of Chriſt, you are undone. I hope ſome of you can ſay, through Grace, you have been enabled to lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt, and you can ſay, <hi>The Lord is our Righteouſneſs!</hi> then your Souls may rejoyce. If Chriſt be your Lord, if you have put his Righteouſneſs upon your naked Souls; then call upon the heavenly Choir to help you to praiſe him, and let the Words of your Song be, Free Grace, Grace, Grace! Not unto us, but unto free Grace, diſtinguiſhing Grace, be everlaſting Praiſe. O what Reaſon have you to praiſe God! Have you got Chriſt's Righteouſneſs? have you cloſed with Chriſt? Have you put on Jeſus Chriſt? Then Jeſus Chriſt has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you into his everlaſting Arms. Some of you may fear, you ſhall loſe him again: But depend upon the Promiſes, build upon God's everlaſting Love. If you have clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005090_0023_1016A3940B2410E8"/>
with Chriſt, you have got a Right to all the Benefits of his Blood; and being in Chriſt, there is no Condemnation to you; You are Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of his Fleſh; you are one with Chriſt; he is <hi>the Lord your Righteouſneſs.</hi>— Above all, my dear Friends, take Care of making continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Progreſs in Sanctification. Many of you turn careleſs in your Walk; you are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidden from God, and now it is not with you as in former Times, when the Candle of the Lord ſhined upon you: Get up again, renew your Acts of Faith. (And if you have never believed before, then begin now to believe) Take Care to make continual Advances in the Divine Life; for when the Prophet ſays, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> the Word <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> implies inward Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, Holineſs of Heart, as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs. Thoſe whom the Lord Jeſus juſtifies, thoſe he ſanctifies. And therefore if ye have cloſed with Chriſt, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>put on Chriſt</hi>; be every Day ſaying, Through the Help of my God I will behave as a Chriſtian to Day. Let one good Work be the Beginning of another. And be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day hungering and thirſting for Chriſt. Be more dead to the World; be more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God. In a Word, my dear Friends, pray for your Chriſtian Friends, and take
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005090_0024_1016A396C4E8F928"/>
Care you do not fall out by the Way.</p>
            <p>How many are there here in this very Church-yard, that never cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt by Faith! I fear, the greateſt Part of this Congregation do not know what it is ſavingly to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt: The moſt of you cannot ſay, <hi>The Lord is my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Poor Souls, what will become of you? you are now in a Church-yard, and many a Grave may be dug here for your Bodies; and if you ſhould die before you can ſay, <hi>The Lord is my Righteouſneſs,</hi> you muſt depart from Jeſus Chriſt for ever more. You may have a pompous burial; but while your Friends are carrying your Bodies to the Grave, your Souls may be in Hell. What therefore ſhall I ſay? Let me exhort you to examine your Heart, and to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have got Chriſt <hi>the Lord</hi> to be <hi>your Righteouſneſs,</hi> or not. Examine your Heart; do not bribe your poor Conſcience any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; let Conſcience ſpeak out. You muſt now judge and condemn yourſelves, or you will be condemned for ever hereafter. Plead with <hi>the Lord</hi> to be <hi>your Righteouſneſs.</hi> Be you what you will, tho' you were Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Fathers and of Mothers, tho' you were Adulterers or Adultereſſes, tho' you were the worſt of Sinners, yet the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt may be your Righteouſneſs, a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005090_0025_1016A39A953B3228"/>
Righteouſneſs to you, poor Sinners, vile Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>This is a faithful Saying and worthy of all Acceptation that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave poor Sinners.</hi> Therefore my dear Friends, accept of Jeſus Chriſt to be your Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Shall I ſpeak to you, firſt, that are <hi>young</hi> Prodigals, you that are young like myſelf. This Call is in a ſpecial Manner for you. I know what it is to be a great Sinner, I know what it is to play the Prodigal, perhaps more than any of you; and I hope I can ſay through Grace, <hi>The Lord is my Righteouſneſs.</hi> And O my Heart's Deſire, my Prayer to God is, that you alſo may know the Lord to be <hi>your</hi> Righteouſneſs. Dear young Men, you are going on in Chambering and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and you know very well that the Lord is <hi>not</hi> your Righteouſneſs: What ſhall I ſay to you? Curioſity has brought many of you here; however it is good to be where <hi>the Lord is paſſing by.</hi> Who knows but the Lord Jeſus has ſent ſome poor, light, young Prodigals, to be laid hold on by Grace. Come then, young Men, leave your Husks and feeding of Swine; behold, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father waits for you; your Father is ready to <hi>meet you,</hi> while you are yet <hi>a great Way off</hi>; Sinful, vile as you are, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will fall upon your Neck, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005090_0026_1016A39C1DC4D980"/>
kiſs you, and cover you with a Robe which coſt Jeſus Chriſt his precious Heart's Blood; this is ready for you: Come then, young Men, come away to Chriſt. O my Friends, come feed on Chriſt, taſte of the Redeemer's Love. Behold him with open Arms, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Take me to be <hi>the Lord your Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would next addreſs myſelf to you that are Maids. Come then, young <hi>Maids,</hi> and put on the white Raiment of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Come by Faith, and Jeſus Chriſt will cloath you with his Righteouſneſs; and then ſhall you be beautiful in the Sight of God. God ſhall love you, God ſhall dwell in you and walk in you, for you ſhall be his Daughters.—I would next addreſs myſelf to you that are of <hi>middle Age.</hi> Let me exhort you to ſeek the one thing needful; get an Intereſt in the Lamb of God. Come (guilty as you are) by Faith, and <hi>the Lord</hi> ſhall be <hi>your Righteouſneſs.</hi> I fear there are many <hi>old Sinners</hi> here, gray headed Sinners, that have one Foot in the Grave; a little more Sand being run, your Glaſs will be run out, and yet you are going into another World without taking Chriſt to be your Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. O poor Sinners, ſtop a little; away to Chriſt, and then tho' it be at the eleventh Hour, Jeſus Chriſt will abundantly pardon you. Tho' you are grown old in Sin, yet
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005090_0027_1016A39EF743C038"/>
you may have the Lord for your Righteouſneſs.—Ye <hi>little Boys</hi> and <hi>Girls,</hi> you may have Jeſus Chriſt. Dear Lambs, if you can but cry to God to take your Heart, and cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt will hear you, and cloath you with his Righteouſneſs. I might hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpeak to little Children, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has wrought upon the Hearts of little Children. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of little Children in <hi>America</hi> have been brought to Chriſt; ſome of ſix Years of Age. God is there pouring out his Spirit in a remarkable Manner. God forbid of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> that the God of your Fathers ſhould not be the God of their Children.—O my Brethren, my Heart's Deſire, my Prayer to God is, that the Lord may make you <hi>willing in a Day of his Power.</hi>— I cannot ſpeak, I can do nothing without Chriſt; but I do not believe Jeſus Chriſt ſent me here for nothing. Pray for <hi>Power,</hi> to come and lay hold on <hi>the Lord</hi> to be <hi>your Righteouſneſs.</hi> I know, you cannot come of yourſelves; but are you willing to come? Are you crying to God, to bring you to Jeſus Chriſt? May God put into your Heart theſe good Deſires; and may you find no Reſt, till you find your Reſt in Chriſt, and can ſay with full Aſſurance of Faith, <hi>The Lord Jeſus is our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
