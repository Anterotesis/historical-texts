            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FORASMUCH, as there have been many Diſputes ariſen of late concerning the <hi>Medium of Exchange</hi> in this Colony, which have been occaſioned chiefly by Reaſon of our having ſuch large Quantities of Paper <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on ſome of the Neighbouring Governments, paſſing in Payments among us, and ſome of thoſe Governments having iſſued much larger Sums of ſuch Bills than were neceſſary to ſupply themſelves with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent <hi>Medium of Exchange,</hi> and not having ſupplied their Treaſuries with any Fund for the maintaining the Credit of ſuch Bills; they have therefore been continually depreciating and growing leſs in their Value, and have been the principal Means of the Depreciation of the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> emitted by this Colony, by their paſſing promiſcuouſly with them; and ſo have been the Occaſion of Much Embarraſment and Injuſtice, in the Trade and Commerce of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>olony, and many People and eſpecially Widows and Orphans have been great Sufferers thereby. But our Legiſlature having at length taken effectual Care to prevent a further Depreciation of the <hi>Bills</hi> of this Colony, and the other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not having taken the like prudent Care, their <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> are ſtill ſinking in their Value, and have in Fact ſunk much below the Value of the <hi>Bills</hi> of this Colony. Yet ſome People among us, by long Cuſtom, are ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in Favour of a ſinking Medium, and others not being really ſenſible of the true State of the Caſe, are inclined to think that <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the neighbouring Governments ought to be a legal Tender in Payments in this Colony for all Debts due by Book and otherwiſe where there is no ſpecial contract expreſsly mentioning ſome other Currency, and others being of a different Opinion, the Diſputes have been
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006933_0004_102a9b50df3dd550"/>
carried on ſo far, as to occaſion ſome Expence in the Law, and may be likely to occaſion much more, unleſs prevented by thoſe Prejudices being ſome way removed. And ſince it is a Cauſe wherein every one is more or leſs intereſted, I have ventured to ſhew my Opinion, with a ſincere Deſire to have Peace and Juſtice maintained and promoted in the Colony. Not deſiring any Perſon to approve of my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations any farther than he finds them agreeable to the Principles of Juſtice and right Reaſon.</p>
            <p>THE CASE STATED.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE a Man comes to a Trader's Shop in this Colony to buy Goods, and the Trader ſells him a certain Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Goods and tells him the Price is ſo many Pounds, Shillings and Pence, <hi>(let it be more or leſs)</hi> to be paid at the Expiration of one Year, from that Time, and the Man receives the Goods but their is nothing ſaid either by Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or Buyer, what Currency it is to be paid in, but the Goods are charged according to the Value of <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> Old Tenor on this Colony.</p>
            <p>Now I Query what the Creditor has a Right to demand for a Debt ſo contracted; or what the Debtor can oblige him to accept in Payment?</p>
            <p>The Creditor ſays, that the Debt being contracted in the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> he ought to have what is known by the Laws of ſaid Colony to be Money: And that he has no Right to demand any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>The Debtor ſays, That <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Governments have for many Years paſſed promiſcuouſly with <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on this Colony as Money in all Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>(except ſpecial Contracts)</hi> and that People in general where the Contracts ly at large have expected, and do ſtill expect, that any of the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on any of the Governments in <hi>New-England,</hi> that have obtained a Currency in this Colony will anſwer in Payment, and in as much as the Creditor did not give him any Notice to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when he bought the Goods, therefore he thinks that ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> ought to be accepted in Payment
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006933_0005_102a9b5272068c90"/>
for the aforeſaid Debt. And altho' there is no particular Statute in this Colony, that ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> ſhall be a legal Tender in Payments of Money: Yet the Practice has been ſo univerſal for ſo long a Time, and the Creditor himſelf has both received and paſs'd them as Money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly without making Exceptions againſt them 'till this Debt was contracted, and for many Years all Demands on Book Debts have been for Old-Tenor Money indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, without Diſtinction of Colonies, and Judgments in all Courts have been given thereon accordingly: And any of the aforeſaid <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> have paſs'd in Payment to ſatisfy all Judgments, ſo obtain'd and this univerſal Cuſtom, the Debtor ſaith, ought to be eſteem'd as common Law and ought not without ſome ſpecial Reaſon to be ſet aſide, and that in this Caſe there is nothing ſpecial; and therefore the Creditor ought not to make Demand or obtain Judgment different from the common Cuſtom of the Colony.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this the Creditor ſaith, that altho' <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the neighbouring Governments have for a Number of Years been paſs'd and receiv'd in Payments: Yet it has been only by the voluntary Conſent of the Perſons receiving them, and not becauſe they were under any Obligation to receive them; and that it is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that a Perſon ſhall be obliged to receive any species when it won't anſwer his End, becauſe in Time paſt he has receiv'd it when it would anſwer. And the Creditor further ſaith, that ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> are of no intrinſick Value, and their Extrinſical Value is fluctuating and very uncertain, and therefore it would be unjuſt that any Perſon ſhould be obliged to receive them in Payment as Money in this Colony, (ſince neither the Colony nor any of the Inhabitants thereof are under any Obligation either to Refund ſaid Bills or to maintain the Credit of them) for Money ought to be ſomething of certain Value, it being that whereby other Things are to be valued. And I think it is a Principle that muſt be granted that no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006933_0006_102a9b54b9d5f438"/>
has a Right to impoſe on its Subjects any foreign Currency to be received in Payments as Money which is not of intrinſick Value; unleſs ſuch Government will aſſume and undertake to ſecure and make Good to the Poſſeſſor of ſuch Currency the full Value which they oblige him to receive it for. Becauſe in ſo doing they would oblige Men to part with their Eſtates for that which is worth nothing in it ſelf and which they don't know will ever procure him any Thing. And <hi>Rhode-Iſland Bills of Credit</hi> have been ſo far from being of certain Value and ſecuring to the Poſſeſſor the Value that they were firſt ſtated at, that they have depreciated almoſt four ſeventh Parts in nine Years laſt paſt, as appears by their own Acts of Aſſembly. For in the Year 1743, it appears by the Face of the Bills then emitted that <hi>Twenty-ſeven</hi> Shillings Old-Tenor was equal to one Ounce of Silver. And by an Act of their General Aſſembly paſs'd in <hi>March</hi> laſt, they ſtated <hi>Fifty-four</hi> Shillings Old-Tenor Bills equal to one Ounce of Silver, which ſunk their Value one half. And by another Act in <hi>June</hi> laſt, (viz. 1751) they ſtated <hi>Sixty-four</hi> Shillings in their Old-Tenor Bills equal to one Ounce of Silver. And by another Act in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt they gave Order and Direction to the Courts in that Colony to make Allowance to the Creditors in making up Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Time to Time as the Bills ſhall depreciate for the Future, which ſhows that they expect their <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> to depreciate for the Future. And ſince the Value of the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> depend wholly on the Rate at which they are ſtated and on the Credit of the Government by whom they are emitted and that being the only Reaſon and foundation upon which they obtained their firſt Currency and by which the ſame has been upheld ever ſince their firſt being current, and therefore when the Publick Faith and Credit of ſuch Government is violated, then the Reaſon upon which ſuch Bills obtained their Currency ceaſes and there remains no Reaſon why they ſhould be any longer current.</p>
            <p>And this I would lay down as a Principle that can't be denied that a Debtor ought not to pay any Debts with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006933_0007_102a9b57cb06d0a0"/>
leſs Value than was contracted for, without the Conſent or againſt the Will of the Creditor,</p>
            <p>And the Creditor further ſaith, that his accepting <hi>Rhode-Iſland Bills of Credit</hi> when they ſtood ſtated equal to Silver at <hi>Twenty-ſeven</hi> Shillings an Ounce, can be no Reaſon that he ſhould receive them at the ſame Value when they are ſtated equal to Silver at <hi>Fifty-four</hi> Shillings an Ounce, and ſtill to receive them at the ſame Rate when they are ſo reduced down that <hi>Sixty-four</hi> Shillings is equal to but one Ounce of Silver, and whoever does receive them ſo muſt not only act without, but againſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And the Debtor can't poſſibly plead without any Truth that he expected to pay in <hi>Rhode-Iſland Bills of Credit</hi> at their preſent Value and under their preſent Circumſtances, (any Debts contracted before the aforeſaid Act of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> were publiſhed) becauſe there was no ſuch Thing (as thoſe Bills are under their preſent Circumſtances) exiſting at the Time of Contract, for as was obſerv'd before, the Value of ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> depend wholly upon the Rate at which they are ſtated and on the Credit of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by whom they are emitted, and a <hi>Bill of Credit</hi> for the ſame Sum that is ſtated equal to Silver at <hi>Twenty-ſeven</hi> Shillings an Ounce, muſt be of more than double the Value of one ſtated equal to Silver at <hi>Sixty four</hi> Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings an Ounce if the Credit of the Emitter may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on: But if the Emitter's Credit can't be depended on then neither of the Bills aforeſaid are of any Value, becauſe it is evident that no <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> have any Value in themſelves, but are given to ſecure ſomething of intrinſick Value, to the Poſſeſſor.</p>
            <p>So that the Arguments drawn from Cuſtom are of no Force, becauſe the Reaſons upon which that Cuſtom were grounded do now ceaſe.</p>
            <p>I grant that if any Thing whoſe Value is intrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

accepted in Payments for Debts where there is no ſpecial Agreement for any other Species. But if what is us'd as a <hi>Medium of Exchange</hi> is fluctuating in its Value it is no better than unjuſt Weights and Meaſures, both which are condemn'd by the Laws of GOD and Man, and therefore the longeſt and moſt univerſal Cuſtom could never make the Uſe of ſuch a <hi>Medium</hi> either lawful or reaſonable.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe that Gold or Silver Coines that paſs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Payments at a certain Rate by Tale ſhould have a conſiderable Part of their Weight filed or clipp'd off will any reaſonable Man judge that they ought to paſs for the ſame Value as thoſe of full Weight. But the State of <hi>R—I—d Bills of Credit</hi> is much worſe than that of Coins that are clipp'd, becauſe what is left of thoſe Coins is of intrinſick Value: But the General Aſſembly of <hi>R—I—d</hi> having depreciated their <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> have thereby violated their Promiſe from Time to Time, and there is juſt Reaſon to ſuſpect their Credit for the Future for the ſmall Value which they now promiſe for ſaid Bills, and they have not only violated their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as to the Value pretended to be ſecured to the Poſſeſſor by ſaid Bills; but alſo as to the Time of calling them in and paying the ſame, they having lengthened out the Time Fifteen Years. So that if the Poſſeſſor muſt be kept out of the Uſe of his Money until that Term is expired (and the Bills ſecure nothing to him ſooner.) One Ounce of Silver paid down now, would be worth more than <hi>Seven</hi> Pounds <hi>Ten</hi> Shillings in ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> computing the Intereſt at 6 <hi>per Cent per Annum.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Things conſidered can, any reaſonable Man think that ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> (or rather of no <hi>Credit</hi>) ought to be a legal Tender in Payment of Money in this Colony for Debts, for which the Debtor received Species of much more Value than thoſe Bills provided the Creditor could get the full Value of them in Silver that they are now ſtated at. For it muſt be remembred that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006933_0009_102a9b5d133b9580"/>
according to the State of the Caſe now in Queſtion the Goods were charged according to the Value of Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony. Wherefore upon the whole it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that it would be evidently unjuſt to impoſe <hi>Rhode-Iſland Bills of Credit</hi> in payment for ſuch a Debt, or any other in this Colony, unleſs the Creditor obliged himſelf by a ſpecial Agreement to receive them in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And if he had agreed to receive them in Payment for Debts contracted any Time between laſt <hi>March</hi> and <hi>June</hi> it would be unjuſt to oblige him to take them without three Shillings on the Pound Allowance, for the General Aſſembly of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> depreciated them ſo much in <hi>June</hi> below both their current and ſtated Value in <hi>March</hi> preceding. And to oblige People to receive them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Allowance in this Colony; would be, to be more diſhoneſt than they are in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Colony for they are obliged by Law to make Allowance for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation. But in as much as we are not under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Government and therefore can take no Benefit by their equitable Acts, I ſuppoſe that according to the Rules of the Law, upon a Contract made in this Colony for the Payment of <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> or any of the neighbouring Governments. If the Debtor could not procure ſuch Bills under the ſame Circumſtances that they were at the Time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, the Courts would aſſeſs Damages for <hi>Connecticut</hi> Money, according to the Value of ſuch Bills at the Time of Contract. And the Reaſon is, becauſe if on the one Hand all ſuch Bills ſhould be called in and burnt between the Time of Contract and the Time of Payment it would be unreaſonable to oblige the Debtor to an impoſſibility, and on the other Hand if there ſhould between the Time of Contract and the Time of Payment be an Act paſs'd that all ſuch Bills ſhould be brought into the Treaſurer to be redeemd' by a certain Time or elſe be Outlawed and rendered of no Value and that Time ſhould be expired
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006933_0010_102a9b60815d1f00"/>
before the Time of Payment, or if by an Act of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they ſhould be depreciated and ſunk one half or two third in their Value, it would be unreaſonable that the Creditor ſhould be thereby defrauded of his juſt Due and loſe ſo much of his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>But to impoſe <hi>Rhode-Iſland Bills of Credit</hi> in Payments for Debts in this Colony when the Creditor never agreed to take them, and that without any Allowance for the Deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be to take away Men's Eſtates and wrong them of their juſt and righteous Dues without either Law or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And inſtead of having our Properties defended and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us by the Protection of the Government under which we live; we ſhould be always expoſed to have them taken from us by Fraud at the Pleaſure of other Governments, who have no Right of Juriſdiction over us. And according to this Argument, if <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> General Aſſembly had been pleaſed laſt <hi>June</hi> to have ſtated their Old-Tenor Bills equal to Silver at <hi>Forty-eight</hi> Pounds <hi>Twelve</hi> Shillings an Ounce, inſtead of <hi>Sixty-four</hi> Shillings, and ſo have cut off the Value of them <hi>Eighteen</hi> Shillings on the Pound, inſtead of <hi>Three</hi> Shillings, all Creditors in this Colony would thereby have been neceſſitated to loſe <hi>Ninety</hi> Pounds out of every <hi>Hundred</hi> Pounds of their Debts which were then out ſtanding, for if they could take away one Sixth Part of their Value and reduce them ſo much below the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony and the Creditor be notwithſtanding obliged to receive them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Allowance, by the ſame Rule they might have taken away three Quarters or Nine Tenths or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole, and the Creditor have had no more Remedy than he has now. And the Eſtates of poor Widows and Orphans muſt according to this Principle in the ſame unjuſt Manner be taken away from them and given to others that have no Right to them, (for what the Creditor loſes in this way the Debtor gains becauſe the more the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> depreciate the leſs Value the Debtor can procure them for) and according to the Debtor's
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006933_0011_102a9b62e840c388"/>
Argument the Executive Courts in this Colony muſt give Judgment in Favour of all this Fraud and Iniquity at leaſt, 'till there is ſome ſpecial Act of Aſſembly to order them to the contrary; but I believe that every honeſt Man of common Senſe, upon mature Conſideration of the Circumſtances of the Caſe, will think that this is an Iniquity not to be countenanced, but rather to be puniſhed by the Judges.</p>
            <p>But in Anſwer to what is ſaid concerning Demands being made for Old-Tenor Money indifferently and the Courts giving Judgment accordingly. The Creditor ſaith that Phraſe in all Demands made in this Colony ought to be underſtood to be the Old-Tenor Money of this Colony, and no other, for there never was any Law in this Colony that <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the neighbouring Governments ſhould be a legal Tender in Payments of Money, and I have obſerved before that it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that any ſuch Foreign Currency ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as Money, and the ſame Phraſe is us'd in taxing Bills of Coſt in the Executive Courts, but it is underſtood to be the Old-Tenor Money of this Colony only, for a <hi>Thouſand</hi> Pounds in <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the neighbouring Governments would not be ſufficient in the Law to ſatisfy a Bill of Coſt of <hi>Twenty</hi> Shillings Old-Tenor.</p>
            <p>☞ And the General Aſſembly of this Colony have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared that they don't Eſteem ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> as Money, and that no Perſon ought to be obliged to receive them as ſuch. In that, they themſelves will not receive them for their Wages neither do they oblige any other Perſon whoſe Fees or Wages are ſtated by Law to receive them, but have made Proviſion how they ſhall be paid excluſive of ſuch Bills. And as to the Objection that they have been receiv'd in Payment to ſatisfy all Judgments given as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Creditor ſaith, that it was only by the voluntary Conſent of the Receiver, but there is not the ſame Reaſons that they ſhould be received now at the ſame Value as <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on this Colony that there was formerly becauſe it is evident that there is now a real Difference in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006933_0012_102a9b65c1b076f0"/>
their Values. For by a Law of the Province of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets-Bay,</hi> their Bills of Old-Tenor are ſtated equal to Silver at <hi>Fifty</hi> Shillings an Ounce and <hi>Seven</hi> Shillings and <hi>Six</hi> Pence are equal to <hi>One</hi> Shilling Proclamation Money, and the Executive Courts in this Colony reckon <hi>Eight</hi> Shillings Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony equal to <hi>One</hi> Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Proclamation Money which is equal to Silver at <hi>Fifty-four</hi> Shillings Old-Tenor an Ounce. And by an Act of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> General Aſſembly <hi>Sixty-four</hi> Shillings of their Old-Tenor Bills is ſtated equal to one Ounce of Silver, at which Rate <hi>Nine</hi> Shillings and <hi>Six</hi> Pence is equal to but <hi>One</hi> Shillings Proclamation Money, whereas three Years ago the Bills of Old-Tenor on all the three Governments aforeſaid were of equal Value.</p>
            <p>And ſince it appears, that there is ſuch a Difference in the ſtated Value of the aforeſaid <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> no Man can with any Propriety be ſaid to make them all without Diſtinction, a Standard to value Things by; for a Man could afford to ſell any Goods or Merchandize for a leſs Sum in Old-Tenor Bills of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay,</hi> than for the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony and he could afford to ſell Goods for a leſs Sum by 15 <hi>per Cent</hi> for the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony, than for the Old-Tenor Bills on <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Colony.</p>
            <p>And to ſay that an Accompt is charged in Old-Tenor Money indifferently of this and the neighbouring Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is to ſay that 7<hi>s.</hi>-6<hi>d.</hi> and 8<hi>s.</hi> and 9<hi>s.</hi>-6<hi>d.</hi> are one and the ſame Sum, or that there is no Difference between <hi>Fifty</hi> and <hi>Fifty-four,</hi> or between <hi>Fifty-four</hi> and <hi>Sixty-four</hi> Q. E. D.</p>
            <p>And ſince it appears that it would be evidently abſurd to make a Demand for Old-Tenor Money indifferently of this and the neighbouring Governments, it follows that all Demands made for Old-Tenor Money in this Colony muſt be for the Money of this Colony excluſive of the Old-Tenor of the neighbouring Governments, or elſe for the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006933_0013_102a9b6773fb4bf8"/>
Old-Tenor Money of ſome one of the other Governments excluſive of the Old-Tenor of this and the reſt.</p>
            <p>And ſince nothing but a ſpecial Contract can intitle any Perſon to demand the Money of any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a Debt contracted and demanded in this Colony: It neceſſsarily follows, that all Demands for Debts due by Book, where the Contract lyes at large muſt be for the Money of this Colony only.</p>
            <p>What I would be underſtood to mean by Old-Tenor Money of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut</hi> is, whatſoever is eſtabliſhed by Law in ſaid Colony to paſs, as or in Lieu of Money, rated according to its Value in Old-Tenor Bills on ſaid Colony, and I ſuppoſe that the Words (Old-Tenor) when us'd in Contracts are univerſally <hi>underſtood</hi> to be intended only to aſſertain the Value of the Sum to which they are affixed and they muſt be ſo underſtood when the Executive Courts tax Bills of Coſt in Old-Tenor Money, for they have no Right neither do they mean to exclude Bills of the New-Tenor, or any of thoſe Coins eſtabliſhed by Law (to paſs in Payment for Fees) from being a ſufficient Tender in Payment of ſuch Coſts.</p>
            <p>And now I have gone through with what I firſt propoſed. But perhaps ſome, may be ready to ſay, <hi>that we are ſenſible that it is of bad Conſequence to have a fluctuating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Exchange, but what can be done to Remedy it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer take away the Cauſe, and the Effect will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But it may be further objected, that if it were not for the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the neighbouring Governments, we ſhould have no Money to Trade with, and what ſhould we do for a <hi>Medium of Exchange?</hi> or how could we live without?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that if that were indeed the Caſe, we had better die in a good Cauſe than live in a bad one. But I apprehend that the Caſe in Fact is quite the reverſe, for we in this Colony are ſeated on a very fruitful Soil,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006933_0014_102a9b6ac754d8a8"/>
the Product whereof, with our Labour and Induſtry, and the Divine Bleſſing thereon, would ſufficiently furniſh us with, and procure us all the Neceſſaries of Life and as good a <hi>Medium of Exchange</hi> as any People in the World have or can deſire. But ſo long as we part with our moſt valuable Commodities for ſuch <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> as are no Profit; but rather a Cheat, Vexation and Snare to us, and become a <hi>Medium</hi> whereby we are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cheating and wronging one another in our Dealings and Commerce. And ſo long as we import ſo much more foreign Goods than are neceſſary, and keep ſo many Merchants and Traders employed to procure and deal them out to us: Great Part of which, we might as well make among ourſelves; and another great Part of which, we had much better be without, eſpecially the Spiritous Liquors of which vaſt Quantities are conſumed in this Colony every Year, unneceſſarily to the great Deſtruction of the Eſtates, Morals, Health and even the Lives of many of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>I ſay ſo long as theſe Things are ſo we ſhall ſpend great Part of our Labour and Subſtance for that, which will not profit us. Whereas if theſe Things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Proviſions and other Commodities which we might have to export yearly, and which other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are dependant upon us for, would procure us Gold and Silver abundently ſufficient for a <hi>Medium</hi> of Trade. And we might be as independent, flouriſhing and happy a Colony as any in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions.</p>
            <p>And with Submiſſion I would humbly beg Leave to propoſe it to the wiſe Conſideration of the Honourable General Aſſembly of this Colony; whether it would not be conducive to the welfare of the Colony to paſs ſome Act to prevent the Bills laſt emitted by <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Colony from obtaining a Currency among us. And to appoint ſome reaſonable Time (not exceeding the Term that our <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> are allowed to paſs) after the Expiration of which none of the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi>
               <pb n="15"

or <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> ſhall be allowed to paſs in this Colony, that ſo People having previous Notice thereof may order their Affairs ſo as to get rid of each Bills to the beſt Advantage that they can before the Expiration of ſuch Term.</p>
            <p>And whether it would not be very much for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good to lay a large Exciſe upon all Rum imported in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
