            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>John Bleakley, in the year 1783, before his departure to Europe, appointed William Alliſon his attorney in fact, who at that time owed him as a balance of a former account £816.

               </gap>hem from 1783 to 1787. I accordingly drew out from the company books all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat had come to my knowledge—this I furniſhed, but it was not ſatisfactory. Then William Alliſon put his caſh account for this eſtate into my hands, to draw out a full account of all the monies of Bleakley, had and paid by William Alliſon. This I did—and of courſe all the items of the account drawn from the books of the company, were included in this laſt account of William Alliſon, as the attorney in fact, for John Bleakley, the balance of which was £2518, in his favour: and to make the books of the company conform with this account, the balance of Bleakley's account in them was carried to the credit of William Alliſon. In the ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Sir, Having ſeen an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Dunlap's paper for a complete accountant, for the bank of North America, and being conſcious of my capacity of filling that office with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the inſtitution and with honour to myſelf, and more eſpecially being anxious for an exoneration by payment of the debt due to the bank for which judgment was obtained againſt me in April laſt—I offer my ſervices to fill that office. I have ſignified my intention to John Bleakley the executor of Captain Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon my late partner, and offered to apply two thirds of the ſalary towards the extinguiſhment of ſuch balance as may be found againſt me, on a deciſion of the Supreme Court. As yet I have not received his full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination—but I ſuppoſe ſhould no obſtacle prevent my approval by the directors—Mr. Bleakley will accept the propoſed terms, and relieve me from a long, unprofitable and unneceſſary confinement. As to my fidelity I have no doubt of giving full ſecurity.</q>
