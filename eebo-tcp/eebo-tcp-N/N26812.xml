            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE OF DR. KNIGHT.</head>
            <p>ABOUT the latter end of the month of March, or the beginning of April of the year 1782, the weſtern Indians began to make incurſions upon the frontiers of Ohio, Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Youghagany, and Weſtmoreland counties, which has been their conſtant practice ever ſince the commencement of the preſent war between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of theſe predatory invaſions, the principal officers of the abovementioned counties, namely, Colonels Williamſon and Marſhall, tried every method in their power to ſet on foot an expedition againſt the Wyandot towns, which they could effect no other way than by giving all poſſible encouragement to volunteers. The plan propoſed was as follows: Every man furniſhing himſelf with a horſe, a gun, and one months proviſions, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from two tours of militia duty. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035689_0003_1005F0AE99C5A030"/>
that everyone who had been plundered by the Indians, ſhould if the plunder could be found at their towns, have it again, proving it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> his property: And all horſes loſt on the expedition by unavoidable accident were to be replaced by horſes taken in the enemy's country.</p>
            <p>The time appointed for the rendezvous, or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> meeting of the volunteers, was fixed to be on the 20th of May, and the place, the old <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> town on the weſt ſide of the river Ohio, about forty miles below Fort Pitt by land, and I think about 75 by water.</p>
            <p>Col. Crawford was ſolicited by the Genera<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> voice of theſe weſtern counties and diſtricts to command the expedition. He accordingly ſet out as volunteer and came to Fort Pitt two days before the time appointed for the aſſembling of the men. As there was no ſurgeon yet appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go with the expedition, Colonel Crawford begged the favour of Gen. Irvine to permit me to accompany him, (my conſent having been previouſly asked) to which the General agreed provided Col. Gibſon did not object.</p>
            <p>Having obtained permiſſion of the Colonel. I left Port Pitt on Tueſday, May 1ſt, and the next day about one in the afternoon arrived at the Mingoe bottom. The volunteers had not all croſſed the river until Friday morning the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> companies, chooſing their captains by vote. There were choſen alſo, one Col. Commandant, four field and one brigade-major. There were four hundred and ſixty five who voted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035689_0004_1005F0B026D9B1A8"/>We began our march on Saturday May 25th, making almoſt a due weſt courſe, and on the 4th day reached the old Moravian town <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the river Muskingum, about 60 miles from the river Ohio. Some of the men having loſt their horſes on the night preceding returned home.</p>
            <p>Tueſday the 28th in the evening, Major B<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ton, and Captain Bean, went ſome diſtance <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> camp to reconnoitre: Having gone about one quarter of a mile they ſaw two Indians, upon whom they fired, and then returned to camp. This was the firſt place in which we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, as we underſtood afterwards.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday the 4th of June, which was the eleventh day of our march, about one o'clock, we came to the ſpot where the town of Sandusky formerly ſtood; the inhabitants had moved 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> miles lower down the creek, near the lower Sandusky: But as neither our guides or any who were with us, had known any thing of their removal, we began to conjecture there were no Indian towns nearer than the lower Sandusky, which was at leaſt 40 miles diſtant.</p>
            <p>However, after refreſhing our horſes, we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced on in ſearch of ſome of their ſettlements but had ſcarcely got the diſtance of three or four miles from the old town when a number of our men expreſſed their deſire to return, ſome of them alledging that they had only five days proviſions upon which the field officers and captains, determined, in council, to proceed that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and no longer. Previous to the calling of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> council, a ſmall party of light horſe had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſent forward to reconnoitre.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035689_0005_1005F0B2BA994050"/>
I ſhall here remark, by the way, that there are a great many extenſive plains in that country: The woods in general grow very thin, free from bruſh and underwood; ſo that light horſemen may advance a conſiderable diſtance before an army without being much expoſed to the enemy.</p>
            <p>Juſt as the council ended, an expreſs returned from the above mentioned party of light horſe with intelligence, "that they had been about three miles in front, and had ſeen a large body of Indians running towards them."—In a ſhort time we ſaw the reſt of the light horſe, who joined us, and having gone one mile further met a number of Indians who had partly got poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a piece of woods before us; whilſt we were in the plains but our men alighting from their horſes and ruſhing into the woods, ſoon obliged them to abandon that place.</p>
            <p>The enemy being by this time reinforced, flanked to the right, and part of them coming in our rear, quickly made the action more ſerious. The firing continued very warm on both ſides from four o'clock until the dusk of the evening, each party maintaining their ground. Next morning about ſix oclock ſome guns were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged at the diſtance of two or three hundred yards, which continued till day, doing little or no execution on either ſide.</p>
            <p>The field officers then aſſembled and agreed, as the enemy were every moment increaſing, and we had already a number wounded, to retreat that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight. The whole body was to form into <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, keeping the wounded in the centre.
<pb facs="unknown:035689_0006_100627DA4E83C648"/>
We had four killed and twenty three wounded, of the latter, ſeven very dangerouſly, on which account as many biers were got ready to carry them: Moſt of the reſt were ſlightly wounded and none ſo bad but they could ride on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. After dark the officers went on the out poſts and brought in all the men as expeditiouſly as they could. Juſt as the troops were about to form, ſeveral guns were fired by the enemy, upon which ſome of our men ſpoke out and ſaid, our intention was diſcovered by the Indians who were firing alarm guns. Upon which ſome in front hurried off, and the reſt immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, leaving the ſeven men that were danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wounded, ſome of whom however got off on horſeback, by means of ſome good friends, who waited for, and aſſiſted them.</p>
            <p>We had not got a quarter of a mile from the field of action, when I heard Col. Crawford calling for his ſon John Crawford, his ſon-in-law Maj. Harriſon, Maj. Roſe and William Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, his nephews, upon which I came up and told him I believed they were before us—He asked, was that the Doctor? I told him it was he then replied, they were not in front, and begged of me not to leave him—I promiſed him I would not.</p>
            <p>We then waited, and continued calling for theſe men till the troops had paſſed us. The Colonel told me his horſe had almoſt given out, that he could not keep up with the troops, and wiſhed ſome of his beſt friends to remain with him; he then exclaimed againſt the militia for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035689_0007_100627DCCBADB730"/>
riding off in ſuch an irregular manner, and leaving ſome of the wounded behind, contrary to his orders. Preſently there came two men riding after us, one of them an old man, the other a lad: We enquired if they had ſeen any of the above perſons? And they anſwered they had not.</p>
            <p>By this time there was a very hot firing before us, and, as we judged, near where our main body muſt have been. Our courſe was then nearly ſouth-weſt, but changing it, we went north about two miles, the two men remaining in company with us. Judging ourſelves, to be now out of the enemy's lines, we took a due eaſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, taking care to keep at the diſtance of fifteen or twenty yards apart, and directing ourſelves by the north ſtar.</p>
            <p>The old man often lagged behind, and when this was the caſe never failed to call for us to halt for him. When we were near the Sandusky Creek he fell one hundred yards behind, and bawled out, as uſual, for us to hault. While we were preparing to reprimand him for making a noiſe, I heard an Indian halloo, as I thought one hundred and fifty yards from the man, and partly behind him; and after this we did not hear the man call again, neither did he ever come up to us any more. It was now paſt midnight, and about day break Col. Crawford's and the young man's horſes gave out, and they left them. We purſued our journey eaſtward, and about two o'clock fell in with Capt. Biggs, who had carried Lieut. Aſhly from the field of action,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035689_0008_100627E06E2F6510"/>
who had been dangerouſly wounded. We then went on about the ſpace of an hour, when a heavy rain coming on, we concluded it was beſt to encamp, as we were encumbered with the wounded officer. We then barked four or five trees, made an encampment and a fire, and remained there all that night. Next morning we again proſecuted our journey, and having gone about three miles found a deer which had been recently killed. The meat was ſliced from the bones and bundled up in the skin with a tomahawk lying by it. We carried all with us, and in advancing about one mile further eſpyed the ſmoke of a fire. We then gave the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed officer into the charge of the young man, deſiring him to ſtay behind whilſt the Colonel, the Captain, and myſelf, walked up as cautiouſly as we could toward the fire. When we came to it, we concluded from ſeveral circumſtances ſome of our people had encamped there the preceding night, We then went about roaſting the veniſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when juſt about to march ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one of our men coming upon our tracks. He ſeemed at firſt very ſhy, but having called to him he came up and told us he was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had killed the deer, but upon hearing us come up, was afraid of Indians, hid in a thicket and made off. Upon this we gave him ſome bread and roaſted veniſon, proceeded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together on our journey, and about two o'clock came upon the paths by which we had gone out. Capt. Biggs and myſelf did not think it ſafe to keep the road, but the Colonel ſaid the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035689_0009_1005F09B6537EC70"/>
Indians would nor follow the troops farther than the plains, which we were then conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably paſt. As the wounded officer rode Capt. Biggs' horſe, I lent the Captain mine; the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel and myſelf went about one hundred yards in front, the Captain and the wounded officer in the centre, and the two young men behind. After we had travelled about one mile and a half, ſeveral Indians ſtarted up within fifteen or twenty ſteps of the Colonel and me. As we at firſt diſcovered only three I immediately got behind a large black oak, made ready my piece and raiſed it up to take ſight, when the Colonel called to me twice not to fire; upon that one of the Indians ran up to the Colonel and took him by the hand. The Colonel then told me to put down my gun, which I did. At that inſtant one of them came up to me whom I had formerly ſeen very often, calling me Doctor and took me by the hand. They were Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware Indians of the Wingenim tribe. Captain Biggs fired amongſt them but did no execution. They then told us, to call theſe people and make them come there, elſe they would go and kill them, which the Colonel did, but they four got off and eſcaped for that time. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel and I were then taken to the Indian camp, which was about half a mile from the place, where we were captivated. On Sunday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five Delawares who had poſted themſelves at ſome diſtance further on the road brought back to the Camp, where we lay, Captain Biggs' and Lieutenant Aſhley's ſcalps, with an Indian
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035689_0010_100627E1F2CC0358"/>
ſcalp which Captain Biggs had taken in the field of action: They alſo brought in Biggs' horſe and mine, they told us the two other men got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them.</p>
            <p>Monday morning, the tenth of June, we were paraded to march to Sandusky, about 33 miles diſtant: They had eleven priſoners of us and four ſcalps, the Indians being ſeventeen in number.</p>
            <p>Col. Crawford was very deſirous to ſee a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Simeon Girty, who lived among the Indians, and was on this account permitted to go to town the ſame night, with two warriors to guard him, having orders at the ſame time to paſs by the place where the Colonel had turned out his horſe, that they might if poſſible, find him.— The reſt of us were taken as far as the old town which was within eight miles of the new.</p>
            <p>Tueſday morning, the 11th, Col. Crawford was brought out to us on purpoſe to be marched in with the other priſoners. I asked the Colonel if he had ſeen Mr. Girty?—He told me he had, and that Girty had promiſed to do every thing in his power for him, but that the Indians were very much enraged againſt the priſoners; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Capt. Pipe one of the Chiefs: He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe told me that Girty had informed him that his ſon-in-law, Col. Harriſon and his nephew William Crawford, were made priſoners by the Shawaneſe, but had been pardoned. This Capt. Pipe had come from the towns about an hour before Col. Crawford, and had painted all the priſoner's faces black.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:035689_0011_100627E476D8B5E0"/>As he was painting me he told me I ſhould go to the Shawaneſe towns and ſee my friends. When the Colonel arrived he painted him black alſo, told him he was glad to ſee him and that he would have him ſhaved when he came to ſee his friends at the Wyandot town. When we marched, the Colonel and I were kept back be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Pipe and Wyngenim, the two Delaware chiefs, the other nine priſoners were ſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with another party of Indians. As we went along we ſaw four of the priſoners lying by the path tomahawked and ſcalped, ſome of them were at the diſtance of half a mile from each other. When we arrived within half a mile of the place where the Colonel was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, we overtook the five priſoners that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alive: The Indians had cauſed them to ſit down on the ground, as they did, alſo the Colonel and me at ſome diſtance from them, I was there given in charge to an Indian fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be taken to the Shawaneſe towns.</p>
            <p>In the place where we were now made to ſit down there was a number of ſquaws and boys who fell on the five priſoners and tomahawked them. There was a certain John M'Kinley amongſt the priſoners, formerly an officer in the 13th Virginia regiment, whoſe head an old ſquaw cut off, and the Indians kicked it about upon the ground. The young Indian fellows came often where the Colonel and I were, and daſhed the ſcalps in our faces. We were then conducted along toward the place where the Colonel was afterwards executed; When we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035689_0012_100627E5F9814488"/>
came within about half a mile of it, Simeon Girty met us, with ſeveral Indians on horſeback; He ſpoke to the Colonel, but as I was about one hundred and fifty yards behind could not hear what paſſed between them.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every Indian we met ſtruck us either with ſticks or their fiſts. Girty waited till I was brought up, and asked, was that the Doctor?— I told him, yes, and went toward him reaching out my hand, but he bid me begone, and called me a dam'd raſcal; upon which the fellow who had me in charge pulled me along. Girty rode up after me and told me I was to go to the Shaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aneſe towns.</p>
            <p>When we were come to the fire the Colonel was ſtripped naked, ordered to ſit down by the fire, and then they beat him with ſticks and their fiſts. Preſently after I was treated in the ſame manner. They then tied a rope to the foot of a poſt about fifteen feet high, bound the Colonel's hands behind his back and faſtened the rope to the ligature between his wriſts. The rope was long enough either for him to ſit down or walk round the poſt once or twice and return the ſame way. The Colonel then called to Girty and asked if they intended to burn him? Girty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, yes. The Colonel ſaid he would take it all patiently. Upon this Capt. Pipe, a Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware Chief, made a ſpeech to the Indians, viz. about thirty or forty men, ſixty or ſeventy ſquaws and boys.</p>
            <p>When the ſpeech was finiſhed they all yelled a hedious and hearty aſſent to what had been
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035689_0013_100627E79147EB70"/>
ſaid. The Indian men then took up their guns and ſhot powder into the Colonel's body, from his feet as far up as his neck. I think not leſs than ſeventy loads were diſcharged upon his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> body. They then crowded about him, and to the beſt of my obſervation, cut off his ears: When the throng had diſperſed a little I ſaw the blood running from both ſides of his head in conſequence thereof.</p>
            <p>The fire was about ſix or ſeven yards from the poſt to which the Colonel was tied: It was made of ſmall hickory poles, burnt quite through in the middle, each end of the poles remaining about ſix feet in length. Three or four Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by turns would take up, individually, one of theſe burning pieces of wood and apply it to his naked body, already burned black with the powder. Theſe tormentors preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on every ſide of him, ſo that which ever way he ran round the poſt they met him with the burning faggots and poles. Some of the ſquaws took broad boards upon which they would put a quantity of burning coals and hot embers, and throw on him, ſo that in a ſhort time he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but coals of fire and hot aſhes to walk upon.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe extreme tortures he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Simeon Girty and begged of him to ſhoot him: But Girty making no anſwer he called to him again. Girty then, by way of deriſion, told the Colonel he had no gun, at the ſame time turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to an Indian who was behind him, laughed heartily, and by all his geſtures ſeemed delighted at the horrid ſcene.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035689_0014_100627EB07CF8300"/>Girty then came up to me and bade me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death. He ſaid, however I was not to die at that place, but to be burnt at the Shawneſe towns. He ſwore by G—d I need not expect to eſcape death, but ſhould ſuffer it in all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
            <p>He then obſerved that ſome priſoners had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him to underſtand that if our people had him they would not hurt him; for his part, he ſaid, he did not believe it, but deſired to know my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter; but being at that time in great anguiſh and diſtreſs for the torments the Colonel was ſuffering before my eyes, as well as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of undergoing the ſame fate in two days. I made little or no anſwer. He expreſſed a great deal of ill will for Col. Gibſon, and ſaid he was one of his greateſt enemies, and more to the ſame purpoſe, to all which I paid very little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>Col. Crawford at this period of his ſufferings, beſought the Almighty to have mercy on his ſoul, ſpoke very low, and bore his torments with the moſt manly fortitude. He continued in all the extremities of pain for an hour and three quarters or two hours longer, as near as I can judge, when at laſt being almoſt ſpent, he lay down on his belly: They then ſcalped him and repeatedly threw the ſcalp in my face, telling me "that was my great Captain."—An old ſquaw (whoſe appearance everyway anſwered the ideas people entertain of the Devil) got a board, took a parcel of coals and aſhes and laid them on his back and head after he had been ſcalped: He
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035689_0015_100627EFA2ED8740"/>
then raiſed himſelf upon his feet and began to walk round the poſt: They next put a burning ſtick to him as uſual, but he ſeemed more inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pain than before.</p>
            <p>The Indian fellow who had me in charge now took me away to Capt. Pipe's houſe, about three quarters of a mile from the place of the colonel's execution. I was bound all night and thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from ſeeing the laſt of the horrid ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Next morning, being June 12th, the Indian untied me, painted me black, and we ſet off for the Shawaneſe town, which he told me was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs than forty miles from that place. We ſoon came to the ſpot where the Colonel was burnt, as it was partly in our way; I ſaw his bones laying amongſt the remains of the fire, almoſt burnt to aſhes, I ſuppoſe after he was dead they had laid his body on the fire.</p>
            <p>The Indian told me, that was my Big Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and gave the ſcalp halloo. He was on horſeback and drove me before him.</p>
            <p>I pretended to this Indian I was ignorant of the death I was to die at the Shawaneſe town, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as cheerful a countenance as poſſible and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if we were not to live together as broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in one houſe when we ſhould get to the town? He ſeemed well pleaſed, and ſaid, yes. He then asked me if I could make a wigwam?—I told him I could—he then ſeemed more friendly—we went that day as near as I can judge about 25 miles, the courſe partly ſouthweſt—The Indian told me we ſhould next day come to the town the ſun being in ſuch a direction, pointing nearly ſouth. At
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035689_0016_1005F09CF4B10380"/>
night when we went to reſt I attempted very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to untie myſelf, but the Indian was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigilant and ſcarce ever ſhut his eyes that night. About day break he got up and untied me: He next began to mend up the fire, and as the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> were troubleſome I asked him if I ſhould make a ſmoke behind him? He ſaid, yes. I then took the end of a dogwood fork which had been burnt down to about 18 inches long: It was the longeſt ſtick I could find, yet too ſmall for the purpoſe I had in view: then I picked up another ſmaller ſtick and taking a coal of fire between them went behind him: Then turning ſuddenly about, I ſtruck him on the head with all the force I was maſter of; which ſo ſtunned him that he fell forwards with both his hands into the fire, but ſeeing him recover and get up, I ſeized his gun while he ran off howling in a moſt fearful manner—I followed him with a determination to ſhoot him down, but pulling back the cock of the gun with too great violence I believe I broke the main ſpring. I purſued him, however, about thirty yards ſtill endeavouring to fire the gun, but could not; then going back to the fire I took his blanket, a pair of new mokkiſons, his hopp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, powder horn, bullet bag, (together with the gun) and marched off, directing my courſe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the five o'clock mark; about half an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſunſet I came to the plains which I think are about ſixteen miles wide. I laid me down in a thicket till dark, and then by the aſſiſtance of the north ſtar made my way through them and not into the woods before morning. I proceeded
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035689_0017_100627F26C6D2F28"/>
on the next day and about noon croſſed the paths by which our troops had gone out: Theſe paths are nearly eaſt and weſt but I went due north all that afternoon with a view to avoid the enemy.</p>
            <p>In the evening I began to be very faint, and no wonder; I had been ſix days priſoner; the laſt two days of which I had eat nothing, and out very little the firſt three or four: There were wild gooſeberries in abundance in the woods, but being unripe required maſtication, which at that time I was not able to perform on account of a blow received from an Indian on the jaw with the back of a tomahawk: There was a weed that grew plentifully in that place, the juice of which I knew to be grateful and nouriſhing; I gathered a bundle of the ſame, took up my lodging under a large ſpreading beach tree and having ſucked plentifully of the juice, went to ſleep. Next day I made a due eaſt courſe which I generally kept the reſt of my journey. I often imagined my gun was only wood bound and tried every method I could deviſe to unſcrew the lock but never could effect it having no knife nor any thing fitting for the purpoſe; I had now the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to find my jaw began to mend and in four or five days could chew any vegetable proper for nouriſhment, but finding my gun only a uſeleſs burden left her in the wilderneſs. I had no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus for making fire to ſleep by ſo that I could get but little reſt for the gnats and muſquetoes; there are likewiſe a great many ſwamps in the beach ridge which occaſioned me very often to lie we<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: This ridge through which I travelled is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035689_0018_1005F098F1AFC1D0"/>
20 miles broad, the ground in general very level and rich, free from ſhrubs and bruſh: there are, however, very few ſprings, yet wells might eaſily be dug in all parts of that ridge; the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on it is very lofty, but it is no eaſy matter to make a ſtrait courſe through the ſame, the moſs growing as high upon the ſouth ſide of the trees as on the north. There are a great many white oaks, aſh and hickory trees that grow among the beach timber; there are likewiſe ſome places on the ridge, perhaps for three or four continued miles where there is little or no beach, and in ſuch ſpots, black, white oah, aſh and hickory abound. Sugar trees grow there alſo to a very great bulk: The ſoil is remarkably good, the ground a little aſcending and deſcending with ſome ſmall rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and a few ſprings. When I got out of the beach ridge and nearer the river Muskingum the lands were more broken but equally rich with thoſe before mentioned, and abounding with brooks and ſprings of water: There are alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmall creeks that empty into that river, the bed of which is more than a mile wide in many places: The woods conſiſt of white and black oaks, walnut, hickory and ſugar trees in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abundance. In all parts of the country thro' which I came the game was very plenty, that is to ſay, deer, turkies and pheaſants, I likewiſe ſaw a great many veſtiges of bears and ſome elks.</p>
            <p>I croſſed the river Muskingum about three or four miles below Fort Laurence, and croſſing all paths aimed for the Ohio river. All this time my food was gooſeberries, young nettles, the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035689_0019_100627F75D168880"/>
juice of herbs, a few ſervice berries, and ſome May apples, likewiſe, two young blackbirds and a turripine which I devoured raw. When my food ſat heavy on my ſtomach, I uſed to eat a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wild ginger which put all to rights.</p>
            <p>I came upon Ohio river about five miles below fort M'Intoſh, in the evening of the 21ſt day after I had made my eſcape, and on the twenty ſecond, about ſeven o'clock in the morning, being the fourth day of July, arrived ſafe, though very much fatigued, at the fort.</p>

            <head>A SHORT MEMOIR OF THE WITHIN MENTIONED COL. CRAWFORD.</head>
            <p>COL. CRAWFORD, was about 50 years of age, had been an old warrior againſt the ſavages. He diſtinguiſhed himſelf early as a volunteer in the laſt war, and was taken notice of by Colonel (now General) Waſhington, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for him the Commiſſion of Enſign. As a partiſan he ſhowed himſelf very active, and was greatly ſucceſsful: He took ſeveral Indian towns, and did great ſervice in ſcouting, patrolling and defending the frontiers. At the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this war he raiſed a regiment in the back country by his own exertions: He had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Colonel in the Continental army, and acted bravely on ſeveral occaſions in the years '76, '77, and at other times. He held his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at the time he took Command of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia in the aforeſaid expedition againſt the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; moſt probably he had it with him when he was taken: He was a man of good judgment, ſingular good nature, and great humanity, and remarkable for his hoſpitality, few ſtrangers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the weſtern country, and not ſpending ſome days at the croſſings of the Yochaghany riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where he lived; no man therefore could be more regretted.</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE OF JOHN SLOVER.</head>
            <p>HAVING in the laſt war been a priſoner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Indians many years, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well acquainted with the country weſt of the Ohio I was employed as a guide in the expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Col. William Crawford againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian towns on or near the river Sandusky. It will be unneceſſary for me to relate what is ſo well known, the circumſtances and unfortunate event of that expedition; it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that having on Tueſday the fourth of June fought the enemy near Sandusky, we lay that night in our camp, and the next day fired on each other at the diſtance of three hundred yards, doing little or no execution. In the evening of that day it was propoſed by Col. Crawford, as I have been ſince informed, to draw off with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but at the moment of our retreat the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (who had probably perceived that we were about to retire) firing alarm guns, our men broke and rode off in confuſion, treading down thoſe who were on foot, and leaving the wounded men who ſupplicated to be taken with them.</p>
            <p>I was with ſome others on the rear of our troops feeding our horſes on the glade, when our men
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035689_0022_1005F09E856D09C0"/>
began to break: The main body of our people had paſſed by me a conſiderable diſtance before I was ready to ſet out. I overtook them before they croſſed the glade, and was advanced almoſt in front. The company in which I was, had ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated from me, and had endeavoured to paſs a moraſs; for coming up, I found their horſes had ſtuck faſt in the moraſs, and endeavouring to paſs mine alſo in a ſhort time ſtuck faſt. I ought to have ſaid, the company of five or ſix men with which I had been immediately connected, and who were ſome diſtance to the right of the main body, and had ſeparated from me, &amp;c. I tryed a long time to diſengage my horſe, until I could hear the enemy juſt behind me, and on each ſide, but in vain. Here then I was obliged to leave him. The moraſs was ſo unſtable that I was to the middle in it, and it was with the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that I got acroſs it, but which having at length done, I came up with the ſix men who had left their horſes in the ſame manner I had done; two of theſe, my companions, having loſt their guns.</p>
            <p>We travelled that night making our courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Detroit, with a view to ſhun the enemy, who we conceived to have taken the paths by which the main body of our people had retreated. Juſt before day we got into a ſecond deep moraſs and were under the neceſſity of detaining until it was light to ſee our way through it. The whole of this day we travelled towards the Shawaneſe towns, with a view of throwing ourſelves ſtill farther out of the ſearch of the enemy. About
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035689_0023_100627FF46D5D8F0"/>
ten o'clock this day we ſat down to eat a little, having taſted nothing from Tueſday, the day of our engagement, until this time which was on Thurſday; and now the only thing we had to eat was a ſcrap of pork to each. We had ſat down juſt by a warrior's path which we had not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, when eight or nine warriors appeared. Running off haſtily we left our baggage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but were not diſcovered by the party; for ſculking ſome time in the graſs and buſhes, we returned to the place and recovered our baggage. The warriors had hallooed as they paſſed, and were anſwered by others on our flanks.</p>
            <p>In our journey through the glades, or wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended dry meadows, about twelve o'clock this day we diſcovered a party of Indians in front, but ſculking in the graſs and buſhes were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them. In theſe glades we were in great danger, as we could be ſeen at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In the afternoon of this day there fell a heavy rain, the coldeſt I ever felt. We halted while it rained, and then travelling on we ſaw a party of the enemy about two hundred yards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, but hiding ourſelves in the buſhes, we had again the good fortune not to be diſcovered. This night we got out of the glades, having in the night croſſed the paths by which we had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Sandusky. It was our deſign to leave all theſe paths to the right, and to come in by the Tuſcarawas. We ſhould have made a much greater progreſs, had it not been for two of our companions who were lame; the one having his foot burnt, the other with a ſwelling in his knee, of a rheumatic nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:035689_0024_10062801C4238A30"/>On this day, which was the ſecond after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, one of our company, the perſon affected with the rheumatic ſwelling, was left behind ſome diſtance in a ſwamp. Waiting for him ſometime we ſaw him coming within one hundred yards, as I ſat on the body of an old tree mending my mok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſons, but taking my eye from him I ſaw him no more. He had not obſerved our tracks, but had gone a different way. We whiſtled on our charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and afterwards hallooed for him but in vain. Nevertheleſs he was fortunate in miſſing us, for he afterwards came ſafe into Wheeling. We trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled on until night, and were on the waters of Muskingum from the middle of this day.</p>
            <p>Having catched a fawn this day we made a fire in the evening, and had a repaſt, having in the mean time eat nothing but the ſmall bit of pork I mentioned before. We ſet off at break of day. About nine o'clock the third day we fell in with a party of the enemy about twenty miles from the Tuſcarawas, which is about 135 miles from Fort Pitt. They had come upon our tracks, or had been on our flanks, and diſcovered us, and then having got before had way-laid us, &amp; fired before we perceived them. At the firſt fire one of my companions fell before me, and another juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; theſe two had guns: Tnere were ſix men in company, and four guns, two of theſe rendered uſeleſs by reaſon of the wet, when coming thro' the ſwamp the firſt night; we had tried to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them, but could not. When the Indians fired I ran to a tree, but an Indian preſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fifteen yards before me, deſired me to deliver
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035689_0025_1006280347CABC58"/>
myſelf up and I ſhould not be hurt: My gun was in good order, but apprehending the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind might diſcharge their pieces at me, I did not risk firing, which I had afterwards reaſon to regret when I found what was to be my fate, and that the Indian who was before me and preſented his gun, was one of thoſe who had juſt before fired. Two of my companions were taken with me in the ſame manner, the Indians aſſuring us we ſhould not be hurt. But one in company, James Paul, who had a gun in order made his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and has ſince come into Wheeling. One of theſe Indians knew me, and was of the party by whom I was taken in the laſt war. He came up to and ſpoke to me, calling me by my Indian name, Mannuchcothee, and upbrading me for coming to war againſt them. I will take a moment here to relate ſome particulars of my firſt captivity, and my life ſince.</p>
            <p>I was taken from New River, in Virginia, by the Miameſe, a nation of Indians by us called the Picts, amongſt whom I lived ſix years; afterwards being ſold to a Delaware, and by him put into the hands of a trader, I was carried amongſt the Shawaneſe, with whom I continued ſix years; ſo that my whole time amongſt theſe nations was 12 years, that is, from the eighth to the twentieth year of my age. At the treaty at Fort Pitt in the fall preceding what is called Dunmore's war, which, if I am right, was in the year '73, I came in with the Shawaneſe nation to the treaty, and meeting with ſome of my relations at that place, was by them ſolicited to relinquiſh the life of a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035689_0026_1005F0A05C4E79A8"/>
ſavage, which I did with ſome reluctance, this manner of life having become natural to me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as I had ſcarcely known any other. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted as a ſoldier in the Continental army at the commencement of the preſent war, and ſerved fifteen months. Having been properly diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I have ſince married, have a family, and am in communion with the church.</p>
            <p>To return: The party by whom we were made priſoners had taken ſome horſes, and left them at the glades we had paſſed the day before. They had followed on our tracks from theſe glades; on our return to which we found the horſes and rode. We were carried towachatomakak, a town of the Mingoes and Shawaneſe. I think it was on the third day we reached the town, which when we were approaching, the Indians, in whoſe cuſtody we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, began to look ſour, having been kind to us before, and given us a little meat and flour to eat, which they had found or taken from ſome of our men on their retreat. This town is ſmall, and we were told was about two miles diſtant from the main town, to which they meant to carry us.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants from this town came out with clubs and tomahawks ſtruck, beat and abuſed us greatly. One of my two companions they ſeized and having ſtripped him naked, blacked him with coal and water: This was the ſign of being burnt: The man ſeemed to ſurmiſe it, and ſhed tears. He asked me the meaning of his being blacked; but I was forbid by the enemy in their own language to tell him what was intended.— In Engliſh, which they ſpoke eaſily, having been
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035689_0027_10062804CD0F7D98"/>
often at Fort Pitt, they aſſured him he was not to be hurt. I know of no reaſon for making him the firſt object of their cruelty, unleſs it was that he was the oldeſt.</p>
            <p>A warrior had been ſent to the greater town to acquaint them with our coming, and prepare them for the frolic; for on our coming to it, the inhabitants came out with guns, clubs and toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks. We were told that we had to run to the council houſe, about three hundred yards. The man that was blacked was about twenty yards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, in running the guantlet: They made him their principal object, men, women and children beating him, and thoſe who had guns firing loads of powder on him as he run naked, putting the muzzles of the guns to his body, ſhouting, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looing and beating their drums in the mean time.</p>
            <p>The unhappy man had reached the door of the council houſe, beat and wounded in a manner ſhocking to the ſight: for having arrived before him we had it in our power to view the ſpectacle: it was indeed the moſt horrid that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: They had cut him with their tomahawks ſhot his body black, burnt it into holes with loads of powder blown into him: A large wadding had made a wound in his ſhoulder whence the blood guſhed.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to the declaration of the enemy when he firſt ſet out, he had reaſon to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure when he had reached the door of the council houſe. This ſeemed to be his hope, for coming up with great ſtruggling and endeavour, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hold of the door but was pulled back and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035689_0028_10062808688E7240"/>
drawn away by them; finding they intended no mercy, but putting him to death he attempted ſeveral times to ſnatch or lay hold of ſome of their tomahawks, but being weak could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. We ſaw him borne off and they were a long time beating, wounding, purſuing and killing him.</p>
            <p>That ſame evening I ſaw the dead body of this man cloſe by the council houſe. It was mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led cruelly and the blood mingled with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was rendered black. The ſame evening I ſaw him, after he had been cut into pieces and his limbs and his head about two hundred yards on the outſide of the town put on poles. That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening alſo I ſaw the bodies of three others in the ſame black and mangled condition: Theſe I was told had been put to death the ſame day and juſt before we had reached the town. Their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as they lay were black, bloody, and burnt with powder; two of theſe were Harriſon, and young Crawford. I knew the viſage of Colonel Harriſon, and I ſaw his cloathing and that of young Crawford, at the town. They brought horſes to me and asked if I knew them?—I ſaid they were Harriſon's and Crawford's. They ſaid they were.</p>
            <p>The third of theſe men I did not know, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to have been Col. M'Cleland, the third in command on the expedition.</p>
            <p>The next day the bodies of theſe men were dragged to the outſide of the town, and their carcaſes being given to the dogs, their limbs and heads were ſtuck on poles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:035689_0029_10062809EC1216D8"/>My ſurviving companion ſhortly after we had reached the council houſe was ſent to another town, and I preſume he was burnt or executed in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>In the evening the men aſſembled in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil houſe; This is a large building about fifty yards in length and about twenty five yards wide; and about ſixteen feet in height, built of ſplit poles covered with bark: Their firſt object was to examine me, which they could do in their own language, inaſmuch as I could ſpeak the Miame, Shawaneſe and Delaware languages, which I had learned during my early captivity in the laſt war: I found I had not forgotten theſe languages, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the two former, being able to ſpeak them as well as my native tongue.</p>
            <p>They began with interrogating me concerning the ſituation of our country, what were our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions? our numbers? the ſtate of the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Britain? I informed them Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis had been taken, which next day, when Matthew Elliot, with James Girty, came, they affirmed to be a lie, and the Indians ſeemed to give full credit to their declarations.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I had been treated with ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of kindneſs, but now the enemy began to alter their behaviour towards me. Girty had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, that when he asked me how I liked to live there, I had ſaid that I intended to take the firſt opportunity to take a ſcalp and run off. It was, to be ſure, very probable that if I had ſuch intention, I would communicate it to him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035689_0030_1005F0A5174FB278"/>
man came to me and told me a ſtory of his having lived on the ſouth branch of Potowmac in Virginia, and having three brothers there, he pretended he wanted to get away, but I ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deſign; nevertheleſs he reported that I had conſented to go. In the mean time I was not tied and could have eſcaped, but having nothing to put on my feet, I waited ſome time longer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for this.</p>
            <p>I was invited every night to the war dances, which they uſually continued until almoſt day. I could not comply with their deſire, believing theſe things to be the ſervice of the devil.</p>
            <p>The council laſted fifteen days; from fifty to one hundred warriors being uſually in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſometimes more. Every warrior is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to theſe councils; but only the chiefs or head warriors have the privilege of ſpeaking. The head warriors are accounted ſuch from the number of ſcalps and priſoners they have taken.</p>
            <p>The third day M'Kee was in council, and afterwards was generally preſent. He ſpoke little, and did not ask any queſtions or ſpeak to me at all. He lives about two miles out of the town, has a houſe built of ſquared logs with a ſhingled roof; he was dreſſed in gold laced cloaths. I had ſeen him at the former town through which I paſſed.</p>
            <p>I think it was on the laſt day of the council, ſave one, that a ſpeech came from Detroit, brought by a warrior who had been counſeling with the commanding officer at that place. The ſpeech had been long expected, and was
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035689_0031_1006280D5D25BF08"/>
in anſwer to one ſometime before ſent from the town to Detroit: It was in a belt of Wampum and began with addreſſing them, "My child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren," and enquiring why they continued to take priſoners? "Proviſions are ſcarce; when priſoners are brought in we are obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, and ſtill ſome of them are running away, and carrying tidings of our affairs. When any of your people fall into the hands of the rebels they ſhew no mercy: why then ſhould you take priſoners? Take no more priſoners, my children, of any ſort; man, woman or child."</p>
            <p>Two days after a party of every nation that was near being collected, it was determined on to take no more priſoners of any ſort. They had held a large council, and the determination was, that if it where poſſible they could find a child of a ſpan or three inches long, they would ſhow no mercy to it. At the concluſion of the council it was agreed upon by all the tribes preſent, viz. the Tawaws, Chiappawaws the Wiondots, the Mingoes, the Delawares, the Shawaneſe, the Munſes, and a part of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rokees, that ſhould any of the nation who were not preſent take any priſoner, theſe would riſe againſt them, take away the priſoners and put them to death.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of theſe deliberations I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what was ſaid perfectly. They laid plans againſt our ſettlements of Kentucky, the Falls, and towards Wheeling. Theſe it will be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to mention in this narrative, more eſpecially as the Indians finding me to have
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035689_0032_1006280EE07F6D70"/>
eſcaped, and knowing that I would not fail to communicate theſe deſigns, will be led to alter their reſolutions.</p>
            <p>There was one council held at which I was not preſent: The warriors had ſent for me as uſual, but the ſquaw with whom I lived would not ſuffer me to go, but hid me under a large quantity of skins. It may have been from an unwillingneſs that I ſhould hear in council the determination with reſpect to me, that I ſhould be burnt.</p>
            <p>About this time twelve men were brought in from Kentucky, three of whom were burnt on this day: The remainder were diſtributed to other towns, and all as the Indians informed me, were burnt. This was after the ſpeech came from Detroit.</p>
            <p>On this day alſo I ſaw an Indian who had juſt come into town, and who ſaid that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner he was bringing to be burnt, and who he ſaid was a doctor, had made his eſcape from him. I knew this muſt have been Dr. Knight, who went as ſurgeon of the expedition. The Indian had a wound four inches long in his head which he acknowledged the doctor had given him: he was cut to the ſcull. His ſtory was, that he had untied the doctor, being asked by him to do ſo, the doctor promiſing that he would not go away; that while he was employed in kindling the fire, the doctor ſnatched up the gun, had come behind and ſtruck him: that he then made a ſtroke at the doctor with his knife, which he laid hold of, and his fingers were cut
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035689_0033_100628126F136C10"/>
almoſt off, the knife being drawn through his hand; that he gave the doctor two ſtabs, one in the belly, the other in the back; ſaid the doctor was a great, big, tall, ſtrong man. Being now adopted in an Indian family, and having ſome confidence for my ſafety, I took the liberty to contradict this, and ſaid that I knew the doctor who was a weak, little man. The other warriors laughed immoderately, and did not ſeem to credit him. At this time I was told that Col. Crawford was burnt, and they greatly exulted over it.</p>
            <p>The day after the council I have mentioned about forty warriors accompanied by George Girty came early in the morning round the houſe where I was. The ſquaw gave me up; I was ſitting before the door of the houſe; they put a rope round my neck, tied my arms behind my back, ſtripped me naked, and blacked me in the uſual manner. George Girty as ſoon as I was tied, damned me, and ſaid that I now ſhould get what I had deſerved many years. I was led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to a town diſtant about five miles, to which a meſſenger had been diſpatched to deſire them them to prepare to receive me: Arriving at this town I was beaten with clubs and the pipe ends of their tomahawks, and was kept for ſome time tied to a tree before a houſe door. In the mean while the inhabitants ſet out to another town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two miles diſtant, where I was to be burnt, and where I arrived about three o'clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.</p>
            <p>Here alſo was a council houſe, part of it cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and part of it without a roof. In the part of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035689_0034_100628160EF89888"/>
it where no cover was, but only ſides built up, there ſtood a poſt about ſixteen feet in height, and in the middle of the houſe around the poſt, there were three piles of wood built about three feet high and four feet from the poſt. Being brought to the poſt my arms were tied behind me and the thong or cord with which they were bound was faſtened to the poſt; a rope alſo was put about my neck and tied to the poſt about four feet above my head. During the time they were tying me, piles of wood were kindled and began to flame.</p>
            <p>Death by burning, which appeared to be now my fate, I had reſolved to ſuſtain with patience. The divine grace of God had made it leſs alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me: for on my way this day, I had been greatly exerciſed in regard to my latter end. I knew myſelf to have been a regular member of the church, and to have ſought repentance for my ſins; but though I had often heard of the faith of aſſurance, had known nothing of it; but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this day, inſtantaneouſly by a change wrought upon me ſudden and perceivable as lightning, an aſſurance of my peace made with God ſprung up in my mind. The following words were the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my meditation—"In peace thou ſhalt ſee God. Fear not thoſe who can kill the body. In peace ſhalt thou depart." I was on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a confidence in mind, not to be reſiſted, fully aſſured of my ſalvation: This being the caſe, I was willing, ſatisfied, and glad to die.</p>
            <p>I was tied to the poſt, as I have already ſaid, and the flame was now kindled. The day was
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035689_0035_1006281791293FE0"/>
clear, not a cloud to be ſeen: if there were clouds low in the horizon, the ſides of the houſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from ſeeing them, but I heard no thunder, or obſerved any ſign of approaching rain. Juſt as the fire of one pile began to blaze, the wind roſe; from the time they began to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the fire and to tie me to the poſt, until the wind began to blow, was about fifteen minutes. The wind blew a hurricane, and the rain followed in leſs than three minutes. The rain fell violent, and the fire, though it began to blaze conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, was inſtantly extinguiſhed. The rain laſted about a quarter of an hour.</p>
            <p>When it was over, the ſavages ſtood amazed and were a long time ſilent. At laſt one ſaid, we will let him alone till morning, and take a whole day's frolic in burning him. The ſun at this time was about three hours high. It was agreed upon and the rope about my neck was untied, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſit down, they began to dance around me. They continued dancing in this manner until e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven o'clock at night; in the mean time, beating kicking, and wounding me with their tomahawks and clubs.</p>
            <p>At laſt one of the warriors, the Half Moon, asked me if I was ſleepy? I anſwered, Yes. The head warrior then choſe out three men to take care of me. I was taken to a block houſe; my arms were tied until the cord was hid in the fleſh; they were tied in two places, round the wriſt and above the elbows. A rope was faſtened about my neck, and tied to a beam of the houſe, but permitting me to lie down on a board. The three
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035689_0036_1006281A60256E60"/>
warriors were conſtantly harraſſing and troubling me, ſaying, "How will you like to eat fire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow—you will kill no more Indians now." I was in expectation of their going to ſleep; when at length, about an hour before day break, two laid down; the third ſmoked a pipe, talked to me, and asked the ſame painful queſtions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour after, he alſo laid down and I heard him begin to ſnore.—Inſtantly I went to work, and as my arms were perfectly dead with the cord, I laid myſelf down upon my right arm which was behind my back, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it faſt with my fingers, which had ſtill ſome life and ſtrength, I ſlipped the cord from my left arm over my elbow and my wriſt. One of the warriors now got up and ſtirred the fire: I was apprehenſive that I ſhould be examined, and thought it was over with me; but my hopes revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when now he lay down again. I then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to unlooſe the rope about my neck, tried to gnaw it but in vain, as it was as thick as my thumb and as hard as iron, being made of a buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faloe hide: I wrought with it a long time, gave it out, and could ſee no relief. At this time I ſaw day break and heard the cock crow: I made a ſecond attempt almoſt without hope, pulling the rope by putting my fingers between my neck &amp; it, &amp; to my great ſurpriſe it came eaſily untied: It was a nooſe with two or three knots tied over it.</p>
            <p>I ſtept over the warriors as they lay, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got out of the houſe looked back to ſee if there was any diſturbance; I then run through the town into a corn field; in my way I ſaw a ſquaw with four or five children lying aſleep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035689_0037_1006281BE86BD6E0"/>
a tree: Going a different way into the field I untied my arm which was greatly ſwelled and turned black: Having obſerved a number of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the glade as I ran through it, I went back to catch one, and on my way found a piece of an old rug or quilt hanging on a fence which I took with me: Having caught the horſe, the rope with which I had been tied ſerving for a halter, I rode off; the horſe was ſtrong and ſwift, and and the woods being open and the country level, about ten o'clock that day I croſſed the Sciota river at a place by computation fifty full miles from the town. I had rode about twenty miles on this ſide Sciota by three o'clock in the afternoon, when the horſe began to fail and could no longer go on a trot. I inſtantly left him and ran on foot about twenty miles farther that day, making in the whole the diſtance of near one hundred miles. In the evening I heard hallooing behind me and for this reaſon did not halt until about ten o'clock at night, when I ſat down, was extremely ſick and vomited; but when the moon roſe which might have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hours after, I went on and travelled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til day.</p>
            <p>During the night I had a path, but in the morning judged it prudent to forſake the path and take a ridge for the diſtance of fifteen miles in a line at right angles to my courſe, putting back as I went along with a ſtick the weeds which I had bended, leſt I ſhould be tracked by the enemy. I lay the next night on the waters of Muskingum: The nettles had been trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to me after my croſſing the Sciota, having
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035689_0038_1006281FA5200358"/>
nothing to defend myſelf but the piece of a rug which I had found, and which while I rode I uſed under me by way of ſaddle; the briars and thorns were now painful to and prevented me from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the night until the moon appeared: In the mean time I was hindered from ſleeping by the muſquetoes, for even in the day I was under the neceſſity of travelling with a handful of buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to bruſh them from my body.</p>
            <p>The ſecond night I reached Cuſhakim; next day came to Newcomer's town, where I got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven rasberries, which were the firſt thing I ate from the morning in which the Indians had taken me to burn me until this time, which was now about three o'clock the fourth day. I felt hunger very little, but was extremely weak; I ſwam Muskingum river at Oldcomer's town, the river being about two hundred yards wide; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reached the bank I ſat down, looked back and thought I had a ſtart of the Indians if any ſhould purſue. That evening I travelled about five miles, next day came to Stillwater, a ſmall river, in a branch of which I got two ſmall cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh to eat: Next night I lay within five miles of Wheeling, but had not ſlept a wink during this whole time, being rendered impoſſible by the muſquetoes, which it was my conſtant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bruſh away. Next day came to Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſaw a man on the iſland in the Ohio oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to that poſt, and calling to him and asking for particular perſons who had been on the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and telling him I was Slover, at length, with great difficulty, he was purſuaded to come over and bring me acroſs in his canoe.</p>

            <p>ON Wedneſday the 29th day of June, 1785. late in the evening, a large company of armed men paſſed the houſe, on their way to Kentucky: Some part of whom encamped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two miles. Mr. Scott living on a frontier part, generally made the family watchful; but on this calamitous day, after ſo large a body of men had paſſed, ſhortly after night, he lay down in his bed, and imprudently left one of the doors of his houſe open; the children were alſo in bed, and aſleep. Mrs. Scott was nearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, when to her unutterable aſtoniſhment and horror, ſhe ſaw ruſhing in through the door that was left open, painted ſavages with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented arms, raiſing a hideous ſhriek—Mr. Scott being awake, inſtantly jumped out of his bed, but was immediately fired at: He forced his way through the middle of the enemy and got out of the door, but fell a few paces from thence.

to a particular ſpot, and not to move; others ſtabbed and cut the throats of the three youngeſt children in their bed, and afterwards lifted them up and daſhed them down on the floor, near the mother; the eldeſt, a beautiful girl of eight years old, awoke and eſcaped out of bed, and ran to her parent, and, with the moſt plaintive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, cried, "O mama! mama! ſave me"—the mother, in the deepeſt anguiſh of ſpirit, and with a flood of tears, intreated the ſavages to ſpare her child; but, with a brutal fierceneſs, they tomahawked and ſtabbed her in the mothers arms. Adjacent to Mr. Scott's dwelling houſe another family lived, of the name of Ball.— The Indians alſo attacked them at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant they did Mr. Scott's, but the door being ſhut, the enemy fired into the houſe through an opening between two logs, and killed a young lad, and then eſſayed to force the door open; but a ſurviving brother fired through the door, and the enemy deſiſted, and went off: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the family ran out of the houſe and eſcaped. In Mr. Scott's houſe were four good rifles well loaded, and a good deal of clothing, and furniture, part of which belonged to people that had left it on their way to Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky. The Indians loaded themſelves with the plunder, being 13 in number, then ſpeedily made off, and continued travelling all night; next morning their chief allotted to each man his ſhare and detached nine of a party to ſteal horſes from the inhabitants of Clinch. The eleventh day after Mrs. Scotts captivity, the four Indians that
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035689_0041_10062827A6FDC020"/>
had her in charge, ſtopped at a place fixed upon for a rendezvous, and to hunt, being now in great want of proviſions. Three went out, and the chief, being an old man, was left to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> care of the priſoner, who, by this time, expreſſed a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs to proceed to the Indian towns, which ſeemed to have the deſired effect of leſſening her keeper's vigilance. In the day time, as the old man was graining a deer skin, the captive pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on her ſituation, and anxiouſly looking for an opportunity to make her eſcape, took the reſolution, and went to the Indian careleſsly, asked liberty to go a ſmall diſtance to a ſtream of water, to waſh the blood off her apron, that had remained beſmeared ſince the fatal night of the murder of her little daughter. He told her in the Engliſh tongue "go along;" ſhe then paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, his face being in a contrary direction from that ſhe was going, and he very buſy. She after getting to the water, proceeded on without delay, made to a high barren mountain, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled until late in the evening, when ſhe came down into the valley, in ſearch of the track ſhe had been taken along; hoping thereby to find the way back, without the risk of being loſt, and periſhing with hunger in uninhabited parts. On coming acroſs the valley to the river ſide, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the eaſterly branch of Kentucky river, ſhe obſerved in the ſand, tracks of two men, that had gone up the river, and had juſt returned. She concluded theſe to have been her purſuers, which excited emotions of gratitude and thankfulneſs to divine providence for ſo timous a deliverance.

Being without any proviſions, having no kind of weapon or tool to aſſiſt her in getting any, and being almoſt deſtitute of cloathing, alſo knowing that a vaſt tract of rugged high mountains inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, between where ſhe was and the inhabitants eaſtwardly, and the diſtance of the Kentucky ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements unknown, and ſhe almoſt as ignorant as a child of the method of ſteering through the woods, excited painful ſenſations. But certain death, either by hunger or wild beaſts, ſeemed preferable rather than to be in the power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who had excited in her mind ſuch horror. She addreſſed heaven for protection, and taking courage, proceeded onward. After travelling three days, ſhe had nearly met with the Indians, as ſhe ſuppoſed, that had been ſent to Clinch to ſteal horſes, but providentially hearing their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, concealed herſelf among the cane, until the enemy had paſſed. This giving a freſh alarm and her mind being filled with conſternation, ſhe got loſt, proceeding backwards and forwards for ſeveral days; at length ſhe came to a river, that ſeemed to come from the eaſt; concluding it was Sandy river, ſhe accordingly reſolved to trace it to its ſource, which is adjacent to the Clinch ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements. After proceeding up the ſame ſeveral days, ſhe came to where the river runs through the great Laurel mountain, where is a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous water-fall, and numerous high craggy cliffs along the water edge; that way ſeemed impaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the mountain ſteep and difficult: However, our mournful traveller concluded that the latter way was the beſt. She therefore aſcended for
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035689_0043_1006282B52E013B8"/>
ſome time, but coming to a range of inacceſſible rocks, ſhe turned her courſe towards the foot of the mountain and the river ſide; After getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep gulley, and paſſing over ſeveral high ſteep rocks, ſhe reached the river ſide, where, to her inexpreſſible affliction, ſhe found that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular rock or rather one that hung over of 15 or 20 feet high, formed the bank. Here a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn pauſe took place; ſhe eſſayed to return, but the height of the ſteeps and rocks ſhe had deſcended over, prevented her. She then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the edge of the precipice, and viewed the bottom of it, as the certain ſpot to end all her troubles, or remain on the top to pine away with hunger, or be devoured by wild beaſts. After ſerious meditation, and devout exerciſes, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on leaping from the height, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly jumped off. Although the place ſhe had to alight was covered with uneven rocks, not a bone was broken; but, being exceedingly ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the fall, ſhe remained unable to proceed for ſome ſpace of time. The dry ſeaſon cauſed the river to be ſhallow—ſhe travelled in it, and where ſhe could, by its edge, until ſhe got thro' the mountain, which ſhe concluded was ſeveral miles. After this, as ſhe was travelling along the bank of the river, a venemous ſnake bit her on the ancle: She had ſtrength to kill, and knowing its kind, concluded that death muſt ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her. By this time, Mrs. Scott was reduced to a mere skeleton with fatigue, hunger and grief: probably this ſtate of her body was the means, of preſerving her from the effects of the poiſon: be
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035689_0044_1006282CD694E240"/>
that as it may, ſo it was, that very little pain ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the bite, and what little ſwelling there was, it fell into her feet. Our wanderer now left the river, and after proceeding a good diſtance, ſhe came to where the valley parted into two, each leading a different courſe. Here a painful ſuſpence again took place: A forlorn creature, almoſt exhauſted, and certain, if ſhe was far led out of the way, ſhe would never ſee a human creature—During this ſoliloque, a beautiful bird paſſed cloſe by her flattering along the ground, and went out of ſight up one of the valleys.— This drew her attention, and whilſt conſidering what it might mean, another bird of the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in like manner fluttered paſt her, and took the ſame valley the other had done This determined her choice of the way; and in two days which was on the 11th day of Auguſt, ſhe reached that ſettlement on Clinch, called New-Garden; whereas (ſhe is ſince informed by wood men) had ſhe taken the other valley, it would have led her back towards the Ohio. Mrs. Scott relates, that the Indians told her, that the party was compoſed of four different nations, two of whom ſhe thinks they named Delawares and Mingoes.</p>
            <p>She further relates, that during her wandering from the tenth of July to the eleventh of Auguſt, ſhe had no other ſubſiſtance but chewing and ſwallowing the juice of young cane-ſtalks, Saſſaſras leaves, and ſome other plants ſhe did not know the names of; that, on her journey, ſhe ſaw Buffaloes, Elks, Deer, and frequently
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035689_0045_1006282E598B4A98"/>
Bears and Wolves; not one of which, although ſome paſſed very near her, offered to do her the leaſt harm. One day a Bear came near her, with a young Fawn in his mouth, and on diſcovering her, he dropped his prey and ran off. Hunger prompted her to go and take the fleſh and eat it: but on reflection, ſhe deſiſted, thinking that the Bear might return and devour her; beſides ſhe had an averſion to taſte raw fleſh.—Mrs. Scott continues in a low ſtate of health, and remains inconſolable for the loſs of her family, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bewailing the cruel death of her little daughter.</p>
