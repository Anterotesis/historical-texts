            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Prophetic Spirit in the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> foretells four hundred Years before they were accompliſhed, the Things that were to occur at the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>New.</hi> He foretells the coming of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, and of His <hi>Harbinger;</hi> and the <hi>Frame</hi> and the <hi>Fate</hi> of the People, at the Time when theſe Illuſtrious Predictions, were to have their Accompliſhment. There would be a <hi>wicked People,</hi> who ſhould be but <hi>Stubble</hi> in the Day of <hi>Burning Wrath,</hi> which would come from GOD upon the <hi>Jewiſh Nation.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe GOD would <hi>leave neither Root nor

Of theſe it is foretold, <hi>They ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in the Day when I make up my Jewels.</hi> None but <hi>They</hi> ſhall now be owned by the GOD of Heaven, for True <hi>Iſraelites; They,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> aſſociated with them, who ſhould now take the place of the abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>Jews</hi> in the Kingdom of GOD, and be a <hi>Surrogate Iſrael. Theſe</hi> the Glorious GOD, would now wonderfully diſtinguiſh with His Favour: They ſhould be of as much Regard with Him, as any <hi>Jewels</hi> can be to the owner of them.</p>
            <p>THE DOCTRINE whereto I demand your Attention, is This.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, are the <hi>Jewels</hi> of GOD; And there will be a Day, when GOD our SAVIOUR will do <hi>That</hi> for His <hi>Children,</hi> which will be a <hi>making up</hi> of His <hi>Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was a very Inſtructive Action in a Roman Lady; who, when her Friends Viſiting of her, deſired her to ſhow them her <hi>Jewels,</hi> as they
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002766_0005_0FE62C663AE73D28"/>had ſucceſſively, each in their Turn, Shown her <hi>Theirs,</hi> brought in her Well-educated <hi>Children,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>If you would ſee my Jewels, Theſe are They! I have no Jewels comparable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Theſe?</hi> But, How much more Inſtructively, and with an how much more grateful Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, are the Regenerated <hi>Children</hi> of GOD now to be brought forth, and have this Declaration made concerning them; <hi>Theſe are the Jewels of GOD: When GOD ſhall make up His Jewels, theſe will be among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. WE will Enquire, firſt. On what Accounts it is, that the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD are to be look'd upon, as the <hi>Jewels</hi> of the Glorious LORD.</p>
            <p>NOW, In general, The <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, are to Him, what a Valuable <hi>Treaſure</hi> is to the Children of Men. When King <hi>Solomon</hi> had furniſhed himſelf with a ſtore of <hi>Jewels,</hi> he ſaid, Eccl. II. 8. <hi>I gathered me the peculiar Treaſure of Kings.</hi> In the <hi>Wealth</hi> of King <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> we find this Article; 1 Chron. XXXII. 27. <hi>He, made himſelf Treaſuries for precious ſtones, and for all manner of pleaſant Jewels.</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, are to Him, a much more Valuable <hi>Treaſure,</hi> than thoſe <hi>Jewels</hi> were to the <hi>Kings of the Eaſt</hi> The <hi>Great King whoſe Name is Venerable,</hi> ſets a Value on His <hi>Children,</hi> and they are as a <hi>Treaſure</hi> to Him. <hi>Lord, What is Man that thou doſt ſo magnify him!</hi> The Hebrew Word, <hi>Segullah,</hi> which is here tranſlated <hi>Jewels,</hi> carries a <hi>peculiar Treaſure,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002766_0006_0FE62C46D58D22B8"/>in the Signification of it. It leads us to the Promiſe which the Glorious GOD made unto His People; Exod. XIX. 5. <hi>If ye will indeed obey my Voice, ye ſhall be a peculiar Treaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, above all People.</hi> There is an <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of which we are told Pſal. CXXXV. 4. <hi>The Lord hath choſen Iſrael for His peculiar Treaſure.</hi> All that <hi>Fear GOD and work Righteouſneſs in every Nation,</hi> are the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD. All that <hi>Walk according to the Rule</hi> which is given us in the Goſpel of GOD, are the <hi>Iſrael of GOD.</hi> We that are <hi>afar off,</hi> and the Children of ſuch as were <hi>Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael,</hi> yea, though we ſhould be the Children of <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> yet, if we <hi>worſhip GOD in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS,</hi> we are of as much Account with GOD as they that of old had <hi>Confidence in the Fleſh,</hi> and we are the genuine Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Of whatever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are, if we <hi>Live unto GOD,</hi> and <hi>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</hi> we are <hi>Iſraelites indeed.</hi> The Glorious GOD owns us for His <hi>Children;</hi> and we are His <hi>peculiar Treaſure.</hi> 'Tis but a Tranſlation of the <hi>Segullah,</hi> which we render <hi>Jewels,</hi> that the People of GOD, even all the <hi>Redeemed</hi> of the Lord, and the Believers &amp; Followers of the Great REDEEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER, are called, Tit. II. 14. <hi>A Peculiar Treaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY Friends, Let the <hi>Fear of the Lord</hi> be our <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and let us count our ſelves <hi>Rich,</hi> yea, the <hi>Rich Heirs of all things,</hi> in having the Glorious GOD and His CHRIST, for our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002766_0007_0FE62BD2DCF5FC78"/>
               <hi>Portion.</hi> Then our GOD will make <hi>us</hi> His <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and we ſhall be more to Him, than a <hi>whole World</hi> left <hi>lying in Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT we will proceed more particularly to conſider, the Accounts on which theſe XEIMHAIA as we may call them, of GOD our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, may be call'd, The <hi>Jewels</hi> of the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord.</p>
            <p>Firſt. THE <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, How <hi>Dear,</hi> How <hi>Dear,</hi> unto Him are they? No Prince can ſet ſuch a Price upon His <hi>Jewels,</hi> as the Glorious GOD ſets upon His <hi>Children.</hi> He ſays of them, <hi>They are the dearly beloved of my Soul.</hi> He ſays to them, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love.</hi> About this Cabinet of <hi>Jewels,</hi> we find Him ſaying, Iſai. XLIII. 4. <hi>Thou wast precious in my ſight, thou haſt been Honourable; and I have loved thee; Therefore will I give Men for thee, and People for thy Life.</hi> So <hi>precious</hi> are theſe <hi>Jewels,</hi> to the Glorious GOD, that He will <hi>Destroy</hi> every thing that ſtands in the way of the Good which He has to do for them. So <hi>precious</hi> are they, that in Times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Deſolation, He ſets a <hi>Mark</hi> upon them for their <hi>Signal</hi> Preſervation. So <hi>precious</hi> are they, that He gives His <hi>Angels charge</hi> over them, and commits them to the <hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi> with a command unto them, to take theſe <hi>Heirs of Salvation</hi> into their Cuſtody. Yea, the Higheſt among thoſe who <hi>Ride upon the High places of the Earth,</hi> altho' they ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002766_0008_0FE62C49B17FC890"/>he thoſe who wear cloth of Gold, all ſtudded with <hi>Jewels,</hi> are not of ſuch <hi>precious Eſteem</hi> with the Glorious GOD, as His <hi>Children</hi> that <hi>Chuſe the things that pleaſe Him,</hi> though they make never ſo mean an Appearance, and are the <hi>poor People in Vile Raiment,</hi> whom the <hi>Proud Ones</hi> of the Earth, would have to <hi>ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Footſtool.</hi> Indeed, They have nothing in and of themſelves to recommend them unto a <hi>precious Eſteem</hi> with GOD. If GOD have any <hi>Eſteem</hi> for them, <hi>'Tis even ſo, Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſes thee!</hi> The only <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the <hi>Eſteem</hi> which the Glorious GOD has for any, is that <hi>Reaſon of all Reaſons,</hi> His <hi>Good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> which ſays, <hi>I loved thee, becauſe I loved thee.</hi> And it muſt be ſaid, as it is, in Ezek. XVI. 11, 12, 14. <hi>I decked thee with Ornaments, and I put a Jewel on thy Forchead; it was my comelineſs which I put upon thee, faith the Lord GOD.</hi> Even ſo; O Child of GOD, If thou art made a <hi>Jewel,</hi> 'tis from the <hi>Comelineſs</hi> which the <hi>Lord GOD</hi> Himſelf has given to thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly. THE <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, How much <hi>Better</hi> are they, than the <hi>common Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men,</hi> that are no more than ſo? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as much <hi>Better,</hi> as <hi>Jewels</hi> are better than the <hi>common Stones</hi> of the <hi>Street,</hi> and of the <hi>Field!</hi> He was a competent Judge, who ſaid of ſuch; Pſal. XVI. 3. <hi>They are the Saints in the Earth, and the Excellent in whom is all my Delight.</hi> This <hi>Excellent</hi> Man had a Son, who
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002766_0009_0FE62BD2E1D7CD98"/>eſpouſed his Fathers Maxims, and has left this unto us; Prov. XII. 26. <hi>The Righteous is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> They are <hi>Deſireable</hi> Ones: A Change of their <hi>Nature</hi> has made them ſo. The <hi>Love</hi> of GOD and of their Neighbour coming to reign in them, has made them ſo. Theſe <hi>Renewed</hi> Ones, by a <hi>Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work</hi> of GOD upon them, come to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi> Yea, If <hi>Wiſdom excelleth Folly, as far as Light excelleth Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> then theſe <hi>Children of Light</hi> are more <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> than they who <hi>walk in Darkneſs.</hi> Their <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>Excellent Principles,</hi> and their <hi>Practices</hi> are <hi>Excellent Practices.</hi> There are <hi>Engravings</hi> upon theſe <hi>Jewels;</hi> The <hi>Image</hi> of GOD is <hi>Engraved</hi> upon them. There is a <hi>Worth</hi> in them. The Wicked who are <hi>little Worth,</hi> may truly ſay to the leaſt of theſe, <hi>Thou art worth Ten Thouſand of us.</hi> Indeed, they ſtudy to <hi>Do Good;</hi> while the Wicked are but ſo many <hi>Hinder goods.</hi> They are the <hi>Jewels</hi> of the <hi>Societies</hi> they belong unto; inaſmuch as they ſtudy to be <hi>Bleſſings</hi> unto the <hi>Societies.</hi> They <hi>Exalt the City</hi> that has them in it. All that are concerned in them, fare the <hi>Better</hi> for them. They are called, <hi>Profitable Ones.</hi> If there were nothing elſe, yet the very <hi>Prayers</hi> of theſe <hi>Humble Ones,</hi> help to fetch down <hi>Bleſſings</hi> on all about them: When the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Wicked One,</hi> only pull down <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on the Neighbourhood.</p>

Thirdly. THEY <hi>Shine!</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> of GOD have a ſingular <hi>Luſtre</hi> in them. Theſe <hi>Jewe's</hi> have a ſparkling Beauty in them. Their <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> cauſes their <hi>Faces to ſhine;</hi> Their <hi>Wiſdom</hi> gives an <hi>Ornament of Grace</hi> unto them. GOD is <hi>Light;</hi> and they have ſo much of GOD in them, that it may be ſaid of them, <hi>Truly, The Light in them is ſweet.</hi> Yea, it has been ſaid, Phil. II. 15. <hi>Ye ſhine as Lights in the World.</hi> No ſooner did they turn to GOD, but there was that Voice of Heaven over them, <hi>Ariſe and ſhine; for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is ariſen upon thee.</hi> Henceforward, they become <hi>Lights;</hi> Yea, not only <hi>Shining</hi> but <hi>Burning Lights,</hi> and ſuch as are to be <hi>Rejoyced in.</hi> Being <hi>Illuminated of GOD,</hi> they become the <hi>Guides of the Blind,</hi> the <hi>Lights of them that are in Darkneſs,</hi> the <hi>Instructors of the Fooliſh.</hi> They are ſo <hi>Enlightned</hi> from the <hi>Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> that GOD <hi>ſhines</hi> in them. And their <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and their <hi>Example,</hi> is for the <hi>Enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of thoſe that behold them. Their <hi>Path</hi> is as the <hi>ſhining Light.</hi> Of thoſe whom our Lord makes the <hi>Teachers</hi> of others, we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> I. 16. <hi>He had in His Right Hand ſeven Stars. Jewels</hi> are not unlike to <hi>Stars,</hi> for their Brightneſs; and Writers often uſe the Name of the one for the other. To have <hi>Stars in the Hand,</hi> is the fame as to have <hi>Jewels</hi> that are ſet in <hi>Rings</hi> on the Hand. Our Lord makes His Faithful Servants to be <hi>Jewels,</hi> like <hi>Stars</hi> in His Hand; When He makes them <hi>Teachers,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002766_0011_0FE62BD4ADA0D4F8"/>and <hi>Light</hi> is from Him Communicated by them. Yea, Even with Luminous and Ethere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Bodies</hi> beſtowed upon them, they ſhall one Day <hi>Shine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. YEA, more than ſo. The <hi>Children</hi> of GOD are what the SON of GOD Himſelf, wears as His <hi>Ornaments.</hi> He ſhows them for ſuch, and with Pleaſure ſays, <hi>Behold, The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which GOD has given me!</hi> They are the <hi>Jewels</hi> which our SAVIOUR is not only <hi>Arrayed,</hi> but even reckons Himſelf <hi>Adorned</hi> withal. They are ſo, when they <hi>Adorn the Doctrine of GOD our SAVIOUR in all things.</hi> Theſe are they to whom our GOD ſays; Iſai. LXII. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a Royal Diadem in the Hond of thy GOD.</hi> They may indeed be called, <hi>Jewels of the Crown.</hi> Our Glorious Lord, uſes them for His <hi>Crown;</hi> and makes His more than <hi>Royal Diadem</hi> to glitter with them. When our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR ſays, <hi>The Righteous ſhall compaſs me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;</hi> it may be read, <hi>The Righteous ſhall be a Crown unto me.</hi> We find this aſtoniſhing Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity put upon ſome, who were eminent for Holineſs, and Watchfulneſs, and Uſefulneſs; 2 Cor. VIII. 23. <hi>They were the Glory of CHRIST.</hi> Our Great SAVIOUR Exhibits His Choſen and Called Ones, with the effects of His Grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and ſays, <hi>This is the People whom I have thus formed for my ſelf; They ſhew forth
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002766_0012_0FE5F4939DFE2190"/>my Praiſe!</hi> When they have ſuch a <hi>Mind,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Walk,</hi> as He had; and when He has prepared them in <hi>every good Work to do the Will of GOD,</hi> and <hi>wrought</hi> in them what is <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in the ſight of GOD,</hi> &amp; has <hi>Forgiven</hi> their <hi>Iniquities, &amp; Relieved</hi> their <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and <hi>Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> them with His <hi>Kindneſſes,</hi> Now, Helooks on them as a <hi>Glory</hi> to Him. So He produced a <hi>Job</hi> of old, as one of His <hi>Jewels;</hi> &amp; ſaid, <hi>Haſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him? Conſider what a Perfect and Upright Man, there is of my making in him!</hi> And ſo, when He deſcends from Heaven, with ſuch as will have His Work finiſhed on them, He will then be <hi>Glorified in His Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</hi> The King of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurrounded with <hi>Jewels,</hi> and <hi>having every precious Stone for his covering,</hi> has his <hi>Glory</hi> ſo deſcribed unto us; <hi>Thou waſt upon the Holy Mountain of GOD; thou haſt walked up and down in the midst of the stones of Fire.</hi> Our Bleſſed JESUS, being ſurrounded with ſuch as <hi>Delight</hi> in Him, and ſuch as <hi>Derive</hi> the <hi>Beauties of Holineſs</hi> from Him, has <hi>every preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtone for a covering;</hi> and He <hi>walks up and down in the midſt of the ſtones of Fire.</hi> And He ſo diſplays His <hi>Glory</hi> from the <hi>Holy Mountain of GOD unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly. AND will He ſuffer any of them to be loſt? No, He does <hi>Prize</hi> them too much for <hi>That;</hi> They have <hi>Coſt</hi> Him too much for <hi>That.</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> of GOD ſhall be as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002766_0013_0FE5F48F4B8A1DE8"/>much look'd after, as if they were His <hi>Jewels.</hi> GOD the FATHER has betruſted our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR with His <hi>Children</hi> as His <hi>Jewels:</hi> And our SAVIOUR ſays, John X. 27. <hi>They ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my Hand.</hi> All the Attempts of Hell, to ruin the Children of GOD, or to rob Him of His <hi>Jewels,</hi> or break the <hi>Jewels</hi> to pieces, will all come to nothing. Our SAVIOUR will keep a ſtrict <hi>Eye</hi> upon them, and for any to touch them, will be to <hi>Touch the Apple of His Eye.</hi> He has <hi>purchaſed</hi> them out of the Hands into which they had been <hi>forfeited:</hi> And not <hi>Silver,</hi> nor <hi>Gold,</hi> but His own <hi>precious Blood</hi> has been <hi>paid</hi> for them. They are called, <hi>His purchaſed Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi> Hereupon, He is continually <hi>poliſhing</hi> of them, and bringing them into the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Shape,</hi> in the <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of GOD intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them. And, though they <hi>are an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Multitude, which no Man can Number,</hi> yet not one of them ſhall miſcarry. He will anon preſent them all to His Eternal FATHER, <hi>with exceeding Joy;</hi> and in Terms like thoſe; John XVII. 12. <hi>Thoſe that thou baſt given me I have kept; and not one of them is loſt. Lost!</hi> No, They ſhall be <hi>made up.</hi> And in the Day of their being ſo, then, <hi>Seek ye out of the Book of the Lord, and read; no one of theſe ſhall fail,</hi> or be wanting; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord ſhall <hi>gather</hi> them. The Meaning of this, is what remains to be Enquired into.</p>

II. WE muſt Enquire, <hi>When</hi> and <hi>How</hi> it is, that the Glorious LORD will <hi>make up</hi> theſe <hi>Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly; THERE is a Bleſſed <hi>Bundle of Life,</hi> whereof it was once foretold unto a very Bright one among the <hi>Jewels</hi> of GOD; 1 Sam. XXV. 29 <hi>The Soul of my Lord ſhall be bound in the Bundle of Life with the Lord thy GOD.</hi> When a Soul is brought into that <hi>Bundle,</hi> by being brought unto ſincere PIETY, and ſo into the <hi>Life</hi> of GOD; And there ſhall be an <hi>Aſſembling</hi> of every ſuch <hi>Soul,</hi> even, a bringing of them all together in the Enjoyment of <hi>Everlaſting Life;</hi> This is the <hi>making up</hi> of the <hi>Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Firſt Thing to be affirmed, is, That our Glorious LORD <hi>makes up</hi> His <hi>Jewels,</hi> when He <hi>makes them Jewels.</hi> What we read, <hi>I make up my Jewels,</hi> may be read, <hi>I am the Maker of my Jewels.</hi> 'Tis verily ſo; GOD our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, may ſay of all His <hi>Jewels,</hi> what is in Iſai. LX. 21. <hi>They are the Work of my Hands, that I may be glorified.</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, are no better than ſorry <hi>Pebble Stones,</hi> till His Good SPIRIT Enter them, and Refine them, and Sublimate them, and make <hi>New Creatures</hi> of them. That which makes <hi>Jewels</hi> of them, is This; Eph. II. 10. <hi>We are the Workmanſhip of GOD, created in CHRIST JESUS unto good Works.</hi> Learned and Curious Things have been written by Philoſophers, about, <hi>The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of Gems.</hi> But the true <hi>Origin</hi> of theſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002766_0015_0FE62BD4B26D58F8"/>
               <hi>Jewels,</hi> is a marvellous <hi>Work</hi> of GOD upon a miſerable Soul, <hi>Transforming</hi> of it; and the imprinting His <hi>Image</hi> upon it, <hi>from Glory to Glory.</hi> And there is a <hi>making up</hi> of the <hi>Jewels,</hi> in His thus <hi>making</hi> of them to be what now they are; and ſo making a <hi>Seizure</hi> on them. There is an Eternal Purpoſe of <hi>Election,</hi> in which it is decreed, That ſuch a Number of <hi>Jewels</hi> is to be the <hi>Peculiar Treaſure</hi> of GOD; and that ſuch and ſuch Perſons are to make up the Number. In the <hi>Fulneſs of Time</hi> for it, Every <hi>Sinner converted from the Error of his way,</hi> is brought into the Poſſeſſion of GOD, and actually logded among his <hi>Jewels.</hi> On every <hi>Repenting Sinner,</hi> there is this <hi>Joy in Heaven,</hi> [Oh! wilt thou make it, O Goſpelliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul, upon thy being told ſo!] <hi>Lo, A New Acceſſion to the Number of Jewels, with which Heaven is to be Irradiated!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then, Secondly. 'TIS to be further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, That the Final, and more perfect and compleat <hi>making up</hi> of the <hi>Jewels,</hi> will be, <hi>in the Day,</hi> when our Glorious LORD will have his <hi>Jewels</hi> to be all together <hi>with Him, where He is, that they may behold His Glory.</hi> We read 2 Theſ. II. 1. <hi>Concerning the coming of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and our gathering together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him.</hi> Our <hi>gathering together</hi> unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, will be His <hi>making up of His Jewels.</hi> It is in the <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> in the <hi>Future World,</hi> that the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD will
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002766_0016_0FE62C512A662BF8"/>have thoſe Things done for them, which will <hi>make up His Jewels</hi> for Him. The <hi>Jewels</hi> have continually ſomething done towards the <hi>Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them up,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are, upon their Expiration, fetch'd away into the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of GOD. While the <hi>Jewels</hi> are here below, they are in the <hi>Jewellers</hi> Shop, where they are Grinding, and Cleanſing, and Fitting, that they may be <hi>made meet for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> The Glorious LORD fetches them away, One after another, in what He will have to be the moſt <hi>proper Seaſon</hi> for it. And as theſe are <hi>Taking up,</hi> He is therein <hi>making up</hi> the <hi>Jewels,</hi> which He will <hi>bring with Him,</hi> when He comes to the <hi>Raiſing of the Dead.</hi> After the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> we ſhall ſee that wondrous Thing; Heb. XII. <hi>The General Aſſembly of the Firſt-born, which are enrolled in Heaven, and the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect. The Day</hi> when the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly of the Firſt born,</hi> ſhall be brought all together, and the Departed and Separate <hi>Spirits of the Just</hi> ſhall be <hi>made Perfect,</hi> in the <hi>Bodies</hi> deſigned for them; This, This will be <hi>the Day</hi> in which the Glorious LORD will <hi>make up His Jewels.</hi> There will then be ſeen the <hi>Strong City</hi> of GOD, in which he will <hi>ſhew His Marvellous Kindneſs</hi> unto <hi>His Jewels.</hi> Oh! That in the Viſions of GOD, we may be now <hi>carried away,</hi> to a <hi>Great and High Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> where we may ſee that <hi>Great City,</hi> the <hi>Holy Jeruſalem!</hi> Chriſtians, Take a View of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002766_0017_0FE62C67779FAF60"/>the dazzling and charming Spectacle! <hi>It has the Glory of GOD</hi> in it; and its <hi>Light</hi> is <hi>like unto a Stone moſt precious:</hi> And <hi>the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Wall of the City, are garniſhed with all manner of precious Stones.</hi> The Glorious LORD will <hi>make up His Jewels,</hi> by bringing them all into that <hi>Holy City,</hi> and there <hi>filling them with all the fulneſs of GOD,</hi> and cauſing them to <hi>ſhine like the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father;</hi> and GOD ſhall be <hi>All in All</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>¶ WE may now at length Enquire, What IMPROVEMENT we are to make of theſe Things.</p>
            <p>AND here, One might indeed propoſe, What <hi>Uſage</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD ſhould of Right meet withal; What <hi>Reſpect</hi> is due to the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, from a <hi>World,</hi> which, alas, <hi>Knows them not.</hi> Certainly, If the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous GOD looks upon them as His <hi>Jewels,</hi> the People among whom they ſojourn, ſhould not <hi>Mal-treat</hi> them, and look on them as their <hi>Burdens</hi> or their <hi>Blemiſhes.</hi> No, They really are the <hi>Jewels</hi> of the Places wherein they are <hi>Pilgrims:</hi> And all the Citizens of <hi>Zion</hi> muſt count them ſo; Yea, of ſuch an One we read, Pſal. XV. 4. <hi>He honours them that Fear the Lord.</hi> They that have the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> conſpicuous in them, and labour to <hi>Abſtain from all Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Evil,</hi> and contrive as they <hi>have Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do good unto all;</hi> What are theſe but the <hi>Jewels</hi> of the Places where they live? The
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002766_0018_0FE62C52E7EA6240"/>People there ſhould <hi>honour</hi> theſe, as their <hi>Glory,</hi> yea, and their <hi>Defence,:</hi> Not <hi>Perſecute</hi> them with <hi>Indignities,</hi> and <hi>Malignities;</hi> Not ſhut them out, as our <hi>Fooliſh Nation</hi> does at this Day many of them, from Capacities to do <hi>Good Offices</hi> for them. And when theſe <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>Merciful</hi> Ones are <hi>taken away</hi> by <hi>Death;</hi> and theſe <hi>Godly</hi> Ones do <hi>ceaſe,</hi> and the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fail from among the Children of Men,</hi> the People ſhould <hi>lay to heart</hi> every ſuch <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>lament</hi> it as having their <hi>Jewels</hi> therein taken from them; Yea, they ſhould <hi>ſpeak of ſuch in their Lamentations many Days!</hi> But this Advice will be little entertained, by any but ſuch as are alſo come into the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the Temper of the <hi>Jewels;</hi> For, <hi>He that is Right in the way, is an Abomination unto the Wicked!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, To be a little Even with the <hi>Wicked,</hi> before we leave them; It might be propoſed, That a <hi>juſt Contempt</hi> may be caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe <hi>Wicked</hi> Ones, whoſe <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> ſays, <hi>There is no Fear of GOD before their Eyes.</hi> This alſo is a Character, by which the Citizens of <hi>Zion</hi> are diſcovered; <hi>A Vile Perſon is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Eyes of ſuch an One.</hi> Every One who evidently <hi>Hates</hi> GOD, and <hi>Wrongs</hi> His Neighbour, is a <hi>Vile Perſon.</hi> There is One, who has at this Day more Vaſſals than any Monarch upon Earth, but one whom the Book of GOD calls, <hi>A Vile Perſon.</hi> The <hi>Vicar of the Devil</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> is that <hi>Vile Perſon.</hi> Every <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002766_0019_0FE62C67822AE6B0"/>of GOD, and of Right, is worthy to be <hi>Deſpiſed:</hi> and ſhould be <hi>Deſpicable</hi> in our Eyes; The Glorious GOD ſays, <hi>They who deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> Indeed, There are decent <hi>Civilities,</hi> wherewith we are to <hi>Honour all Men,</hi> according to the <hi>Stations</hi> wherein GOD has placed them. The <hi>Rules of Good Manners</hi> are to be obſerved with us, towards all that we converſe withal. But yet we muſt preſerve in our Mind a Religious <hi>Distaſte</hi> and a Reaſonable <hi>Diſdain</hi> for thoſe who <hi>declare their Sin as Sodom,</hi> and by notorious Impieties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim themſelves the <hi>Seed of the Serpent.</hi> Theſe <hi>Vipers,</hi> let us <hi>Trample</hi> on them! It is among the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Prov. XXVI. 8. <hi>As he that caſteth a precious Stone into an heap of Stones, ſo is he that giveth Honour to a Fool.</hi> When <hi>Malefactors</hi> were Executed, they laid an <hi>Heap of Stones</hi> on their Graves, and they that paſſed by uſually caſt a <hi>Stone</hi> upon the <hi>Heap.</hi> Would One throw a <hi>precious Stone</hi> on ſuch an <hi>Heap?</hi> There are Impious Ones, worthy to be deem'd <hi>Malefactors,</hi> who are ſo far from <hi>Jewels,</hi> that if they have any <hi>Jewels,</hi> they are only <hi>Jewels</hi> in the <hi>Snouts</hi> of <hi>Swine;</hi> Even the <hi>Harlot</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> has her <hi>Jewels.</hi>—But for us to <hi>give Honour</hi> unto ſuch <hi>Fools,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard-them as we would <hi>Jewels:</hi> 'Tis as bad as <hi>caſting a precious Stone, into an Heap of Stones.</hi> Good Men, and the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, may before they are aware, carry their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too far, in <hi>falling before the Wicked;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002766_0020_0FE7564D2B17DC40"/>and GOD may chaſtiſe them for their Error in it. —</p>
            <p>BUT the main Thing to be preſs'd upon us, is; To preſs after, to make out for, to make ſure of, this Incomparable Felicity; That we may be found among the <hi>Jewels</hi> of GOD, <hi>in the Day when He ſhall make up His Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is foretold, as the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Church in the latter Days; Iſai. LIV. 11, 12. <hi>I will lay thy Foundations with Saphires; and I will make thy Windows of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and all thy Borders of pleaſant Stones.</hi> Oh! That we who belong to this Church, may have our ſhare in this <hi>Glory;</hi> and that we may be <hi>pleaſant Stones</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> of our GOD.</p>
            <p>THE Firſt Thing which we are therefore to be directed to, is; Let us become <hi>the Lord's;</hi> By a moſt Voluntary and Immediate <hi>Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Conſecration</hi> of our ſelves unto Him, let us become <hi>the Lord's.

O Heart-melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Overtures! Let thy Anſwer to theſe Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be That; Pſal. CXIX. 94. <hi>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</hi> The Glorious LORD will now own thee for One of His <hi>Jewels.</hi> And as the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of old, had <hi>Jewels on his Breast-plate,</hi> whereon the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had their Names Engraved: Thou art one of thoſe, whoſe <hi>Names</hi> are Engraven on the <hi>Breast plate</hi> of thy SAVIOUR; He ſets thee as a <hi>Seal upon His Arm.</hi> Thou art with Him, and on Him, and in Him, and as One of His <hi>Jewels,</hi> when He does as the <hi>High Priest</hi> of His People, <hi>Enter within the Vail,</hi> with an <hi>Interceſſion</hi> that <hi>ſaves to the Uttermoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Second Thing whereto we are to be directed, is This; Let us <hi>Have Jewels,</hi> and we ſhall <hi>Be Jewels.</hi> Let us obtain as much as we can of thoſe things, which are the moſt <hi>Ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Jewels.</hi> You ſhall now be pointed unto ſome <hi>Ineſtimable Jewels;</hi> whereof you are to be adviſed, let not ſuch ſorry <hi>Barley-Corns,</hi> as the beſt Things of this World, be, (as in the Ancient Parable) preferr'd with you, before ſuch <hi>Inestimable Jewels.</hi>

            <p>Firſt. WHAT Think you of a Glorious CHRIST? Verily, A CHRIST, A CHRIST, is what you read; Mat. XIII. 46. <hi>A Pearl of Great Price.</hi> An <hi>Union</hi> with a CHRIST: Oh!
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002766_0022_0FE62C52ED4FCAE0"/>No ſuch <hi>Pearl</hi> as <hi>That;</hi> An <hi>Intereſt</hi> in a CHRIST; A Dying Hour will teach you to Value it above a Thouſand Worlds, if you do not ſo before. Well; This Glorious CHRIST now offers Himſelf unto you all; He ſays, <hi>I am willing to be Thine.</hi> Oh! Thankfully, Heartily, Preſently embrace the Offer, and ſay, <hi>I have Unſearchable Riches for mine, if I have Thee for mine, O my SAVIOUR.</hi> We read; Prov. XVII. 8. <hi>A precious Stone, whitherſoever it turns, it proſpers.</hi> What? Shall ſuch a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stone</hi> as This be tendered, and ſhall it not <hi>proſper,</hi> and make its way, and find Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>whitherſoever it is tendered?</hi> O Criminal Stupidity! O Prodigious Ingratitude!</p>
            <p>AGAIN; What think you of thoſe Things, which are called, <hi>The Fruits of the Spirit!</hi> When we read of, <hi>Pure Religion and Undefiled,</hi> it is an Alluſion to a <hi>Jewel,</hi> that firſt is no <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> and then has no <hi>Flaws</hi> in it. Let us become full of <hi>Pure and Undefiled Religion,</hi> and we ſhall have with us a <hi>Jewel,</hi> which there can be no Exception to. But Lo, It will transform us into itſelf; We ſhall by it be rendred ſuch. A Diſpoſition to <hi>Walk with GOD,</hi> in all the Exerciſes of Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: What are theſe <hi>Graces,</hi> but ſo many <hi>Jewels?</hi> The Soul that has them, is <hi>the Kings Daughter, all Glorious within,</hi> from the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of them. The <hi>Clothing</hi> which covers the Joints or Limbs of ſuch a Soul, is like <hi>Jewels,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002766_0023_0FE62BDCC4D86310"/>the Work of the Hands of a Cunning Workman.</hi> Here are thoſe Things, which <hi>cannot be valued with the precious Onyx and the Sapphires; The Price is above Rubies; The Topaz of Ethiopia ſhall not equal them.</hi> They are, as we are told, 1 Pet. III. 4. <hi>Ornaments of great Price in the ſight of GOD.</hi> Now, Come to your SAVIOUR for theſe <hi>Graces.</hi> Come to Him, <hi>Of whoſe Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> with them you ſhall <hi>receive.</hi> Come to Him, on that Encouragement, <hi>If any lack Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let him ask, and it ſhall be given him:</hi> The <hi>Jewels</hi> are to be had for <hi>Asking</hi> for.</p>
            <p>ONCE more; What Think you of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> in the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD? The <hi>Good Words</hi> provided for the <hi>Hearts that are ſtooping with Heavineſs?</hi> How can you reckon them any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſo many <hi>Jewels?</hi> The Value of every One among thoſe Glittering and Peerleſs <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of GOD;</hi> Oh! 'Tis beyond all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation! Whole Rocks of <hi>Diamonds</hi> are not worth ſo much as one of theſe <hi>Jewels.</hi> We are told, 2 Pet. I. 4. <hi>They are exceeding Great and Precious Promiſes.</hi> Now lay hold on theſe <hi>Comforts.</hi> The <hi>Jewels</hi> become your own, upon your laying hold on them. <hi>Take</hi> them, and you <hi>Have</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Finally; WHATEVER you attain unto, yet never be <hi>Jewels</hi> in your own Eyes. Ly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the <hi>Duſt.</hi> Yea, Be not Impatient, if <hi>Man</hi> as well as GOD lay you in the <hi>Duſt,</hi> and if you ſee your ſelves <hi>Deſpiſed and Reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Men.</hi> See nothing Valuable in your
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002766_0024_0FE62C5D592E9C08"/>ſelves; But forever ſay as one of the moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Jewels</hi> did; Job XL. 4. And, XLII. 6. <hi>Behold, I am Vile; I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> Indeed, thou haſt a <hi>Soul,</hi> O Man, a <hi>Soul</hi> which thou ſhouldeſt always eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem as a <hi>Jewel</hi> too precious to be thrown away. But, for <hi>Thy ſelf,</hi> Oh! Let not thy Heart be vainly lifted up, for any thing that GOD may do for thee, and by thee.</p>
            <p>¶ WHILE I am ſpeaking theſe Things I call to Mind, that upon the Death of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Gentlewoman, in the Primitive Church, there was that Expreſſion uſed; <hi>Ex Annulo Eccleſiae Monile Perdidimus:</hi> The <hi>Ring</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> has dropt a <hi>Jewel</hi> that belonged unto it.</p>
            <p>AND this draws on a Remark, That thro' the <hi>Marvellous Kindneſs</hi> of GOD ſhown unto this Part of His <hi>Holy City,</hi> Poor NEW ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND notwithſtanding all our Deficiencies and Miſcarriages, and very abaſing Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, has had His <hi>Jewels</hi> brightening of it, in as good a Proportion, as perhaps any Region, on the Face of an Earth covered with a <hi>Flood</hi> of Ignorance and Wickedneſs. Yea, ſuch the Number of them, that the Adverſaries of this poor People, and they that go to Abuſe them, and Oppreſs them, or Damnify that <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> which is continually producing the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones of Zion</hi> among them; Alas, They <hi>Know not what they do!</hi> The <hi>Milſtone</hi> which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002766_0025_0FE62BDCC9B8D0B8"/>our SAVIOUR has told them of, would not be more uneaſy than the Doom to which they Expoſe themſelves. But how great a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Female Sex</hi> has afforded of theſe, is a Thing to be particularly conſidered, for the Glory of the REDEEMER, <hi>Born of a Woman,</hi> who has Glorified His <hi>Grace,</hi> in what they have received from Him. Theſe have not only been the <hi>Grandmothers</hi> of all the Good that has been done; and oftentimes, the <hi>Instructors</hi> that have Qualified and Inſtigated their Offspring to do it; but alſo been the <hi>Inſtances</hi> of much Good, and the more Immediate and very Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Doers</hi> themſelves, of more than a little. The <hi>Handmaids</hi> of the Lord, who bore their part in the <hi>Firſt Planting</hi> of this Wilderneſs, ought forever to have their ſhare in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Juſt,</hi> for their <hi>Virtues.</hi> And how many of their <hi>Daughters,</hi> have like them, <hi>Done Virtuouſly!</hi> — The <hi>Handmaids</hi> of the Lord, who have had their Souls betimes <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their SAVIOUR; and <hi>Lived by the Faith of the SON of GOD;</hi> and had their Lives filled with the <hi>Religion of the Cloſet,</hi> and the <hi>Devotion of the Temple;</hi> and ſtudied how to be <hi>Bleſſings</hi> in all <hi>Relations;</hi> and been Prayerful, Patient, Humble <hi>Croſs-bearers;</hi> and have at laſt gone away Triumphing over the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</hi>

AMONG Theſe, there appears a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Commemoration</hi> due,
<note place="margin">[Mrs. ELIZABETH COTTON.]</note> to a Valuable &amp; Honourable GENTLEWOMAN, lately retired from us into the <hi>Chambers</hi> of the Bleſſed: ONE Deſcended of a Family, [that of SAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TONSTAL] that has for now Four Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, made a Figure among us; And a Genuine SISTER, to the late moſt accompliſhed and never-to-be-forgotten GOVERNOUR of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> as well as many Years the <hi>Conſort,</hi> and then for ſome Years the <hi>Widow</hi> of a worthy <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who for ſome time did worthily in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Her Early PIETY; [which began to ſhow itſelf at Thirteen Years of Age, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto a more <hi>Confirmed State</hi> in an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> to Her SAVIOUR, when ſhe was firſt a <hi>Widow forſaken in Youth,</hi> by the <hi>Praemature Death</hi> of a moſt Hopeful Young Miniſter, of whom the Bereaved and Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Flock in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> had ſaid, <hi>This ſame ſhall Comfort us!</hi>] The Uncommon Prudence of her <hi>O Economy;</hi> The Large Number of <hi>Well-Educated Children,</hi> that ſhe has preſented unto the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; whereof this Happy <hi>Mother in Iſrael,</hi> had the Conſolation to ſee ſeveral become Well-Eſteemed <hi>Paſtors</hi> of Churches; The Generous <hi>Aſſiſtences</hi> that ſhe often gave to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in their various <hi>Afflictions;</hi> The <hi>Reſiſh</hi> that ſhe had for the Enjoyments in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of her GOD; And indeed her whole <hi>Behaviour;</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:002766_0027_0FE62C6E2820C038"/>has beſpoke a grateful Remembrance of her, and a <hi>Name</hi> in the Enumeration of thoſe whom our GOD, when he ſhall <hi>make up His Jewels</hi> will doubtleſs allow a place unto.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoke <hi>Nothing,</hi> but what I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>All the City of my People</hi> do think, that it is <hi>True,</hi> and that I have done well to ſpeak it.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral ſhort Monuments of her Pen, wherein ſhe has <hi>Written Excellent Things:</hi> and what in a more Public View would be highly Serviceable to the cauſe of PIETY.</p>
            <p>THERE is one of them ſo expreſſive and ſo Inſtructive, that it may well paſs for the Beſt part of my Sermon, if I now give to you all, and particularly the Daughters of our <hi>Zion,</hi> the Benefit of hearing it Read unto you. Tis the Inſtrument of her <hi>Marriage</hi> to her SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, which when ſhe was a very Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe thus Compoſed;</p>
            <q>

            <head>A Few ſhort <hi>Memorials</hi> of that Vertuous Woman, Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Cotton.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MRS. ELIZABETH COTTON was only Daughter to the late Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Colonel <hi>Nathanael Saltonstall,</hi> and Siſter to the late Honourable <hi>Gurdon Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſtall</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>; the Memorable Governour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SHE was born <hi>September</hi> 15. 1668. She was Marryed firſt unto Mr. <hi>John Deniſon,</hi> a Young Gentleman of Uncommon Accompliſhments and Expectations; of whom the Church of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> hoped, <hi>Under his ſhadow we ſhall ſit many Years!</hi> and he was a <hi>Paſtor</hi> to them, of whoſe <hi>Fruit</hi> they taſted with an Uncommon ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By him She had the late Col. <hi>John Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> But became his Diſconſolate Widow in the Year 1689.</p>
            <p>SHE was after this Married unto Mr. <hi>Roland Cotton</hi> the Faithful Miniſter of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002766_0031_0FE62BDDD577B270"/>Died in the beginning of the Year 1722. By whom ſhe has <hi>Ten Children</hi> left Surviving (<hi>Five</hi> of them <hi>Sons</hi>) who with Hearts full of Sorrow, and calling her <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> followed her unto the Grave in <hi>Boſton;</hi> where ſhe was found Prepared and Ripened for the Heavenly World; on <hi>July</hi> 9. 1726.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Dorcas</hi> was Dead they produced the Effects of her <hi>Needle,</hi> as Teſtimonies for her.</p>
            <p>On the Death of this Gentlewoman we will produce Two or Three Effects of her <hi>Pen,</hi> which we will ſingle out from others, becauſe of a ſingular Adaptation in them to ſerve ſome <hi>Deſigns</hi> of PIETY which are of much more Concern to us, than the <hi>Praiſes</hi> of the Deceaſed. And in ſo doing, though we do not what <hi>Peter</hi> did for <hi>Dorcas,</hi> after her Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet we ſhall in ſome ſort <hi>preſent her Alive</hi> unto the People of GOD, and ſtill in ſome Degree have her with us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IT may be of conſiderable Uſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto our <hi>Young People,</hi> and moſt of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of the <hi>Female Sex;</hi> to Read what ſhe wrote of, <hi>Reflections on the State of her Soul,</hi> when ſhe was but <hi>Thirteen</hi> Years of Age.</p>
            <q>
               <p>IT has pleaſed GOD by the Striving of his SPIRIT on my Heart (which I a long
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002766_0032_0FE62C5E6279ED80"/>time neglected) to put me upon <hi>ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi> of the Certainty of <hi>Death,</hi> the Uncertainty of <hi>Life,</hi> the Inſtability and Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of any of theſe <hi>Creature Enjoyments,</hi> the Excellency of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> and of <hi>CHRIST JESUS</hi> who ſo freely offered Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin, the Unavoidableneſs of appearing before the Juſt <hi>Judge of the whole World</hi> at the Great and Laſt Day; The <hi>Endleſs Joy</hi> of ſuch who in this Life do make ſure to themſelves an Intereſt in CHRIST; the Everlaſting Duration of the <hi>Wicked</hi> in that <hi>Torment</hi> which is ineffable and intollerable.</p>
               <p>THESE <hi>Conſiderations</hi> put me on an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> (with the Jaylor) <hi>What ſhall I do to be Saved?</hi> Where I found an Anſwer ready; <hi>Believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou ſhalt be Saved.</hi> But I found an <hi>impotency</hi> in in my ſelf to <hi>believe,</hi> to <hi>repent,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> to do any <hi>good Thing</hi> after a right manner. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when I was Ruminating on ſuch things as theſe, I thought it my Duty to ask, <hi>If I ever intended to receive;</hi> for to ſuch is given a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> Matth. 7.7. <hi>Ask and it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you, ſeek and ye ſhall find.</hi> I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it was my Duty to <hi>pray.</hi> But I knew not <hi>how</hi> to perform this Duty; and was many times <hi>diſcouraged</hi> therein, by thinking on ſuch like Texts of Scripture as theſe. <hi>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002766_0033_0FE62C700B2CF258"/>to the Lord</hi> —. And, <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my Covenant into thy Mouth?</hi> I I do verily think and fear, my <hi>preſent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is ſuch, that I am as yet alienated and eſtranged from GOD and His Ways. I take no <hi>Delight</hi> in doing his Will, and yet go on to <hi>Omit</hi> known Duties and <hi>commit</hi> manifeſt Sins. When I <hi>pray,</hi> it is but in a cold for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Manner; and though I am thoroughly convinced of the Indiſpenſible Neceſſity of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in CHRIST, and the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin; and alſo the <hi>readineſs</hi> of GOD to grant it to them that deſire it; Yet ſuch is the backwardneſs of my Heart, that I am <hi>not willing</hi> to <hi>forſake Sin,</hi> though by foregoing the ſame I obtain everlaſting Salvation, and by retaining it I incur Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation. Much Comfort I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from many Places of Scripture of late; In particular theſe; Iſaiah. 1.17, 18. And 43.25. Ezek. 16.6, 8, 9. And 36.26, 27.</p>
               <p>I have had many thoughts concerning my <hi>future State</hi> and Condition; but not ſo many (I fear) as to put me upon the Practice of the Apoſtle's Advice, of <hi>working out my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> but I do yet continue in a <hi>State of Nature,</hi> in a Graceleſs Condition, and in ſuch a State, that if the Judge of the whole World ſhould Summon me <hi>this Night</hi> to appear before him, I ſhould periſh for Ever. So that ſometimes when I
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002766_0034_0FE62BC6D660DDD8"/>ſeriouſly conſider of theſe things, The <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> of my Soul, <hi>Eternity,</hi> The <hi>laſt Judgment,</hi> and the Nature of the <hi>Judge,</hi> His <hi>Juſtice, Omniſcience, Power;</hi> I know not which way to turn my ſelf. Then whilſt I am in this frame of Spirit (which is not <hi>long,</hi> for this <hi>Zeal</hi> is but Temporary and Tranſient) I put <hi>ſerious Questions</hi> to my Soul; ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Immortal Soul! How canſt thou ſleep this Night, or take any Repoſe, whilſt thou art in ſuch a periſhing State? If thou ſhouldast be called for this Night, what wouldſt thou do? Where wouldeſt thou appear? Is this thy Condition? Art thou an Heir of Hell? Ah Woful State! Fly then to the Lord JESUS CHRIST for His Mercy!</hi> But, Oh, My Fears! That Rock on which I fear moſt to be daſh'd, is, Not <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,</hi> and deſpondency (as I do think) For I <hi>hope</hi> by divine Aſſiſtance (without which I ſhall run into all manner of Evils) I ſhall not fall into <hi>Deſpair;</hi> for hi herto I have found no Propenſity <hi>that way;</hi> I am fully convinc'd of the <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> of GOD, his being <hi>able</hi> to Save me, and to Pardon my Sins. And as I am convinced of his being <hi>able,</hi> ſo alſo am <hi>I</hi> of his being <hi>willing</hi> to Save. For he is a <hi>Gracious, Merciful, Tender hearted GOD.</hi> He is willing to ſave <hi>all</hi> that come to Him by Faith in Chriſt. But this is that
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002766_0035_0FE62BE26FCE9620"/>Rock on which <hi>I</hi> fear <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſuffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck; <hi>Carnal Security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> find this <hi>Repentance</hi> to be an hard Work; A difficult Work! <hi>I</hi> muſt part with <hi>Boſom Sins,</hi> and a <hi>Right Eye,</hi> and a <hi>Right Hand,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> will be a Diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I muſt <hi>take up a Croſs,</hi> follow a Naked Chriſt, hate Father and Mother; Theſe things make <hi>Repentance</hi> ſo repugnant to Fleſh and Blood, that <hi>I</hi> daily ſay, though not <hi>in Word,</hi> yet <hi>Practically,</hi> and by my <hi>Actions,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> will <hi>ſit at Eaſe in this Life,</hi> though <hi>I</hi> periſh for Ever <hi>hereafter,</hi> rather than take the <hi>Pains</hi> to <hi>Repent. Lord, help me out of this Woſul State!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Conſideration of the <hi>Brevity</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Certainty of Death,</hi> and after that of the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and of <hi>Eternity, I</hi> upon this thought <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Counſel to be the beſt that could be given, Eccl. 12.1. <hi>Remember thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth,</hi> and Health, <hi>before the Evil Days</hi> of old Age and Death <hi>do come.</hi>

                  <hi>I</hi> have too too much cauſe to fear, that if <hi>I</hi> ſhould be taken away by <hi>Sudden Death</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> pray GOD prevent while <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a State of Nature) <hi>I</hi> ſhould be Eternally ſeparated from the Preſence of GOD, which is the <hi>ſoreſt Puniſhment</hi> that can be inflicted on any Creature. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002766_0036_0FE62C5E67367F78"/>when <hi>I</hi> hear a Sermon, I <hi>receive it with Joy,</hi> and Purpoſe Amendment of Life; and when <hi>I</hi> am in Fear or Danger <hi>I Vow</hi> and promiſe to GOD. But when <hi>I</hi> am deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>I</hi> make no Conſcience to perform; ſo that <hi>I</hi> fear my ſelf to be worſe than the <hi>Stony Ground;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> kept the Seed of the <hi>Word, till Perſecution aroſe;</hi> but I forſake it for ſuch and ſuch a ſinful <hi>Vanity,</hi> and hazard Eternal Damnation rather than leave my Senſualities, (for which Sins the Lord humble me!) And ſo, when <hi>I</hi> come to <hi>GOD's Houſe</hi> my mind is not ſo much on the <hi>Word</hi> Preached as it ſhould be. <hi>I</hi> take not that delight in <hi>Reading</hi> the Scripture, nor make that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of doing it daily as <hi>I</hi> ought to do, or ſhould do, were I a Child of GOD. I am too negligent in that Duty of <hi>Private Prayer;</hi> and when I do go to GOD in ſecret, it is but in a <hi>Cold,</hi> Formal Manner. <hi>I</hi> am alſo too much addicted to <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Words.</hi> But notwithſtanding all this, in Reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I find ſome Gracious Invitations to Sinners, Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Iſaiah 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that Thirſteth, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price.</hi> But I thought, theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> did not belong to <hi>me;</hi> for though I had a great <hi>weight of Sin,</hi> yet I was not <hi>weary</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I was without <hi>Senſe</hi> of it; I <hi>thirſted</hi> not after an Intereſt in Chriſt. But then I
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002766_0037_0FE62BE275DF07E8"/>thought there were <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Invitations</hi> againſt which I could bring no Objection; as Matth. 7.7. <hi>Seek and ye ſhall find, Knock,</hi> &amp;c. And Rev. 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, come, and whoſoever will, let him come and take of the Waters of Life freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am throughly convicted, that if I do my <hi>part</hi> towards the <hi>working out of my Salvation,</hi> GOD will not be wanting on <hi>His.</hi> But my Heart is ſo backward to any good, that I am not ſo willing as I ſhould be to do any thing towards my Salvation.</p>

Mr. <hi>Roland Cotton</hi> of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who died in March 1721, 2. by whom ſhe has left Ten Children Surviving, and who followed her to her Grave. Upon the deceaſe of the latter Conſort, ſhe removed with her Family to this Town, where ſhe has liv'd and maintain'd
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002766_0044_0FE62BCEE654F530"/>her diſtinguiſhing Character to the Day of her Death.</p>
            <p>SHE was known to be a Perſon of very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Wit, Knowledge and Virtue from her Youth up. She was of a very agreeable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and every way accompliſh'd to ſhine in the Station wherein Providence ſet her: She was the Honour and Delight of her Husbands: and being endow'd with a very lively and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit, and a rare Diſcretion, Her emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent virtue directed her to imploy them in a moſt exact and induſtrious care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Houſehold, and in a moſt ready aſſiſtance of her Neighbours in all their Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, wherever ſhe ſojourned. Strict in the order of her Family, a great Enemy to Levity and Idleneſs, abounding in excellent Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her Children, more concern'd to ſee them Good and Wiſe than Great in the World. She continually charm'd her Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with Wiſdom, Piety, Diligence, Goodneſs and Uſefulneſs in her lovely Example. The Character of the Virtuous Woman in the XXXI. of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> was in a moſt lively man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner exemplified in Her.</p>
