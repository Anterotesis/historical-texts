            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE and ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.</head>
            <p>I WAS born of a good family, in the city of York, where my father had settled, after his having got a handsome estate by merchandize. My heart began to be very early filled with rambling thoughts; and though, when I grew up, my father often persuaded me to settle to some business, and my mother used the tenderest entreaties, yet nothing could prevail upon me to lay aside my desire of going to sea; and I at length resolved to gratify my roving disposition, notwithstanding the extreme uneas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ness my father and mother always shewed at the thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the prudent and kind advice of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> who was going to sea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024253_0004_0FC5DACEF72B7578"/>
On the first September, 1651, I went on board this ship, which was bound for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and without letting my father know the rash and disobedient step I had taken, set sail; but no sooner was the ship out of the Humber, than the wind began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most terrible manner. Having never been at sea before, I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely sick, and my mind was filled with terror. I then began to grow sensible of my wickedness, in disobeying the best of parents, and their good counsel; tears and entreaties came a fresh into my mind, and filled me with fear and remorse. I expected every wave would swallow us up, and in the agony of my mind, made vows and resolutions, that if it should please God to spare my life in this one voyage, I would go directly home to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and never set soot into a ship again.</p>
            <p>The next day the wind abated, and the sea grew calm, I was no longer sea sick, and my companions laughed at my fears—rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iculed my gravity, and with a bowl of punch made me half drunk, and thus drowned my repentance and all my sober reflections. The weather continued calm for several days, and we at length came into Ya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mouth Road where we cast anchor to wait for a wind. After riding here four or five days, the wind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very hard; the road however being reckoned almost as good as an harbour, we were under no apprehension, but spent the time in rest and mirth, till the eighth day in the mornings
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024253_0005_0FC5DACFFA8AD100"/>
when the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts and cast our sheet anchor.</p>
            <p>It now blew a terrible storm; I began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves; and as the master pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, I could hear him say softly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Lord be merciful to us, we shall all be lost. During the first hurry I was stupid, lying still in my cabin in the steerage. I could ill resume the penitence I had so apparently trampled upon: I even hardened myself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and thought that this storm would pass over like the first. But when the master came by me and said we should all be lost, I was terribly frightened: I got up out of my cabin, and looked about; but such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sight I never before saw; the sea ran <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes: A ship foundered at a distance; two ships that were near us had cut their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by the board; and the mate and boatswar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the master to let them cut away our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast.</p>
            <p>The storm still increased and I saw (what is but too seldom seen) the master, the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swain, and several others at prayers, expecting that every moment the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, who had been down on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cried out we had sprung a leak, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> four feet water in the hold, upon which all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> were called to the pumps. I worked with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024253_0006_0FC5DAD2CDBAD4E0"/>
But the water gained upon us, and it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the ship would founder; the storm however beginning to abate, the master fired guns for help, and a light ship which had rid it out, just a head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard that it came near us; but the men ventured their lives to save ours; and our men casting a rope over the stern with a buoy, they after much labour and hazard got hold of it, and we had hardly left the ship a quarter of an hour when we saw her founder.</p>
            <p>As it was impossible for the boat to get up with the ship to which she belonged, we endeavoured to reach the shore, and partly by rowing, and partly by being driven by the waves we at last with great difficulty got to lands and walked to Yarmouth, where we were received with great humanity.</p>
            <p>Had I now had the sense to return home, my father would have received me with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness: but I was afraid of being laughed at. I remained some time in doubt what course to take; but having money in my pocket, I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to London by land.</p>
            <p>On my arrival in that city. I contracted an acquaintance with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go again; and he told me, that if I would go with him, I should be at no expence and should have the advantage of trading <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> myself. Encouraged by this offer and by the assistance of some friends, I raised 40l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:024253_0007_0FC5DAD401B921B0"/>
which I said cut in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. In this voyage I was continually sick, yet under my worthy friend, I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics, and the rules of navigation—In a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust, which yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in London, at my return, almost 300l.</p>
            <p>I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend (the captain) dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, and having left 200l. in the hands of my friend's widow, I embarked in the same vessel, with one who was our former mate.—This was one of the most unhappy voyages, that ever man made; for as we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

We also crowded all the canvas our yards could spread; but finding that the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship having twelve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I was not carried, as the rest of our men were, to the Emperor's court, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his own slave. My master having the long boat of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish ship, had a cabin built in it, with some small lockers to put in provisions. In this boat he frequently went out a fishing, and as I was most dexterous at catching fish for him, he never went without me. One day he had appointed to go out in this boat with two or three Moors of some distinction, and had therefore sent over night a larger store of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions than usual; and ordered me to get ready two or three fusils of powder and shot, which were on board his ship; for that they designed to have sport at fowling, as well as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. But in the morning he came on board, telling me that his guests had declined going, and ordered me with the man and boy to sail out with the boat, and catch some fish, for his friends were to sup with him.</p>
            <p>At this moment the hopes of my deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance darted into my thoughts, and I resolved to furnish myself for a voyage. I told the Moor that we must not presume to eat our master's bread; he said that was true, and brought a large basket of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and three jars of fresh water into the boat. I knew where my master's case of bottles stood, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by their make to have been taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of some English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat, while the Moor, whom we called Muly, was on shore; and also a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of bees-wax, with a parcel of twines, of which I afterwards made candles, an hatchet, a saw, and a hammer.</p>
            <p>Every thing being prepared, we sailed out of the port to fish; but purposely catching none, I told Muly that this would not do, and that we must stand farther off, which he agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, set the sails, and I having the helm, ran the boat out near a league farther, and then brought her too, as if I would fish, when giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the boy the helm, I stept forwards, and stooping behind the Moor, took him by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, and tossed him overboard into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork and called to me to take him in; but fetching one of the fowling pieces I presented it at him and told him, that if he came near the boat, I would shoot him through the head; but as the sea was calm, he might easily reach the shore. So he turned about, and swam a shore.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, if you will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me. I will make you a great man; but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me, (that is swear by Mahomet, and his father's beard) I must throw you into the sea in too. The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him; he swore to be faithful to me, and go over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> world with me.</p>
            <p>While I was in view of Muly I stood out to sea that he might think me gone to the Streights, as any body in his wits would have
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024253_0010_0FC5DADC8A916DD8"/>
done; but it no sooner grew dark, than I fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly changed my course, and steered to the south, and having a fresh gale of wind I made such sail, that before the end of the next day, I believe I was beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions.</p>
            <p>The principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We entered a creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark; but we then heard such a dreadful roaring and howling of the wild beasts, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. Well Xury, said I, then I won't, but we may then see men who will be as bad to us as those lions: "Then we may give them the shoot gun says Xury, laughing, make them run away;" such English Xury spoke, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing among us slaves. About two or three hours after we saw monstrous great creatures come down to the sea shore, and run into the water, in order to wash and cool themselves, making the most hideous howlings and yell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Xury was dreadfully frightened; but our terror was greatly increased when we saw one of them swimming towards our boat. Xury said it was a lion, and called out to me to weigh the anchor, and put out to sea, and instantly I saw the wild beast within two oars length of us; but though I was much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised; I st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me, that there was no going on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:024253_0012_0FC5DAE20DBD22B8"/>
The next morning Xury asked for one of the jars, and said he would go and seek for water. I asked him why he would go? The boy answered with so much affection, that <hi>I</hi> could not help loving him. "If wild menu come, they eat me, you go away." Well, Xury, said <hi>I,</hi> we will both go, and if the wild men come we will kill them; having hauled the boat as near the shore as we thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, waded to land, carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> did not care to go out of fight of the boat, left any savages should come in canoes down the river; but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled thither; by and by <hi>I</hi> saw him come running towards me, when thinking he might be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by some savages, or wild beasts, <hi>I</hi> ran to meet him; but when <hi>I</hi> came nearer, <hi>I</hi> saw a hare hanging over his shoulder, which he had shot; but the great joy that he came with, was to tell me he had found good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and seen no wild mens.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning, Xury called to me, and told me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we had best go farther off the shore; for says he, look yonder lies a dreadful monster fast asleep. <hi>I</hi> looked where he pointed, and saw it was a great lion; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, charging my three guns, <hi>I</hi> took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> at his head and dispatched him. <hi>I</hi> took off his skin, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun dried it in two days time, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:024253_0013_0FC5DAE377403DC8"/>
After this stop, we still proceeded to the southward for ten or twelve days in hopes of making the river Gambia or Senegal, or of meeting with some European ship, living all the while very sparingly on our provisions, which began to grow short. We now saw that the land was inhabited, and that the people were black, and stark naked. Drawing nearer to land, they ran along the shore a good way, with no weapons in their hands, except one of them, who had a lance. I made signs to them for something to eat, and they making signs to me to stay, I lowered my sail, and lay by; while two of them ran up into to the country, and in less than half an hour returned with two pieces of dried flesh, and some corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but though I was willing to accept it, I was loath to venture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all; for they brought it to the shore, and laying it down, went away, and stood at a distance till we fetched it on board, and then returned.</p>
            <p>At this instant an opportunity offered of obliging them, for two furious wild beasts, one pursuing the other, came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>As I was sailing with a fresh gale of wind by some islands, which I suppose to be those of Cape Verde, and sitting down in the cabin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> jumped out of the cabin, and saw that it was a Portuguese vessel. I instantly stretched out to sea, with all the sail I could make: But, when I began to despair of my ever coming near enough to make any signal to those on board, they perceived me by the help of their glasses, and supposing it same European boat belonging to a ship that was lost, shortened sail, to let me come up.</p>
            <p>On my coming near, they asked me what I was, in Portuguese, in Spanish, and in French; but I understood none of them; at last, a Scots sailor on board called to me, and I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered I was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moor, at Sallee. They then bid me come on board, and very kindly took me in and all my goods.</p>
            <p>My joy at this deliverance was inexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship; but he generously told me, he would take nothing from me; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> said, that all I had should be delivered safe to me, when I came to the Brasils; and that he would save my life on no other terms

than on such as he would be glad to be saved himself, if ever be happened to be in my condition. He offered me 80 pieces of eight for my boat, 40 ducats for the lion's skin, and for my boy-Xury, he offered me 60 pieces of eight, which I was loath to take; for I was unwilling to sell the boy's liberty who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own; but when I told him my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered to give the boy an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian; and Xury readily consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I let the captain have him.</p>
            <p>We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and arrived in All Saints Bay in about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two days. The generous treatment of the captain I can never enough admires; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended me to an honest man who had a sugar-house, with whom I lived till I had learnt the manner of planting and making sugar, after which I took out a letter, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization, purchased a piece of land that was uncured, and became a planter.</p>

and undertakings beyond my reach. I had lived here about four years, and had not only learned the language, but contracted an acquaintance and friendship among my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low planters, and several merchants. I had frequently talked to them of the method of purchasing Negroes on the coast of Guinea, and they being pleased with the project, easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed on me to make a voyage for that purpose. We fitted out a ship of about 120 tons burthen, which carried 6 guns, and 14 men, besides the master, his boy and myself; and had no other cargo, but such toys as were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fit for trading with the Negroes.</p>
            <p>In this vessel I set sail, with the hopes of purchasing slaves, to assist us in our planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and stood to the northward, in order to stretch over to the African coast. We had very good weather for about twelve days; but soon after we had crossed the line, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hurricane drove us quite out of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knowledge, and for many days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not any of us in the ship expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fave their lives.—In this distress one of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I now began to thank God that my life was saved, and rising up, I walked about on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>But I soon found my comforts abate; for I

               </gap>; and looking round I saw no prospect but that on perishing with hunger, or of being devoured by wild beasts; for I had no weapon either to kill any creature for my sustenance, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me from beasts that might desire to kill me for theirs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I then cut a stick for my defence; and placing myself so as not to fall, if I should sleep—being much fatigued, slept comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably till morning.</p>
            <p>When I awaked it was broad day, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear, and the storm abated; but what surprised me most was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the night the ship had been lifted up from the sand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the swelling of the tide, and driven almost as far as the rock, against which I had been dashed. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024253_0020_0FC5DAF80ECFF630"/>
no means of getting aboard, she lying so high, that I could find nothing within my reach; I swam round her twice, and observing a small piece of rope hanging down, I took hold of it, and got into the forecastle. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in the hold; but to my great joy saw that all the ship's provisions were dry; and being well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, and slipping on a waistcoat, filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat as I went about other things.</p>
            <p>As I found several spare yards, and some large spars of wood, I let them down with ropes by the ship's sides, and putting them together I made a raft; placing several pieces of blank and boards upon them.</p>
            <p>I broke open and emptied three of the seamen's chests; then lowered them down upon the raft, and filled them with bread, some dried goat'<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flesh, and three Dutch cheeses. I also let down the carpenter's chest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was worth more to me than a ship load of gold. I next found two good fowling pieces, and two pistols, with some powder-horns, two barrels of powder, and two old rusty swords, all of which I placed on the raft, and set off for the shore—having two or three broken oars, which served to push the raft along. I run it on a flat piece of ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when the water ebbed. I placed my cargo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The next day, considering that I might yet get many useful things out of the ship, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the rigging and sails, I resolved to make a second voyage.

            <p>I now went to work to make a hut, with the sail and some poles; and into it I put every thing that would spoil, either with the sun or rain.—I pilled all the empty chests and casks in a circle round the hut, to fortify it from any sudden attack from man or beast; I blocked up the door with boards, and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

main where thou art. However, upon second thought, <hi>I</hi> took it way—the wind began to rise and blow off shore, I let myself down into the water, and swans to land, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great difficulty, from the weight of the things I had about me, and the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the water.</p>
            <p>It blow very hard all night, and in the morning when I looked out, no more ship was to be seen. I was a little surprised; however, <hi>I</hi> comforted myself with the reflection, that <hi>I</hi> had made the best use of my time. <hi>I</hi> now went in search of a place to fix my dwelling; and found a little plain on the side of a rising hill, which was as steep as the side of a house, so that nothing could come down to me from the top: On the side of this rock was a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low place, like the entrance of a cave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which I resolved to fix my tent. This plain was not above 100 yards broad, and and twice as long, descending to the sea.</p>
            <p>Before I set up my tent, <hi>I</hi> drew an half circle before the hollow place, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended 20 yards, and in this half circle pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into the ground like piles; they stood about five feet out of the ground, sharpen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed on the top. Then <hi>I</hi> took the pieces a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> I had cut in the ship, and laid them it rows one upon another up to the top and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could enter it.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:024253_0023_0FC5DAFE742A33C8"/>
But for many days after I had taken all I could get out of the ship, I could not forbear going up to the top of this hill, and locking out to the sea: I sometimes fancied I saw a sail at a vast distance—pleased myself with the hopes of it; looked steadily at the place till I was almost blind; lost it quite and then bemoaning my lonely situation, wept like a child, and increased my misery by my folly.</p>
            <p>But before the above works were completed a sudden storm of thunder and lightning filled me with the greatest error; for my powder suddenly darted into my mind, and my heart sunk within mean the thought that at one blast it might all be destroyed; on which not only my defence but the providing of my food entirely depended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No sooner as the storm over, when I laid aside every other work to make a number of boxes and bags, in order to separate my powder; of these I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: I put them into holes, up and down the rocks in such a manner that one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

10th of Sept. 1659. Upon the sides I cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every day a notch, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first day of the month as long again as that long one; and thus I kept weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning.</p>
            <p>I had got from my ship some pens, ink and paper;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some mathematical instruments, and three good bibles, with several other books, which I carefully secured. I also brought to shore with me two cars; and a dog swam on shore who was a trusty servant to me many years; he was so good a companion that I was at a loss for nothing he could fetch me; and he only wanted the power of speech to become a most agreeable friend. Tho' I had amassed so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>When my habitation was finished according to the first plan, I found it far too small to contain my moveables; every thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

it gave me great pleasure to see my goods in such order.</p>
            <p>What a different situation was <hi>I</hi> in now, from that I was afraid of perishing with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or of being devoured by wild beasts!</p>
            <p>But I had scarcely finished my habitation when I had like to have been buried in its ruins. I was at work just in the entrance of my cave, when all of a sudden the earth came tumbling down from the hill, and the ground shook violently under me. There were three shocks at about eight minutes distance, such as I believe would have overturned the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est building; and about half a mile from me a great piece of rock fell down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the most terrible noise I ever heard.

            <p>In rummaging among my things, <hi>I</hi> found a little bag with a few husks of corn in it. I took and shook it out by the side of my forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. This was just before some heavy rain, and about a month afterwards I saw some green stalk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shooting out of the ground; but how great was my astonishment, when I saw about ten or twelve cars of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024253_0026_0FC5DB0A83640EA8"/>
me terribly, imagining I should die for want of proper help. This fit of illness proved a violent ague, which made me so weak I could hardly carry my gun, and when the fit was on me, I was almost perished with thirst. One night as I was ruminating on my sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, expecting the return of my fit, it occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to my thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Brasilians took no physic but tobacco, and I went, directed by Heaven, to search for some in a chest, and there found a bible; <hi>I</hi> brought both that and the tobacco to my table; <hi>I</hi> steeped some of the last in rum, some <hi>I</hi> burnt in a pan of coals, holding my head over the fume, and some I chewed; during the interval of this operation, I opened my book, and the first words on which I cast my eyes were, "Call upon me in the day of trouble, and <hi>I</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee." The words struck me; but <hi>I</hi> could read no more; for the tobacco made me excessive sleepy. <hi>I</hi> therefore went to bed, and falling into a sound sleep. <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> slept two days; for <hi>I</hi> lost a day in my reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, which <hi>I</hi> could no other way account for; another dose of this remedy quite cured me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> dug up a piece of ground with a wooden spade of my own making, and began to sow my grain, which answered my wishes, and my crop amounted to half a peck of each kind.</p>
            <p>One day I took a ramble—armed myself with a gun, a hatchet, and guarded by my faithful dog. It being a clear day, I plainly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024253_0027_0FC5DB0BF7C972C8"/>
discovered land; but whether island or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not tell; but guessed that it could not be less than 20 leagues off. I imagined it was some savage coast, and such indeed it proved. In this journey I caught a young parrot, having knocked it down with a stick; I brought it home with me, and taught it to speak. My dog seized a young kid, and I saved it alive; which afterwards became one of my domestics also, and would never leave me.</p>
            <p>I was now thoroughly resigned to my situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and pretty regularly divided my time between rest and labour. My corn was now coming up, and to defend it, I set my dog to watch, which he did faithfully, and the corn grew and began to ripen apace. I went to see how my harvest throve, and saw my little crop surrounded with fowls of all sorts, I fired among them when there arose a little cloud of fowles from the corn itself. This touched me sensibly, for a single grain might be said in its consequences to be a peck loaf to me. While I was loading my gun again I could see the thieves upon the trees round me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> waiting for my absence, and having gone a little way I turned my head and saw them dropping one by one into my corn.

the place as long as my scare crows hung there.</p>
            <p>When my corn was ripe I made me a scythe with a sword, and cut off none but the ears, which I rubbed out with my hands. At the end of my harvest I guessed that I had two bushels and a half of barley. I kept all this for seed, and had now a tolerable prospect of having as much as I wanted.</p>
            <p>My clothes now began to decay; linen I had been without a good while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was warm, and I had no great need of clothes, yet I was unwilling to be quite nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; besides, the sun blistered my skin, and my head ached if I went without a hat or cap; so I made myself two waistcoats out of some watch coats, which lasted me a great while. I made a cap out of a goat's skin, with the hair side outwards, to throw off the rain, and also another waistcoat of the same skins.</p>
            <p>Three or four years after, I made a little boat, my umbrella, which I had made, serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both for a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This I launched for a sea voyage; but let this be a warning to all rash and inconsiderate pilots: I put off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and found a great ledge of rocks ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about two leagues in the sea, some a ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

saw the full extent of it, and that a most furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous current ran to the east, with a strong eddy nearer the shore, so that I had nothing to do but to get out of the current, and I should presently be in the eddy. I therefore resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to venture.</p>
            <p>The wind, however, blowing pretty hard, I lay here two days, and the third day in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wind having abated in the night, I found the sea calm and set sail; but I no sooner got within the current, than found myself in a great depth of water, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with such violence, that all I could do, could not keep the boat on the edge of it; but I found that it hurried me farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out from the eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with my pad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Now I looked back upon my deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late solitary island<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the most pleasant place in the world; and stretched out my hands to it with eager wishes. O happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to be on there again. I worked hard till my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my

boat as near as possible to that side of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent on which the eddy lay; when about noon I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, blowing towards the shore. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived my spirits, especially when in about half an hour more it blew a small gentle gale. By this time I was gotten at a frightful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the island; and had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I should have been undone another way, for I had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass on board, and should never have known how to have steared towards the island, if I had but once lost fight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I spread my sail, standing away to the north, and got out of the current. They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought them when at the gallows, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may guess what was my present joy; how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy, and spread my sail to the wind, running cheerfully before it, assisted by a strong edd, which carried me about a league back again, directly towards the island, and the breeze still continuing, I reached it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night.</p>
            <p>When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my deliverance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to lay aside all thoughts of escaping from the island in my boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I laid me down to sleep. The next morning I made my way westward, and soon found that I was not
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024253_0031_0FC5DB19009579A0"/>
far off the place where I had been before. I reached my bower in the evening, where I found every thing as I left it.</p>
            <p>I got over the fence, and laid me down to sleep in the shade; but judge my surprise, when I was awaked by a voice calling me by name several times, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe, where are you? Where have you been? I was so dead asleep at first, that I thought I dreamt somebody spoke to me; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin Crusoe, I awaked dreadfully frighted; but no sooner were my eyes open, than I saw my Pol sitting on the hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately called him, and the poor sociable creature came as he used to do, and sat on my thumb, crying, Poor Robin Crusoe, as if he had been overjoyed to see me again.</p>
            <p>I had at length a great mind to go to the point of the island to see how the shore lay, and resolved to travel thither by land. And now, reader, I will give thee a short sketch of the figure I made, I had a great high shapeless cap made of goat's skin, a jacket with the skirts coming down to the middle of my thighs and a pair of open kneed breeches of the same with the goats hair hanging to the middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; but I had made a pair of somethings, I scarce knew what to call them, to flap over my legs like spattersashes, but of a most barbarous shape, and so indeed were all the rest of my
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024253_0032_0FC5DB1FAC5B1270"/>
clothes: I had a broad belt of goats skin dried and in a frog hung on one side a saw, and on the other a hatchet. I had another belt not so broad, fastened over my shoulder. Under my arm hung two pouches for shot and powder; on my back I carried a basket, on my shoulder a gun, and over my head a great clumsy ugly goats skin umbrella. My beard was cut short except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers; but as for my figure I had so few to observe me that it was of no manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
            <p>I was exceedingly surprized with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore which was plainly to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunder struck; I listened; <hi>I</hi> looked round me; <hi>I</hi> could hear nothing, nor see any thing. <hi>I</hi> went upon a rising ground to look farther; I walked backwards and forwards on the shore, but I could see only that one impression; I went to look at it again, there was plainly a foot, toes, heel and every part very distinct: How it came there I knew not; but I hurried home to my fortifications, looked behind me every two or three steps, and fancying every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and stump, to be a man. I had no sleep that night, but my terror gradually wore of, and I ventured down to take measure of the foot by my own, but I found it much larger. This filled me again with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> whimsies and when I went home I began <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> double my fortifications.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:024253_0033_0FC5DB228ABF6F30"/>
After having secured my habitation in the strongest manner possible, I sought for a place of security for my live goats, and at length found a piece of ground which contained about three acres, in the middle of hollow and thick woods, and rendered almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible by nature, so that it cost me but little pains to make it so; and then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved my goats into it.</p>
            <p>After I had thus secured one part of my live stock, I went about the whole island, and rambling more to the western point than I had ever done before, I was presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island, as I imagined; for on my approaching the shore, I was perfectly confounded and amazed, nor is it possible to express the horror I fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;—and particularly a place, where, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, there had been a fire made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a circle dug in the earth for the savage mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to sit down to their inhuman feasts, on the bodies of their fellow creatures. I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away my face from the horrid spectacle; my no mach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, and left the place as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>When I got a little out of that part of the island, I looked up with the utmost affection o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024253_0034_0FC5DB240A249E60"/>
where I was distinguished from such wretched creatures as these. In this frame of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I went home to my cattle, and began to be much easier as to my safety, than <hi>I</hi> had been for some time before; for I observed that these wretches never came to the island in search of what they could get. I had been in the island a most eighteen years, and never saw any sufficient proofs of their having been there before; and might be eighteen more, concealed as I was if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>One day when I was cutting some brush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, I found behind the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I was almost as much frighted as before: for I heard a loud sigh followed by a broken noise, and then a sigh

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. I stepped back, struck with such sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that I was in a cold sweat. However, I recovered resolution enough to step forward again, and lifting up ray light, I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goat gasping for life. When recovered from my fright, <hi>I</hi> began to look round me. This cave was but twevle feet over, and I observed that on the farther side was an opening, into which I crept on my hands and knees; but as I had no light I deferred going farther than the entrance till the next day, when I brought candles of my own making, and crept about ten yards, after which the roof rose to about twenty feet high, and the wall reflected an hundred thousand lights from my two candles. It was a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful grotto, the floor dry and level, no damp to be felt, nor any noxious creature to be seen.</p>
            <p>I had now been twenty-two years in the island, and was so naturalized to the place, that had I been secure as to the savages, I then fancied I could have been contented to have staid in it, till, like the goat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had died of mere old age; but in my twenty-third year, going out at break of day, I was surprized with the light of a fire upon the shore towards the end of the island; which, to my great affliction, was on my side. In this extremity <hi>I</hi> went back directly to my castle; pulled up the ladder after me, and put myself in the best posture of defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I staid within two hours, when I began to be impatient for intelligence; but I had no spies to send out. Soon after I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024253_0036_0FC5DB2D4FAC6BB0"/>
set my ladder to the side of the hill, and went to the top: and lying down on my belly on the ground, I discovered nine naked savages sitting round a fire. They had two canoes with them, and at the turn of the tide they went away. As soon as I saw them gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two pistols at my girdle, and a great sword without a scabboard, and badened to the place, when I found that there had been no less than five canoes of them on the shore, which I saw altogether making over to the main. The sight of the horrid carnage they had left behind them so filled me with horror and indignation that I meditated the destruction of the next that came ashore.</p>
            <p>Some time after, in the midst of a very stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my night I was startled at the firing of a gun, I hasted up to the top of my hill, and heard another. I imagined that these were signals of a ship in distress, and such it proved, as I discovered the next day. I cannot explain by any possible energy of words, the emotion I felt at the fight of this wreck. O that there had been but one saved! I cried, that I might but have had one companion! one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

began my voyage, I in two hours time reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ship, which was Spanish built. She stuck fast jammed in between two rocks, and all the stern and quarter were beaten to pieces by the sea. On my coming near it, a dog yelped and cried; but there was no other liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature on board; but I saw two men drowned in the cook room, with their arms fast about one another, and all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oods were spoiled by the water. I took twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>eamen's chests, and in them I found some neckcloths and skirts, which were very useful to me; I 100 pieces of eight, and about a pound weight of solid gold.</p>
            <p>After this acquisition I lived in my old manner; though terrified with fears of the savages. One morning very early I saw five canoes of them on shore. I clambered up my hill, and by the help of my perspective dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I soon after saw two miserable wretches dragged cat of the boats, one of whom was immediately knocked down, but the other starting from them, run with incredible swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness along the sands, towards me. I confess I was horridly frightened when I saw him come my way, imagining he would be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by the whole body; however, I kept my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024253_0038_0FC5DB2FF95E0CE8"/>
as before. Of the three that followed, but two entered the water, the other returning back. I clapped myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled and beckoning with my hand for him to come back; then rushing at once upon the foremost, knocked him down with the stock <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; but when I advanced towards him. I perceived he was sitting his bow to shoot me, upon which I shot him dead directly The poor savage who had fled was so terrified at the noise of my gun, that he seemed rather inclined to fly than to come towards me.—However, when I gave him signs of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he came nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps; on his coming close to me he kneeled down again, laid his head upon the ground, and placed my foot upon it. The man that I knocked down came to himself, and my savage began to be afraid, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I then took him to my cave, and gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat.</p>
            <p>He was a well made handsome fellow of about 26 years of age, of an olive coloured complexion, with long black hair. I began to speak to him, and to teach him to speak to me; and first, I made him to know that his
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024253_0039_0FC5DB32888CA8E0"/>
name should be Friday, which was the day wherein I saved his life. I taught him to say Master, and let him know that was to be my name. The next day I gave him clothes, at which he seemed much pleased.</p>
            <p>Having now more courage, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dextrously. I also gave him to carry one god, and taking two for myself, away we marched to the place where his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had been: When I came there my blood ran cold in my veins; the place was covered with human bones and the ground dyed with blood; great pieces o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ched. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet; and Friday, by his signs made me understand, that they brough: over four prisoners to feast upon, that three of them were eaten up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himself was the fourth, and that they had been conquered, and taken prisoners in war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>I caused Friday to collect the remains of this horrid carnage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to light a fire, and burn them to a she. When this was done we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to our castle. The next day I made a little tent on the outside of my fortification, and at night took in my ladder, that he might not be able to get at me while slept. But there was no need of this precaution; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024253_0040_0FC5DB345A1BA3B8"/>
man had a more faithful servant; he had the same affection for me as a child has for a father, and I dare say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would have sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed his life to save mine.</p>
            <p>After I had been two or three days returned to the castle, I thought that in order to bring him off from the relish of human flesh, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I took him out one morning to the woods, in order to take a kid from my herd; but as I was going, I saw a she<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her; when making signs to Friday not to stir, I shot one of them. Poor Friday trembled and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down; he did not see the kid I had shot, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to kill him. But taking him by the hand, I laughed at him, and pointing to the kid I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering how it was killed, I loaded my gun and seeing a parrot sit upon a tree, I shewed it to him, and made him understand that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would kill it; accordingly I fired, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately saw it fall; he looked frightened again, and I believe if I would have let him, would have worshipped both me and my gun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the gun itself, he would not so much a touch it for several days after; but would talk to it, when he was by himself, which I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024253_0041_0FC5DB3A6A40C5C0"/>
understood, was to desire it not to kill him.</p>
            <p>Having brought home the kid, I feasted Friday the next day with a piece of it roasted. This he admired very much, and made me to understand that he would not eat man's flesh any more. I now found it necessary to sow a larger quantity of corn than I used to do, and therefore with Friday's assistance enlarged my fence. In short, this was the pleasantest yeur I had led in the island; for as my man began to talk pretty well, I had some use for my tongue again.</p>
            <p>I soon learnt from Friday's discourse, that he had formerly been among the savages, who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on the same man eating occasions, which he was now brought for; and some time after, I took him to that side which was the same I formerly mentioned; he knew the place, and told me he was there once, when they eat up twenty men, two woman, and a child; but not knowing how to tell twenty, he numbered them by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.</p>
            <p>I did not fail to instruct this poor creature as well as I was able, in the principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and he listened to me with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One day when I had been talking to him on this subject, he told me, that if our God could hear us beyond the son, he was a greater God than their Benamnukee, who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024253_0042_0FC5DB3B402235D0"/>
but a little way off, and yet could not hear till the Oowokakee, or priests, went up to the great mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him. In short, by instructing him, I inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myself; for by seriously considering what I had never thought of before, I more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impressed a sense of my duty upon my own mind and at length made him a better chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian than I had been myself. I then told him my story, and let him into the mystery of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder and bullets, and taught him how to shoot; I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with; also made him a belt with a frog hanging to it and instead of a hanger, gave him a hatchet.</p>
            <p>I descried to him the countries of Europe, and particularly England, how we lived, how we worshipped God, and how we traded in ships to all the parts of the world: I gave him an account of the wreck I had been on board o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I escaped, and which I could not stir with all my strength then, but was now almost fallen to pieces. Upon see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing; when asking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat he was thinking of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> asked him, if there were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> he mens, as he called them, in the boat? Yes, he said, the boat full of white mens: I asked him how many? He told me upon his fingers, seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024253_0043_0FC5DB3CE84EC578"/>
I then asked him, what became of them? And he replied, They live, they dwell at my nation. I presently imagined, that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight of my island, who after the ship had struck on a rock, had saved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their boat. I then enquired what was become of them, and he assured me that his countrymen gave them victuals. I asked him why they did not kill them, and eat them? He said, No, they make brother with them. They no eat mens but when make war fight; that is, they never eat any man but such as are taken in battle.</p>
            <p>A considerable time after this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being on the top of a hill at the east side of the island from whence I had discovered land, Friday looked very earnestly towards it, and in a kind of surprize f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll a jumping and dancing, crying, O joy.! O glad! there be my country, there my nation! I observed that his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sense of pleasure. This observation gave me some uneasiness, and I could not help ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, that if he should get back to his own nation, he would not only forget all his religion, but his obligations to me, and would perhaps come back with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or two of his countrymen, and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as he used to be with those of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies when they were taken in war. But I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>longed the poor honest creature very much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:024253_0044_0FC5DB4392949780"/>
One day, walking up the same hill I called to him and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country again? Yes, said he, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be much a glad to be at my own nation. What would you do there? said I: Would you eat man's flesh again, and be a savage as you was before? He looked full of concern, and, shaking his head, said, no, no, Friday tell them to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat corn bread, cattle flesh, milk, no eat man's flesh again. Why then, said I to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will kill you. He looked grave, and said no, they no kill me, they willing love learn. He meant they would be willing to learn. I then told him, that I would make a canoe for him; and he replied, that he would go, if I would go with him. I go! said I, why they will eat me if I go there. No no, says he, me make them no eat you, me make they much love you. He then told me how kind they were to the seventeen white or bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore in distress.</p>
            <p>From this time I had a mind to venture over, and see if I could possibly join those bearded men, not doubting but that we might find some means of escaping from thence. I therefore went with Friday to the other side or the island, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> him my boat, when he getting into it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> managed it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est dex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024253_0045_0FC5DB4635F3EB90"/>
he said that was big enough; but as it had lain two or three and twenty years, the sun had split it. I therefore told him, that we would go and make one as big as that, and he should go in it. At this he looked very uneasy, and I asked what was the matter with him. To which he returned, Why angry, mad with Friday? what me done? I told him I was not angry with him. No angry! no angry! says he, why then send Friday home to my nation? Why said I, Friday did you not say you wished you were there? Yes, yes says he, wish be both there, no wish Friday there, no master there. I go there Friday! said I, What should I do there? You do great deal much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good, sober, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Yes, yes, says he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you teach me good, you teach them good. No, no, Friday, said, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you shall go without me, are leave me here to live by myself, as I did before—He looked confused and running to a hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et took it up hastily, and gave it me—What must I do with this? said I, You take kin Friday, says he. What must I kill you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> said I again. He returns very quick, What you send Friday, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o send Friday away. This he spoke with such earnestness, that I saw the tears stand in his eyes.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse, a settled affection to me and that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024253_0046_0FC5DB4735E9F4C8"/>
nothing should part him from me; so I found that his desire to return to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was founded on his affection to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his hopes of my doing them good.</p>
            <p>I was now entered into the 27th year of my captivity, and one morning I bid Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day go to the sea shore to see if he could find a turtle; but he had not long been gone, when he came running back like one that felt not the ground, on which he trod, and before I had time to speak, cried, O master! O master! O sorrow! O bad! What's the matter, Friday, said I. O yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there, said he, one, two, three! Canoe! one, two, three! Well, Friday, said I, do not be frightened: He was however terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afraid, imagining that they were come to look for him. I asked him, whether if I resolved to defend him, he would stand by me, and do as I bid him. He said Me die, when you bid me die, Master. I then loaded four musquets with five small bullets in each. and each of my two pistols with a brace of bullets. I hung my great sword naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.</p>
            <p>I then took my perspective glass, and went up the side of the hill, when I saw twenty-one savages, three prisoners, and three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes. They were landed at a small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024253_0047_0FC5DB48E2AE20C8"/>
sea: and I was so filled with indignation, that I was resolved to kill them all. I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; took one pistol and the other three guns myself; and having put a bottle of rum in my pocket, I marched with Friday to attacked them. I sent Friday to some trees that was near them to see what they were about; he soon returned and told me, that they were all about a fire eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that a bearded man lay bound upon the sand whom he said they would kill next. I went to the tree, and plainly saw a white man lying on the beech with his hands and feet tied with flags. I observed another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, to which I could go undiscovered. I therefore took a circuit to it, where I had a full view of them, at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about eighty yards.</p>
            <p>I had not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the horrid wretches sat huddled together on the ground, and the other two were stooped down to untie the christian in order to murder him. Now, said I, Friday, do as you see me do. I laid the musquets down, and took up one, and then we both fired. Three were killed and five wounded. The savages <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in a dreadful consternation, and all who were unhurt jumped up instantly on their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap>n rushed out of the thicket, and cut the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that bound the poor victim, and gave him a sword and pistol, which he had no sooner got than he flew upon his murderers. In short, seventeen of them were killed, and four of them getting into a canoe, got out to sea.</p>
            <p>I resolved to pursue them, and going to one of the canoes. I found another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand and foot. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cut the twisted flags, and seeing that he had been bound so tight that he was almost dead, I gave him a dram, and ordered Friday to tell him of his deliverance; but when the poor fellow looked in his face, and heard him speak, it would have moved any one to tears, to have seen how he kissed, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, cried, danced, sung, and then cried again. I asked him what was the matter, he said it was his own dear father. He then sat down by him, held the old man's head close to his bosom. At my desire Friday took the Spaniard into the canoe, and placed him by his father, and paddled them along ashore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            <p>The Spaniard gave me an account of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> resolved that he and Friday's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

About eight days after they were gone, Friday waked me one morning by crying out, Master they are come. I dressed myself and hasted up to the top of the hill, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered an English ship lying at anchor. At first I felt in my mind a tumult of joy, but it was-soon turned into fear; for though I knew them to be my countrymen, I was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of them.—They ran the boat ashore on the beach, and eleven men landed, three of them unarmed, who by their gestures I thought to be prisoners, for they seemed to be pleading for mercy. At this sight I was stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with horror, and Friday called out to me in his broken English, O master! you see Englishmens eat prisoners as well as savage mens. No, no, said I, Friday, I am afraid they will murder them; but you may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they wont eat them. At this instant I saw a villain lift up his arm to kill one of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners; but he did not strike him. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

sat under the shelter of a tree, but a little way from me. To them I went and said, What are you, Gentleman? They started at the noise; but when they saw my uncouth figure, they prepared to fly. I then said, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, perhaps you may have a friend near you, whom you little expect. He must be sent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from heaven, said they, bowing; for our condition is past the help of man. All help is from heaven, Sir, I replied; I see you are in distress, and am willing to serve you. The poor man, with a gush of tears, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Am I talking to a man or an angel? A man, an Englishman, said I; ready to assist and save you: Tell me your case. I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that ship, he replied; my men have mutinied against me, and if they do not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, they intend to leave me and two gentlemen ashore in this desolate place. They are but in that thicket, and I tremble for fear they have seen you, and heard us speak: if they have, they will murder us all. I asked what arms they had got, and finding they had but one, I told him it was easy to kill them all, or to take them prisoners. I then gave each of them a musquet, and advised them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> among them at once; but he was cautious of shedding blood. The captain reserving his own piece, two men shot one of the villains dead, and wounded another, whom the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knocked down with the stock of his mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. There were three more in company, one of whom was wounded. They begged for

mercy, and I coming up, gave orders for sparing their lives, on condition of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound hand and foot while they stayed in the island.</p>
            <p>After securing all our prisoners, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted together how to recover the ship, there being still twenty six men on board. While we were securing the boat, we heard the ship fire a gun, as a signal for the boat to come on board. Soon after, another boat with ten men with arms, approached the ashore. We had a view of them as they came; and as soon as they got to the place where the other boat lay, the ran their boat on the beach, and came all on shore. They hallooed for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; and seeing the holes beat in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boat, they immediately returned and rowed from the shore; but quickly coming back again, seven of them landed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving three in the boat, who kept at a distance from the shore. We now lost all hopes of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ship; for we imagined that if we seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the seven men, the rest would return to the ship and she would set sail; however we had no remedy but patience.</p>
            <p>Those who came on shore kept close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, marching up the hill, under which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

then called to the boat to set them over. They having crossed the creek left two men in the boat, taking the other with them. We left Friday and the mate decoying the fellows up into the woods, while we surprised the two men they had left, one lying in the boat, and the other asleep on the shore. The last start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up at our approach, the captain knocked him down, and called to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead men. This he did, and heartily joined us.</p>
            <p>Several hours after, Friday came back and told me they had heartily tired the men, by hallooing to them from different places; for he heard them complain, they were so tired they could not walk. At length we saw them all go to the boat, which was aground in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, the tide having ebbed out. When they saw the two men gone, they called to one another in the most lamentable manner, saying they were got in an inchanted island, that it was either inhabited, and they should be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or that there were devils in it, and they should be devoured. They hallooed and called their comrades by their names, and then ran about winging their hands like men in despair; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

in his power, that he let fly, and killed him and another man on the spot; the third an for it, I immediately advanced with my whole army, when the man we took out of the boat, by my order, called to one of them by his name Tom Smith. The fellow answered, Who is that, Robinson! The other replied, Ay, ay, for God's sake, Tom, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yield! who must ye yield to; says Smith. Where are they? Here they are, says he; here's our captain with fifty men with him, the Boatswain and Will Fry are killed, and I am a prisoner. Will they give us quarter? says Smith. The captain then called out. You know my voice, if you lay down your arms and submit, you shall all have your lives but Will Atkins. Upon which Will Atkins cried out for God's sake, captain, spare my life, the rest are as bad I; which was not true, for he had used the captain very ill, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the mutiny. The captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

night, got on board, and being faithfully se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, they knocked down the second mate and carpenter, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he but end of their mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, and soon overcame all the rest: killed the rebel captain, and fired several guns to give me signal of their success, which filled me with great joy.</p>
            <p>When I saw my deliverance thus put in my hands, I was ready to sink with surprize; I was not able to answer one word, but a stood of tears brought me to myself. The captain called aloud to the boat, and bid them bring the governor's present ashore; and indeed it was a present fit for a governor. Among other things there was a very good suit of clothes, with shirts and neck cloths. I dressed myself in them, and then appeared as governor before the prisoners. I asked them what they had to say in their own defence, telling them I had power to execute them there. They pleaded the captain's promise of mercy and I told them that I intended to go passenger in the ship, with all my men; the captain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the ship to get every thing ready for my reception.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, I talked to the men, told them my story, and left a letter for the fifteen Spaniards, and made them promise to treat them in common with themselves. The next day I went on board the ship, taking Friday with me; but did not sail that night; and before we put off, two of the men swam to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> from the shore, desiring to be taken in, or they

should be murdered, which we did. Two of our men left us, and joined them ashore. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I left the Island, after being on it 28 years.</p>
            <p>On my arrival in England, I was as perfect a stranger as if I had never been known there. My father and mother were dead. The own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ship I had saved, made me a present of near 200l. I then went to Lisbon, to see after my effects in the Brasils, and found the generous captain, who had been my friend, still alive, and he put me in a way of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the produce of my plantation, to the amount of 50, 000l. besides 1000l. a year.</p>
            <p>Having converted my money into bills of exchange, I resolved to travel to England by land, over the Pyrenean mountains. Poor Friday was terribly frightened when he saw mountains covered with snow. On our way, our guide was assaulted by two wolves; he called out to us, and I bid Friday hasten to see what was the matter; when like a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The bear stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to smell at the gun, and climbed the tree after him, when Friday getting to the small end of a large branch, and the bear about the middle, he fell a shaking it, crying, Now you see me teachee the bear dance. The bear turned to go back, and Friday said, What you come no farther, pray you come farther, you no come farther, me go. You no come to me me come to you. Then bending the bough, down he slipped of it, and taking up his gun stood still. The bear finding his enemy gone, came with the hinder end foremost down the tree; when Friday clapping the muzzle of his gun to his ear, shot him dead.

            <p>In this voyage we took on board the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and crew of a ship consumed by fire, and set them on shore at Newfoundland, and soon after relieved another ship, where all on board were perishing for want of provisions. On board this last were three passengers, an old lady, her son, and a maid servant. They were barely alive when we met with them, and the old lady died that night. The youth and the maid went with us to my island, as did a young priest whom we took out of the other ship.</p>

I enquired of the Spaniard the situation of the island, who told me the three barbarians, not contented with being moderately their masters, wanted to be their murderers. The Spaniards who were brought over by Friday's other, worked for them while they rambled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>out the island. The three Englishmen would not let their two countrymen, who afterwards came on shore, live with them; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing industrious fellows, built themselves two little huts at a distance, cultivated some land, and had a little thriving farm. The three unnatural rascals told them that the island was theirs by the gifts of the governor, and that they should not build upon their land, without paying them rent. The two honest men, as I call them for distinction, refused, upon which they set fire to one of the huts; blows ensued, in which the two got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the three.</p>
            <p>About this time a great number of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of different nations landed and fought a battle, in which thirty-two men were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the spot.

weary of working, took the canoe, and went among the savages to get them servants. The people treated them very civilly, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for a knife, a hatchet, and six or seven bullets, gave them eleven men, and five wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom they had taken prisoners to ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Before they came to the island, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>They had now another visit from the sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; they kept close while they were in the island; but when they saw them embark, had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been; they found three savages left fast asleep upon the shore; they took them prisoners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> but unfortunately one of them made his escape and soon after returned with a large body or his countrymen. This fellow had been kept at one of the huts of the honest Englishmen, and these two poor men had but just time to remove their wives and children, before they saw their houses in flames. However, they formed themselves in a body, and attacked them. The savages were defeated with great loss, and they left the island.</p>
            <p>About six months after this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

life I had saved, commanded, and Will Atkins one of the three daring Englishmen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under him.</p>
            <p>The savages came forward like lions, and Atkins, with six men, were placed behind thicket, and after suffering about fifty to pass <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, ordered three of his men to fire among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ickest of them. How many they killed they knew not; but the poor wretches seemed frightened to the last degree. Then the other three fired, and after them the first three in less than a minute. Had they now retired as they were ordered, it would have been well; but staying to charge again, some savages at a distance saw them, and surrounded them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, wounded Atkins himself, and killed an Englishman, a Spaniard, and a gallant Indian slave.</p>
            <p>Atkins was then obliged to retire as were also the Spaniards, who had behaved with great gallantry, killing about fifty of their enemies. Atkins, though wounded, would have had the governor march and charge them in a body; but the Spaniard replied, Seignior Atkins let them alone till morning, when they will be stiff with their wounds, and faint with loss of blood. That's true, Seignior, replied Atkins but so shall I too. It being a clear moon-light night, they concluded to fall on them then. They attacked them in three parties, and did great execution, killing in the two fights one hundred and eighty. The rest with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

But as soon as they defeated them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander senta party to destroy their boats, and they soon made them unfit for swimming at sea. When they saw this, it made the poor wretches quite desperate; they ran about the island—trod the corn under foot, and did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>This was the situation of the island at my arrival, with the addition of twenty little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the women had all been fruitful.—My coming was a particular relief, because I furnished them with every thing they wanted.</p>
            <p>When the Spaniards and English were all assembled, I told them that I came to establish them there, and not to remove them; but before I delivered them the stores I had brought I asked them one by one, if they could shake hands with each other, and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, so that there might be no more misunderstanding among them. Will Atkins said very frankly, they had met with afflictions enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough to make them all friends; that for his part he would live and die with them, and if I desired it would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

When we came near the town, we saw three women stark naked, and after them sixteen or seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen men flying in the greatest consternation, pursued by three of our English butchers. My very soul shrunk within me, and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, had our three English sailors continued their pursuit, I should have ordered out men to fire upon them. Some of the poor flying wretches were miserably burnt. We soon saw our boatswain, who was one of the forwarde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>

            <p>I was extremely angry with my nephew, and all the men, about this affair; and at last, on my frequently shewing my abhorence of this massacre as I always called it, they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined. I was then on shore at Bengal, and one and all said, they would leave the ship, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever set my foot in it. My nephew, the captain, was obliged to comply, but sent me money and necessaries.</p>
            <p>I took lodging in the house of an English woman, where I got acquainted with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; we bought a ship, and went a voyage to China, which proved very successful, and made another to the spice islands, with the like good fortune. We then bought a large vessel; but this purchase had like to have cost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and we were pursued by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

which we kept off with our guns, and made the best of our way to Tonquin, under the utmost horror of being seized, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hanged as pirates. Our ship having sprung a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eak, we here laid her down to stop it. While she was in this condition the natives not seeing our men came round <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in twelve large boats, supposing it to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> wreck; we were in an ill posture for fighting; all hands being at work repairing the ship's bottom; we immediately set about righting the ship; but before we could do it, they had boarded our boat to make prisoners of some of our men. The first they seized was an Englishman, who, instead of firing the musket he had in his hand, laid it down in the boat, and seizing the fellow by the ears, he by main force dashed his brains out against the gunnel; while a Dutchman, with the butt end of the musket, knocked down five of them. In the mean time a fellow who attended the carpenter with a kettle of boiling pitch, saluted the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans with a ladle of the hot stuff, which the carpenter seeing, cry'd. Well done, Jack, and dipping a mop into the boiling pitch, sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it profusely over them which made them howl most dreadfully; and another kettle of the same materials, gave us a complete vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, without firing a gun.</p>
            <p>We left this bay the next morning, and sailed to Nanquin, when to our great joy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

arrived at London on the 10th of January, 1705, having been absent from England, this last time, ten years, and nine months. And now resolving to harrass myself no more, I am preparing for a longer journey than all those; for I have lived seventy-two years, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
