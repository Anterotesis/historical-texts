            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>SRAEL</hi> were upon their March to the promiſed Land; and notwithſtanding the wonderful Diſplays of divine Power, they had been Witneſſes of, both in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Wilderneſs; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Succeſs of their important En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize depended intirely on the Bleſſing of God; yet they fell into the Sin of Idolatry, than which nothing could have been more hateful. God was juſtly incens'd againſt them, and teſtified his Diſpleaſure by the Death of three Thouſand of them in one Day, as the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter informs us.</p>
            <p>But tho' they were unmindful of their Duty to God, God was not unmindful of his Promiſe. In the three firſt Verſes of the Context, we have an Account of his ſaying to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007615_0004_102BA97726E28378"/>
               <hi>Moſes; Depart and go up hence, thou and the People, which thou haſt brought up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>unto the Land, which I ſwear unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſaying, Unto thy Seed will I give it; and I will ſend an Angel before thee; and I will drive out the</hi> Canaanite, <hi>the</hi> Amorite, <hi>and the</hi> Perizzite, <hi>the</hi> Hivite, <hi>and the</hi> Jebuſite: <hi>unto a Land flowing with Milk and Honey.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Tho' God determin'd to give them the Land He had promiſed; yet He would bring about the Event by the Interpoſition of an Angel, leſt, if there ſhould be any extraordinary Tokens of His Preſence, their Sins, being aggravated by the Favour and Honour done them, ſhould provoke Him to cut them off.</p>
            <p>The People having humbled themſelves for the Tokens of God's Diſpleaſure; putting off their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—riſing up and worſhipping, every Man at his Tent Door, when they ſaw the cloudy Pillar ſtanding at the Tabernacle Door: And <hi>Moſes,</hi> having got near to God, even to His Seat, thus pleads with Him, 12 and 13 of the Context, <hi>Thou ſayeſt unto me, bring up this People: and thou haſt not let me know whom thou wilt ſend with me. Yet thou haſt ſaid, I know thee by Name, thou haſt alſo found Grace in my Sight. Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found Grace in thy Sight, ſhew me now thy Way, that I may know thee, that I may find Grace in thy Sight: and conſider that this Nation is thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God ſaid, in Anſwer to this Requeſt of <hi>Moſes: My Preſence ſhall go with thee, and I will give thee Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then we have <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Reply to God: <hi>If thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</hi>—Which Expreſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews, that he was ſenſible of the vaſt Importance of having the Preſence of God with them in their War againſt the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> Oh, that every Commander of an Army, and all other Officers, and all
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007615_0005_102BA9950389CAD0"/>
that belong to Armies; yea that all, were as ſenſible of the Importance of the divine Preſence, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and did as earneſtly ſeek it!</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking from the Words, I ſhall firſt endeavour to ſhew what it is to have the Preſence of God with us, in the Senſe of the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Shew the Importance of an Army's having the Preſence of God with them, in their Enterprizes againſt their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Shew, when we may on good Grounds hope for the Preſence of God with us, in our Enterprizes againſt our Enemies. Then make Application relative to the Occaſion of our preſent Meeting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is it to have the Preſence of God with us, in the Senſe of the Text? <hi>And He ſaid, My Preſence ſhall go with thee, and I will give thee Reſt. And He ſaid unto Him, If thy Preſence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt not underſtand by the Phraſe in the Text, that God is not eſſentially preſent every where. He fills Heaven and Earth with his Preſence. There is no fleeing from His Preſence. Let us be where we will, in what State ſoever, or doing what we will, God is preſent. How could we exiſt; how could we be; if God were not preſent to uphold us? Reaſon and Scripture teach us the Omnipreſence of God.</p>
            <p>Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Muſt we underſtand by the Phraſe in the Text, God's being preſent with a People to ruin and deſtroy them. As we read in the 5th Verſe of the Context, <hi>I will come up in the midſt of thee in a Moment, and conſume thee.</hi> When there are extraordinary Diſplays of divine Power for the Ruin of a People, God may be ſaid to be preſent, as well as when there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Diſplays of Power for their Benefit. We read of Deſtruction from His Preſence.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:007615_0006_102BA97A2145E220"/>But God's Preſence going with His People is a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, promiſed as ſuch: God's giving Reſt is coupled with his Preſence going with them. <hi>Moſes</hi> prays, that God would not carry them from thence, if He did not go with them. The Preſence of God for their Deſtruction would not have been deſirable. That is the moſt terrible Deſtruction, that is from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Hand of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. By God's Preſence with us, in the Senſe of the Text, is meant his favourable aſſiſting Preſence. God's being preſent with a Perſon or People, in any Affair they are engag'd in, notes his Concurrence, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Bleſſing in that Affair—as has been already obſerved: God's Preſence going with them is promis'd as a Bleſſing; giving them Reſt is coupled with it.— It is promiſed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he had found Grace in God's Sight, 17th Verſe of the Context—and <hi>Moſes,</hi> in pleading with God, ſays in the 16th Verſe. <hi>For wherein ſhall it be known here, that I and thy People have found Grace in thy Sight? Is it not that thou goeſt with us? ſo ſhall we be ſeparated, I and thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from all the People that are upon the Face of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſeems to repreſent the Preſence of God going with them, as a Characteriſtick, or diſtinguiſhing Mark of God's People: indeed it is the moſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative one to Pagan Nations.</p>
            <p>Wiſhing God to be with a Perſon, or People, was a very uſual Form of Bleſſing among the <hi>Jews:</hi> It was the ſame, as wiſhing them well, wiſhing them Succeſs, and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> bleſſed <hi>David,</hi> when he had inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his Mind to attack <hi>Goliah. Go and the Lord be with you,</hi> i. e. ſucceed, and bleſs you, in your Attempt. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. It was a frequent apoſtolic Benediction. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Lord ſo with you all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:007615_0007_102BA9978BD19AB0"/>It was not uncommon to encourage to great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings with this Conſideration, that God was with them. Thus God encourages <hi>Joſhua</hi> to go againſt <hi>Canaan,</hi> by telling him, He would be with him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might be of good Courage, he ſhould bring the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> there, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.6, 7, 8, 23. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Thus God incourages <hi>Gideon</hi> to go againſt the <hi>Midianites. I will be with thee, and thou ſhalt ſmite the</hi> Midianites <hi>as one Man.</hi> Judges 6.12.16. And thus the Prieſts were to encourage the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were going to Battle. Deut. 20.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>When thou goeſt out to Battle againſt thine Enemies, and ſeeſt Horſes and Chariots, and a People more than thou, be not afraid of them, for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt. And it ſhall be, when ye are come nigh unto the Battle, that the Prieſt ſhall approach and ſpeak unto the People, and ſhall ſay unto them; hear, O Iſrael, you approach this Day unto Battle againſt your Enemies: let not your Heart faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified becauſe of them. For the Lord your God is He that goeth with you, to fight for you againſt your Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And wherever we read of God's being with a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or People, we read of their Proſperity and Succeſs. It is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 18.7. <hi>And the Lord was with him, and he proſper'd whitherſoever he went forth: and he rebell'd againſt</hi> (or ſhook off the Yoke of) <hi>the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and ſerved him not. And ſmote the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>even unto</hi> Gaza, <hi>and the Borders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from the Tower of the Watchmen to the fenced City.</hi> From theſe Things it is evident, that by the Preſence of God going with us in any important Enterprizes, in the Senſe of the Text, is meant his Direction, Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Bleſſing. But according to the propos'd Method, I am,</p>

               <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſenſible of the Importance of it, deprecates the want of it. <hi>If thy Preſence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To have God with us, is the ſame as to have God for us; if God be for us, if God is on our Side, we need not care who is againſt us. Let them be ever ſo many or mighty, there is more with us, than with them. Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> incourages his People againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, from the Confidence he had, that the Lord was them, 2 Chron. 32.7, 8. Verſes. <hi>Be ſtrong and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, be not afraid for the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>nor for all the Multitude that is with him: for there be more with us, than with him; with him is an Arm of Fleſh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our Battles.</hi> Though an Army be ever ſo numerous and ſtrong, their Power is limited, and finite, whereas God's Power is unbounded and infinite. So that an Army, tho' ſmall, that has the Preſence of God with them, is more formidable, and dreadful than the hugeſt Hoſt, that ever was rais'd, that has not the Preſence of God with them. God is the Lord of all the Hoſts in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. He has all Things at his Command. Our moſt avowed Enemies can do nothing againſt us, but what God permits, and allows them; and we have no Reaſon to fear, if God's Preſence is with us, that He will permit them to do much againſt us; but rather have Reaſon to hope that He will be againſt our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, an Adverſary to our Adverſaries; that our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs will be under the beſt Direction; that there will be a Concurrence of favourable Circumſtances on our Behalf.</p>
            <p>God's Preſence with an Army going againſt their Enemies will be a Remedy againſt Fear. We are not
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007615_0009_102BA9990FFCDD70"/>
made without Fear: and the confuſed Noiſe of the Warrior, and Garments roll'd in Blood, will be apt to excite Fear. Fear, as it were, binds Mens Hands, is a Bar to noble, and heroic Actions. But a Perſuaſion, that God is with them, is a good Antidote againſt Fear. God often uſes this Argument to conquer the Fear of his People, in Caſes of Difficulty and Danger, Thus He did with <hi>Joſhua. Deut.</hi> 31.6.8. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſent an Army large enough to compaſs a City, only to ſeize the Prophet <hi>Eliſha:</hi> his Servant, when he ſaw it, feared, and was ready to think it was a gone Caſe. <hi>Eliſha</hi> told him not to fear, for they that be with us, are more than they that be with them. He prayed that God would open his Eyes, and when his Eyes were opened, his Fears vaniſhed. <hi>Eliſha,</hi> by the Help of God, took that whole Army Captive, and led them into <hi>Samaria.</hi> 2 Kings 6.14—20.</p>
            <p>If we knew we had greater Strength, greater Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, greater Advantages on all Accounts than our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, would not Fear be unreaſonable: if an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men were going againſt one Man, would not their fearing be an Argument of a baſe low Spirit. One Man's Strength and Wiſdom bears ſome Proportion to the Power and Wiſdom of an Hundred; but the Power, and Policy of the greateſt Army bears no Proportion to the Power and Wiſdom of God, which is infinite. If God therefore be with us, we need not fear. <hi>David,</hi> in an Addreſs to God, ſays, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 23. <hi>Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death</hi> (which a hot Engagement has ſome Reſemblance of) <hi>I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff ſhall comfort me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Preſence of God with an Army, inſpires with Courage. It not only expels Fear, but fills with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. As our Fears will encourage our Enemies, ſo Courage will diſhearten them. Courage gives Life to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007615_0010_102BA97D9F859098"/>
Strength, which would be in a Manner uſeleſs, if we durſt not exert and put it forth. Courage aſſiſted by Strength, and directed by Wiſdom, is often the Spring of glorious Atchievements— And what has a greater Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to inſpire with Courage, than to be perſwaded on good Grounds, that God is with us. This is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God uſes to excite Courage, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31, 6, 7, 23, Ver. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.6, 9, Ver. What more ſuitable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can there be, when we think of the Perfections of God?</p>
            <p>When it is apparent that God is preſent with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, their Enemies will be filled with Fear. <hi>Let us flee</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Egyptians) from the Face of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for the Lord fighteth for them againſt the</hi> Egyptians, Exod. 14.25.— <hi>When the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>underſtood that the Ark of God was come into the Camp, they were afraid, for they ſaid, God is come into the Camp. And they ſaid, Wo unto us; for there hath not been ſuch a Thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. Wo unto us, Who ſhall deliver us out of the Hands of theſe mighty Gods? Theſe are the Gods that ſmote the</hi> Egyptians <hi>with Plagues in the Wilderneſs,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.6, 7, 8, Ver. The Preſence of God is a Pillar of Fire to direct and guide his People; and a Pillar of the Cloud to confound his Enemies.</p>
            <p>If God is with an Army in an Enterprize, they have Reaſon to expect Succeſs. We have <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaying, Chap. 14.12. <hi>Thou heardeſt in that Day how the</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims <hi>were there, and that their Cities were great and fenced; if ſo be the Lord be with me, I ſhall be able to drive them out.</hi> And they may ſay to thoſe that attack them, as in 2 Chron. 35.21. <hi>Forbear from meddling with God, who is with me, that He deſtroy you not.</hi> And thus may they bid Defiance to their Enemies, as in Iſa. 8.9, 10. Ver. <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves, O ye People, and ye ſhall be broken in Pieces; and give Ear, all ye of far Countries: Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007615_0011_102BA99B387EA198"/>
in Pieces; gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in Pieces. Take Counſel together, and it ſhall come to nought; ſpeak the Word, and it ſhall not ſtand: for God is with us.</hi> See what Aſſurance an Army, that hath the Preſence of God going with them, hath of Succeſs. Zech. 10.5. <hi>And they ſhall be as mighty Men, which tread down their Enemies, in the Mire of the Street in the Battle, and they ſhall fight becauſe the Lord is with them.</hi>— Numb. 14.9. <hi>Only rebel not ye againſt the Lord, neither fear ye the People of the Land; for they are Bread for us: Their Defence is departed from them; the Lord is with us, fear them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God be with us, it will diſpoſe others to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us. It made <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> tho' a King, ſeek the Alliance and Friendſhip of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 21.28. and 26.28. Ver. We read 2 Chron. 15.9. <hi>That they fell to</hi> Aſa, <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>in Abundance, out of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the revolted Tribes, when they ſaw that God was with him.</hi>— And Zech. 8.23. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, In thoſe Days it ſhall come to paſs, that ten Men ſhall take hold out of all Languages of the Nations, even ſhall take hold of the Skirt of him that is a</hi> Jew, <hi>ſaying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</hi> Once more,</p>
            <p>If God be with us, we may on good Grounds, expect a Freedom from a great Variety of Evils. See Ezekiel 34.30. The Prophet having enumerated a Variety of Evils they ſhould be freed from, and a Variety of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings they ſhould be the Subjects of, ſays, <hi>Thus ſhall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, even the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>are my People, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we have not an Exemption from Evils, we ſhall be carried ſafely thro' them. Iſa. 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt thro' the Waters, I will be with thee; and thro' the Rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: When
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007615_0012_102BA97F9C8C3658"/>
thou walkeſt through the Fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt; neither ſhall the Flames kindle upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things are ſufficient to ſhow the Importance of having God with us. It is of more Importance, than to have the greateſt Number of the wiſeſt and moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Men. I dye, ſaid <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but the Lord will be with you, which is of more Importance to you, tho' he had born great Sway at the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court, and God had made him an Inſtrument of great Good to them.— Men are ready to think, that in War, their Safety depends on Numbers. We truſt too much to an Arm of Fleſh. Nothing is of equal Importance to having the Preſence of God with us. We read, Deut. 32.30. <hi>How ſhould one chaſe a Thouſand, and two put Ten Thouſand to Flight, except their Rock had ſold them, and the Lord had ſhut them up?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other Hand, If God is not with us, we have Reaſon to fear a Series of moſt diſmal Events. As God's Preſence with us, is a very ſignal Bleſſing, ſo God's not being with us, or forſaking us, is a moſt terrible Evil, deprecated by thoſe, who, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> knew the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of having God's Preſence with them. If God is not with a People, they are expoſed to become a Prey to their Enemies, See 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.14. <hi>Judges</hi> 6.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.7.23.39, 40. How ſenſible <hi>Saul</hi> was of his Calamity, in being without the Preſence of God, appears from that Lamentation, 1 Sam. 28.15. <hi>I am ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>make War on me, and God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from me.</hi>—Having ſhown the Importance of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Preſence of God with us in Enterprizes againſt our Enemies; I proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſhow the Way to have God's Preſence go with us— To know the Importance of having the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with us, will be of no Service to us, if we never knew how to obtain it: but ſince there is a Way to obtain it, which may be known; to know of what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it is, may engage us to ſeek it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007615_0013_102BA99CD8089298"/>People may conclude He is with them, when He is not, on Account of ſome religious Privileges they are diſtinguiſhed by, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.12. And may conclude God is not with them, when He is, on Account of ſome adverſe Providences, <hi>Judges</hi> 6.13.</p>
            <p>We may on good Grounds hope for the Preſence of God with us.—If we are contrite or patient; if we ſee our Sins; are ſo griev'd for them as to turn from them to God. God dwells with the Contrite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may on good Grounds hope for the Preſence of God with us, when we be with Him. 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>Hear ye me,</hi> Aſa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>the Lord is with you, while ye be with him.</hi> You ſee that it is here promiſed to <hi>Aſa,</hi> That if he would be with God, God would be with him. No Scripture is of private Interpretation. If we are with God, we may be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to hope that God will be with us, from this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, tho' it was particularly applyed to <hi>Aſa,</hi> and his Subjects: It was recorded and handed down for our Direction and Encouragement. But now our Inquiry may be, What it is to be with God? This is a Phraſe that is uſed ſometimes to expreſs the Happineſs of the Saints, in the future World. <hi>So ſhall we be ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. ult. But this is not the Idea that is convey'd by the Phraſe, in the Paſſage under Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>But the being with God, to which God's being with us is promiſed, implies in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Reconciliation with God through Chriſt. How can two walk together, except they be agreed? In Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be with God, there muſt therefore be a laying down the Weapons of our Rebellion, and returning to Him, on the Act of Grace which He has iſſued, wherein He has promiſed Pardon to thoſe that believe and repent and return to Him—We were Enemies to God
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007615_0014_102BA981A9CA7898"/>
by wicked Works: When we come to be with God, the Enmity is ſlain by the Blood of Chriſt, and from Enemies we come to be Friends.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Being with God, to which God's being with us is promiſed, is a being for God, on the Side of God. If we are at War with a People, when we ſay—ſuch are with us—We mean, they are on our Side; This Idea is conveyed 2 Chron. 32.7.8. <hi>There be more with us, than with them,</hi> i. e. there are more on our Side, than on theirs.</p>
            <p>There is a War between God and Sin: To be with God, is to be againſt Sin in ourſelves and others. As a People ſeek the utter Ruin and Deſtruction of thoſe they are at War with; ſo thoſe, that are with God, ſeek the utter Ruin and Deſtruction of Sin, mortify it, and crucify it. They that are Chriſt's, crucify the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Luſts. They that are with God, reprove Sin in others, uſe their Influence to ſuppreſs it, exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their reſpective Spheres againſt it, implore the Help of God againſt it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Being with God, to which God's being with us is promiſed, means a promoting His Cauſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing His Glory. Thoſe that are heartily with God, againſt Sin in themſelves and others, will be with God in promoting a Conformity to His Mind and Will in themſelves and others. That which influences us to exert ourſelves for the Suppreſſion of Sin, will influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence us to exert ourſelves for promoting a Conformity to God. If the End of our Actions is right, our Zeal in promoting a Conformity to God, will be in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Zeal againſt Sin. If we are with God in this Reſpect, ſee what Encouragement we have to hope that God will be with us, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>He removed the High Places, and brake the Images, and cut down the Groves, and brake in Pieces the brazen Serpent, that</hi> Moſes <hi>had made; for unto thoſe Days the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007615_0015_102BA9A08FBF24A8"/>
Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did burn Incenſe unto it—He truſted in the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſo that after him, was none like him, among all the Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>nor any that were before him; for He clave to the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from following him, but kept his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Lord was with him, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Amos</hi> 5.14. <hi>Seek Good and not Evil, that ye may live; and ſo the Lord, the God of Hoſts will be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Being with God may mean, a being much with Him in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Being with God may mean acting as in His Preſence. As being with a great Perſonage would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us from what might diſpleaſe, and diſpoſe us to honour him. So realizing God's Preſence would be a great Reſtraint to Sin, and incentive to Duty.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Doth God ever vouchſafe His Preſence with a People, in their Enterprizes? Learn his Grace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion.

We not only read of God's Preſence with his People, in his Word, but we in this Land have experienced his Preſence with us, in former important Enterprizes, we have been engag'd in. What Obligations did thoſe wonderful Favours, lay us under to love and ſerve Him? but how doth our Ingratitude and ill-requiting the Lord call for our Humiliation and Abaſement?

it, and the Folly of the contrary. It is the higheſt Wiſdom to ſeek the Preſence of God with us in our Enterprizes. We think it Wiſdom, and juſtly too, to have wiſe and faithful Perſons, and Perſons of Strength and Courage, engaged in our warlike Enterprizes. How much more ſo is it to have the Preſence of God, who is infinitely wiſe, true and powerful? If the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> were imbolden'd to defy the Armies of the living God, becauſe they had the Preſence of the tall Giant of <hi>Gath;</hi> certainly, we may defy the Armies of the uncircumcis'd, if we have the Preſence of Almighty God with us. As it is a great and invaluable Bleſſing to have the Preſence of God with us, ſo it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Miſery to have God forſake us; the greater the Bleſſing in having God with us, the greater the Miſery in being depriv'd of it As it is great Wiſdom to ſeek the Preſence of God; ſo it is great Folly to do any Thing to provoke God to forſake us.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now particularly apply myſelf to thoſe of our Brethren, and Friends, who are engag'd in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition on Foot, and are about to take their Leave of us.</p>

               <p>The Cauſe, you are engaged in, is undoubtedly good. Our Rights have been unjuſtly invaded. Lands ceded to us in the moſt ſolemn Treaties have been incroach'd on.

diſpute our Right to—Settlements have been broken up, People have been driven from their Farms, by which Multitudes of Families have been impoveriſhed. —If a Community may puniſh ſuch Things, in its own Members, (as undoubtedly it may) I don't ſee why they may not exert themſelves for the Puniſhment of another Community, which commits ſuch Hoſtilities againſt them. We are to ſet a greater Value on our Liberties and Priviledges, than tamely to ſuffer our ſelves to be depriv'd of them.</p>
               <p>The People, you are going againſt, are a Limb of that MOTHER OF HARLOTS, whom God has devoted to utter Deſtruction, whoſe Deſtruction is plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Word of God—The <hi>French</hi> Nation, in God's Account, ſtands chargeable with the Blood of many Saints and Martyrs, which, like the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> cries aloud for Vengeance againſt them. <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth.</hi> Rev. 6.9, 10.</p>
               <p>God has of late been pouring out the Vials of His Wrath on the Antichriſtian States.

               <p n="1">1. Do Violence to no Man. This is what the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt ſaid to the Soldiers, who aſk'd him what they muſt do. You may poſſibly think, this is a ſtrange Piece of Advice to be given to Soldiers, who are to effect their Deſigns by Force and Arms. But this, without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, you may gather from it, that you ſhould offer no Violence in the Towns of your Friends and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, through which you are to march. Soldiers often take Liberties, at a Diſtance from Home, which they would not do at Home. Thoſe you are going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, ſhould not be inſulted by you: Some I have ſeen march along, have needed this Caution—Or, this Paſſage of <hi>John</hi> may be a Prohibition of fighting with your Fellow-Soldiers—This Paſſage of the Baptiſt may be a Caution againſt depriving your Country-men, or Fellow-Soldiers, of their Property, violently, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly.—</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware of Drunkenneſs. Some may be in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into this Vice: This is a beaſtly Vice; it transforms a Man into a Beaſt—it expoſes a Man to do, and ſuffer all Manner of Evils in this World, and to inexpreſſible Miſery in the next World.— It is a Vice that renders very unfit for the Buſineſs of a Soldier. It is a Vice that infeebles and diſpirits a Man— Hoſea 4.11. <hi>Whoredom and Wine take away the Heart.</hi> He that ſtrives for the Maſtery, ſhould be temperate in all Things.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:007615_0020_102BA987D9F04240"/>3. Beware of profane Swearing. This is a Vice, I apprehend, you will be much expos'd to fall into. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> learnt to Swear by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> In ſuch a Concourſe of Men, there will be doubtleſs many, who will be addicted to this Vice. Men are apt to follow bad Examples—This Vice gratifys no ſenſual Appetite—It is highly provoking to God. I would have you remember your Succeſs depends on God: Can you, on good Grounds, hope for Succeſs, when you thus diſhonour Him?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beware of a mutinous Spirit and Diſpoſition. The Safety of the Army, under God, depends much on their Harmony and good Agreement. If it ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt itſelf, it can't ſtand. The Enemy would have an eaſy Conqueſt—you would do your Enemies Work for them in a great Meaſure. Therefore let none of you foment Diviſions, nor try to make any uneaſy, and diſcontented; but try to promote Concord and Unity: You will have Enemies enough without the Camp: You need not make any in it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neglect not your Duty in an Engagement, tho' attended with Difficulty and Danger. Don't think it will do to leave the Work to others, while you are <hi>ſneaking</hi> in ſome <hi>Hole.</hi> By ſuch Conduct you will be unfaithful to your Truſt—you will defraud the Country of what you receive of them—you will betray your Fellow-Soldiers; if any of them fall through your wilful Neglect of Duty, I don't ſee but their Blood muſt be required at your Hands.— You will weaken the Army, and expoſe it to be overthrown.—</p>
               <p n="6">6. Be much in Prayer. Though you may not have much Opportunity to retire for Prayer, yet be much in ejaculatory Prayer. Let theſe Places have Weight with you, Jam. 4.2. <hi>Ye Fight and War, yet ye have not, becauſe you aſk not. Ye aſk, and receive not, becauſe ye aſk amiſs, that ye may conſume it on your Luſts.</hi> And Pſal. 91.15.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007615_0021_102BA9A6FAC2EC48"/>
                  <hi>He ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him, I will be with him in Trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Attend on the publick religious Exerciſes of the Army, as often as you have Opportunity; you will be taken off from this often; but let not Sloth or Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it, hinder you.—</p>
               <p>I commend you to God. I pray God to be with you in all the Ways you ſhall go—to hold you in the Hollow of his Hand—to preſerve you amidſt all the Dangers you will be expoſed to—to fit you for the great Work, you are called to do—to make you Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reducing your, and your Countries Enemies— to return you with Songs of Praiſe in your Mouths; and that we and you may rejoice in the happy Iſſue of this Expedition.—Above all, That God would make you Overcomers in your ſpiritual Warfare, and intitle you to the Rewards of ſuch.</p>
               <p>You are going from us, dear Friends: Whether we ſhall all ſee each other in this World, God only knows. The Lord grant we may meet in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Farewell! I wiſh you well here, and for ever.</p>
               <p>I would ſay a Word to thoſe, who are about to part with Conſorts, Children, Brethren, or other near Friends— It is, no doubt, a Day of Trouble with you—you call to mind, no doubt, our dear Friends, and Neighbours, that loſt their Lives the laſt Campaign— <note n="*" place="bottom">Major <hi>Noah Aſhley,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Jonathan Ingerſol,</hi> and <hi>Richard Campbell,</hi> of this Town, were ſlain in Battle. <hi>Jonah Stiles,</hi> Jun. and <hi>Samuel Ponder,</hi> of this Town, died with Sickneſs</note> But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God's Providence is not confined to this Place, or that Place: He can keep ſafe in Places of greateſt Dangers, as well as elſewhere— Commit them to God, put your Truſt in God. Pſal. 112.7. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil Tidings, his Heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord.</hi>— Be much in Prayer to God for them, that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007615_0022_102BA98B32111F98"/>
they may have the Preſence of God with them, then they will do well. I pray God, you may from Time to Time, have comfortable Accounts from them. Tho' now you part in Tears, may you meet in Joy— The Lord fit you for his Will.</p>
               <p>And may this whole Aſſembly look on themſelves intereſted in the Event of this Expedition. Our Friends that are going from us, not only expoſe themſelves in Defence of their own Liberty and Property, but in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ours. They are entitled to our Prayers. Let us be much in Prayer for their Proſperity and Succeſs, that God's Preſence would go with them, and that He would give them and us Reſt, from the Calamities we have long groan'd under. When the Hoſt goeth againſt the Enemy, let us keep from every wicked Thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9.—I ſhall leave with you a gracious Word of God, and have done, Pſal. 81.13, 14, 15. <hi>O that my People had hearkened unto me, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my Ways. I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their Enemies, and turned my Hand againſt their Adverſaries. The Haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted themſelves to Him; but their Time ſhould have endured for ever.</hi>
