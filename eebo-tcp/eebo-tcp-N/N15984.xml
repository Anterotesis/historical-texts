            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LITTLE PRETTY POCKET-BOOK, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE grand Design in the Nurture of Children, is to make them <hi>Strong, Hardy, Healthy, Virtuous, Wise,</hi> and <hi>Happy;</hi> and these good Purposes are not to be obtained without some Care and Management in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>Would you have your Child <hi>Strong,</hi> take Care of your Nurse, let her be a prudent Woman, one that will give him what Meat and Drink is necessary, and such only as affords a good Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not salt Meat, rich tarts, Sauces,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020459_0003_0FAF0B3A860853A8"/>
Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Practice too common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst some indulgent People. She must also let the Child have due Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; for it is this that gives Life and Spirits, circulates the Blood, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Sinews, and keeps the whole Machinery in Order.</p>
            <p>Would you have a <hi>Hardy</hi> Child, give him common Diet only, clothe him thin, let him have good Exercise, and be as much exposed to Hardships as his natural Constitution will admit. The Face of a Child, when it comes into the world (says the great Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>) is as tender and susceptible of Injuries as any other part of the Body; yet, by being always exposed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Proof against the severest Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and the most inclement Weather; even at a Time when the Body (though wrapped in Flannels) is pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Cold. It is beside my Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to give a physical Reason for
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020459_0003_0FAF0B3A860853A8"/>
this; nor indeed will the Brevity of my Design admit of it. It is a Fact sufficiently known, what every Man must be sensible of, and therefore can need no Demonstration.</p>
            <p>Would you have a <hi>Healthy</hi> Son, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Directions already laid down with regard to Diet and Exercise, and keep him, as much as possible, from Physick; for Physick is to the Body, as Arms to the State; both are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, but neither to be used but in Cases of Emergency and Danger.</p>
            <p>Would you have a <hi>Virtuous</hi> Son, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still into him the Principles of Morality early, and encourage him in the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of those excellent Rules, by which whole Societies, States, Kingdoms, and Empires are knit together. Take heed what Company you intrust him with, and be always sure you set him a good Example yourself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:020459_0004_0FAF0B3B43372690"/>Would you have a <hi>Wise</hi> Son, teach him to reason early. Let him read, and make him understand what he reads. No Sentence should be passed over without a strict Examination of the Truth of it; and though this may be thought hard at first, and seem to retard the Boy in his Progress, yet, a little Practice will make it familiar, and a Method of Reasoning will be acquired, which will be of Use to him all his Life after. Let him study Mankind; shew him the Springs and Hinges on which they move; teach him to draw Consequences from the Actions of others; and if he should hesitate or mistake, you are to set him right: But then take Care to do it in such a Manner, as to forward his Enquiries, and pave this his grand Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit with Pleasure. Was this Method of Reasoning put more in Practice by Tutors, Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we should not see
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020459_0004_0FAF0B3B43372690"/>
so many dismal Objects in the World, for People would learn by the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of others to avert their own.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but every Parent, every Father and Mother, would gladly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute what they could towards the Happiness of their Children; and yet it is surprising to see how blind they are, and how wide they mistake the Mark. What the indulgent Parent generally proposes for the Happiness of his Child, is a good Fortune to bear him up under the Calamities of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but daily Experience tells us, this is insufficient. Happiness and Misery have their Source from the Passions: If in the Midst of the greatest Affluence, we are always repining, and think ourselves poor and miserable, we are so; and the Beggar in the Straw, who is content, and thinks he has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, is rich and happy. The whole Matter subsists in the Mind, and the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020459_0005_0FAF0B3C234488B0"/>
Constitution: Subdue therefore your Children's Passions; curb their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and make them subservient to the Rules of Reason. And this is not to be done by chiding, whipping, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Treatment, but by Reasoning and mild Discipline. Were I to see my Son too much ruffled and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, I should take him aside, and point out to him the Evils that attend passionate Men; tell him, that my Love for him would make me over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look many Faults, but that this was of so heinous a Nature, that I could not bear the Sight of him while he continued so wicked; that he should not see his Mother, nor any of his Playmates, until he had sufficiently repented of that Crime: Upon which, I would immediately order him (in a very calm Manner) to be shut up from any Company for five or six Hours, and then, upon his Confession of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020459_0005_0FAF0B3C234488B0"/>
Fault, asking Pardon for his Offence, and promising Amendment for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I would forgive him. This Meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, regularly pursued, would soon break his Passion of Resentment, and subdue it to Reason. The next pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Step to be taken, is to check his inordinate craving and desiring almost every Thing he sees; and this, I think, might be as easily effected as the other; for, in the first Place, I would lay down this as a Maxim with him, that he should never have any Thing he cried for; and therefore, if he was willing to obtain any Favour, he must come with some reasonable Request, and withdraw without the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any Uneasiness in Case of a Disappointment.</p>
            <p>Some over-fond People will think these are harsh Precepts. What, say they, are Children never to be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? answer, Yes, I would have them
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020459_0006_0FAF0B3CC3492408"/>
obliged and pleased, but not humoured and spoiled. They should have what they asked for in a proper Manner; but then they should wait my Time, without seeming over solicitous, or cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it. I would make them exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Patience, that they might know the Use of it, when the Cares of the World came on. And therefore, I say again, Children should never have any Thing they cried for; no, not on any Consideration whatsoever.</p>

            <p>YOUR Nurse called upon me To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and told me that you was a good Boy; that you was dutiful to your Father and Mother, and that, when you have said your Prayers in the Morning and the Evening, you asked their Blessing, and in the Day-time
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020459_0007_0FAF0B3DB36C0448"/>
did every Thing they bid you. She says, you are obedient to your Master, loving and kind to your Play-fellows, obliging to every Body; that you rise early in the Morning, keep yourself clean, and learn your Book; that when you have done a Fault you confess it, and are sorry for it. And though you are sometimes naughty, she says you are very honest and good-humoured; that you do not swear, tell Lies; nor say indecent Words, and are always thankful when any Body gives you good Advice: that you never quarrel, nor do wicked Things, as some other Boys do.</p>
            <p>This Character, my Dear, has made every Body love you; and, while you continue so good, you may depend on my obliging you with every Thing I can. I have here sent you a <hi>Little Pretty Pocket-Book,</hi> which will teach you to play at all those innocent Games

that good Boys and Girls divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with: And, while you behave so well, you shall never want Play, I assure you. But my dear <hi>Tommy,</hi> in order that you may be as good as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, I have also sent you a <hi>Ball,</hi> the one Side of which is <hi>Red,</hi> the other <hi>Black,</hi> and with it <hi>ten Pins</hi>; and I must insist upon making this Bargain, that your Nurse may hang up the <hi>Ball</hi> by the String to it, and for every good Action you do, a <hi>Pin</hi> shall be stuck on the <hi>Red Side,</hi> and for every bad Action a <hi>Pin</hi> shall be stuck on the <hi>Black Side.</hi> And when by doing good and pretty Things you have got all the <hi>ten Pins</hi> on the <hi>Red Side,</hi> then I will send you a <hi>Penny,</hi> and so I will as often as all the <hi>Pins</hi> shall be fairly got on that Side.

               <salute>Dear Miss Polly,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Nurse called upon me To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and told me that you was a good Girl; that you was dutiful to your Father and Mother, and that, when you have said your Prayers in the Morning and the Evening, you
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020459_0009_0FAF0B3EF23DFFE0"/>
asked their Blessing, and in the Day-time did every Thing they bid you. She says, you are obedient to your Mistress, loving and kind to your Play-fellows, and obliging to every Body; that you rise early in the Morning, keep yourself clean, and learn your Book; that when you have done a Fault you confess it, and are sorry for it. And though you are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times naughty, she says you are very honest and good-humoured; that you do not tell Lies, nor say indecent Words and are always thankful when any Body gives you good Advice; that you never quarrel, nor do wicked Things, as some other Girls do.</p>
            <p>This Character, my Dear, has made every Body love you; and while you continue so good, you may depend on my obliging you with every Thing I can. I have here sent you a <hi>Little Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020459_0009_0FAF0B3EF23DFFE0"/>
Pocket-Book,</hi> which will teach you to play at all those innocent Games that good Boys and Girls divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with: And, while you behave so well, you shall never want Play, I assure you. But then my dear <hi>Polly,</hi> in order that you may be as good as possible, I have also sent you a <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cushion,</hi> the one Side of which is <hi>Red</hi> and the other <hi>Black</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with it <hi>ten Pins</hi>; and I must insist upon making this Bargain, that your Nurse may hang up the <hi>Pincushion</hi> by the String to it, and for every good Action you do, a <hi>Pin</hi> shall be stuck on the <hi>Red Side,</hi> and for every bad Action a <hi>Pin</hi> shall be stuck on the <hi>Black Side.</hi> And when by doing good and pretty Things you have got all the <hi>ten Pins</hi> on the <hi>Red Side,</hi> then I will send you a <hi>Penny,</hi> and so I will as often as all the <hi>Pins</hi> shall be fairly got on that Side. But
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020459_0010_0FAF0B3FE3A64438"/>
if ever the <hi>Pins</hi> be all found on the <hi>Black Side</hi> of the <hi>Pincushion,</hi> then I will send a <hi>Rod,</hi> and you shall be whipt as often as they are found there. But this, my Dear I hope you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent by continuing a good Girl, that every Body may still love you, as well as</p>

            </p>
            <p>THERE was in my Country a little Boy who learned his Book to that surprising Degree, that his Master could scarce teach him fast enough, for he had his Lesson almost as soon as it was pointed out to him; which raised the Attention of every Body: And as he was also very dutiful to his Parents and obliging to his Playmates, every Body loved him. His Learning and Behaviour purchased him the Esteem of the greatest People, and raised him from a mean State of Life to a Coach and Six, in which he rides to this Day. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a most excellent Thing, and easy to be acquired too, when little Boys set themselves earnestly about it. I know several Masters at this Time, who all bid fair for the same Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the above Gentleman enjoys.</p>
