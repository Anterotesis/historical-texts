            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This ſtate has again called a Convention for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of adopting the New Conſtitution, nor is there now any doubt that when the mild yet efficient operations of the New Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, together with the wiſdom and patriotiſm of the members of the Federal Legiſlature, are duly conſidered, it will remove every doubt of thoſe with whoſe opinions it may not entirely coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; and confirm the expectations of its numerous friends. And her extenſive frontier being obliged to export the greater part of her producttions through Virginia, there is no doubt, has fully evinced the neceſſity of her acceding to the confederation, as a depreciated paper medium is conſidered as the principal cauſe of the anti-national ſpirit of this ſtate. The principal towns are, Newbern, Halifax, Edenton, Waſhington, Fayetteville, Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Hilſborough.</p>

               <p>Including the iſland of that name and Providence Plantations, is bounded on the North by Maſſachuſetts-Bay, on the Eaſt by the Atlantic, on the Weſt by Connecticut, and on the South by the Atlantic; is 68 miles in length, and 40 in breadth, contained, according to a cenſus in 1783, 51, 896 inhabitants.

This diſmemberment of the ſtate it is to be deſired, may be prevented by her being wholly graffed into that ſtock from whence through blindneſs ſhe has been broken off. The principal towns are, Newport, the capital, ſituate on Rhode-Iſland, which has an excellent harbour; and Providence, ſituated at the head of navigation on a large river or arm of the ſea, thirty miles from Newport, at preſent in a flouriſhing condition. The buſineſs of this ſtate conſiſts principally in the Whale Fiſhing and Weſt-India trade.</p>

            <p>SOME years ago, immediately after the ſhock of a tremendous earthquake had alarmed the inhabitants of Grenada, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation turned at the governor's table, upon the latent occaſion of the above phaenomenon; after every one of the company had aſſigned it to a different cauſe, an old negro woman was aſked, what was her opinion on the ſubject; ſhe replied, <hi>"ſhe thought the great God was paſſing by, and the earth had made him a curteſy."</hi>

            <p>A gentleman met another in the ſtreet, who was ill of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and accoſted him thus—"Ah! my friend, you <hi>walk exceedingly flow"</hi>—"Yes (replied the ſick man) but I am <hi>going very faſt.</hi>"</p>
            <p>A gentleman and his man riding into the country, they met a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low aſtride upon a cow. The man calls cut to his maſter, O, ſir, ſays he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yonder is a ſtrange ſight! a fellow is <hi>on horſeback on a cow.</hi> That's a bull ſaid the gentleman. Nay, ſir, ſaid the man, it is not a bull, I know it is a cow by its teats.</p>
            <p>A perſon bought a pair of horns and brought them home; his wife aſked what he meant? he ſaid to hang his hat on. Good lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſays ſhe, <hi>cannot you keep your hat on your own head?</hi>

            <p>Colonel Bond, who had been one of king Charles the firſt's judges died a day or two before Cromwell, and it was ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported every where, that the protector was dead; "No" ſays a gentleman, who knew better, <hi>"he has only given bond to the devil for his future appearance."</hi>

            <p>If you marry (ſaid a father to his daughter) you will do <hi>well;</hi> if you do not marry, you will do <hi>better.</hi> If that's the caſe, replied the daughter, "get me a huſband as ſoon as you can, I ſhall be content to do <hi>well,</hi> and leave it to others to do <hi>better.</hi>"</p>

The following example of laudable pride in a ſoldier, was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a letter from an officer of the American army, written ſoon after the battle of Monmouth.—A ſoldier in that memorable action, fell into the hands of the Engliſh cavalry, when one of them knocked him down, and attempted to pierce him through the back with his ſword,—<hi>"Strike me in the heart,"</hi> ſaid he, turning briſkly about <hi>"that my friends may not bluſh for me after my death."</hi>

            <p>An honeſt clergyman in the country was reproving a married couple for their frequent diſſenſions, which were very unbecoming both in the eye of God and man, ſeeing that you are both <hi>one; Both one!</hi> cried the huſband, <hi>were you to come by our door ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when we quarrel, you would ſwear we were twenty.</hi>

            <p>A ſoldier in the late war having ſtolen a ſhirt from a farmer, to whom he would not make reſtitution—"Well, (ſaid the farmer) if you keep it, you will pay for it in this world or in the next.—"Faith, (replied the ſoldier) if you will truſt ſo long, I will take another."</p>
            <p>An honeſt Jack Tar being at a quaker's meeting, heard the friend that was holding forth ſpeak with great emotion, againſt the ill conſequence of giving the lie in converſation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adviſed, when a man was telling a tale, that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with truth or probability, to cry <hi>twang,</hi> which would not irritate the paſſions as the lie would. After digreſſing into the ſtory of the great miracle of five thouſand being fed with five loaves of bread &amp;c he told them that they were not ſuch loaves as are uſed now, but were as big as a mountain; at the hearing of which the tar uttered with a loud voice, <hi>twang!</hi> What, ſays the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, doſt thou think I lie, friend? No, ſays Jack, but I am think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>how big the ovens were that baked them.</hi>

            <p>Dr. Sheridan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the celebrated friend of Swift, had a cuſtom of ringing his ſcholars to prayers in his ſchool room, at a certain hour every day. The boys were one day very devoutly at prayers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one, who was ſtifling a laugh as well as he could; which aroſe from ſeeing a rat deſcending from the bell-rope into the room. The poor boy could hold out no longer, but burſt into an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate fit of laughter, which ſet the others agoing when he pointed to the cauſe. Sheridan was ſo provoked, that he declared he would whip them all if the principal culprit was not pointed out to him;
<pb facs="unknown:022295_0043_0FB7E7109DDDE3A8"/>
which was immediately done. The poor pupil of Momus was immediately hoiſted, and his poſteriors laid bare to the rod, when the witty ſchoolmaſter told him, if he ſaid any thing tolerable on the occaſion, as he looked on him as the greateſt dunce in his ſchool, he would forgv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him. The trembling culprit, with very little heſitation addreſſed his maſter with the following beautiful distich:
<q>
                  <l>There was a rat—for want of ſtairs,</l>
                  <l>Came down a rope—to go to pray'rs.</l>
               </q>
Sheridan inſtantly dropped the rod, and inſtead of a whipping gave him half a crown.</p>

As for me, I am no more yours, nor you mine; death hath cut us aſunder; and God hath divided me from the world, and you from me. Remember your poor child, for his father's ſake, who loved you in his happieſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. I ſued for my life, but (God knows) it was for you and yours, that I deſired it; for know it, my dear wife, your child, is the child of a true man, who in his own reſpect deſpiſeth death, and his miſhapen and ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forms. I cannot write much; God knows, how hardly I ſteal this time, when all are aſleep: And it is alſo time for me to ſeparate my thoughts from the world. Beg my dead body, which living was denied you; and either lay it in Sherburne, or Exeter Church, by my father and mother. I can ſay no more; time and death call me away. The everlaſting God, powerful, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and inſcrutable, God Almighty, who is goodneſs itſelf, the true light and life, keep you and yours, and have mercy upon me, and forgive my perſecutors, and falſe accuſers; and ſend us to meet in his glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. My dear wife, farewell; bleſs my boy, pray for me: and let my true God hold you both in his arms.</p>

            <p>A very pious Gentleman, but rather worldly, who lives not many miles from Boſton, made it his conſtant practice to call up his family before day, in order that they might attend prayers and be ready for their labour in good ſeaſon: One morning having muſtered his family rather earlier than common, he commenced family duties by prayer, during which he returned thanks to the Lord, that they were brought to ſee the light of <hi>another day:</hi> an old negro ſtanding by, cried out, <hi>"Top, top, vate a bit, no day yet, maſſa, ſartin, no day yet."</hi>
