            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TWO SHOEMAKERS.</head>
            <p>HE knew he owed his preſent happy ſituation to the kindneſs of the creditors. But did he grow eaſy and careleſs becauſe he knew he had ſuch friends? No indeed. He worked with double diligence in order to get out of debt, and to let theſe friends ſee he did not abuſe their kindneſs. Such beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as this is the greateſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world to rich people to lend a little money.</p>
            <p>His ſhoes, and boots were made in the beſt manner, this <hi>got</hi> him buſineſs, he ſet out with a rule to tell no lies and deceive no cuſtomers; this <hi>secured</hi> his buſineſs. He had two reaſons for not promiſing to ſend home goods when he knew he ſhould not be able to keep his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037146_0003_100C83A3591AA2C0"/>
word. The firſt, becauſe he knew a lie was a ſin, the next, becauſe it was a folly. There is no credit ſooner worn out than that which is got by falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. After a little while no one is deceived by them. Falſehood is ſo ſoon found out that I believe moſt tradeſmen are the poorer for it in the long run. Deceit is the worſt part of a ſhopkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſtock in trade.</p>
            <p>James was now at the head of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. "This is a ſerious ſituation," (ſaid he to himſelf, one fine ſummer's evening, as he ſtood leaning over the half door of his ſhop to enjoy a little freſh air) "I am now maſter of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. My cares are doubled and ſo are my duties. I ſee the higher one gets in life the more one has to anſwer for. Let me now call to mind the ſorrow I uſed to feel when I was made to carry work home on a Sunday by an ungodly maſter.</p>
            <p>So what his heart found right to do he reſolved to do quickly; and he ſet out at firſt as he meant to go on. The Sunday
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037146_0004_100C83A62B0F3950"/>
was truly a day of reſt at Mr. Stock's. He would not allow a pair of ſhoes to be given out on that day to oblige the beſt cuſtomer he had. And what did he looſe by it? Why nothing. For when people were once uſed to it, they liked Saturday night juſt as well. But had it been otherwiſe he would have given up his gains to his conſcience.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Shewing how Mr. STOCK behaved to his APPRENTICES.</head>
               <p>When he got up in the world ſo far as to have apprentices, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as accountable for their behaviour as if they had been his children. He was very kind to them, and had a cheerful merry way of talking to them, ſo that the lads who had ſeen much of ſwearing reprobate maſters, were very fond of him. They were never afraid of ſpeaking to him, they told him all their little troubles, and conſidered their maſter as their beſt friend, for they ſaid they would do any thing for a good word and a kind look. As he did not
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037146_0005_100C9531AB778C58"/>
ſwear at them when they had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a fault, they did not lie to him to conceal it, and thereby make one fault two. But though he was very kind, he was very watchful alſo, for he did not think neglect any part of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He brought them to one pretty method, which was, of a Sunday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divert themſelves with writing out half a dozen texts of Scripture in a pretty copy book with gilt covers. You may have the ſame at any of the Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner's; they do not coſt above eleven-pence, and will laſt nearly a year.</p>
               <p>When the boys carried him their books, he juſtly commended him whoſe texts were written in the faireſt hand. "And now my boys," ſaid he, "let us ſee which of you will learn your texts beſt in the courſe of the week; he who does ſhall chuſe for next Sunday." Thus the boys ſoon got many pſalms and chapters by heart, almoſt without knowing how they came by them. He taught them how to make a practical uſe of what they learnt; "for," ſaid he, "it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037146_0006_100C9533B7483CA8"/>
will anſwer little purpoſe to learn texts if we do not try to live up to them." One of the boys being apt to play in his abſence, and to run back again to his work when he heard his maſters ſtep, he brought him to a ſenſe of his fault by the laſt Sunday's texts, which happened to be the 6th of Epheſians. He ſhewed him what was meant by being "obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his maſter in ſingleneſs of heart as unto Chriſt," and explained to him with ſo much kindneſs what it was, "not to work with eye ſervice as men pleaſers, but doing the will of God from the heart," that the lad ſaid he ſhould never forget it, and it did more towards curing him of idleneſs than the ſoundeſt horſe-whipping would have done.</p>

               <head>How Mr. STOCK got out of debt.</head>
               <p>Stock's behaviour was very regular, and he was much beloved for his kind and peaceable temper. He had alſo a good reputation for ſkill in his trade, and his induſtry was talked of through the whole town, ſo that he had ſoon more
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037146_0007_100C9535E59D3238"/>
work than he could poſſibly do. He paid all his dealers to the very day, and took care to carry his intereſt money to the creditors the moment it became due. In two or three years he was able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to pay off a ſmall part of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal. His reaſon for being ſo eager to pay money as ſoon as it became due was this. He had obſerved tradeſmen, and eſpecially his old maſter, put off the day of payment as long as they could, even though they had the means in their power. This deceived them. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving money in their pockets they forgot it belonged to the creditor, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o themſelves, and ſo got to fancy they were rich when they were really poor. This falſe notion led them to indulge in idle expences, whereas, if they had paid regularly they would have had this one temptation the leſs. A young tradeſman, when he is going to ſpend money, ſhould at leaſt aſk himſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this money is his own or his credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. This little queſtion might help to prevent many a bankruptcy.</p>

A true Chriſtian always goes heartily to work to find out what is his beſetting ſin; and when he has found it, (which he eaſily may if he looks ſharp) againſt this ſin he watches narrowly. Now I know it is the faſhion among ſome folks (and a bad faſhion it is) to fancy that good people have no ſin; but this only ſhews their ignorance. It is not true. That good man St. Paul knew better. And when men do not own their ſins, it is not becauſe there is no ſin in their hearts, but becauſe they are not anxious to ſearch for it, nor humble to confeſs it, nor penitent to mourn over it. But this was not the caſe with James Stock. "Examine yourſelves truly," ſaid he, "is no bad part of the catechiſm." He began to be afraid that his deſire of living creditably and without being a burthen to any one, might, under the maſk of honeſty and independence lead him into pride and covetouſneſs. He feared that the bias of his heart lay that way. So inſtead of being proud of his ſobriety; inſtead of bragging that he never ſpent his money idly, nor went
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037146_0009_100C839D0AD80428"/>
to the alehouſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtead of boaſting how hard he worked, and how he denied himſelf, he ſtrove in ſecret that even theſe good qualities might not grow out of a wrong root. The following event was of uſe to him in this way.</p>
               <p>One evening as he was ſtanding at the door of his ſhop, a poor dirty boy without-ſtockings and ſhoes came up and aſked him for a bit of broken victuals, for he had eaten nothing all day. In ſpite of his dirt and rags he was a very pretty, lively, civil ſpoken boy, and Mr. Stock could not help thinking he knew ſomething of his face. He fetched him out a good piece of bread and cheeſe, and while the boy was devouring it, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if he had no parents, and why he went about in that vagabond manner? "Daddy has been dead ſome years," ſaid the boy, "he died in a fit over at the Greyhound. Mammy ſays he uſed to live at this ſhop, and then we did not want for clothes nor victuals neither." Stock was melted almoſt tears on finding that this dirty beggar boy was Tommy
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037146_0010_100C953A36318518"/>
Williams, the ſon of his old maſter. He bleſſed God on comparing his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition with that of this poor deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute child, but he was not proud at the compariſon, and while he was thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for his own proſperity, he pitied the helpleſs boy.—"Where have you been living of late," ſaid he to him? "for I underſtand you all went home to your mother's friends." "So we did Sir," ſaid the boy, "but they are grown tired of maintaining us, becauſe they ſaid that Mammy ſpent all the money which ſhould have gone to buy victuals for us, on ſnuff and drams. And ſo they have ſent us back to this place, which is Daddy's pariſh."</p>
               <p>"And where do you live here?" ſaid Mr. Stock. "O Sir, we are all put in the pariſh poor-houſe."—"And does your mother do any thing to help to maintain you?" "No, Sir, for Mammy ſays ſhe was not brought up to work like poor folks, and ſhe would rather ſtarve than ſpin or knit; ſo ſhe lies a bed all the morning, and ſends us about to pick
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037146_0011_100C953D0A514028"/>
up what we can, a bit of victuals, or a few half-pence." "And have you any money in your pocket now?" "Yes, Sir, I have got three half-pence which I have begged to day." "Then, as you were ſo very hungry, how came you not to buy a roll at that baker's over the way?" "Becauſe, Sir, I was going to lay it out in tea for Mammy, for I nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lay out a farthing for myſelf. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mammy ſays ſhe will have her tea twice a day if we beg or ſtarve for it." "Can you read my boy?" ſaid Mr. Stock. "A little, Sir, and ſay my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers too." "And can you ſay your catechiſm?" "I have almoſt forgot it all, Sir, though I remember about ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring my father and mother, and that makes me ſtill carry the half-pence home to Mammy inſtead of buying cakes." "Who taught you theſe good things?" "One Jemmy Stock, Sir, who was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh 'prentice to my Daddy. He taught me one queſtion out of the catechiſm every night, and always made me ſay my prayers to him before I went to bed. He told me I ſhould go to the wicked
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037146_0012_100C953FB3DA5E48"/>
place if I did not fear God, ſo I am ſtill afraid to tell lies like the other boys. Poor Jemmy gave me a piece of gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerbread every time I learnt well; but I have no friend now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jemmy was good to me, though Mammy did nothing but beat him."</p>
               <p>Mr. Stock was too much moved to carry on the diſcourſe, he did not make himſelf, known to the boy, but took him over to the baker's ſhop; as they walked along he could not help repeating aloud, a verſe or two of that beautiful hymn, ſo deſervedly the favourite of all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Not more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>Or beg from door to door.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The little boy looked up in his face ſaying, "Why Sir, that's the very hymn which Jemmy Stock gave me a penny for learning." Stock made no anſwer,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037146_0013_100C95414C2EA318"/>
but put a couple of three penny loaves into his hand to carry home, and told him to call on him again at ſuch a time in the following week.</p>

               <head>How Mr. STOCK continued to be charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without any Expence.</head>
               <p>Stock had abundant ſubject for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that night. He was puzzled what to do with the boy. While he was carrying on his trade upon borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed money he did not think it right to give any part of that money to aſſiſt the idle, or even to help the diſtreſſed. "I muſt be juſt," ſaid he, "before I am generous." Still he could not bear to ſee this fine boy given up to certain ruin. He did not think it ſafe to take him into the ſhop in his preſent ignorant unprincipled ſtate. At laſt he hit upon this thought. I work for myſelf twelve hours in the day. Why ſhall not I work one hour or two for this boy in the evening? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:037146_0014_100C9543CF0C6AC0"/>
So he began to put his reſolution in practice that very night, ſticking to his old notion of not putting off till to-mor-row what ſhould be done to-day; and it was thought he owed much of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in life, as well as his growth in goodneſs to this little ſaying. "I am young and healthy," ſaid he, "one hour's more work will do me no harm; I will ſet aſide all I get by theſe over hours, and put the boy to ſchool. I have not only no right to puniſh this child for the ſins of his father, but I conſider that though God hated thoſe ſins, he has made them inſtruments for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement."</p>
               <p>Tommy Williams called at the time appointed. In the mean time Mr. Stock's maid had made him a tidy little ſuit of clothes out of an old coat of her maſter's. She had alſo knit him a pair of ſtockings, and Mr. Stock made him ſit down in the ſhop, while he himſelf fitted him with a pair of new ſhoes. The maid having waſhed and dreſſed him, Mr. Stock took him by the hand
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037146_0015_100C954668B806C8"/>
and walked along with him to the pariſh poor-houſe to find his mother. They found her dreſſed in ragged filthy finery, ſtanding at the door, where ſhe paſſed moſt of her time, quarrelling with half a dozen women as idle and dirty as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; when ſhe ſaw Tommy ſo neat and well dreſſed, ſhe fell a crying for joy. She ſaid it put her mind of old times, for Tommy always uſed to be dreſſed like a gentleman. "So much the worſe," ſaid Mr. Stock, "if you had not begun by making him look like a gentleman, you needed not have ended by making him look like a beggar." "Oh Jem," ſaid ſhe, (for though it was four years ſince ſhe had ſeen him, ſhe ſoon recollected him) "fine times for you! ſet a beggar on horſeback—you know the proverb. I ſhall beat Tommy well for finding you out, and expoſing me to you."</p>
               <p>Inſtead of entering into any diſpute with this bad wowan, or praiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her expence; or putting her in mind of her paſt ill behaviour to him; or reproaching her with the bad uſe ſhe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037146_0016_100C95485C7E7AB8"/>
had made of her proſperity, he mildly ſaid to her, "Mrs. Williams I am ſorry for your misfortunes; I am come to relieve you of part of your burthen. I will take Tommy off your hands. I will give him a years board and ſchooling, and by that time I ſhall ſee what he is fit for. I will promiſe nothing, but if the boy turns out well I will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him. I ſhall make but one bargain with you, which is, that he muſt not come to this place to hear all this rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſwearing, nor ſhall he keep company with theſe pilfering idle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. You are welcome to go and ſee him when you pleaſe, but here he muſt not come.</p>
               <p>The fooliſh woman burſt out a crying, ſaying, "ſhe ſhould loſe her poor dear Tommy for ever. Mr. Stock might give <hi>her</hi> the money he intended to pay at the ſchool, for nobody could do ſo well by him as his own mother." The truth was, ſhe wanted to get theſe new clothes into her clutches, which would all have been pawned at the dram ſhop before
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037146_0017_100C954A31C7E580"/>
the week was out. This Mr. Stock well knew. From crying ſhe fell to ſcolding and ſwearing. She told him he was an unnatural wretch, that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a child deſpiſe his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe ſhe was poor. She even went ſo far as to ſay ſhe would not part from him; ſhe ſaid ſhe hated your godly people, they had no bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but tried to ſet men, women, and children againſt their own fleſh and blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stock now almoſt loſt his patience, and for one moment a thought came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs him to ſtrip the boy, carry back his clothes, and leave him to his unpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iful mother. "Why," ſaid he, "ſhould I work over hours, and wear out my ſtrength for this wicked woman?" But he ſoon checked this thought, by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the patience and long ſuffering of God with rebellious ſinners. This cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his anger in a moment, and he mildly reaſoned with her on her folly and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in oppoſing the good of her child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037146_0018_100C954CAD5BA9F0"/>
One of the neighbours who ſtood by, ſaid, what a fine thing it was for the boy, but ſome people were born to be lucky! She wiſhed Mr. Stock would take a fancy to her child, he ſhould have him ſoon enough. Mrs. Williams now began to be frightened leſt Mr. Stock ſhould take the woman at her word, and ſullenly conſented to let the boy go, from envy and malice, not from prudence and gratitude; and Tommy was ſent to ſchool that very night, his mother crying and roaring inſtead of thanking God for ſuch a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot forbear telling a very goodnatured thing of Will Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, one of the workmen. By-the-by it was that very young fellow who was reformed by Stock's good example when he was an apprentice, and who uſed to ſing Pſalms with him on a Sunday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they got out of the way of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams's junketting. Will coming home early one evening, was ſurpriſed to find his maſter at work by himſelf, long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the uſual time. He begged ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037146_0019_100C954EA1C08890"/>
to know the reaſon, that Stock owned the truth. Will was ſo ſtruck with this piece of kindneſs, that he ſnatched up a laſt, crying out, "Well maſter, you ſhall not work by yourſelf however; we will go ſnacks in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Tommy; it ſhall never be ſaid that Will Simpſon was idling about, when his maſter was working for char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity." This made the hour paſs cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and doubled the profits.</p>
               <p>In a year or two Mr. Stock, by God's bleſſing on his labours, became quite clear of the world. He now paid off his creditors; but he never forgot his obligation to them, and found many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſhewing kindneſs to them, and to their children after them. He now caſt about for a proper wife, and as he was thought a proſperous man, and very well looking beſides, moſt of the ſmart girls of the place, with their tawdry finery, uſed to be often parading before the ſhop, and would even go to church in order to put themſelves in his way. But Mr. Stock when he went to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037146_0020_100C9550955CAC78"/>
church had other things in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead, and if ever he thought about theſe gay damſels at all, it was with concern at ſeeing them ſo improperly tricked out, ſo that the very means they took to pleaſe him, made him diſlike them.</p>
               <p>There was one Betty Weſt, a young woman of excellent character and very modeſt appearance. He had ſeldom ſeen her out, as ſhe was employed night and day in waiting on an aged widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mother who was both lame and blind. This good girl was indeed eyes and feet to her helpleſs parent, and Mr. Stock uſed to ſee her through the little caſement window lifting her up and feeding her with a tenderneſs which greatly raiſed his eſteem for her. He uſed to tell Will Simpſon, as they ſat at work, that ſuch a dutiful daughter could hardly fail of making a faithful wife. He had not, however, the heart to try to draw her off from her care of her ſick mother. The poor woman declined ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt. Betſy was much employed in in reading or praying by her while ſhe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037146_0021_100C955223DAD158"/>
was awake, and paſſed good part of the night while ſhe ſlept, in doing ſome fine wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to ſell in order to ſupply her ſick mother with little niceties which their poor pittance could not afford, while ſhe herſelf lived on a cruſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stock knew that Betſy would have little or nothing after her mother's death, as ſhe had only a life income. On the other hand Mr. Thompſon, the Tanner, had offered him 200l. with his daughter Nancy. But he was almoſt ſorry that he had not in this caſe an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reſiſting his natural bias, which rather lay on the ſide of loving money: "For," ſaid he, <q>putting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and putting affection out of the queſtion, I ſhall do a more <hi>prudent</hi> thing by marrying Betſy Weſt, who will conform to her ſtation, and is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, humble, induſtrious girl, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſhilling, than by having an idle dreſſy laſs, who will neglect my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fill my houſe with company, though ſhe ſhould have twice the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037146_0022_100C9554988F9130"/>
which Nancy Thompſon would bring.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At length poor old Mrs. Weſt was releaſed from all her ſufferings. At a proper time Mr. Stock propoſed marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Betſy, and was accepted. All the diſappointed girls in the town won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what any body could like in ſuch a dowdy as that. Had the man no eyes? They thought Mr. Stock had more taſte. Oh! how it did provoke all the vain idle things to find, that ſtaying at home; dreſſing plainly, ſerving God, and nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a blind mother, ſhould do that for Betſy Weſt which all their contrivances, flaunting, and dancing could not do for them.</p>
               <p>He was not diſappointed of meeting with a good wife in Betſy, as indeed thoſe who marry on right grounds ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are. But if religious perſons will chuſe partners for life who have no religion, do not let them complain that they are unhappy; they might have known that beforehand. Tommy Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037146_0023_100C9556FAE01138"/>
was now taken home to Stock's houſe and bound apprentice. He was always kind and attentive to his mother; and every penny which Will Simpſon or his maſter gave him for learning a chapter he would ſave to buy a bit of tea and ſugar for her. When the other boys laughed at him for being ſo fooliſh as to deny himſelf cakes and apples to give his money to her who was ſo bad a woman, he would anſwer, "it may be ſo, but ſhe is my mother for all that."</p>
               <p>Mr. Stock was much moved at the change in this boy, who turned out a very good youth. He reſolved, as God ſhould proſper him, that he would try to ſnatch other helpleſs creatures from ſin and ruin. "For" ſaid he, "it is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's bleſſing on the inſtructions of my good miniſter when I was a child, that I have been ſaved from the broad way of deſtruction." He ſtill gave God the glory of every thing he did aright, and when Will Simpſon one day ſaid to him, "Maſter, I wiſh I were half as good as you are." "William," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037146_0024_100C955953ECFF78"/>
he gravely, "I once read in a book, that the Devil is willing enough we ſhould appear to do good actions if he can but make us proud of them."</p>
               <p>But we muſt not forget our old acquaintance, Mr. Stock's fellow 'pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. So you ſhall now hear what befel idle Jack, who, being a farmer's ſon, had many advantages to begin life with. But he who wants prudence may be ſaid to want every thing, becauſe he turns all his advantages to no account.</p>
               <p>Jack Brown was juſt out of his time when his maſter Williams died in that terrible drunken fit at the Greyhound. You know already how Stock ſucceeded to his maſter's buſineſs, and proſpered in it. Jack wiſhed very much to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to partnerſhip with him. His father and mother too were deſirous of it, and offered to advance a hundred pounds with him. Here is a freſh proof of the power of a good character! the old far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with all his covetouſneſs, was eager to get his ſon into partnerſhip with
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037146_0025_100C955AF793B4F8"/>
Stock, though the latter was not worth a ſhilling, and even his mother, with all her pride was eager for it, for they had ſenſe enough to ſee it would be the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Jack. The father knew that Stock would look to the main chance; and the mother that he would take the labouring oar, and ſo her darling would have little to do.</p>
               <p>Stock, however, young as he was, "was too old a bird to be caught with chaff." His wiſdom was an overmatch for their cunning. He had a kindneſs for Brown, but would on no account en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into buſineſs with him. "One of theſe three things," ſaid he, "I am ſure of if I do; he will either hurt my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, my character, or my trade; perhaps all." And here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by-the-by, let me drop a hint to other young men who are about to enter into partnerſhip. Let them not do that in haſte which they may repent at leiſure. Next to marriage it is a tie the hardeſt to break; and next to that it is an engagement which ought to be entered into with the utmoſt caution.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037146_0026_100C955C9C96A250"/>
Many things go to the making ſuch a connection ſuitable, ſafe, and pleaſant. There is many a top man need not be above taking a hint in this reſpect from James Stock the Shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Brown was ſtill unwilling to leave him, indeed he was too idle to look out for buſineſs, ſo he offered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stock to work with him as a journeyman; but this he alſo mildly refuſed. It hurt his good nature to do ſo; but he reflected that a young man who has his way to make in the world muſt not only be good natured, he muſt be prudent alſo. "I am reſolved" ſaid he "to employ none but the moſt ſober regular young men I can get. "Evil communications corrupt good manners," and I ſhould be anſwerable for all the diſorders of my own houſe if I knowingly took a wild drinking young fellow into it. "That which might be kindneſs to one, would be injuſtice to many, and therefore a ſin in myſelf."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:037146_0027_100C955E29695180"/>
Brown's mother was in a great rage when ſhe heard that her ſon had ſtooped ſo low as to make this offer. She thought pride was a grand thing. Poor woman! She did not know that it was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing in the world. It was her ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance which made her proud, as is apt to be the caſe. "You mean ſpirited raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal," ſaid ſhe to Jack, "I had rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to your grave, as well as I love you, than ſee you diſgrace your family by working under Jem Stock the pariſh 'prentice." She forgot already what pains ſhe had taken about the partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but pride and paſſion have a bad memory.</p>
               <p>It is hard to ſay which was now upper-moſt in her mind, her deſire to be revenged on Stock, or to ſee her ſon make a figure. She raiſed every ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhe could get from her huſband, and all ſhe could crib from the dairy to ſet up Jack in a ſhowy way. So the very next market day ſhe came herſelf, and took for him the new white houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the two little ſaſh windows painted blue,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037146_0028_100C9561E5624830"/>
and blue poſts before the door. It is that houſe which has the old croſs juſt before it, as you turn down between the church and the greyhound. It's being ſo near the church to be ſure was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to Jack, but it's being ſo near the greyhound was, and ſo tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one thing with the other it was to be ſure no bad ſituation; but what weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt with the mother was, that it was a much more ſhowy ſhop than Stock's, and the houſe, though not half ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, was far more ſmart.</p>
               <p>In order to draw cuſtom, his fooliſh mother adviſed him to underſell his neighbours juſt at firſt; to buy ordinary but ſhowy goods, and employ cheap workmen. In ſhort, ſhe charged him to leave no ſtone unturned to ruin his old comrade Stock. Indeed ſhe always thought with double ſatisfaction of Jack's proſperity, becauſe ſhe always joined to it the hope that his ſucceſs would be the ruin of Stock, for ſhe owned it would be the joy of her heart to bring that proud upſtart to a morſel of bread. She
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037146_0029_100C956372E99D78"/>
did not underſtand for her part, why ſuch beggars muſt become tradeſmen, it was "making a velvet purſe of a ſow's ear."</p>
               <p>Stock however ſet out on quite another ſet of principles. He did not allow himſelf always to ſquare his own beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to others by their's to him. He ſeldom aſked himſelf what he ſhould <hi>like</hi> to do; but he had a mighty way of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "I wonder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> what is my duty to do? And when he was once clear in that matter he generally did it. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſetting Brown at defiance; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all that vulgar ſelfiſhneſs, of "catch he that catch can"—and "two of a trade can never agree," he reſolved to be friendly towards him. Inſtead of joining in the laugh againſt him for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his houſe ſo fine, he was ſorry for him, becauſe he feared he would never be able to pay ſuch a rent. So he very kindly called upon him, told him there was buſineſs enough for them both, and gave him many uſeful hints for his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on. He warned him to go oftner to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037146_0030_100C956537421E40"/>
church and the ſeldomer to the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound: Put him in mind how the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the one and forſaking the other had been the ruin of their poor maſter, and added the following</p>

               <p>For a ſhort time things went on ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly. Brown was merry and civil. The ſhop was well ſituated for goſſip; and every one who had ſomething to ſay and nothing to do was welcome. Every idle
