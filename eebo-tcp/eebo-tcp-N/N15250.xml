            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>DEUTERONOMY VIII. 11, 12, 13, and 14.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments and his judgements and his ſtatutes which I command thee this day:</hi>—<hi>Leſt when thou haſt eaten and art full, and haſt built goodly hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and dwelt therein; And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy ſilver and thy gold is multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all that thou haſt is multiplied;</hi>—<hi>Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the houſe of bondage.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words contain a divine inſtruction to the people of Iſrael, reſpecting their ſtate of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the promiſed land. The inſtruction is not typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or merely local, but of a moral and univerſal nature. It may therefore with propriety, be applied to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in every age, whenever they are in a proſperous ſtate. With ſingular propriety may it be applied to the people of theſe United States, who, after the ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of unnatural war and civil diſcord, are now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the bleſſings of peace and plenty. Let me then requeſt the indulgence of this very reſpectable auditory, while, in order to apply to ourſelves the divine caution of our text, I endeavour,</p>
            <p>I. To point out ſome of thoſe evils which, as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019359_0005_0FAB52550EF03418"/>
we have reaſon to fear in our preſent national proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.—And then,</p>
            <p>II. To exhibit, in a very conciſe manner, that line of conduct which we ought to purſue, in order to ſecure through the divine favour the continuance of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which we now enjoy.</p>
            <p>A political diſcuſſion of theſe points, it is perſumed will not be expected nor deſired. It is propoſed to conſider them eſpecially in a moral and religious view. Indeed never ſhould it be forgotten that all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of civil policy ought to be founded on the great principles of religion; or, at the leaſt, to be perfectly conſiſtent with them: otherwiſe they will never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, becauſe they will be contrary to that moral ſenſe of right and wrong which God has implanted in the breaſt of every rational being. But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us attend to ſome of thoſe evils which, as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we have reaſon eſpecially to fear in our preſent natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proſperity. That we have been and ſtill are greatly bleſſed with national proſperity, I conceive, will not be doubted. We have been often delivered in a moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner, both from the ſecret ſtratagems and the open aſſaults of our enemies. Great is the ſalvation which heaven hath wrought for us in the full reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bleſſings of peace. <hi>The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</hi> He hath given us a very extenſive country abounding with the richeſt gifts of nature. With ſufficient eaſe do we procure all the neceſſaries, together with moſt of the conveniencies and delicacies of life. Could we procure them with more eaſe or in greater plenty, we ſhould not be in ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a ſituation as we are now. A proper view of all our various bleſſings will lead us to conclude that we are indeed the moſt highly favoured people under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>God hath not dealt ſo with any other nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:019359_0006_0FAB525ED74D7828"/>
But ſecurity in happineſs is not the lot of humanity. This is equally true of all mankind, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as individuals or as united in ſociety. In the midſt of all our preſent publick happineſs, dangers ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us and evils hang over our heads.</p>
            <p>The greateſt evil by which we are endangerd, and which indeed is the ſource of all others, is the want of true religion. It is true, the ſuperior bleſſings which we enjoy are well calculated to promote religion, to promote each of its eſſential branches, piety and charity. And ſuch affects would thoſe bleſſings naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, did we improve them as we ought. But through the perverſeneſs of our nature there is much danger that we ſhall uſe them for very different purpoſes. When we are favoured with a profuſion of earthly good, we are exceedingly prone to ſet our hearts upon it with an immoderate affection, neglecting our bountiful Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator from whom alone all good is derived. We bathe and bury ourſelves in the ſtreams, forgetting the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence they flow. This is indeed a very diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous behaviour towards the Father of mercies. It cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly diſcovers a very ſordid diſpoſition, a depraved and contracted mind. Such a diſpoſition, however, is but too natural to man in his preſent degenerate ſtate.</p>
            <p>We are much more inclined to murmur at God's juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in adverſity than to acknowledge his goodneſs in proſperity; more ready to view God as the author of evil than as the author of good. In the diſtreſſes of the late war, though they were moſt evidently brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by the inſtrumentality of men, we were never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs much more ready to impute them to the hand of God, than we now are to acknowledge the ſame hand in the happineſs of peace, and the other rich bleſſings of his providence and grace. When our wants are very preſſing, we are willing, or pretend to be willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019359_0007_0FAB5262AA098920"/>
to God for relief. But no ſooner is the relief given than we ſet our hearts upon the gift, and neglect the giver; or rather make uſe of his own bounty in order to ſight againſt him. The reaſon is, becauſe we are more inclined to love the creature than the Creator, to be <hi>lovers of pleaſure rather than lovers of God.</hi> On this account, Moſes with peculiar emphaſis warns the Iſraelites to ſtand on their guard againſt ſuch impiety in the days of their proſperity: <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we now attend to matters of fact we ſhall find no reaſon to think more lightly of the dangers before us. The hiſtory of the Iſraelites ſhews us that they greatly needed the caution which Moſes gave them. Scarcely a proſperous period in their hiſtory can be pointed out which was not followed by a decay of piety, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of morals. This was the caſe ſoon after their happy ſettlement in the land of Canäan. This was the caſe very frequently in the times of their Judges and Kings. And this was eminently the caſe with reſpect to their higheſt ſtate of wealth and power under the reign of Solomon. The very great proſperity of this happy reign produced very unhappy effects, even upon that wiſe king, as well as upon his court, and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The profligacy of his court may be ſeen in the hiſtory of his life: and that the moral ſtate of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects was alſo exceedingly corrupt, appears from their conduct immediately after his death. Even in the good reign of the pious Hezekiah, ingratitude and irreligion were the conſequences of ſucceſs and proſperity. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah rendered not according to the benefit done unto him: for his heart was lifted up; therefore there was wrath upon him, and npon Judah and Jeruſalem.</hi>

by Moſes may, with the utmoſt propriety, be applied to them in every ſtage of their proſperity. <hi>They have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of his children: they are a perverſe and crooked generation. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? is he not thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee and eſtabliſhed thee? But Jeſhurun waxed fat and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatneſs; then he forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the rock of his ſalvation. They provoked him to jealouſy with ſtrange gods, with abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations provoked they him to anger.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Nor was this pernicious effect of abuſed proſperity peculiar to the people of Iſrael. It has, in one degree or another, been common to all people in every age of the world. It has been the caſe even with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. The conſequences of outward proſperity have been often more fatal to the Chriſtian cauſe than thoſe of adverſity. Indeed the diſtreſſes and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church have often produced a very happy effect in the advancement of true Chriſtianity. Hence that obſervation in primitive times: "<hi>The blood of the Martyrs is the ſeed of the Church.</hi>" But the like happy effect has ſeldom if ever followed from a ſtate of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace and opulence. The firſt great inſtance of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proſperity granted to the Chriſtians in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fourth Century under Conſtantine the great, was ſoon followed by a great loſs of fervent piety, and a ſad corruption both of doctrines and morals. And the ſame ſad effect has followed from many inſtances of their proſperity in ſucceeding ages; particularly from the flouriſhing ſtate of many proteſtant Churches ſince the grand emancipation from the Papal See.

And the very ſame things have proved ruinous to individuals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number. Surely we have no reaſon to <hi>call the proud, happy,</hi> or to look with a covetous eye upon the glare of earthly greatneſs. Miſery lies hid beneath it, and deſtruction is its uſual attendant.</p>
            <p>Since then a proſperous ſtate has been ſo often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſuch an effect both on public communities, and on individuals, have we not reaſon to fear a ſimilar effect from our national proſperity at the preſent day? Is it not a ſad truth, that ſince the commencement of the late war, and eſpecially ſince the reſtoration of peace, the holy religion of Jeſus, that brighteſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our world, is, by many leſs regarded than it was before? and are not the ſacred inſtitutions of the Goſpel more neglected and deſpiſed? Are not the friends of Chriſtianity treated with more diſregard? Are not infidelity and profligacy of manners, viewed with leſs concern, and by many conſidered as matters of trivial conſequence? Still, we ought with the higheſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019359_0010_0FAB5264D6D86F38"/>
gratitude to acknowledge the ſovereign grace of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, which has, in ſome places, been manifeſted in the ſupport of his own cauſe. In ſeveral of our States he has been pleaſed to excite in the minds of many individuals, here and there, an unuſual attention to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and eternal things. He ſaw us unpurified by the furnace of affliction: He ſaw us diſregarding him while he ſpake to us in the <hi>whirlwind,</hi> the <hi>earthquake,</hi> and the <hi>fire.</hi> Yet has he been pleaſed to ſpeak to us not only by the ſtill voice of peace after war, but alſo by the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent voice of his holy Spirit; inviting us to become the ſubjects of the Prince of peace, and making numbers in one place and another, as we truſt, the actual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of that peace which the world can neither give nor take away. To his great name be all the glory aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding ſome pleaſing appearances of true religion, in ſeveral places, we have too much reaſon to fear that "<hi>The unthinking many</hi>" are abuſing our preſent proſperity in ſuch a manner as to produce a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effect. We have reaſon to fear that they are faſt growing into that ſtate of irreligion which has been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed already. The ſymptoms and effects of this evil are already too manifeſt; and will probably continue and increaſe <hi>unto more ungodlineſs,</hi> unleſs vigorous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures be taken to prevent them. Some few of theſe evils which may be called ſymptoms and effects of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion I beg leave particularly to mention.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, One of them which we have much reaſon to lament and fear, is ingratitude, vile ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude both to God and to man. During the troubles of the late war, how ardently did we wiſh for peace? While our lives and liberties were endangered; while our very exiſtence as a nation, was in doubt; while we were threatened with all the horrors of a cruſhed rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019359_0011_0FAB52659AAB50F8"/>
and all the vengeance of a very potent enemy peculiarly incenſed againſt us; how eagerly did we long after that independence, that eſtabliſhed liberty and national happineſs which we now enjoy? We then ſaw and felt our need of help from God. While the horrid conteſt was long doubtful, we acknowledged that the iſſue muſt be determined by the ſovereign diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of events. At ſome periods victory and ſucceſs were ſo greatly in favour of our enemies, and our own affairs were, in many reſpects, ſo exceedingly embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, that the ſtouteſt hearts were almoſt ready to fail. At ſome ſeaſons there ſeemed to be no way left but <hi>To ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> This ſalvation we ſought of him; nor did we ſeek in vain. His own arm brought ſalvation. By a ſeries of the moſt viſible interpoſitions of his providence, he has made wars to ceaſe thro' the land, and bleſt us with all that our hearts deſired.</p>
            <p>But alas! what poor returns have we made to our great Deliverer! Witneſs our cold hearts and our irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious lives. How much leſs inclined are we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him ſincere thanks for theſe favours now, than we were to aſk them of him in the times of our diſtreſs? How ſmall are the emotions of gratitude in our hearts, towards the God of all our ſalvations! And what little honour do we bring to his name by our lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation! With too much propriety may we apply to ourſelves theſe words of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>When he ſlew them, they ſought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm: 8. 34—37.</note>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:019359_0012_0FAB5266B51A8350"/>
Nor have we been guilty of ingratitude towards God only; we have been guilty of the ſame evil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man. Although this be a leſs evil than the former, it is nevertheleſs an evil which we ought to condemn and reform. We are certainly under great obligations to thoſe who have voluntarily taken an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous or an expenſive part, in effecting our late happy revolution. They have been, under God, the Saviours of our country. They have been inſtrumental in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting one of the moſt happy and intereſting events which have taken place in the preſent age, or in any other. Their merit is certainly great. Yet after all, are they not too much in the ſituation of the <hi>poor wiſe man,</hi> mentioned in ſacred writ, who by his wiſdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from impending danger, the city in which he dwelt, but was nevertheleſs ſoon univerſally forgotton? Do we give them that praiſe, that reſpect, that reward to which they have a juſt claim? That we have not yet afforded that reward which they juſtly claim, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. This thought leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That another particular evil into which we have fallen, and by which we are much endangered, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, injuſtice to the beſt and moſt deſerving friends of our country. Thoſe are certainly to be eſteemed ſome of the moſt deſerving friends of the country, who have willingly lent her either their lives or their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the late important ſtruggle. To ſuch perſons we are under obligations not only of gratitude but of juſtice. Their voluntary ſacrifices have, through the divine bleſſing, purchaſed for us our lives and fortunes, our liberties, our independence, our peace, and in a great meaſure, all our temporal happineſs.</p>
            <p>Whether all who thus ſerved their country acted wholly from diſintereſted views, is a queſtion which we ought not to aſk them, and which, with honour, we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019359_0013_0FAB52671AD268C8"/>
cannot aſk. That many of them acted from the moſt generous and patriotic motives, cannot be doubted by a candid mind. The leaſt that we can do for them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſtrict juſtice, is to afford them a reward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the full import of our promiſes. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with regret be it ſpoken, has not been done. But in lieu of this, many who have generouſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </note> And whenever any payments of annuities have been attempted, they have been generally, if not univerſally made in a depreciating medium which immediately anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated in their hands a very conſiderable part of its nominal value. In a ſimilar way have we effected moſt of the payments which have been made to our armies. Indeed as to moſt of our public ſecurities, there has uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly been a wide difference between their real and their nominal value. This is a difference which never ought to have exiſted: a difference manifeſtly contrary to the nature and claims of juſtice and truth. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the faithful Soldier who has in the face of the greateſt diſcouragements and dangers perſevered in the ſervice of his country to the cloſe of the war, receives a very conſiderable part of his pay in a paper medium which he is obliged to ſell or barter for one eighth part of its nominal value, one half quarter only of the value for which he receives it.</p>
            <p>Gladly would I draw a veil over this part of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conduct, were it poſſible, and could it be done with propriety. But it cannot be done, it ought not to be attempted. The beſt and wiſeſt thing which we
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019359_0014_0FAB52696DA07B20"/>
can now do with regard to this matter, is, to reprobate our own conduct and reform it for the future. Let us not pretend any longer to excuſe ourſelves by promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and promiſing that we will do juſtice to our credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at ſome diſtant period of time. Such promiſes are eaſily made and commonly of little worth. Nor do they by any means anſwer the demands of juſtice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they ſhould be hereafter fulfilled. For juſtice requires punctuality with reſpect to the time of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as really as with reſpect to the ſum which is due. A failure in the former of theſe points, is often more pernicious than in the latter. Let us no longer plead in ability in our own vindication. I hope indeed this plea may be made in vindication of ſome of our paſt defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences, but I fear it can by no means juſtify them all. It is, at beſt, but a very diſhonourable plea becauſe it is ſo often uſed merely as a maſk for injuſtice, and always can be uſed in one ſhape or another by thoſe who are unwilling to pay their debts.—As a people, we are not poor, but rich, and have large reſources of public reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. If we are but willing to do juſtice, and do not needleſsly embarraſs the hands of government, we ſhall be under no neceſſity of defrauding or injuring our creditors. If we cannot immediately pay them the principle of our debt, we can, at leaſt, pay the intereſt, and thereby at once place our credit on a more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able footing.</p>
            <p>Britain, loaded with a bebt more than thirty times ſo large as ours, and carrying an annual intereſt larger than our whole debt, nevertheleſs pays the intereſt punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, maintains her credit, and can borrow money from her ſubjects at pleaſure. At the ſame time her civil liſt and other annual expences are far greater than ours even in proportion to her wealth, and perhaps grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter almoſt in the ſame proportion with her national debt.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019359_0015_0FAB526A12D8FB50"/>
debt.<note n="*" place="bottom">The national debt of Britain is 280 millions ſterling, carrying an intereſt of £9500000. The national debt of the United States is not far from 9 millions in the ſame money.</note> Whatever difference there may be between her ſource of revenue and ours, or what ever difference there may be between her and us in any other reſpect, ſtill with regard to public juſtice to her creditors, ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us an example which we ought not to behold without ſelf-condemnation.</p>
            <p>Our public injuſtice is attended with conſequences moſt deplorable and alarming. It expoſes us to the high diſpleaſure of that God who from everlaſting to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, <hi>loveth righteouſneſs and hateth iniquity.</hi> It tends to render public faith contemptible and is highly injurious to our national character. It gives too much countenance to the reproach of our enemies who have ſtigmatized us with the character of a knaviſh, faithleſs people; covering the moſt iniquitous deſigns under the garb of liberty and the cloak of religion. It is hurtful to many literary and religious inſtitutions; while the monies which were charitably given for their ſupport are detained and perverted to a very different purpoſe. It is attended with great cruelty towards widows and orphans, towards the poor and needy, and many other individuals who have ſuffered extremely for the want of thoſe monies which are their juſt due, and to which they have an indiſputable claim.</p>
            <p>The cries of ſuch perſons <hi>enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</hi> Is not this unjuſt detention of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, in a particular manner attended with cruelty to the generous Soldier, who has nobly braved fatigues, and dangers, and deaths, for our ſake, who has faithfully adhered to our cauſe while thouſands deſerted it, while thouſands and ten thouſands of his brethren periſhed around him by the horrors of ſickneſs and the ſword, and the far greater horrors of Britiſh priſon-ſhips, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019359_0016_0FAB526C35CD7000"/>
Britiſh jails? Who of us would be willing to endure the like fatigues and be expoſed to the like dangers for the contemptible reward which we now afford the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Who would not think himſelf affronted by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry propoſal of ſo ſmall a reward for ſo great a ſervice.</p>
            <p>This public injuſtice deſtroys ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ends of civil ſociety; ſuch as an equal adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of juſtice, and the ſecurity of property. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves us in ſome of the worſt evils of tyranny and deſpotiſm, while we are flattering ourſelves with the pleaſing names of liberty and independence. It tends to deſtroy all confidence in the Public, and to create a diſtruſt of Government. For if ſuch a flagrant violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of juſtice may be practiſed in one inſtance, how do we know but the like may be practiſed in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or what one right have we which is properly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured? If the Public, as a body, will allow themſelves, in any one inſtance, to injure an individual, every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Public is in conſtant danger. For who can tell where the injury will fall next? If one part of our property may be detained from us for a long time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the plaineſt promiſes, without our conſent and without any unavoidable neceſſity; how can we know but that another part may be ſoon as unjuſtly wreſted from us in the very firſt inſtance? In either caſe the injuſtice is equally real and equally manifeſt: and which would be the greater evil of the two, can be determined only by concurrent circumſtances. If our property muſt be taken or detained without our conſent, what great choice is there as to the mode, whether it be taken by fraud or by force, whether we be robbed by an highwayman or cheated by a knave? In this latter caſe we have often the long pain of repeated diſappointments, which does not take place in the former.</p>
            <p>Further, is it certain that Government will never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019359_0017_0FAB526F04A5E548"/>
want the voluntary aid of individuals, aid which ſhe cannot compel them to yield? Should ſhe be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in ſuch a ſituation what encouragement would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals have to afford the needed aid? Will they not be ready to fear that all State-policy is founded merely on Machiavelian principles, and that public bodies will practiſe fraud in order to accompliſh their own ends, whenever they can do it with impunity?—Honeſt minds hope that ſuch fears are groundleſs, and that ſome public Communities at leaſt, as well as ſome individuals, mean to make juſtice a rule of conduct. If this be the caſe, let us make it manifeſt by our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; if it be not the caſe, let the truth be known, that faithful citizens and honeſt men may be no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and duped out of their property. <hi>Heu pietas, heu publica fides!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the moſt pernicious conſequence of our public injuſtice is ſtill to be mentioned. It has a fatal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the morals of the people at large. It is like the ſin of Jereboam the ſon of Nebat; it makes Iſrael to ſin, and thereby ſtill further provokes the Lord God of Iſrael to anger. It is a trite obſervation and a very juſt one, That example has more influence than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. And if our public conduct may be adduced by knaves and ſharpers, as an example and pretext of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, will it not have a greater tendency to promote this evil than all our laws will have to prevent it? Too many are there of that ſmooth-ſpeaking claſs of people, who mean to get their living out of others; who, whenever they can run into debt, conſider it as ſo much clear gain; becauſe, forſooth, they can make ample payment by fair promiſes and ſoft words, by complaints of the ſcarcity of money and the hardneſs of the times. Better payment than this they do not wiſh to make: <hi>The words of their mouths are ſmoother than butter, but
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019359_0018_0FAB5270ACA4F098"/>
war is in their heart: Their words are ſofter than oil, yet are they drawn ſwords.</hi> To our reproach and our ſhame, we are already too much inclined to diſhoneſty. It is already practiſed by too much many to the detriment of the Public, and to the ruin of their own true intereſt both temporal and eternal. Too many motives are there already to this accurſed evil, too many are its friends and votaries. For Gods ſake let it not have any more. Many even of our religious ſocieties have long conducted as if they thought it no evil to violate the moſt explicit and ſolemn covenants with the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion by withholding from them the ſtipulated ſupport. If the religious ſcarcely eſcape this evil, what may be expected from the ungodly and profane? <hi>There is,</hi> however, <hi>a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi> Let this wiſe maxim be remembered by us all, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by thoſe very religious people who make high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Chriſtianity, and yet at the ſame time bid defiance to the plaineſt rules of juſtice, and trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the moſt ſacred obligations of truth and plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another particular evil by which we are endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, is the want of true patriotiſm. By true patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm I mean a real concern for the welfare of our whole country in general. This patriotiſm is a branch of that extenſive benevolence which is highly recommended by our holy religion, and is at the ſame time moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſentaneous to the dictates of ſound reaſon. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine patriotiſm of the beſt kind, is peculiar to thoſe only who are poſſeſſed of a principle of true virtue. Some ſemblances and imitations of this patriotiſm are nevertheleſs to be found in thoſe who are not, on the whole, of a truly virtuous character. Yet even theſe imitations of pure patriotiſm have often proved very beneficial in civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:019359_0019_0FAB5270EB5C7AA8"/>
While the war laſted our patriotiſm was eminent and produced the moſt happy effects. Common dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was a common bond of union, cementing us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But as this bond has now in ſome meaſure cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is danger that our union will not be ſo great as will be neceſſary for the general good. There is danger not only that factions will ariſe in particular States, but that particular States will attempt to purſue their own particular intereſts without a due regard to the common good, and perhaps in direct oppoſition to it. But we ſhould remember that theſe States are, by voluntary and ſolemn agreement united as one nation, one body, of which each particular State is a member. <hi>And the eye cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you: but the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 12. 21, and 25.</note> It will doubtleſs be neceſſary not only that individual perſons, but alſo particular States ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten give up, in many caſes, their own particular intereſt for the common benefit. To do thus is generous, is wiſe, is neceſſary for our exiſtence as a free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent people. Some generous examples of this kind have been given, and it is to be hoped they will be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally followed. If we are unwilling to act on this liberal ſcale we ſhall be in perpetual danger of that evil which our Saviour points out when he tells us, "<hi>That every kingdom divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand. but is brought to deſolation.</hi>"</p>
            <p>It was the want of this extenſive patriotiſm that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the States of Greece. A party ſpirit, a ſpirit of jealouſy and diſcord prevailed among them, and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and wars expoſed them for a long time to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of the Perſian Empire, and finally ſubjugated them all to the Macedonian yoke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:019359_0020_0FAB5271A039CD38"/>
If the ſame ſpirit prevail among us we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe but it will produce the moſt unhappy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Human nature is the ſame in every age, and ſimilar cauſes will produce ſimilar effects. In this view we may ſee how much it concerns us to ſupport our grand bond of union, or, in other words; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the rights of our honourable Congreſs, and even to enlarge their powers, ſhould this be proved neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the general good.—</p>
            <p>That want of patriotiſm, of which we ſpeak, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces very different effects in perſons who are in different ſituations of life. It is nearly the ſame thing with ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs. It often leads the ambitious and aſpiring to ſeek their own promotion by very improper means. It leads them into a mad purſuit of low popularity, to the violation of honour and honeſty and to the neglect of the public good. For not theſe things, but popular applauſe and their own advancement in office are the objects of their firſt concern. And they ſometimes have their reward: but a very contemptible one it is. True popularity or the real eſteem of the virtuous and the wiſe, procured by a ſteady courſe of benevolent and virtuous conduct, is well worthy of purſuit and is indeed the greateſt earthly good that we can enjoy. This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity is not procured by time-ſerving, by flattery or any improper compliances. It is ſeldom if ever gained without a manly oppoſition, in ſome caſes at leaſt, to popular prejudice and vulgar error The man who can make it appear that he conſcienciouſly acts from a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous principle will command the veneration even of the moſt unprincipled, and of thoſe who oppoſe him. But the fame of the popular drudge, that fame which is gained by low arts of deceiving the ignorant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing their prejudices, to the public detriment, is not only unworthy of a Chriſtian, but beneath the character of an honeſt man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:019359_0021_0FAB52725B00F6C0"/>
This ſame ſelfiſh ſpirit, when it poſſeſſes the minds, of the common people, has this bad conſequence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others, that it ſubjects them to an undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the choice of civil rulers. Poſſeſſed of this ſpirit, they will not regard the probity or abilities of the candidates for office; but will be very ready to give their voice for thoſe to whom they happen to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly attached by any private and ſiniſter motives; for thoſe by whom they are moſt humoured in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and follies; and eſpecially for thoſe who moſt loudly exclaim againſt the payment of public debts and moſt vigorouſly oppoſe taxation however juſt or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. All ſuch operations of ſelfiſhneſs, whether in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular demagogues or in the people at large, in whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhape they appear, tend ultimately to the public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and to the encouragement of deceit and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth evil by which we are threatened is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard of civil Authority. Great is our privilege in chooſing our own rulers, and, by them, of making and executing our own laws. But this privilege we are in great danger of abuſing, for this ſtrange reaſon, becauſe it is the effect of our own voluntary act. While the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large are too ready to yield to this temptation, even rulers themſelves are in danger of relaxing too far the reigns of government, thro' fear of diſpleaſing the people by whom they are choſen to office. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that no State can be long happy or even an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the moſt important ends of civil ſociety, unleſs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be revered and the law obeyed. Tyranny and deſpotiſm are undoubtedly very great evils, but greater ſtill are the dangers of anarchy.</p>
            <p>Thoſe perſons who have the moſt power in their own hands are in the greateſt danger of abuſing it. No people on earth have ſo much power in their own hands
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019359_0022_0FAB52731D0BAB40"/>
as thoſe of the United States. All the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are at their diſpoſal. We ought therefore to be much on our guard againſt the abuſe of this power. The abuſe of this power may perhaps produce tyranny or ariſtocracy; but the proper uſe of it will be the beſt way to prevent them both. Never let us forget that the dignity of government and the energy of the law, are eſſential to the continuance of our public happineſs and proſperity. Reaſon and experience teach us this leſſon, while the more ſpecial voice of God enforces the ſame, by commanding <hi>every ſoul to be ſubject to the higher powers.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I will only add once more, in the fifth place, that we are in much danger of the evils which ariſe from luxury and extravagance in our expences. After all that has been ſaid in favour of foreign trade and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign luxuries, it ſtill remains a demonſtration in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, that when our imports exceed our exports, the courſe of trade is againſt us, and we are conſtantly growing poor. This, it is to be feared, is our ſtate at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, eſpecially on account of thoſe very extravagant importations which we have made ſince the peace. Our very great conſumption of foreign luxuries not only impoveriſhes the country to an high degree, but at the ſame time, tends directly to enervate both our bodies and our minds, to produce indolence and pride, and to open the door to every temptation and every vice. In this caſe, as well as many others, experience is a faithful teacher. And if we conſult the experience of mankind in every age, and in every part of the world, we ſhall not find a ſingle inſtance wherein luxury and extravagance have ſubſerved the true intereſt of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But inſtances in which they have proved hurtful and ruinous are to be found in abundance. And to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019359_0023_0FAB5273D425C6A0"/>
Republican governments they have proved more fatal than to others. By cultivating induſtry, frugality, and a patriotic ſpirit, Rome extended her conqueſts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe pleaſed, and was revered as the Arbitreſs of kings and the Miſtreſs of the world. But by adopting the luxuries of Aſia where her arms had proved victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſhe ſoon enfeebled her true Republican ſpirit and prepared the way for her own ruin. Let not the ſame ſcene be again acted over in America. America has by her noble exertions repelled the force of Britain. But if America perſiſts in her preſent rage after Britiſh gew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaws and foreign luxuries, ſhe muſt expect the fate of Rome, her ancient predeceſſor; or at leaſt, that very unhappy conſequences will enſue. To prevent theſe impending evils we need the exertions not only of the ſons, but alſo of the daughters of America. Very great are your influence and importance, my fair hearers, in this reſpect, as well as in many others. Be aſſured that oeconomy and frugality with an elegance of dreſs, on the plan of that modeſt apparel recommended by St. Peter, would add more grace to your charms and more dignity to your characters than all the tinſel of Britiſh ornament, or the greateſt extravagance of foreign dreſs.—</p>
            <p>II. It now remains that we exhibit, in a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe manner that line of conduct which we ought to purſue in order to ſecure, through the divine favour, the continuence of thoſe bleſſings which at the preſent we enjoy.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it is, I conceive, ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we ought moſt earneſtly to endeavour after a reformation of thoſe particular evils aforementioned, and at the ſame time, to uſe the beſt means in order to prevent them for the future. We muſt firſt <hi>ceaſe to do evil</hi> or we ſhall never <hi>learn to do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:019359_0024_0FAB5274905C4350"/>
In the ſecond place we muſt uſe our beſt endeavours to promote the practice of virtue and true religion.</p>
            <p>I will not indeed preſume to aſſert, that God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards nations under the goſpel, is exactly paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to his conduct towards the ancient Iſraelites. They were under a diſpenſation of grace different from ours, and, for a long time under that peculiar kind of civil government which has been called <hi>a Theocracy.</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal bleſſings are not promiſed, and national judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not threatened under the goſpel in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they were under the law. The goſpel being a more ſpiritual diſpenſation, its bleſſings and its curſes are of a more ſpiritual nature, and leſs obvious to the view of the world. They are deſigned, in a ſpecial manner, to prepare perſons for the more full retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of eternity. This we know is the caſe with regard to the bleſſings conferred, and the chaſtiſements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the children of God. And that this is alſo the caſe with regard to the judgements inflicted on the man of ſin and his followers, we are expreſsly told: <hi>God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie: that they all might be damned.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2. 11, 12.</note> Still, this is certain, that by the conſtitution of nature which God has eſtabliſhed, vice tends to the miſery, and virtue to the happineſs not only of individuals, but of public Communities. The practice of religion muſt therefore be conſidered as abſolutely eſſential to the beſt ſtate of public proſperity, it muſt be ſo unleſs we may expect happineſs in direct oppoſition to the conſtitution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of nature's God. "<hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation: but ſin is a reproach to any people.</hi>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov.</note> This is the courſe of nature, this is the voice of heaven, this is he decree of God.</p>
            <p>In the third place, we ought eſpecially in the uſe of all
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019359_0025_0FAB5277260C8E08"/>
proper means, to pray fervently for the effuſions of the divine Spirit.</p>
            <p>Without a divine and ſupernatural influence, true religion will never prevail. This is a doctrine clearly taught in divine revelation and perfectly conſonant to the dictates of reaſon. It has been taught even by heathen Philoſophers, ſuch as Socrates and Plato, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero and Seneca. It has been acknowledged, in one ſhape or another, in every nation and in every age. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it may be conſidered as a doctrine of natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Nor is there any thing enthuſiaſtical or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in this doctrine, any more than there is in that other great doctrine of natural religion "<hi>That in God we live and move and have our being.</hi>" Divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is abſolutely neceſſary both in the natural and in the moral world. All creatures of every kind, from the moſt exalted Seraph before the eternal throne, to the ſmalleſt animal which eſcapes our ſight, are wholly dependent on God. Our ſouls and all their powers are in his hand, and he can form and incline them at his pleaſure, in full conſiſtency with our moſt perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of action.</p>
            <p>That divine influence which is neceſſary in order to a pious life we are taught to expect from the operations of the third perſon in the holy Trinity. We cannot therefore do a more faithful or important ſervice for our country than to pray fervently and perſeveringly to the Father of mercies, that he would by the energy of the Holy-Ghoſt, form the hearts of this people to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and thus "<hi>Purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the review of our ſubject, I think we may juſtly make this reflection: Let us not flatter ourſelves too
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019359_0026_0FAB528ADFC18440"/>
much with an idea of the future proſperity and glory of theſe United States.</p>
            <p>While we thus flatter ourſelves, we are in danger of expecting the end without a proper attention to thoſe means which are abſolutely neceſſary in order to obtain it. Young States are like young men; exceedingly apt, in imagination, to anticipate and magnify future ſcenes of happineſs and grandeur, which perhaps they will never enjoy. It has lately become very faſhionable to propheſy about the future greatneſs of this country; its aſtoniſhing progreſs in ſcience, in wealth, in population and grandeur: to tell of <hi>Lockes</hi> and <hi>Newtons,</hi> of poets, philoſophers and divines greater than have ever yet lived; of towering ſpires, and ſpacious domes, of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous towns and cities riſing thick throughout an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire greater than the world has ever ſeen. Such repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations may perhaps be beautiful in poetry and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, but cannot with equal propriety be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in an unqualified ſenſe, into ſerious and didactic proſe. And true indeed it is, Providence has here laid a foundation for a very flouriſhing and mighty empire. But although the foundation is laid, the ſuperſtructure is not yet finiſhed, nor ever will be, unleſs we uſe the proper means. And whether we ſhall uſe ſuch means or not, is a matter of very great uncertainty. Foudati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for happineſs have been often laid where happineſs has never followed This is no leſs true of States and Kingdoms than of individual perſons. It is remarkable that many places which were in ancient times, the ſeats of mighty States aud empires, and might perhaps have continued with increaſing greatneſs to the preſent time, had proper means been uſed, are nevertheleſs now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ruin and deſolation, or at beſt, in a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and miſerable condition. What is become of Nineveh and Babylon, and thoſe mighty Empires of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019359_0027_0FAB528C51FB7848"/>
which they were the capital cities? What is become of Perſepolis, of Antioch, of Jeruſalem, of Carthage, of Athens and Sparta? And how wide is the difference between ancient and modern Rome? Had the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of ſuch places, from age to age, known the things of their peace and purſued them, their glory might have remained to the preſent day.</p>
            <p>If we abuſe the ſignal favours which God has grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, we have no right to expect that he will favour us in the like manner for the future. Although it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible we may be a flouriſhing and happy people, it is equally poſſible we may be far otherwiſe. When we have reached the pinnacle of our hopes, it is often connected with evils far greater than the loſs of that envied height would have been. <hi>The faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi> The greateſt worldly good is often ſucceeded by the greateſt evil; the greateſt happineſs by the greateſt miſery. Who would have thought, after the happy eſtabliſhment of peace between France and Britain, twenty years ago, that the late war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Britain and America, with all its attending hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, could poſſibly have taken place ſo ſoon?</p>
            <p>When <hi>God gave Iſrael their requeſt, but ſent leanneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſouls,</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm cvi. 15.</note> theſe two things, taken in their connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, were the greateſt curſe that could have befallen them. When Jephthah had ended a ſucceſsful war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the children of Ammon, and thereby become the ſaviour of his country, he ſeemed to have gained the whole deſire of his heart, even all that happineſs for which he had moſt ardently wiſhed. But this ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which made him ſo happy a man was cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with two ſore evils which came nearer to his heart and more ſenſibly affected him, than all his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns reſpecting the Ammonites. It was cannected
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019359_0028_0FAB528C95E5A2F8"/>
with the mournful affair reſpecting his only child, and it was the occaſion of a very bloody civil war in which, beſide others, forty and two thouſand Ephraimites were ſlain with the ſword. And thus, as in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſimilar inſtances, the occaſion of his greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was turned into the occaſion of his greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>So, although we have gained that for which we moſt ardently wiſhed, an happy period to the late war, yet we can by no means be certain but that ſome far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er evils are now before us. We may be over-run and ruined both for time and eternity by a torrent of vice and licenciouſneſs, with their never-failing attendants, infidelity and atheiſm. We may be left to deſtroy ourſelves by inteſtine diviſions and civil wars: or we may be viſited with ſuch ſickneſs and peſtilence as would ſoon produce a far greater deſtruction than any war of what kind ſoever. God has many ways, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, to puniſh the ſins both of individuals and of nations. He has ten thouſand arrows in his quiver, and can always direct any or all of them unerring, to the victims of his wrath. No poſſible concurrence of circumſtances can ſcreen us from the notice of his eye or the power of his hand. Never, never, can we be ſecure but in the practice of true virtue and in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God.</p>
            <p>From long and general cuſtom, it will, I conceive, be expected that I do not cloſe this diſcourſe without ſome of thoſe addreſſes which have been uſual on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>It the firſt place, I beg leave, with great veneration to addreſs myſelf to his Excellency our Governor and Commander in Chief.—</p>

May it pleaſe your EXCELLENCY,
It is with great pleaſure we behold you at the helm of government in this ſovereign and independent State. While we ſympathize with you under the burdens and difficulties of your very important ſtation, we cannot but congratulate you on a variety of circumſtances which are peculiarly ſatisfactory. Highly honourable, in many reſpects, is the office which your Excellency fills with ſo much honour. Much dignity is derived to it from its high importance and extenſive utility. It has been rendered honourable by a long ſucceſſion of worthy and eminent characters, who have filled it from one time to another, and particularly by that very illuſtrious and immortal character, your immediate predeceſſor in office. Great is the honour of having a place in ſuch a ſucceſſion as this, and much greater ſtill the honour of appearing in it, as your Excellencey does, with a venerable dignity. Connecticut can boaſt of a number of her ſons in the vigour of life, who are equal to the firſt offices in government. Yet, by the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a free and diſcerning people, your Excellency, though far advanced in life, has been raiſed to the firſt chair of government. A greater mark of eſteem could not have been given; an equal one, probably never was given by this ſtate or by any other.</p>
            <p>Very great is the public eſteem for thoſe abilities with which the Fountain of wiſdom has endowed you, and for that large ſtore of knowledge which you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from a moſt extenſive reading in the various branches both of civil and ſacred ſcience. And yet all good men rejoice that you are thus highly eſteemed, not merely for your natural or acquired endowments, but more eſpecially for the moral virtues and your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred regard for the religion of Jeſus. May your ſingular piety and wiſdom, your extenſive influence and moſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019359_0030_0FAB528E340F58C8"/>
excellent example, contribute much to prevent thoſe public evils by which we are endangered. This effect in ſome good meaſure they have already had, God grant they may have, in a ſtill greater degree, the ſame happy effect for the future.</p>
            <p>We cannot but view your Excellency as a Moſes, a Joſhua or a Samuel, giving the moſt important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions at the cloſe of a moſt uſeful life. With pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſion of our great loſs, and yet with joy in the proſpect of your far more exceeding gain, we view you as an Elijah ready to mount the fiery car and aſcend to your native heaven, followed with the moſt eager exclamations of your country. "my father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof."<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Kings ii. 12</note> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that time ſhall come, mournful to us but joyful to you, may a double portion of your ſpirit deſcend and reſt upon your ſucceſſors in office and upon all our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers. May your Excellency have, both while with us and when taken from us, all the peace and joy of that holy religion to which you have ſo devoutly adhered. May the God of all conſolation be your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port through life and your portion forever. Amen.—</p>
            <p>May I now be permitted to turn my addreſs, with great reſpect, to the other branches of our honourable Legiſlature; to his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, the honourable aſſiſtant Counſellors, and the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Repreſentatives of the people.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Honours and the Gentlemen of the other houſe of Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>While proſperity is dangerous to a people in general, it is peculiarly ſo to thoſe who are elevated above the common walks of life. Honour, power and wealth are attended with ſtrong temptations, temptations which in moſt inſtances have proved too powerful for man. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019359_0031_0FAB528EDA609810"/>
they have been and always will be too powerful for him, unleſs when he calls in foreign aid, even the aid of almighty grace. They who are poſſeſſed of thoſe worldly goods, thoſe envied diſtinctions, it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, often have their portion in this life only, and are therefore of all men the moſt miſerable. Hence that ancient objection againſt the Saviour when here on earth, "Have any of the rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him?"<note n="*" place="bottom">John vii 48.</note> Hence his own proverbial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: "It is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xix. 24.</note> Hence his queſtion to the Jews: "How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only?"<note n="†" place="bottom">John v. 44.</note> Hence we read of thoſe among the chief rulers who, in ſpite of conviction, refuſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt, becauſe "They loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God."<note n="‖" place="bottom">John xii. 43.</note> Hence the obſervation of St. Paul: "Not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called."<note n="(1)" place="bottom">1 Cor. I. 26.</note> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we thus ſpeak in order <hi>to ſtir up your pure minds by way of remembrance,</hi> yet we hope better things of you, venerable Fathers, things which accompany ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and things which have a favourable aſpect, both on our civil and on our religious concerns.</p>
            <p>Singularly happy has Connecticut been, even from the beginning, in a Legiſlature friendly not only to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil liberty but alſo to true religion. And this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent character, we truſt, may with propriety be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this preſent honourable Aſſembly. May all your public meaſures and your whole conduct, be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative proof that our hopes are well founded.</p>
            <p>In a particular manner, may your vigourous exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be directed againſt thoſe evils by which we are
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019359_0032_0FAB528FD5721108"/>
threatened in our preſent proſperous ſituation. More eſpecially, may ſuch meaſures be adopted as ſhall be well calculated to reſtore public faith, and to free this State, ſo far as poſſible, from the crying guilt of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic injuſtice, which will otherwiſe be our reproach and perhaps our ruin. In the name of all honeſt men, let me preſume to entreat you, Honoured Fathers, that ſuch meaſures be not neglected. <hi>The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me, He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">a Sam xxiii 3.</note> The meaſures neceſſary to the exerciſe of public juſtice will accord with the judgement of all wiſe politicians as well as with the judgement of God and of all good men. Such meaſures may poſſibly be burdenſome, in ſome degree to the people. But weak or wicked we muſt have been if we ever hoped to gain the glorious prize of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, without bearing burdens and particularly a very conſiderable burden of expen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. The prize which we have gained, well improved, will infinitely more than counterbalance all the expences we have borne or ever need to bear. Every honeſt man will gladly bear his proportion of ſuch burdens, rather than to tranſgreſs the eternal law of righteouſneſs and truth. Every man who has the ſmalleſt pretenſions to honour or ſpirit, will willingly bear his proportion, rather than to be guilty of the meanneſs, the baſeneſs of cruelly defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt faithful ſervants of the Public, in order to ſave an inconſiderable expence to himſelf. Every man who is unwilling to forward thoſe meaſures which are neceſſary in order to the exerciſe of public juſtice, ought to lie under the imputation of ſhameful ignorance or a more ſhameful diſhoneſty. After all, ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures may perhaps through the weakneſs of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be unpopular with many and meet with oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019359_0033_0FAB52DE9781C2E0"/>
But ſhould they be oppoſed by multitudes nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as the army of Xerxes or the more numerous future armies of Gog and Magog, ſtill, while engaged in the cauſe of righteouſneſs, we may ſay as the prophet did when he and his ſervant were ſurrounded by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Syrian hoſt: "<hi>Fear not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</hi>" All the hoſts of the Lord in heaven and on earth will ſupport us, while the Lord of hoſts himſelf will be on our ſide. "<hi>For the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance doth behold the upright.</hi>" He has given the ſtrongeſt evidence in his word and in his works, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the great work of Redemption, given the ſtrongeſt evidence of his unalterable determination to ſupport the cauſe of righteouſneſs and truth. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs will finally prevail over iniquity, and truth over falſehood.—Indeed were we deſigned only for the preſent world, even then the practice of juſtice and the other moral virtues, would undoubtedly be the ſafeſt and the happieſt courſe not only for individuals but for States and Kingdoms,</p>
            <p>In the executive department of Government, it is greatly to be wiſhed not only that impartial juſtice may be adminiſtered, but that it be done with diſpatch and with as little expence as may be conſiſtent with the dignity of Government. Unhappy indeed is the caſe when a legal proceſs is attended with ſuch expence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and other embarraſments that one had better loſe his juſt dues than to recover them by a courſe of law. Not a few inſtances of this kind have taken place. Can no meaſures be adopted which may ſerve to remedy ſo great an evil?</p>
            <p>The Univerſity of this State, the education of youth and the advancement of literature, are kindred objects of ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> importance, that it is preſumed they will

not paſs unnoticed by this honourable Aſſembly. May you, Honoured Fathers, in your great wiſdom and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, adopt ſuch meaſures with regard to each of them as ſhall be worthy of yourſelves and moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the true intereſt of the Public. And may all your meaſures be ſuch as ſhall evince to the world that you are not only our worthy and faithful civil fathers, but alſo that you are, at the ſame time, acting in a far more amiable and honourable character, even that of <hi>Nurſing fathers to the church of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now beg the patience of this auditory, while, with the moſt effectionate eſteem and reverence, I addreſs myſelf to my fathers and brethren in the ſacred char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter.</p>
            <p>Reverend and worthy Sirs,
Although Chriſt's kingdom is not of this world, yet is it perfectly friendly to civil government. It requires us to obey and honour civil rulers, and to conduct our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as peaceable and uſeful ſubjects of the State. By ſerving God and your generation in this way, much good may be done, and much has been done by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your venerable order. Great was your influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and great your merit in producing the late glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous revolution. And although by the temporary loſſes which moſt of you have ſuſtained during the arduous conflict and even to the preſent day, you have doubtleſs borne more than your equal proportion of the expences of the war, yet will this burden be conſidered as trifling when compared with the peace of a good conſcience and the ſalvation of your country.</p>
            <p>Your virtuous exertions are now again greatly need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in preventing thoſe evils with which we are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in our preſent proſperous ſtate. No order of men have equal advantages with you, to warn the people againſt the encroachments of power on the one hand,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019359_0035_0FAB52F7B4403C68"/>
and the evils of anarchy on the other; and at the ſame time to inſtruct them in all thoſe various duties which they owe to civil rulers and to their country.</p>
            <p>Let us however, never forget that civil and ſecular affairs ought to be viewed by us as matters of no more than a ſecondary conſideration. The weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the law and the goſpel ought always to engage our chief attention, our higheſt concern.</p>
            <p>We are Ambaſſadors for God to a revolted world. In the guilt and wretchedneſs of this revolt, we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are perſonally involved. Jeſus in extremeſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies both of body and ſoul, has died for our ſalvation. He has gone into heaven to prepare manſions of glory for his faithful followers. Hell from beneath is moving to receive the deſpiſers of his grace. Satan and the powers of darkneſs, in conjunction with the world and the fleſh, are plotting the deſtruction of men. The people of our charge are daily paſſing the vale of death and receiving the retributions of eternity. The eye of omniſcience is continually upon us. <hi>He who walketh in the midſt of the golden candleſticks and holdeth the ſtars in his right hand,</hi> hath ſaid, "<hi>All the churches ſhall know that I am he which ſearcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your works.</hi>" <hi>We watch for ſouls as thoſe who muſt give an account:</hi> If unfaithful, an aggravated doom will be our portion: if faithful, <hi>we are unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved and in them that periſh. And who is ſufficient for theſe things? What manner of perſons then, ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs?</hi> With what fervour and fidelity ought we to preach the pure doctrines of the goſpel and the unſearchable riches of Chriſt?—Death will ſoon put an end to our labours. Let us be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the promiſed preſence of our great Lord and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:019359_0036_0FAB52F939AFDA50"/>
Maſter and by his voice which now ſpeaks to each one of us in particular, ſaying "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." Amen.</p>
            <p>Let me now conclude with one word to this whole numerous and reſpectable Auditory.</p>
            <p>Fellow Citizens and fellow Chriſtians,
Great are the benefits of good government. But let us not imagine that theſe benefits are to be expected by us, unleſs, as a people and as individuals, we are willing to perform thoſe duties which we owe to our civil rulers and to the Public in general. Unſpeakably great are the bleſſings of the goſpel. But let us not imagine that miniſters or churches or any power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can force theſe bleſſings upon us without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. They are not, they cannot be ours unleſs we live as the goſpel directs.</p>
            <p>We are happy in being now met together in this large Aſſembly and on this great occaſion. But before the next return of this Aniverſary, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>any, who are now here, will belong to the great congregation of the dead, and be fixed unalterably in their eternal ſtate! Who, where, now in this aſſembly are the perſons thus deſtined ſo ſoon to another world? Perhaps none more likely than the perſon ſpeaking, were we to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> form our judgement from apparent ſymptoms. But if this be the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with him, he is not alone. Others will alſo travel with him the ſame dark road of death. And what one individual here preſent can ſay that he is not one of this number? Are we all prepared for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate? In that ſtate we ſhall all ſoon be found, while other buſy mortals, like ourſelves, will take our places on this ſtage of life. And never, never ſhall we all meet together again, till we meet with the aſſembled Univerſe before the tribunal of our final Judge.</p>
            <p>The God of all grace enable us ſo to live that we
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019359_0037_0FAB52F956D100E0"/>
may, at that ſolemn period, be found on the right hand of our Judge, and, by the ſentence of his mouth, have our portion aſſigned us with a far greater and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſembly than the preſent; even with <hi>the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born which are written in heaven; with the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, with an innumerable company of angels, with Jeſus the Mediator of the new covenant and with God the Judge of all.</hi>—<hi>Bleſſing and honour and glory and power be unto him that ſitteth on the throne and unto the Lamb, forever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>—Amen.</closer>
