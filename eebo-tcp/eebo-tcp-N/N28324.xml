            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It is said that he does not strictly conform to the orthodox belief.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>His conduct is upright, and I have often before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that calumny does not attack a man's <hi>opinions</hi> till his <hi>conduct</hi> is found to be irreproachable.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
                  <p>His intercourse with the Secretary's daughters appears to many of a suspicious nature.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Because many feel what many would do in Reh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg's situation.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
                  <p>It is said, too, that he squanders his small for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune away at cards, when at the Secretary's house.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Ann, you know I hate that term, "It is said," when an honest man's character is concerned. Is he in debt?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
                  <p>Not exactly that, but he had a good library, which he lately sold for a trifle to an antiquarian, who was passing through the place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>What is that to us?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
                  <p>I am sorry for it. The school-master says that when the man took the books away, Rehberg looked out of the window after him, and tears stood in his eyes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Pshaw! If you will give the school-master a pint of beer, and his wife a cup of coffee, you may hear a hundred such stories. I cannot bear that any one's good name should be destroyed to afford conversation at a tea-table, that the gosling should catch it from the goose, and learn to hiss at every one, who is quietly passing by.</p>

                  <p>Right, by my soul. It comes from the heart. I walked hither, and stumbled so often that I nearly broke my neck two or three times, for I was calling to mind those happy days, when my Maria was alive, and we so often used to spend our Sundays together like good neighbors—</p>

                  <p>People are fond of talking, and some account of you has reached the ears of my brothers. When you arrived here twenty-seven years ago, and your late father-in-law farmer Wiedeman treated you so kindly, it was said you were a foundling, and when the magistracy insisted on your producing a certificate of your birth—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>I appealed to the Prince in person.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true. And as the secretary here dropped the subject, nay was afterwards seen to take off his hat as he passed you, it was rumored that he had received orders from court not to molest you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>He probably had.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>The wise folks then maintained, that you were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the natural son of some distinguished personage.—Understood?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Perfectly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>One of my brothers was then tutor to the pages at court, and stated that your audience with the Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded an hour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>It did.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>The world, therefore, not knowing what to make of the matter—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Made something bad of it. That is natural.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>But you see if I could retain the family property for my daughter—but without a mean action—Understood?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly, you would be glad to do it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>You would therefore oblige me, if you would entrust me with a few particulars of your descent.</p>

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear friend, I will do it with pleasure, for I am sure you will not make a bad use of my confidence. The time too, when this discovery might be attended with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is past, for my enemies have forgotten me.—I am, by birth, a nobleman—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>A nobleman!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>The last branch of the old house of Wellingrode. I was fortunate enough in my youth to become the favorite of a Prince, and unfortunate enough to have none but honest intentions towards him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>I understand. You wanted to introduce truth at court.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>The intrigues of an ambitious woman (who wished to raise her husband to the rank of prime-minister in order to govern through him) hurled me from my eminence. I was accused of treason, my property was confiscated and bestowed upon the new favorite. I escaped imprisonment by flight. How I was pursued and what I endured I will relate at another time. At present I will merely confine myself to the lucky turn of my fortunes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>Right—how you were metamorphosed from a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into a peasant?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>My late father-in-law had rented a farm on my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's estate, and I had always heard him mentioned as an upright man.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>He was one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>No longer knowing where I could be secure from the spies of my victorious rival, I suddenly remembered this old faithful servant. I clothed myself as a peasant, cut my hair, and on a summer's evening arrived at the house of Hans Wiedeman.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll bet a wager you were received with open arms.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Gently rest the ashes of that worthy man!—At first I merely meant to stay with him till the storm was blown over, and I forgotten. That I might not, in the mean time, be without employment, I began to cultivate a part of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037752_0020_100ED4A594666980"/>
garden. My Ann was then but fourteen years of age, and assisted me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes—I understand.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>You are mistaken. Much as I admired her, I little thought that we should celebrate a day like this. But the garden soon became too confined for me, and I began to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company good Wiedeman to the field. I acquired a love of agriculture. I daily felt fresh air and industry enliven both my body and the mind. I was healthier than before, and I was happier than before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>I can easily conceive it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>One evening, as I was walking alone across the meadows, the idea suddenly struck me—Oh I could shew you the very spot—to forget the distressing vision of my younger days, to renounce the airy phantoms of ambition, and become a quiet peasant.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>What thought honest old Wiedeman to this?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>He shook his head.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>I should have done so, too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>He thought my intention a mere whim, and that, when the times altered, I should repent my resolution. In vain did I represent to him that he was old, that he wanted a hale son-in-law—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dal.</speaker>
                  <p>He shook his head again, I suppose?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>He smiled, wished to convince me I was wrong, and when he found his arguments were ineffectual, he said he would try my resolution for two years. Finding, after the expiration of them, that I thought no more of court, and that his daughter sincerely loved me, he said: "God bless you!"—and God has blessed us.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>

here he is. If she likes the poet, the author— <stage>Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his left coat-pocket.</stage> here he is. The right pocket will suit the father and mother—the left the daughters—both will, I think, overpower the Arcadian shepherd, Mr. Lewis.—To-day will I bestow this hand, which has written so many a folio—so many a quarto, on — Paulina or Rosa?

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Sincerity is sparing in words. I hope, therefore, you will be silent, and celebrate this happy day by drinking a glass of wine with me.</p>

                  <p>You must play us a good tune—Rosa shall sing, and we will join in chorus. We will pass the bottle round to the health of every honest man, with a wish that after days of toil he may enjoy such happiness as ours.</p>

                  <p>True, and most seldom among those who are bred to a profession. You waste your best years in study, and are often at last obliged to be satisfied with a single dish upon your table.</p>

In the first place it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that I should ascertain my pedigree. <stage>Presents a large scroll.</stage> Here is the testimonial of my matriculations at the university.

                  <speaker>Ern.</speaker>
                  <p>You shall have it. I came here to make an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The dapper spark, Lewis, whose release you thought
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037752_0031_100F01CC5B3B7B38"/>
proper to buy of a recruiting party, has in return enlisted your daughters.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. Ernorf, my daughters are virtuous women.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ern.</speaker>
                  <p>Virtuous they may be; but they are in love. The whole village, the whole neighborhood, the whole country talks of it. They are in love with a vagrant, who will be cited to appear before the magistracy, to-morrow, and be sent over the boundaries next day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, can you prove your accusation?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ern.</speaker>
                  <p>Pshaw! The world seldom requires proofs. The worse any thing appears to be, the readier it is believed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Alas! True.</p>

                  <speaker>Ern.</speaker>
                  <p>I, therefore, advise you as a friend, Mr. Welling, and I advise you, Mrs. Welling, to keep a watchful eye upon these two love-sick damsels, and as to the gentle rhym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster—to-morrow before the magistracy!—<hi>Dixi.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>I am not pleased to seeing you laugh.</p>

                  <p>Dear father, he is only a fool.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>How often have I told you that fools do more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in the world than villains! A villain is generally pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of sense, and does not deal in defamation, unless he can thereby attain some end, but a fool is continually prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I, therefore, merely go out of a rascal's road, but I conceal myself from a blockhead. As to what Ernorf said, it cannot be his own invention.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pau.</speaker>
                  <p>It is indeed. The whole secret is, that Lewis writes better poetry than he does.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps I have too much relied upon the idea that fraternal intercourse is seldom dangerous to the heart.

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Paulina, I can explain no further, but before Lewis can become my son-in-law, I must learn his fortunes, and must be convinced his conduct has always been as praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy as since he lived with us. Go, Rosa, and call him.</p>

                  <speaker>Lew.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, you have not confined yourselves to intentions. Your house was my asylum, and the small measure of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, of which my heart was susceptible, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on me.</p>

                  <p>I would not do it for my own sake, were I not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to it. When you entered my house, my daughters were still almost children, and we thought not that your presence would ever injure their reputation.</p>

                  <p>Count Lohrstein is discovered in the back ground, sleeping under a tree—at his head lies a casket. Francis and Jacob are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation towards the front of the stage.</p>

                     <p>He is asleep. What think you, Jacob? Do you chuse to follow him through woods and bogs any longer? It's a strange kind of inclination.</p>

                     <p>But our master himself fares no better.</p>

                     <speaker>Fra.</speaker>
                     <p>The cook was the wisest of us, for he ran away, when he had only travelled one stage.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                     <p>The count smiled at that; but last night when his <hi>valet</hi> disappeared, on whom he placed such firm reliance—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fra.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, yes—no doubt he took some valuable effects with him. My advice is, Jacob, that we do the same.</p>

                     <speaker>Fra.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, he must dismiss us in a day or two, for how can he support us?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                     <p>That's true, to be sure.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fra.</speaker>
                     <p>And how long shall we be able to endure such a life at this? We have passed six nights in the open air. If we espy a chimney, we leave it a quarter of a mile on one side. We buy our coarse bread at solitary shepherd's huts, and have nothing to drink but water from the springs we meet with.</p>

                     <p>Was it our fault that there was an end to those days? Who knows what crime he has committed? The prince would scarcely send huzzars in pursuit of him for nothing.</p>

                     <p>Well—can't the huzzars ride over the borders?—Besides, we are now in a worse situation than ever. Our horses are so tired that we shall be obliged to leave them, and if we be seen creeping through the thickets, we may be mistaken for robbers, and shot.</p>

                     <speaker>Fra.</speaker>
                     <p>He won't dismiss us, and he can't pay us. But if, when he awakes, he finds we have decamped, he'll be heartily glad to have got rid of us.</p>

I will not conceal from you even this circumstance, but I beg you to believe that nothing but my present situation should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to disclose it. I am of low origin, and my father was seized with the pious whim of making me a clergyman, without being able to bestow any thing on my education. My humble talents, however, procured me a patron, who was in easy circumstances, and who defrayed the expenses of my studies. To him I was obliged for every thing; and the library you have mentioned, was his present. About a year ago, this worthy man was plundered by the French, and obliged in his age to become a beggar. It was then I sold my books.</p>

                     <p>You know my sentiments. A good wife is so great a treasure, that I am not at all surprised when I read of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who receive money from the bridegroom, when they bestow a daughter upon him. A girl ought to have no dowry but beauty and virtue. Thus thought your father—thus think I.—</p>

                  <p>In reality an office, but all adapted to my inclination. Alas! There was a time, when domestic felicity in the arms of my first consort left me no other wish.—She died.—I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook my solitary country dwelling, rushed into the whirlpool of the city to dissipate my grief and to seek another affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate heart; instead of which I found a deceitful and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious woman, who from an admirer of a country life trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me into a courtier, and used me as the tool of her designs.</p>

                  <p>By situations for ever new and intricate she kept me remote from nature and affection.

                  <p>Some months previous to his dissolution, my wife, in combination with an abandoned daughter-in-law, engender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new plans. She knew the hereditary Prince disliked me, and that his father's death would be the signal for my dismissal; but she also knew the connection which subsisted between the young Prince and my daughter-in-law. With her, therefore, she began to cabal, finding she could no longer maintain her station by her own devices. Two furies suppressed the hatred which had endured for years, and the snakes from their hair were intertwined. <stage>Over powered with agony.</stage> Oh!</p>

                  <p>I was. I had been persuaded to so many things—had so often despotically forced my heart to silence, that, on this occasion too, they thought their game an easy one. Yet although I had breathed none but court-air for seven-and-twenty years, I found it impossible to cringe to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had plunged my son into misery, and branded my

                  <p>I was prepared to receive my dismissal, but not to give account of every weakness, which might be laid to my charge during the twenty-seven years of my administration, of every injustice perhaps, to which at the pressing instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my wife and her adherents, I had now and then been led. I was not prepared against proofs, which my wife had stolen from my cabinet, and lodged in the hands of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.—Her reward was the permission to remain at court, and wander like the ghost of her former greatness, while I was doomed to perpetual imprisonment.</p>

                  <p>It is, I own, a long time ago, and the circumstances may have escaped your memory. About twenty-seven years since, when Baron Wellingrode fled— <stage>

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>I know still more. You overtook him, made him a prisoner in your own Prince's territories, and yet—allowed him to escape.</p>

                  <p>Well—I own this account is true, but the case was quite different. Baron Wellingrode was rewarded by his Prince with ingratitude, and the people loved him as their father, whereas Count Lohrstein—</p>

                  <p>You strike home to me.—You are right—I ought not to have connived at his escape, but I was under mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial obligations to him. He was my benefactor. When I was but a poor orphan, he procured me a situation in the

                  <p>My father wished it. He thought it might dissipate my anxiety, but his conduct is so strange, that he quite alarms me. He walks up and down the room, talking to himself. When I speak to him he smiles, and if he makes any reply, it is quite unintelligible.</p>

That in the head is of no consequence—the one in his arm is larger, but not dangerous. It was only the loss of blood which overpowered him, and he is come to himself again.</p>

                  <p>No. He was going to tell me, but the surgeon would not allow him to speak, and desired us to leave the room, as repose was absolutely necessary. Nobody but Mr. Rehberg remained with him.</p>

                  <speaker>Lew.</speaker>
                  <p>You must have been surprised on hearing that I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the hussars.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>

                  <p>When I left you, I intended to travel a few miles before sun-set, but my heart was so heavy, that my feet could not support me. I went to the little inn, which was full of hussars. I left them—wandered into the garden, and seated myself under an elm, where I indulged myself in a flood of tears. Ere long two of the hussars joined me. They laughed at me for my effeminacy—as they called it—but I paid no regard to them. At length they ceased their taunts, and began to converse about their own concerns—in which, alas, I was too nearly concerned.</p>

                  <p>A weak, but a good man. He was high in office—Heaven knows what has lately happened to him! He must have fled, and these hussars, as far as I can learn, are in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of him.—The two I mentioned, having spoken of him in terms the most abusive, I could no longer refrain—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered not that I alone was opposing twenty—I considered nothing but my father's honor, and struck the villain, whose language had been most opprobrious, to the earth. Of course, I immediately became the victim of my rashness.</p>

                  <p>My first education and my heart destined me to act a happy, but not a brilliant part in the world. My mother was formed for domestic comfort, and formed me for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of domestic comfort. She died. An ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful woman succeeded to my father's affections. Through her, he became minister—through her I too was to make my fortune (as it is called) at court. I was married to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom I knew not, but whom I discovered, when too late, to be the Prince's mistress. Yes. Then I might have raised myself, from step to step, in splendid infamy, and bending under the load of turpitude, might have climbed to the summit of courtly favor. But, thanks to Heaven, the sentiments, which she, who now enjoys celestial bliss, had graven in my mind, could not be eradicated by my step-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Soon as I discovered the labyrinth, in which they had involved my inexperience, my resolution was irrevocably
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037752_0074_100F02292102D228"/>
formed. I fled. From a delicacy, which was, perhaps car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to too great an excess, I took nothing with me. Beg I could not—I knew not how to work, so that at last, driven by hunger and despair, I accepted the offers of the recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, with which you found me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, all is plain—and how do I rejoice to find it thus! How Willingly do I request your pardon for the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, which to-day I could not quite suppress!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lew.</speaker>
                  <p>My character must have appeared dubious to you, and alas! that alone made my separation from you so painful.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Why did you not sooner discover yourself?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lew.</speaker>
                  <p>Could I accuse my father—or could I assist him? Even now, I would not have broken my silence, had not anxiety for his safety compelled me to do it. He is pursued and suspected to be in this neighborhood. I am, at present incapable of assisting him; for my arm is maimed, and the loss of blood has so much reduced me, that I cannot even go in search of him, to give him notice that he is pursued. Oh, I beseech you, kind, benevolent, generous man, I beseech you, send all your people through the wood, the roads, the hills, and if they find him—have compassion on his age—on his misfortunes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <stage>Surveys him, and turns aside, much affected.</stage> Fifty years has he lived at court, yet has it had no influence but on his manners. <stage>Aside.</stage> I hear the old Prince is dead?</p>

                  <p>
                     <stage>Composing himself.</stage> Yes, it has pleased the Highest to take him home, and what I prophesied twenty-seven years ago has happened. The prayers of the poor and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, whose father you always were, have been heard, and his Serene Highness restores to you all your former offices, estates, and dignities.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>How could the Prince learn—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Zah.</speaker>
                  <p>Pardon me, my Lord. When his Highness was pleased to manifest his sentiments, I found it impossible to keep silence any longer. I therefore announced myself, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an audience, and reported what I knew.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>Your intentions were good, but—</p>

                  <speaker>Zah.</speaker>
                  <p>His Highness was highly delighted. "Such a man," he was pleased to observe, "is wanting both for me and my subjects. Haste, and invite him to court."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Yes, I, old as I am, shall have the honor of again serving in the administration of your Excellency. I own I cannot proceed with the same facility as twenty-seven years ago, but the pleasure of doing my duty under my old wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy director, will make me young again.</p>

                  <speaker>Wel.</speaker>
                  <p>No, dear Zahn. To court I shall not return. I am not disposed again to encounter the cabals of Countess Lohrstein.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Zah.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lord. The Countess has finished her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and at present is a prisoner in the castle.</p>
