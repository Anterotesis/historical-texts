            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO Conſtructions have been given us of theſe Words; ſome have ſuppoſed, that the Queſtion here put, is, Whether theſe Diſciples, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> found at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> after he had paſſed thro' the upper Coaſts, had received the Holy Ghoſt, by Impoſition of Hands at Confirmation. — Others think, that theſe Diſciples had been already baptiſed into <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm; but that not being attended with an immediate Effuſion of the Holy Spirit, the Apoſtle here aſks them, <hi>Whether they had received the Holy Ghoſt by being baptiſed into</hi> JESUS CHRIST? And upon their anſwering in the Negative, he firſt baptiſed, and then confirmed them in the Name of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Which of theſe Interpretations is moſt true, is neither eaſy nor very neceſſary to determine. However, as the Words contain a moſt important Enquiry, without any Reference to the Context, I ſhall from them draw theſe two general Heads of Diſcourſe.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">I. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew who the Holy Ghoſt, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Text is; and how we muſt all receive him ere we can be ſtiled <hi>True Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Holy Ghoſt here ſpoken of, is ſignified the Holy Spirit, the third Perſon in the ever bleſſed Trinity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial and coeternal with the Father and the Son, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from, yet equal to them both.—He is emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called <hi>Holy,</hi> becauſe infinitely Holy in himſelf, and the Author and Finiſher of all Holineſs in us.</p>
            <p>This bleſſed Spirit, who once moved on the Face of the great Deep, who overſhadowed the Bleſſed Virgin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Holy Thing was born of her, who deſcended in a bodily Shape like a Dove on our Bleſſed LORD, when he came up out of the Water at his Baptiſm; and lighted afterwards in fiery Tongues on the Heads of all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles at the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi>; this is the Holy Ghoſt, who muſt move on the Faces of our Souls; this Power of the Moſt High muſt come upon us, and we muſt be baptiſed with his Baptiſm and refining Fire, before we can be ſtiled True Members of its myſtical Body.</p>
            <p>Thus ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you?</hi> that is, by his Spirit, <hi>unleſs you are Reprobates?</hi> Now if any Man hath not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his. — And again, ſays St. <hi>John, We know that we are his by the Spirit that he hath given us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not indeed neceſſary that we ſhould have it now given in that miraculous Manner in which it was at firſt given to our Lord's Apoſtles, by Signs and Wonders. But it is abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould receive the Holy Ghoſt in his ſanctifying Graces as really as they did, and ſo will it continue to be till the End of the World.</p>
            <p>For thus ſtands the Caſe between GOD and Man.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040228_0004_1015D4DB6E31CE40"/>
GOD at firſt made Man upright, or as the ſacred Pen-man expreſſes it, <hi>In the Image of GOD made he Man,</hi> that is, his Soul was the very Copy, the Tranſcript of the Divine Nature.—He that before had by his Almighty Fiat ſpoke the World into Being, breathed into Man the Breath of ſpiritual Life, and his Soul became adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity,—This was the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stroke of the Creation: The Perfection both of the moral and material World,—and ſo near reſembled its Divine Original, that GOD could not but rejoyce, and take Pleaſure in his own Likeneſs—And therefore we read, that when GOD had finiſhed the inanimate and brutiſh Part of the Creation, he looked upon it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it was <hi>Good</hi>; but when that lovely God-like Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Man,</hi> was made, behold it was <hi>very Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy then, unſpeakably happy muſt Man needs be, who was thus Partaker of the Divine Nature; and thus might we have ſtill continued, had he ſtill continued Holy. But GOD had placed him in a State of Probation, with a free Grant to eat of every Tree in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> except the Tree of Knowlege of Good and Evil.—The Day he did eat thereof he was ſurely to die; that is, not only to be ſubject to temporal, but ſpiritual Death, and conſequently to loſe that Divine Image, that ſpiritual Life GOD had not long ſince breathed into him, and which was as much his Happineſs as his Glory.</p>
            <p>Theſe, one would imagine, were eaſy Conditions for a finite Creature's Happineſs to depend on. But Man, unhappy Man, being ſeduced by the Devil, and deſiring like him, to be equal with his Maker, eat of the forbidden Fruit, and thereby became liable to that Curſe which the Eternal GOD, who cannot lie, had denounced againſt his Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Accordingly we read, that ſoon after <hi>Adam</hi> had fallen, he complained that he was naked.—Naked not only as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040228_0005_1015D4DD1F0A4230"/>
to his Body, but Naked and left deſtitute of thoſe Divine Graces, which before decked and beautified his Soul.— The unhappy Mutiny and Diſorder which the viſible Creation fell into, thoſe Briars and Thorns which now ſprung up and overſpread the Earth, were but poor Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, but lifeleſs Repreſentations of that Confuſion and Rebellion, thoſe divers Luſts and Paſſions which ſprung up in, &amp; quite overwhelmed the Soul of Man immediately after the Fall.—Alas! he was now no longer the Image of the inviſible GOD; but as he had imitated the Devil's Sin, he became Partaker of the Devil's Nature, and from an Union with, ſunk into a State of direct Enmity againſt GOD.</p>
            <p>Now in this dreadful diſordered Condition are all of us brought into the World.—For as the Root is, ſuch muſt the Branches be.— Accordingly we are told, that <hi>Adam</hi> begat a Son in his own Likeneſs, that is with the ſame corrupt Nature which he himſelf had ſunk into after he had eaten the forbidden Fruit. And Experience, as well as Scripture proves, that we alſo are altogether born in Sin and Corruption, and therefore uncapable, whilſt in ſuch a State, to hold Communion with GOD.—For as Light cannot have Communion with Darkneſs, ſo GOD can have no Communion with ſuch polluted Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then appears the End and Deſign why CHRIST was made manifeſt in the Fleſh.—<hi>viz.</hi> to put an End to theſe Diſorders, and to reſtore us to that primitive Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in which we were at firſt created.—Accordingly he ſhed his precious Blood to ſatisfy his Father's Juſtice for our Sins, and thereby alſo he purchaſed again for us the HOLY GHOST, who ſhould once more re-inſtamp the Divine Image upon our Hearts, and make us capable of living with and enjoying GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:040228_0006_1015D4E004427C10"/>This, I ſay, was the only End of our LORD's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World—Nay, this is the only End why the World itſelf is now kept in Being. For as ſoon as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Number are ſanctified out of it, the Heavens ſhall be wrapped up like a Scrowl, the Elements ſhall melt with fervent Heat, the Earth and all that therein is ſhall be burnt up.</p>
            <p>This is that New-Birth mentioned by our bleſſed LORD to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> without which we cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD. This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Spirit of our Minds, and herein conſiſts that Holineſs without which no Man ſhall ſee the LORD.</p>
            <p>In this manner then it is undeniably certain we muſt receive the HOLY GHOST e'er we can be ſtiled true Members of CHRIST'S myſtical Body.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now, in the <hi>Second</hi> Place, to lay down ſome ſcriptural Marks, whereby we may eaſily judge whether we have received the HOLY GHOST or not.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Firſt</hi> Mark I ſhall mention is,— our having received a Spirit of Prayer and Supplication:—For that always accompanies the Spirit of Grace—No ſooner was <hi>Paul</hi> converted, but behold he prayeth, ſays JESUS CHRIST. And this was urged as an Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Ananias</hi> that he was converted. And GOD's Elect are ſaid to cry to him Day and Night.</p>
            <p>For ſince one great Work of the Holy Spirit is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of Sin, and to ſet us upon ſeeking Pardon and renewing Grace thro' the all ſufficient Merits of a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Redeemer, whoſoever has felt the Powers of the World to come awakening him from his Spiritual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, cannot but be always crying, out, LORD, what wouldſt thou have me do? Or in the Language of the importunate blind <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> JESUS, thou Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> have Mercy upon me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:040228_0007_1015D4E2A13DCFB8"/>The bleſſed JESUS, as he received the Holy Ghoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meaſure, ſo he evidenced it by nothing more than his frequent Addreſſes at the Throne of Grace. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we read, that he was often alone on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Praying— That he roſe a great while before Day to Pray.—Nay that he ſpent whole Nights in Prayer. And whoſoever is made Partaker of the ſame Spirit with the HOLY JESUS, will be of the ſame Mind, and delight in nothing ſo much as to draw nigh unto GOD, and lift up holy Hands and Hearts in fervent and devout Prayer.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed indeed that this Spirit of Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is often as it were ſenſibly loſt, and decays for ſome Time even in thoſe who have actually received the Holy Ghoſt. And they, thro' ſpiritual Dryneſs and Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Soul, find in themſelves a Liſtleſſneſs and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to this Duty of Prayer;—but then they take it as their Croſs, and ſtill perſevere in ſeeking JESUS tho' it be ſorrowing. And their Hearts notwithſtanding are fixed upon GOD, tho' they cannot exert their Affections ſo ſtrongly as uſual, on Account of that ſpiritual Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which GOD for wiſe Reaſons has ſuffered to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb their Souls.</p>
            <p>But as for the formal Believer, it is not ſo with him. No, he either prays not at all, or if he does enter into his Cloſet, it is with Reluctance—out of Cuſtom—or to ſatisfy the Checks of his Conſcience—Whereas the true Believer can no more live without Prayer, than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Food Day by Day. And he finds his Soul as really and perceptibly fed by the one, as his Body is nouriſhed and ſupported by the other.</p>
            <p>A Second Scripture Mark of our having received the HOLY GHOST, is— not committing Sin.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoſoever is born of GOD,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, ſinneth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he ſin, becauſe his Seed remaineth in him</hi>—Neither can he ſin—This Expreſſion does not imply the Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040228_0008_1015D4E617DFCD18"/>
of a ſpiritual Man's ſinning. For we are told, that in many Things we offend all. It means only thus much; that a Man that is really born again of GOD, doth not wilfully commit Sin, much leſs live in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Practice if it. For how ſhall he that is dead to Sin, as every converted Perſon is, live any longer therein?</p>
            <p>'Tis true a Man that is born again of GOD may, thro' Surprize or Violence of a Temptation, fall into an Act of Sin: Witneſs the Adultery of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter's</hi> Denial of his Maſter. But then, like them, he quickly riſes again, goes out from the World, and weeps bitterly; waſhes the Guilt of Sin away by the Tears of a ſincere Repentance, joined with Faith in the Blood of JESUS CHRIST; takes double Heed to his Ways for the future, and perfects Holineſs in the Fear of GOD.</p>
            <p>The Meaning of this Expreſſion of the Apoſtle, that a Man that is born again of GOD, cannot commit Sin, has been <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>LAW's</hi> Chriſtian Perfection.</note> fitly illuſtrated in the Example of a covetous Worldling, to the general Bent of whoſe Inclinations, Liberality and Profuſeneſs are directly oppoſite. But if, upon ſome unexpected ſudden Occaſion, he does play the Prodigal, he immediately repents him of his Fault, and returns with double Care to his Savingneſs again.—And ſo is every one that is born again. To commit Sin is as contrary to the habitual Frame and Tendency of his Mind, as Generoſity is to the Inclinations of a Miſer. But if at any Time he is drawn into Sin, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with double Zeal returns to his Duty, and brings forth Fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s meet for Repentance.</p>
            <p>Whereas the unconverted Sinner is quite dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins,—or if he does abſtain from the groſs Acts of it, from worldly ſelfiſh Motives, yet there is ſome Right Eye he will not pluck out; ſome Right Hand which he will not cut off; ſome ſpecious <hi>Agag</hi> that he will not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040228_0009_1015D4E79EAE6E60"/>
for GOD; and thereby he is convinced, that he is but a mere <hi>Saul</hi>; and conſequently, whatever Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he may make to the contrary, he has not yet receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Mark whereby we may know whether or not we have received the Holy Ghoſt is,—our Conqueſt over the World.—For <hi>whoever is born of GOD,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>overcometh the World.</hi>—By the World we are to underſtand, as St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes it, all that is in the World, the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and Pride of Life.—And by overcoming of it is meant our renouncing theſe, ſo as not to follow or be led by them. For whoſoever is born from above, has his Affections ſet on Things above: He feels a Divine Attraction in his Soul, which forcibly draws his Mind Heavenwards; and as the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, ſo doth it make his Soul to long after the Enjoyment of his GOD.</p>
            <p>Not that he is ſo taken up with the Affairs of another Life, as to neglect the Buſineſs of this. No, a truly ſpiritual Man dares not ſtand any Day idle: But then he takes Care, though he laboureth for the Meat which periſheth, firſt to ſecure that which endureth to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life. Or if GOD has exalted him above his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet, like <hi>Moſes, Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding looks upon himſelf as a Stranger and Pilgrim upon Earth.— Having received a Principle of new Life, he walks by Faith and not by Sight.— And his Hopes being full of Immortality, he can look on all Things here below as Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.—In ſhort, tho' he is in, yet is not of the World: And as he was made for the Enjoyment of GOD, ſo nothing but GOD can ſatisfy his Soul.</p>
            <p>The ever bleſſed JESUS was a perfect Inſtance of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the World. For tho' he went continually about doing Good, and always lived in a Preſs, yet wherever
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040228_0010_1015D4EA359D3070"/>
he was, his Converſation tended Heavenwards. In like Manner he that is joined to the LORD in one Spirit, will ſo order his Tho'ts, Words, &amp; Actions aright that he will evidence to all, that his Converſation is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, an unconverted Man being of the Earth, is earthly: And having no ſpiritual Eye to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſpiritual Things, is always ſeeking for Happineſs in this Life, where it never was, will, or can be found. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not born again from above, he is bowed down by a Spirit of natural Infirmity; the Serpent's Curſe becomes his Choice, and he eats of the Duſt of the Earth all the Days of his Life.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Scripture Mark of our <hi>New-Birth,</hi> or of our having received the Holy Ghoſt, is,— our loving one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We know,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, we are paſſed from Death unto Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.—And by this</hi> ſays JESUS CHRIST, <hi>ſhall all Men know, that you are my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if ye have Love one toward another.</hi>—Love is the fulfilling of the Goſpel, as well as the Law; for GOD is Love, &amp; whoſoever dwelleth in GOD, dwelleth in Love.</p>
            <p>But by this Love we are not to underſtand, a Softneſs and Tenderneſs of meer Nature, or a Love founded on worldly Motives (for this a natural Man may have) but a Love of our Brethren proceeding from a Love towards GOD. Loving all Men in general, becauſe GOD loves all Men, &amp; loving good Men in particular, for the Grace we ſee in them, and becauſe they love our Lord JESUS in Sincerity.</p>
            <p>This is Chriſtian Charity, and that new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which CHRIST gave his Diſciples. New not in its Object, but in the Motive and Example whereon it is founded, even JESUS CHRIST. This is that Love which the primitive Chriſtians were ſo renowned for, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Proverb.—<hi>See, how theſe Chriſtians love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:040228_0011_1015D4EEAC302DF8"/>
—And without this Love, tho' we ſhould give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bodies to be burnt, it would profit us nothing.</p>
            <p>Farther, this Love is not confined to any particular Set of Men, but is impartial and catholic. A Love that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces GOD'S Image where-ever it beholds it, and that delights in nothing ſo much as to ſee CHRIST'S King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come.</p>
            <p>This is the Love wherewith JESUS CHRIST loved Mankind.—He loved all, even the worſt of Men, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his weeping over the obſtinately perverſe; but wherever he ſaw the leaſt Appearance of the Divine Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that Soul he loved in particular.—Thus we read, that when he heard the young Man ſay, <hi>All theſe Things have I kept from my Youth,</hi> that ſo far he loved him. And when he ſaw any noble Inſtance of Faith, tho' in a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion,</hi> a <hi>Syro-phaenician,</hi> Aliens to the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how is he ſaid to marvel at it, as Man, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, ſpeak of, and commend it?—So alſo every ſpiritual Diſciple of JESUS CHRIST will cordially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all that worſhip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they may differ as to the Appendages of Religion, and Things not eſſentially neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>I confeſs indeed that the Heart of a natural Man is not thus enlarged all at once; and a Perſon may really have received the Holy Ghoſt (as <hi>Peter</hi> no doubt had when he was unwilling to go to <hi>Cornelius)</hi> tho' he be not arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to this.—But then we affirm, where a Perſon is truly in CHRIST, all Narrowneſs of Spirit decreaſes in him daily; the Partition-Wall of Bigotry and Party Zeal is broken down more and more; and the nearer he comes to Heaven the more his Heart is enlarged with that Love which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here will make no Difference between any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Nation or Language, but we ſhall all with one Heart, and one Voice, ſing Praiſes to him that ſitteth upon the Throne for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:040228_0012_1015D4F16351EA78"/>But I haſten to ſhew a <hi>Fifth,</hi> and that the laſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Mark of our <hi>New-Birth,</hi> that I ſhall at preſent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—Loving our Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſays JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to thoſe that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi>— And this Duty of loving our Enemies is ſo neceſſary, that without it, our bleſſed LORD tells us our Righteouſneſs does not exceed the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> nay, or of <hi>Publicans</hi> and Sinners: For if you do Good to them only which do Good to you, what do you more than others? What do you extraordinary? Do not even <hi>Publicans</hi> the ſame? — And theſe Precepts our LORD confirmed by his own Example, when he wept over the bloody City; when he ſuffered himſelf to be led as a Sheep to the Slaughter; when he made that mild Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Traytor <hi>Judas, Judas betrayeſt thou the Son of Man with a Kiſs</hi>;—And more eſpecially when in the Agonies &amp; Pangs, of Death, he prayed for his very Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the moſt difficult Duty to the natural Man, but whoſoever is made Partaker of that Promiſe of the Father, will find it practicable and eaſy. For if we are born again of GOD, we muſt be like him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently delight to be perfect in this Duty of doing good to our worſt Enemies in the ſame Manner, tho' not in the ſame Degree as he is perfect.—And he ſends his Rain on the Evil and the Good, cauſeth his Sun to ſhine on the Juſt and Unjuſt: And herein more eſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his Love towards us, that whilſt we were his Enemies, he ſent forth his Son, born of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might become a Curſe for us.</p>
            <p>Many other Marks there are ſcattered up and down the Scriptures, whereby we may know whether or not we have received the Holy Ghoſt. Such as <hi>to be carnally
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040228_0013_1015D4F359A0C2B0"/>
minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace.—Now the Fruits of the Spirit are Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Meckneſs,</hi> with a Multitude of Texts to the ſame Purpoſe.—But as moſt, if not all of them, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Duties already laid down, I dare affirm, whoſoever, upon an impartial Examination, can find the aforeſaid Marks upon his Soul, may be as certain, as tho' an Angel was to tell him, that his Pardon is ſealed in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And as for my own Part, I had rather ſee theſe Divine Graces, theſe Heavenly Tempers ſtamped upon my Soul, than to hear an Angel from Heaven ſaying unto me, <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe are infallible Witneſſes; theſe are <hi>Emanuel,</hi> GOD with and in us; theſe make up that white Stone, which none knoweth, ſaving he who receiveth it; theſe are the Earneſts of the Heavenly Inheritance in our Hearts. In ſhort, theſe are Glory begun, and are that good Thing, that better Part, which, if you continue to ſtir up this Gift of GOD, neither Men or Devils ſhall ever be able to take from us.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I proceed now, as was propoſed, in the <hi>Third</hi> Place, to make an Application of the Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, to ſeveral diſtinct Claſſes of Profeſſors.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall addreſs myſelf to thoſe who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.—And here how could I weep over you, as our LORD wept over <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> For alas! how diſtant muſt you be from GOD, what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Work have you got to finiſh, who inſtead of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day and Night, ſeldom or never pray at all! And inſtead of being born again in GOD, ſo as not to commit Sin, are ſo deeply ſunk into the Nature of Devils as to make a Mock at it. Or inſtead of overcoming the World, ſo as not to follow or be led by it, are continually making Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſt thereof. And
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040228_0014_1015D4F4E9724E48"/>
laſtly, inſtead of being endued with the Godlike Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of loving all Men, even your Enemies, have your Hearts full of Hatred, Malice and Revenge, and deride thoſe who are ſincere Followers of the lowly JESUS. But think you, O Sinners, that GOD will admit ſuch pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wretches into his Sight? Or ſhould he admit you, do you imagine you could take any Pleaſure in him? No, Heaven itſelf would be no Heaven to you: The Deviliſh Diſpoſitions which are in your Hearts would render all the ſpiritual Enjoyments of thoſe bleſſed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ineffectual to make you happy.—To qualify you to be bliſsful Partakers of that Heavenly Inheritance with the Saints in Light, there is a Meetneſs required, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which ought to be the one Buſineſs of your Lives.</p>
            <p>It is true, you, as well as the Righteous, in one Senſe ſhall Seat GOD (for we muſt all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of CHRIST) but you muſt ſee him once, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſee him more. For as you carry about in you the Devil's Image, with Devils you muſt dwell. Being of the ſame Nature, you muſt ſhare the ſame Doom. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent therefore and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out. See that you receive the Holy Ghoſt before you go hence: For otherwiſe how can you eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall apply myſelf to thoſe who deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with falſe Hopes of Salvation. And becauſe, thro' the Influence of a good Education, or other providential Reſtraints, they have not run into the ſame Exceſs of Riot with other Men, think they have no Need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghoſt, and flatter themſelves that they are really born again.</p>
            <p>But do you ſhew it by bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit; Do you pray without ceaſing? Do you not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin? Have you overcome the World? And do you
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040228_0015_1015D4F9D0BCA330"/>
love your Enemies, and all Mankind, in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as JESUS CHRIST loved them?</p>
            <p>If theſe Things, Brethren, be in you, and abound, then may you have Confidence towards GOD: But if not, altho' you may be civilized, yet you are not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No, you are yet in your Sins. The Nature of the old <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill reigneth in your Souls. And unleſs the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> be engrafted in its Room, you can never ſee GOD.</p>
            <p>Think not therefore to dreſs yourſelves up in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of a good Nature, and civil Education, and ſay with <hi>Agag,</hi> ſurely the Bitterneſs of Death is paſt. For GOD'S Juſtice notwithſtanding that, like <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſhall hew you to Pieces.—However you may be highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Sight of Men, yet in the Sight of GOD you are but like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Dunghills covered over with Snow, mere whited Sepulchres, appearing a little beautiful without, but inwardly full of Corruption and of all Uncleanlineſs.—And conſequently will be diſmiſſed at the laſt Day, with a <hi>Verily, I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Word is profitable for Comfort, as well as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> therefore do I addreſs myſelf to thoſe who are under the Drawings of the Father, and are going thro' the Spirit of Bondage, but not finding the Marks before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are ever crying out, <hi>Who ſhall deliver us from the Body of this Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But fear not, little Flock; for notwithſtanding your preſent Infant State of Grace, it ſhall be your Father's good Pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Grace of GOD, thro' JESUS CHRIST, that ſhall deliver you, that ſhall give you what you thirſt after.— He hath promiſed he will alſo do it.—Ye ſhall receive the Spirit of Adoption, that Promiſe of the Father, if you ſaint not.—Only perſevere in ſeeking it,—and determine
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:040228_0016_1015D4FC874ABEB8"/>
to find no Reſt in your Spirit, till you know and feel that you are thus born again from above, &amp; GOD'S Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth with your Spirits that you are the Children of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> I addreſs myſelf to thoſe who have received the Holy Ghoſt in all its ſanctifying Graces, and almoſt ripe for Glory.</p>
            <p>Hail happy Saints! For your Heaven is begun on Earth. You have already received the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, and are patiently waiting till that bleſſed Change come, when your Harveſt ſhall be compleat.— I ſee &amp; admire you, tho' alas! at ſo great a Diſtance from you.—Your Life, I know, is hid with CHRIST in GOD.— You have Comforts, you have Meat to eat, which a ſinful, carnal, ridiculing World knows nothing of.— CHRIST'S Yoke is now become eaſy to you, and his Burden light: You have paſſed through the Pangs of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> and now rejoice that the Man CHRIST JESUS is ſpiritually formed in your Hearts. You know what it is to dwell in CHRIST, and CHRIST in you. Like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder, altho' your Bodies are on Earth, yet your Souls and Hearts are in Heaven: And by your Faith and conſtant Recollection, like the Bleſſed Angels, you do always behold the Face of your Father which is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>I need not then exhort you to preſs forward: For you know that in walking by the Spirit there is great Reward. Rather will I exhort you in Patience to poſſeſs your Souls yet a little while, and JESUS CHRIST will deliver you from the Burden of the Fleſh, and an abundant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhall be adminiſtered unto you into the eternal Joy and uninterrupted Felicity of his Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
            <q>Which <hi>GOD</hi> of his infinite Mercy grant, through <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> our <hi>LORD;</hi> to whom with the <hi>FATHER</hi> and the <hi>HOLY GHOST,</hi> Three Perſons &amp; One <hi>GOD,</hi> be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all Honour, Power, and Glory, forever and ever.</q>
