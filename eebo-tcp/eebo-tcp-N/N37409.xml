            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I BLESS God that I was ever acquainted with Doctor GEORGE DE BENNE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILLE, for ſuch an humble, pious, loving man I have ſcarcely ever ſeen in my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage through life.—To ſuch as conſider this account as romantic, abſurd, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, I ſhall only ſay, "that if they had known the author as well as I did, I doubt not they would have thought of him in a good meaſure as I do." I think it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a man of his piety, humility, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and univerſal good character, ſhould have been guilty of deliberately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon mankind; and from the very nature and circumſtances of the caſe, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how it is poſſible that he ſhould be impoſed upon himſelf. I have no doubt of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:049018_0003_102646B16F1F33B0"/>
the truth of this relation myſelf, and have delivered it faithfully as I received it. I conſider myſelf haſtening to the bar of God, where I expect very ſhortly to give up my account to the Judge of all the earth, and therefore God forbid that I ſhould ever practice deceptions or impoſitions on my fellow creatures.</p>

            <head>LIFE AND TRANCE OF <hi>Doctor George De Benneville.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I GEORGE DE BENEVILLE, was born in London, July 26th, 1703. My father George De Benneville was a French refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee, perſecuted for his religion. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with his family and connections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England upon the invitation of his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty king William, who took a tender care of them, and employed them at his court.</p>
            <p>My mother was of the Granville family. She had nine children in five years after mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, having twins four years ſucceſſively, and I being the laſt, ſhe died as ſoon as I was born. She knew that ſhe would die at that time, and therefore ſhe was very often drawn whilſt ſhe was pregnant, to pray for me, and it appears that the Lord heard her prayers and granted her requeſts.</p>
            <p>I was alſo very young when my father died, and was brought up by one of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. After the death of my mother, Queen Anne herſelf provided me a nurſe, and ſhe had the care of my firſt years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:049018_0005_102646B780202290"/>When arrived at the age of twelve years, I was very wild believing myſelf to be of a different maſs from mankind in general, and by this fond imagination I was ſelf-exalted, and believed-myſelf to be more than other men: but God ſoon convinced me to the contrary.</p>
            <p>As it was deſigned that I ſhould learn na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, I was ſent to ſea in a veſſel of war belonging to a little fleet bound to the coaſt of Barbary with preſents, and to renew the peace with Algiers, Tunis, and Tripolis. Being arrived at Algiers, as I walked upon deck I ſaw ſome Moors who brought ſome refreſhments to fell; one of them ſlipped down and tore a piece out of one of his legs, two of his companions having lain him on the deck. each of them kiſſed the wound, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tears upon it, then turned towards the riſing of the ſun, they cried in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that I was much moved with anger at their making ſuch a noiſe, and ordered my waiter to bring them before me. Upon demanding the reaſon of their noiſe, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I was angry, aſked my pardon, and told me the cauſe was owing to one of their brothers having hurt his leg by a fall, and that they kiſſed the wound in order to ſympathize with him, and likewiſe ſhed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:049018_0006_102646B9087C5D00"/>
tears upon it and took part with him, and as tears were ſaltiſh, they were a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to heal the ſame; and the reaſon of their turning towards the ſun's riſing was to invoke him who created the ſun to have compaſſion upon their poor brother, and prayed he would pleaſe to heal him. Up, on that I was ſo convinced, and moved within, that I thought my heart would break, and that my life was about to leave me; my eyes with tears, and I felt ſuch an internal condemnation, that I was obliged to cry out and ſay, "Are theſe Heathens? No; I confeſs before God they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and I myſelf am a Heathen!" Behold the firſt conviction that the grace of our Sovereign Good employed: he was pleaſed to convince a white perſon by blacks! one who carried the name of a chriſtian by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and who was obliged to confeſs himſelf but a heathen. But that was ſoon overcome and forgot. But God who always ſeeks to convince and ſave his poor creatures, did not leave his poor wandering ſheep; for ſome time after my return home, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by invitation at a ball, and having over heated myſelf. I order my ſervant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare linens for me to change, and as I was putting it on, I fell into a fainting fit, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:049018_0007_102646BB734C2BF0"/>
had a viſion of myſelf, burning as a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand in hell, and coming to myſelf; again, I cried out, "I am damned!" Prayers were deſired in the French Churches for one who had loſt his ſenſes and was melancholy— The miniſters often viſited me, and would fain have made me believe that I had not committed any very great ſins, and that I had behaved according to my rank and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then I was obliged to anſwer them, that if they had no other things than thoſe to tell me, they could anſwer no pur-poſe but as fig leaves to cover my ſhame, and my damnable eſtate: that it was in vain to come and viſit me with ſuch comfort, for that I felt myſelf condemned. Then they anſwered me in another manner than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaying, ſince I would not receive their remonſtrances it might be looked upon as a mark that peradventure I was deſtined from the begining to condemnation.</p>
            <p>Then they gave me up and came no more to viſit me—After that I continued in the ſtate of condemnation during the ſpace of fifteen months, believing that all the world but myſelf might be ſaved, and that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be ſaved, becauſe my ſins, as I thought, were too many and too great to be forgiven. At length after the fifteen
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:049018_0008_102646BD0536E278"/>
months were expired, after having paſſed through many temptations, it happened to me one day having laid myſelf down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I was awakened out of my ſleep, and heard a voice within me, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſentence of my condemnation, and left me no room to hope. I then diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the root of all my ſins and iniquities within my heart: that diſcovery brought me into an extreme agony Diſpair entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſoul, which was now preſſed on all ſides with miſery, cauſed eſpecially by ſuch great unbelief and hardneſs of heart, which was the moſt inſupportable of all my troubles; I could diſcover no remedy for my diſeaſe, but thought that my ſentence of damnation was going to be executed: the ſorrow of my ſoul was even to death: I deſired to die, but death fled from me: I could find no remedy but to leave myſelf to the juſtice of my judge for a condemned criminal as I was: I knew that his judgements were juſt, and that I had merited much more than I felt.</p>
            <p>Thus abandoning myſelf to juſtice, and waiting for its accompliſhment in me, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover between juſtice, and me the criminal, one of a moſt majeſtic appearance, whoſe beauty, brightneſs, and grandeur can never be diſcribed: he caſt ſuch a look of love on me as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:049018_0009_102646C14E7A63F0"/>
penetrated through me, the fire of which ſo embraced my ſoul that I loved him again with the ſame love. He perſuaded me in my, heart that he was my Saviour, Mediator and Reconciliator, and while I thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he began to intercede for me in this manner, ſaying, "My father, behold me with thy paternal regard, I have made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for this ſinner, who hath received in himſelf the ſentence of condemnation. I have taken human nature for him. I have ſuffered all kind of ignominy for him. I have ſhed my blood even to the laſt drop for him. I have ſuffered the ſhameful death of the croſs for him. I have deſcended into the abyſs of hell for him, that I might deliver him. I have been put to death for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and raiſed again for his juſtification, and where his ſins abound, our grace abounds much more. Oh! my heavenly father, pardon this poor ſinner, and cauſe thy mercy to come to him." The judge or juſtice had nothing more to ſay. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence diſappeared. Then I heard his eternal univerſal voice, which penetrated through me with divine power, ſaying, "Take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage my ſon, thy ſins are forgiven thee." Immediately all the burthen of my ſins and iniquities was gone, all the ſtings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:049018_0010_102646C2D781F5A8"/>
ceaſed in a moment, a living faith came in their ſtead, and the tears of ſorrow were all wiped from my eyes; I caſt myſelf at the feet of my mediator, reconciler, ſaviour, and interceſſor, and embraced him with an enlivening faith, melting into tears of love, humility, and nothingneſs.</p>
            <p>Oh! my Lord and my God, thou haſt ſaved me thro' pure grace; what ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to thee for all thy benefits? Oh! my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, whom I honor and adore, give me a pure a holy heart, filled with thy vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and thy love, even ſuch as thou wouldſt that I ſhould have; and renew a right ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within my breaſt. Now know that thy marvellous mercy hath given me a ſavior before I knew my danger and ſlavery; a phyſician who had the care of my diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I felt or knew the ſame; a redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who undertook to pay the debt that I was neither willing nor able to pay. Oh! my benefactor, guide me by the efficacy of thy ſpirit to walk in the way of thy truth and univerſal love. Teach me thy eternal and univerſal word; ſpeak my Lord and my God, for thy ſervant heareth. Give me thy grace, oh my divine love, that I may have the eyes of my faith fixed conſtantly upon thee, and that I may follow thee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:049018_0011_102646C59DABD340"/>
thou mayeſt pleaſe to lead me. That thy holy will may be accompliſhed in time and eternity, to the praiſe of thy glory, and my compleat ſalvation.</p>
            <p>O my dear ſoul, ſink, thyſelf down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothingneſs and the deepeſt humiliation, and adore in ſpirit and in truth; honor the ocean of love, and the great wonders of the wiſdom and power of thy God, who hath employed all theſe boundleſs in comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miracles to reſtore and to ſave thee, and not thee only, but all the human ſpecies, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Oh! the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom and power of God, how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out: for of him and through him, and for him are all things. To him be glory eternal.</p>
            <p>In the preſent caſe his goodneſs ſhines. for God hath loved me before that I was born. Oh! what grace. God himſelf hath loved me in my fallen eſtate, whence I was wholly loſt. Oh! what mercy: God hath even loved me when I was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and that freely too.—Oh! what love.</p>
            <p>He hath given me his well-beloved ſon: and in giving his beloved ſon, he hath given me his paternal heart: and at the time that

he took human nature, he became my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that by this parentage he might oblige himſelf to have a right to love and to have the care of me. I feel him the juſt, for my offences and wickedneſs which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to bear as his own, brought before the moſt righteous judgment ſeat, where he himſelf alone paid the laſt penny of the dreadful debt of all the world. I beheld him upon the croſs deface and deſtroy the obligation that was againſt me, and after that he entered once for all into the holy place by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption for me. Approach then now, Oh! my ſoul, love him which haſt loved thee fiſt. Love him eternally, with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might, who hath made thee to know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the great myſteries of his holy love, reſpecting all his creatures.—Hallelujah— Amen.</p>
            <p>O what an alteration from being a child of darkneſs to a child of light; now I know in whom I have believed, and deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate myſelf to my Lord, my Sovereign Good, the remainder of my days.</p>
            <p>My converſion made a great noiſe among the people, for they ſaw me praiſing and adoring my divine Savior on all occaſions,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:049018_0013_102646C85D804EA0"/>
and before all company where I came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception; calling and exhorting each one to ſubmit to the love of God, juſt as they found themſelves, and although their ſins were many and great, his grace was geater to receive and pardon, but that we muſt come as we are, for he is the begining and the end of the converſion of all the human ſpecies, and whoſoever is not converted by him, and to him, is not converted at all.</p>
            <p>The French miniſters were very uneaſy at what they heard concerning me, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was not a true proteſtant, and therefore they demanded a written confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my faith; I told them paper would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing to be written upon it, truth or falſhood, but that I was not aſhamed to confeſs with my mouth what I believed in my heart, and that if they would let me know when they would meet together, I would be ready to appear before them to give them an account of my faith, and the wonders which the moſt holy trinity had wrought within me.</p>
            <p>The time was fixed and I appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. They aſked me many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, but we could not agree, for they held predeſtination, and I held the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all ſouls; becauſe having myſelf been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:049018_0014_102646CBDB30AD98"/>
the chief of ſinners, and that God, through Jeſus Chriſt, by the efficacy of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, had granted me mercy and the pardon of all my ſins, and had plucked me as a brand out of hell, I could not have a doubt but the whole World would be ſaved by the ſame power. They anſwered me that I muſt not take it ill that they could not own me as a member of their church. I replied, that I was very well content to be caſt out, and that my conſolation was, that they were not able to blot my name out of the book of life.</p>
            <p>Soon after I got acquainted with ſome perſons who led a very retired life, having received a deep knowledge of themſelves thro' grace: we ſometimes met together, but we ſoon were perſecuted with reproach.</p>
            <p>After that I received a voice of grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to go and preach the goſpel in France; I reſiſted it more than once or twice, fearing perſecution. but I was ſtruck with a ſickneſs and had pain like the agony of death, was ready to die, and knowing it was becauſe I had not hearkened to that voice that had called me to bear witneſs to the truth of <hi>France,</hi> I humbled myſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my God thro' Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, aſked pardon for my offences, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:049018_0015_102646CD65C5B168"/>
to ſubmit myſelf to follow his voice, upon which I was immediately healed; and grew more robuſt than I had ever been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then I heard his voice once more, calling me to go to France to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and I found myſelf obliged in my ſoul to follow the voice, through with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>I took paſſage at Dover for Calais, and immediately upon my arrival I began to preach and proclaim the good news in the market, even the eternal ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt within us, and that each one of us might be ſaved by pure grace, and that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever knowing himſelf, feeling the burden of his iniquities, having recourſe to Jeſus Chriſt, refining himſelf without reſerve, with all his ſins, even had he found himſelf in his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate, ſhould be delivered, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the pardon of all his ſins.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had done I was taken before a magiſtrate, who made me to know that my conduct was contrary to the ſtature of the king: I was then conducted to priſon, where I was no ſooner arrived than all the fear of perſecution vaniſhed; my ſoul was ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the Lord Jeſus; I felt the love of my divine ſavior very near accompained with his divine light. After ſome days had
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:049018_0016_102646D0242207D0"/>
paſt, I was brought before the juſtice, &amp; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by what order I preached; I told him who I was, and that I was drawn by the ſpecial grace of my God in Jeſus Chriſt, by the power of his holy ſpirit, to teach the nations, and that for refuſing to obey the voice of my God I was taken very ſick. While they were examining me there came in an old man with a white beard; all the juſtices ſaluted him: he ſaid to them, have nothing to do with this perſon, for I have ſuffered much this night paſt on his account, and retired immediately.</p>
            <p>I was then condemed to eight days im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, as it was the firſt time, and to be conducted by the ſervant of the magiſtrate out of the bounds of the city, letting me know that if I was found employed in the ſame manner a ſecond time, my life would be in danger.</p>
            <p>I was about 17 years of age when I began to preach in France. In this manner I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed two years in that kingdom, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel in high and low Normandy, the country of my father, for he was born in the city of Rouan.</p>
            <p>There were many miniſters of us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Monſr. Durant, de la Chevrette; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulin, L'Achar, &amp;c.</hi> We met together
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:049018_0017_102646D2B5C8DC20"/>
in mountains and woods, to the number of 400 where God very often wrought great wonder by the power of the goſpel, among men and women, and even boys and girls, of the age of twelve or fifteen years, that did not even know how to read or write.— They were convinced by the power of grace, and began to proclaim the goſpel with a moſt marvelous ſtrength of ſpirit, without any fear, being embraced by love divine.</p>
            <p>We were many times taken priſoners du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the two years, ſometimes by means of our own brothers, who would go and inform the ſoldiers in the maſhelſey where we were met together.</p>
            <p>Many of us were hanged, others whiped by the hands of the hangman, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a hot iron; all their goods confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and they ſent on boad the galleys, but all that did not weaken us, but on the the contrary, the grace of our divine love ſtrengthened us to a wonder.</p>
            <p>At laſt we were ſurrounned by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſoldiers one day when we were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſide of <hi>Dieppe,</hi> where many of us were taken priſoners, among whom was myſelf, and a Mr. <hi>Durant,</hi> a young man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 24 years of age, of <hi>Geneoa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:049018_0018_102646D60E54C320"/>After a month impriſonment we were condemned to die, he to be hanged, and I to have my headcut off. We were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together to the place of execution; he ſung the 116 pſalm when on the ladder, and died joyfully.</p>
            <p>I was then conducted to the ſcaffold, my eyes were ordered to be bound to prevent my ſeeing, but upon my earneſt requeſt that was omitted.</p>
            <p>I then fell upon my knees, and praying the Lord that he would not require my blood at their hands, as they knew not what they did; my ſoul was filled with exceeding joy. The executioner bound my hands, and while he was employed in ſo doing a courier arrived from the king, which was Louis XV, with a reprieve for the criminal. Immediately the joy of my heart was gone, and darkneſs entered into my ſoul. I was then reconducted to priſon at Paris, where I was confined ſometime before I was libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thro' the interceſſion of the queen.</p>
            <p>Many things happened to me during my exile in France, and the time of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement One may eaſily diſcover here, that the grace of our God never leaves thoſe who truſt in him and are faithful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:049018_0019_102646D7A2EEA850"/>After my releaſement I retired into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, where I began to learn the language with great difficulty. I found many ſouls who were convinced by grace, and who led a very retired life among the French refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees at Bulin, Madeburg. Brandeburg, Brunſwick in the Palatinate, Hamburg, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona, Stade, Gluckſtadt, Bremen, the country of Hanover, in Flanders, Brabant, the low land of Holland, the country of Waldenſes and many other places.</p>
            <p>I found work all round, ſouls who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſaved. I had alſo a large acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the nobility in Germany, and Holland; we had a large communion of brethern and ſiſters in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>I was wholly employed in traveling from place to place, in viſiting the brethern and preaching to the nations, in the German, French, and Dutch language. There were many aſſemblies of brethern all around: in ſome places we had liberty, and where that could not be had publicly, we met ſecretly in particular families; but nevertheleſs grace wrought wonders in convincing ſouls, and leading them to a real deep knowledge of themſelves, and of the damnable eſtate into which all men are plunged by nature, for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:049018_0020_102646DA3B0D4770"/>
none can obtain ſalvation without being firſt damned in themſelves.</p>
            <p>I was much concerned about the ſalvation of ſouls, and their eſtate deeply effected me. I had alſo an acquaintance with a company gentry, who dwelt together near Siegen, ſome of them were married, but only dwelt together as brethern and ſiſters. The ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of Peuchink, the lord of Fleiſhbein; and the court of marſey, who was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in writing books, which are printed in French and German. They led a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired life, filled with love and friendſhip to all the world, without bound, and were very charitable both to friends and enemies.</p>
            <p>Our acquaintance with each other happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a wonderful manner.—One day bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Marſey had a viſion concerning me, when I had arrived in the Palatinate, being about twenty leagues from him. I was drawn by grace, being engaged in proſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf in ſpirit before the preſence of the moſt holy trinity, and having a viſion, I diſcovered a marvellous throne with ſeven foot-ſtools, upon each foot-ſtool were two candleſticks of gold, and upon the throne I ſaw a greater table with ſeven candleſticks of gold placed in a round figure upon it.; then I ſaw many with robes, whiter than
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:049018_0021_102646DCD50BCD58"/>
ſnow, who ſtood up near the candleſticks of gold on each ſide of the foot-ſtools and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the table. Immediately the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks were lighted &amp; chairs were brought that each one might ſet down, then they began to honor the moſt high, ſo that my ſoul was leſt in admiration: then altogether bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their knees, the whole company adored the moſt holy trinity; the viſion vaniſhed in an inſtant, and I came to myſelf.</p>
            <p>Some little time after my brother Marſey ſent a letter to me, writen after this manner.</p>
            <p>My well beloved and dear brother in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, the moſt holy trinity diſcovers many wonders to his children, who are rooted upon the rock of deliverance, and have their eyes of faith fixed upon their ſovereign good; he honors them with his univerſal preſence, and embraces them with the fire of heavenly love; as I have been favoured with the conſolation of ſeeing you in his holy Preſence, I hope you will not deny that communion in the body that we have had together in ſpirit, to the praiſe of the glory of our God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, by the efficacy of his holy ſpirit.—Thus wiſhes and dwells for ever, MARSEY your Brother, united by the grace of God, Amen."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:049018_0022_102646E039AA2D30"/>After I had paſſed about 18 years in Germany, and Holland, I became ſickly of a conſumptive diſorder, occaſioned by being greatly concerned for the ſalvation of ſouls, and much diſquited becauſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part by far walked in the ways of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs, and neglected their converſion, which cauſad me great trouble, and I took it ſo to heart that I believed my happineſs would be incomplete, while one creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained miſerable. Sometimes I was little comforted within by grace inſome manner, but that did not laſt long.</p>
            <p>I dwelt at that time in the country with the brethern near the city of Mons, an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiauth near the border of France, in the emperor's dominions.</p>
            <p>My fever increaſed to ſuch a manner as reduced me almoſt to a ſkeleton, ſo that they were obliged to feed me as an infant. While I lay in this weak ſituation, I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured thro' grace with many viſions: in one it appeared to me that I was conducted into a fine plain, filled with all kinds of fruit trees, agreeable both to the ſight and ſmell, loaded wiih all kinds of the moſt delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fruits, which came to my mouth, and ſatisfied me as with a river of pleaſure: ſame time I beheld the inhabitants, they were
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:049018_0023_102646E1C6919078"/>
beautiful beyond expreſſion, cloathed in garments as white as ſnow. They were filled with humility, and their friendſhip and love was towards all beings: they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted me with the moſt profound reverence and moſt lovely air, ſaying to me with the voice of love, which penetrated thro' me: —"Dear ſoul take courage, be comforted, for in a little time you ſhall ſee the wonders of God, in the reſtoration of all the human ſpecies, without excepcion."</p>
            <p>The weakneſs of my body ſo increaſed that I was certain of dying. I exhorted my breathern to be faithful unto death,! to be ſtedfaſt, immoveable, and to be always turning inward with an enlivening faith, to behold with a fixed attention the Lamb of God, with believing eyes, and to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his eternal word within them, and that then they ſhould receive of the fullneſs of Chriſt's grace upon grace, by which they ſhould be ſtrengthened to abide ſtedfaſt unto the end.</p>
            <p>As I had communion with many aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of brethern, but in particular with that connected with my dear brother Marſey; the brethern there had a viſion of my death and ſent brother Marſey to ſee me.</p>
            <p>When he arrived he found me in the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:049018_0024_102646E4382EF710"/>
agonies of death: he embraced me with a kiſs of peace &amp; love, and ſaluted me in the name of the brethern, who recommended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me, and deſired that I would remember them before the throne of God &amp; the Lamb.</p>
            <p>He then took leave of me and I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf die by degrees, and exactly at midnight I was ſeparated from my body, and ſaw the people occupied in waſhing it, according to the cuſtom of the country. I had a great deſire to be freed from the ſight of my body, and immediately I was drawn up as in a cloud, and beheld great wonders where I paſſed, impoſſible to be written or expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I quickly came to a place which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to my eyes as a level plain, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive that my ſight was not able to reach its limits, filled with all ſorts of delightful fruit trees, agreeable to behold, and which ſent forth ſuch fragrant odours that all the air was filled as with incenſe. In this place I found that I had two guardians, one at my right hand, and the other at my left, exceeding beautiful beyond expreſſion, whoſe boundleſs friendſhip and love ſeemed to penetrate through all my inward parts.— They had wings, and reſembled angels, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhining bodies and white garments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:049018_0025_102646E7ACF58198"/>He that was at my right hand came before me and ſaid—"My dear ſoul and my dear brother, take courage, the moſt holy trinity hath favored you to be comforted with an everlaſting and univerſal conſolation, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to you how, and in what manner he will reſtore all his creatures without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to the praiſe of his glory, and their eternal ſalvation; and you ſhall be witneſs of this, and ſhall rejoice in ſinging and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with all the children of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a reward for the friendſhip and love that you have borne for your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, on whoſe accounts you had many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme griefs, and ſhed many tears, which ſhall be all wiped away from your eyes by God himſelf, who ſhall turn all your griefs to exceeding great gladneſs." Then he took his place at my right hand. After that the ſecond guardian who was at my left hand appeared before me, and ſpoke thus: "My dear ſoul, my dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be of good cheer, thou ſhalt be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and comforted after your griefs, with an univerſal and eternal conſolation—You muſt be prepared to paſs through the ſeven habitations of the damned; be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and prepare yourſelf to feel ſomething of their ſufferings, but be turned inward
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:049018_0026_102646EA27D2C748"/>
deeply, during the time, and you ſhall thereby be preſerved." Then he took his place at my left hand: immediately we were lifted up in the air, and ſometime after we arrived in a dark obſcure place, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weeping, lamentation, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth, could be underſtood. A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place, as being the repoſitory of all ſorts of damned ſouls, under condemnation with the torments, pains, griefs and ſufferings which their ſins had merited, for each one had his works to follow him in death. All iniquities and ſins were reduced to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven claſſes or habitations: there was an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confuſion there, that which one made the other deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The duelliſt, in his fire of anger burns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemy, and they paſs as a fire-brand of hell, one thro' the other.</p>
            <p>You might ſee fornicators, idoliters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, thieves, the covetous, drunkards, ſlanderers, raviſhers, &amp;c. each being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring and being employed with his ſins and iniquities. One might alſo ſee all kind of conditions of men, divines, deputies, controvertors, advocates, judges, lawyers, and in a word one might diſcover whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any of them had done upon earth. In each habitation, I diſcovered that thoſe who
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:049018_0027_102646EBB4EE56B8"/>
were abaſed and that appeared ſorrowful for their ſins, were ſeperated from the others of their ſort that were not yet ſo. I was then conducted into each of the ſeven habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the damned, where I knew one I had been acquainted with upon earth. I diſcovered alſo that he had an habitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the damned, and that they were able to ſee the elect from that habitation where he was, but were not able to paſs through, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a great gulph between them, ſo that all are obliged to dwell where they are.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe my condition. as I had great compaſſion towards the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers. inaſmuch as I had part of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>After we had paſſed thro' we were lifted up ſome diſtance from the place, where we repoſed ourſelves; and a meſſenger was ſent to us, who watered or refreſhed us as with a river of pleaſure, ſaying eat my belove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; drink my friends, to refreſh yourſelves after all your toils and pains; my dear ſoul, and my dear brother, (addreſſing himſelf to me) the moſt holy trinity always works wonders in all times within his poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without exception, and he will order for a time and half a time, that you ſhall
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:049018_0028_102646EE5781F5A8"/>
return into your earthly tabernacle, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and proclaim to the people of the world an univerſal goſpel, that ſhall reſtore in it's time all the human ſpecies without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to it's honor and to the glory of it's moſt holy triniry.—Hallelujah.</p>
            <p>Beholding the meſſenger attentively, I diſcovered that he had a moſt glorious body, dreſſed in a robe whiter than ſnow, filled with the moſt exalted love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, joined with the deepeſt humility, which penetrated me thro' and through, and ſuddenly there was heard a great multitude of the heavenly hoſt, and the meſſenger ſaid, as he flew to join the ſame, with a ſweet voice—"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and who is to come."</p>
            <p>The multitude were innumerable, and there was one who ſurpaſſed in granduer, beauty, brightneſs, majeſty, magnificence and excellence, all the others; even the ſon of the living God, being the brighineſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himſelf purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſins, ſat down at the right hand of the majeſty on high.</p>
            <p>As the multitude approached the glory
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:049018_0029_102646F1C2C47B18"/>
cauſed us to fall down, and to adore in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in truth the ſon of the living God, who marched in the midſt of the multiutude.</p>
            <p>After they had paſſed us, we were lifted up, and cauſed to follow them, for the air carried us the way they went, in a different manner than before. Oh! the wonders of our God! When we arrived in the place of the ſeven habitations of the damned, we could preceive no more darkneſs, obſcurity, pains, torments, lamentations, afflictions, nor gnaſhing of teeth; all were ſtill and quiet, and an agreeable ſweetneſs appeared thro' the whole. Then all the heavenly hoſt ſhouted with one voice and ſaid, "An eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and everlaſting deliverance, an eternal and everlaſting reſtoration, univerſal and everlaſting reſtitution of all things." Then all the multitude adored the moſt holy trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſung the ſong of the Lamb, even the ſong of the triumph for the victory gained by him, in the moſt harmonious manner, and at the end, all the multitude being upon their knees, ſaid with a loud voice, "Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord, God Almighty, juſt and true are thy ways, Oh! King of Saints;" Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they paſſed through the ſeven habitations of the damned, and a multitude were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

from each, and being cloathed in white robes. they followed the heavenly hoſt, praiſing and glorifying the moſt high for their deliverance; one might know them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the others: they all retired by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way than that which they came. The meſſenger then came and conducted us into a moſt wonderful place, and ordered my two guardians to conduct me into five celeſtial manſions, where the Lord's elect abide; and then to reconduct me to dwell yet a time and a half time in my earthly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and to preach to the lower world the univerſal everlaſting goſpel; and that the moſt Holy Trinity hath a pure univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal love towards all the human race, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, and to each in particular; then turning himſelf towards me he ſaid, my dear ſuol thou ſhalt be favored of the moſt Holy Trinity, to be conducted by thy guardians, who ſhall never leave thee: when thou ſhalt have need of their counſel; thou needeſt but to call them; and they ſhall be day and night preſent at thy ſervice; they ſhall conduct thee into five of the heavenly manſions at this time, where thou ſhalt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in a certain degree, of the celeſtial glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as much as thy ſpirit ſhall be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as not being yet ſanctified and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:049018_0031_102646F5CFA007D0"/>
ſufficiently, and then thou ſhall be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into thine earthly tabernacle, for a time and half a time, and ſhall preach to the lower world the univerſal everlaſting goſpel, and that the moſt Holy Trinity hath a pure univerſal love towards all the human race without exception, and towards each one in particular.</p>
            <p>The fountain of grace bleſs and preſerve thee, and cauſe his face to ſhine upon and in thee. and enlighten thine underſtanding both in time &amp; in eternity.—Amen. Our knees bending of their own accord, he laid his hand upon my head, and bleſſed me, and immediately took wing, and ſwiftly fled away-</p>
            <p>After that my guardians conducted me into five celeſtial habitations, where I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered many wonders. Some had greater brightneſs, glory, and majeſty than others, and as the places were, ſo were the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; ſome were clothed in garments whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſnow; others had tranſparent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and others again had white bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling chryſtal. It is impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe things. They were moved by boundleſs burning love, riſing up, and then plunging themſelves into the deepeſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: all their motions were penetrating,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:049018_0032_102646F9539778F0"/>
being filled with love and friendſhip.— their actions and manners are ſtrengthened and animated with brightneſs, being filled with light as with the rays of the ſun; it was the fire of heavenly love, which by inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their hearts, cauſes them all to burn in the ſame fire, and to be animated by the ſame ſpirit. They have no need of any way of ſpeaking there, but the language and motions of eternal and univerſal love without words for their actions, their motions ſpeak more than all words. I was then conducted into five habitations of the elect. At the firſt a great multitude came before us with ſongs to the honor and glory of the moſt high, and of the victory gained over the damned. They received us with triumph, great zeal, love and friendſhip, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting us with profound humility, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting us into a large room: there was a great table covered and furniſhed with all ſorts of fruit, not only pleaſant to behold but alſo exceeding delicious to the taſte.</p>
            <p>In the mean while we were taking our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, the celeſtial multitudes formed ſongs, and ſung pſalms of praiſe and thankſgiving to the moſt holy trinity. After that we were conducted into all the five celeſtial ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, (that I was to ſee) where I ſaw
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:049018_0033_102646FBC95DB480"/>
many wonders, impoſſible to deſcribe. Firſt many thrones lifted up of inexpreſſible beauty and magnificence; upon one of theſe thrones I beheld the Royal High Prieſt, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with exceeding great brightneſs, &amp; clothed in moſt excellent majeſty, being employed in kind interceſſion before his father, for all the human ſpecies, pleading the ſufficiency of his blood-ſheding to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſanctify a thouſand ſuch worlds as ours. All the elect, with the heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, joined their interceſſion with that of their Royal High Prieſt, the only chief king, being reconcilers, ſaviors, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores in the ſame ſpirit.—This mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion appeared like incence aſcending on high into the ſanctuary of the Lord. Over againſt the throne I diſcovered Adam, with Eve, rejoicing in the only mediator between God and men, and adoring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt Holy Trinity for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their children out of the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and eternal condemnation into which their ſin and fall had brought them, and upon their bended knees adoring the only mediator for the interceſſion he makes in behalf of mankind. Alſo I beheld a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſpirits flying and enflamed with the fire of heavenly love, while we adored,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:049018_0034_102646FE33531578"/>
humbled in nothingneſs, rendering our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious homage to the moſt high for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and the deliverance of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Then my guardian, who was at my right hand, coming before me, ſaid thus, "Dear ſoul, my dear brother, do you ſee theſe ſpirtis flying, who came in great multitudes, and who are vaniſhed in the ſpirit of love, and gratitude, humbled and ſelf-annihilated as it were, adoring before the throne of grace, and praying to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior for the interceſſions he hath made for them. Theſe are lately delivered from the infernal priſons; it is for them that the tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt hath been ſhed even to the laſt drop, notwithſtanding they had dwelt a long time ſhut up in the place of the damned, under the power of the ſecond death, and have paſſed thro' many agonies, pains and tribulations.—Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I perceived that Adam and Eve ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and Adam ſpoke to me after this manner:—"My dear brother, rejoice with univerſal and eternal joy, as you are favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the heavenly viſions! it is in this manner that our adorable Royal High Prieſt, Mediator, and interceſſor, ſhall reſtore all my deſcendents to the glory of our God, and their eternal and univerſal ſalvation for
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:049018_0035_102646FFC1070408"/>
the kingdom of eternal love hath power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to draw all mankind out of their bondage, and to exclaim and ſay; O death, where is thy ſting, &amp;c. But my dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this love of our God in Jeſus Chriſt, by the power of his holy ſpirit, ſhall not only gain the victory over all the human ſpecies, but alſo ſurmount or over flow the kingdom of Satan, entirely, with all the principalities of the fallen angels' and ſhall bring them back in their firſt glory, which they have had in the begining. I will make all things new ſaid the Lord of Hoſts, and the end ſhall return into its begining O my Lord and my God, what greart wonders haſt thou cauſed to paſs before mine eyes! who am I O my God, duſt and aſhes, an ungreatful and rebellious creature. I ſhould not dare to lift mine eyes towards the heavens if the blood of Jeſus Chriſt thy ſon did not plead for me. My ſoul rejoices and is glad, ſhe ſhouts for joy: O my God, whom I adore, love and reſpect: before whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be without ceaſing, ſelf-annihilated at thy feet. O my God and my Love, the ſeraphims and cherubims burning with the fire of thy heavenly love, adore and honor thee: give me thy grace alſo, O my God, that I may be conſumed before thee, while

I ſing the majeſty, glory, and the memory of God, who hath created and redeemed me. I would praiſe him inceſſantly, not in ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or figure, but in reality and truth. I would continue devoted to thee, and always be ſwollowed up in the ocean of love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wiſh to leave it.</p>
            <p>Being in this manner conducted into five celeſtial habitations, I diſcovered many my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, ſaw many miracles, and beheld the wonders of the moſt Holy Trinity among the children, the elect, the heavenly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and perceiving how ſome ſurpaſſed others in brightneſs, light, ſplendor, and majeſty, in friendſhip, love, humiliation and ſelf-abaſement, concerning of which things my tongue is too feeble to ſpeak, and my pen to write. I adore the marvellous ways of my God, with all the happy ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Many thrones, places, edifices, temples, and buildings were erected in all parts, with fruit trees intermixed, rivers of pleaſure gliding along thro' the celeſtial land, which appeared like a garden of heaven, even the paradiſe of God. It is the court of King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, which the eye hath not ſeen nor the ear heard, and which the hearts of men have not received; it is
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:049018_0037_10264703C5746490"/>
the celeſtial globe where the New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem or mount Sion is placed' where the boſom of Abraham is; where the ſufferers who came out of their tribulations are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and rejoice, forgeting all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; being come out of their purifications, they are made to rejoice in Sion: O mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent globe! O thou city of the great God! ſtately city of this place! where ſhall a mortal find convenient phraſes to liſp out a little of thy glory and ſplendor? it is the glory and magnificence of the moſt holy trinity, where God is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf in his pomp and beauty. The bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed angels there have their employment in ſerving God; they compoſe the court of the Great King; O my God I am not able to expreſs that which penetrates me, of the granduer, magnificence, ſpendor, pomp, and majeſty of thy dwellings, and of the inhabitants in thoſe tranſparent places. hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah and victory for ever.—AMEN.</p>
            <p>Then my guardians took me up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducted me to the houſe from whence I came, where I perceived the people aſſem,+bled, and diſcovering my body in the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, I was re-united with the ſame, and found myſelf lodged within my earthly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and coming to myſelf, I knew

my dear brother Marſey, and many others, who gave me an account of my being 25 hours in the coffin, and 17 hour before they put me in the coffin, which altogether made 42 hours: to me they ſeemed as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years; begining then to preach the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal goſpel, I was preſently put into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. but ſoon ſet at liberty again. I viſited all my brethern, preached the goſpel and taking leave of them all, becauſe that my God and Sovereign Good called me to go into America and preach the goſpel there, I took my departure for the ſame in the 38th year of my age, and it is 41 years ſince I firſt arrived here. The 28th of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly next, 1782, I ſhall be 79 years of age, bleſſed be the name of the Lord for ever.</p>
