         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="1">1. HE magnifies his <hi>Office</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> It was a great Honour and ſpecial Dignity in the Kingdom of Chriſt and of Grace. With this the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> begins, <q>I Paul, the Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt for you Gentiles! If ye have heard of the Diſpenſation of the Grace of God, which is given me to you ward.</q> The Goſpel of the <hi>Uncircumciſion</hi> was given to <hi>Paul,</hi> as that of the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was unto <hi>Peter.</hi> Not but that they both preached occaſionally to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> but <hi>Peter's</hi> Miſſion was more eſpecially to the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003520_0004_0FF855D145F2F6E8"/>One, and <hi>Paul's</hi> to the Other. When the LORD appeared to him in the Light from Heaven on the Way, he then declar'd him to be <hi>a choſen Veſſel to bear his Name before the Gentiles.</hi> This was his <hi>Mitre</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Crown, this the mighty <hi>See</hi> into which he was choſen. 1 Tim. ii. 7. <hi>I am ordained a Teacher of the Gentiles in Faith and Verity.</hi> It is ſtrange that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould not magnify their <hi>own</hi> Apoſtle; that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ſhould give the <hi>Primacy</hi> to <hi>Peter.</hi> In this <hi>Paul</hi> came not a whit behind the very <hi>Chief</hi> of the Apoſtles, yet he was <hi>Metropolitan of the Gentiles,</hi> but not <hi>of Man,</hi> neither <hi>by Man,</hi> but by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father,</hi> Gal. i. 1.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Gentiles</hi> were alike <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Saviour, as the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Jews indeed call'd them <hi>uncircumciſed and unclean,</hi> and they had loſt the Knowledge of God, and were defiled with abominable Idolatries and Impurities. Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> had ſpoken abundantly of their Converſion; that CHRIST ſhould be <hi>a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Gentiles</hi> were vaſtly <hi>more</hi> for Numbers, Power, Riches, Literature, worldly Name and Glory, than the <hi>few and feeble Jews</hi> were. They were mighty Nations, potent Kingdoms, populous Cities and vaſt Empires; while <hi>Judea</hi> was ſunk into a tributary Province, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Kingdom on proud <hi>Rome.</hi> The Gentiles were <hi>Rome, Athens, Corinth</hi> and the <hi>Schools of Greece,</hi> who then divided the Learning of the World among them. To convert <hi>Theſe</hi> to the Faith of Chriſt was <hi>Paul</hi> called and ſent from Heaven, and well might he ſay, — <hi>That to me this Grace is given!</hi> Wherefore</p>
            <p n="2">2. HE lays <hi>Himſelf very low,</hi> "To me, who am <hi>leſs than the leaſt</hi> of all Saints is this Grace given, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould preach among the Gentiles &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <q>HERE is a double <hi>Diminutive,</hi> ſays One; He was as little as <hi>could be</hi> in his own Eyes, and therefore writes himſelf ſo little as could <hi>not</hi> be; <hi>leſs than the leaſt.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Longe minimus;</hi> by far the leaſt, <hi>Minimiſſimo;</hi> He was a <hi>Minim,</hi> an Animalcule in his own Eyes, after all that Heaven had done to aggrandize him. So <hi>before Honour
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003520_0005_0FF855D2C9EC3110"/>is Humility,</hi> and true Humility increaſes with Worth and Excellency, and the Honours of Providence. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> always look'd back on what he <hi>had been</hi> before his Calling into the Apoſtleſhip of Chriſt: 1 Cor. xv. 9. <hi>I am not meet to be called an Apoſtle becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. <hi>Who was before a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a Perſecutor and Injurious; but I obtained Mercy.</hi> He therefore ſpeaks <hi>highly</hi> of himſelf in the Text, where he calls himſelf the <hi>leaſt of Saints;</hi> if compar'd with what he ſays elſewhere, "<hi>I am the chief of Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET in the <hi>Text,</hi> 1. He acknowledges himſelf thro' Grace among the <hi>Saints.</hi> And 2. Moſt <hi>highly</hi> honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dignified among them: 1. In his <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 2. In his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Riches</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>Now in all this the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is a ſhining <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> and <hi>Monitor</hi> to all of us, both Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; 1. That we ſhould be <hi>Saints.</hi> 2. Yet always in our own Eyes the <hi>leaſt</hi> of them, and <hi>leſs</hi> than the leaſt. And 3. That we ſhould be exceeding <hi>affected</hi> with the ſingular <hi>Grace</hi> of God to us, that <hi>we</hi> ſhould be called into his Kingdom, whether to <hi>preach</hi> the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt to others, or to have the ſame <hi>preached</hi> to us.</p>

I.

            <p>MINISTERS ſhould be <hi>holy Men of God,</hi> like the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> in the Spirit of <hi>Elias;</hi> and like <hi>Aaron the Saint of the Lord,</hi> on the Front of whoſe <hi>Mitre</hi> was written, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> pray'd for the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Tribe, and for the Houſe of his <hi>Brother</hi> choſen to the Prieſthood; to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry at the Sanctuary, and to teach <hi>Jacob</hi> God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Laws; "LORD, ſaid he, <hi>let thy Urim be with thy Holy Ones.</hi> Their <hi>Separation</hi> to holy Miniſtrations put the Name of <hi>Sanctity</hi> and Holineſs upon them, was a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of it and ſtrong <hi>Obligation</hi> to it. It could not indeed <hi>make</hi> them holy in Heart and Life, but it was a <hi>Bond</hi> upon their Soul. As <hi>Aaron</hi> was told in the Preſence of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on a ſolemn Day and upon a moſt awful Diſpenſation; Lev. v. 3. <hi>I will be ſanctified in Them that draw nigh Me.</hi>

               <hi>GOD</hi> is Holy, infinitely <hi>holy.</hi> A <hi>Man</hi> in ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, ſolemnly devoted to Him and imployed for Him, to ſerve in his Houſe and Worſhip, and to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter under his Grace to the Sanctification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls; is laid under the higheſt Engagements to be Himſelf holy.

            </p>
            <p>THE Grace and Favour in the preached Goſpel is therefore the <hi>ſame</hi> to People and to Miniſters.

            <p>THUS Miniſters and People are <hi>One</hi> in the Grace of the preached Goſpel.

LET it be therefore our earneſt Care and Prayer that the Word preached be <hi>ſavingly profitable</hi> to our Souls; that we receive that <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> which the Lord means us from his preached Goſpel.

He would have us come to the Knowledge of the Truth <hi>and be ſaved.</hi> He ſends his <hi>Miniſters</hi> now, as He will his <hi>Angels</hi> hereafter, to <hi>gather in his Elect</hi> from the four Quarters of the Earth. The <hi>Election</hi> will receive his Grace, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> his Mercy, while the reſt are <hi>blinded;</hi> blindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it.

            <p>READ then <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to us in his preached Goſpel, and let it animate both Miniſters and People, as it inſpired holy <hi>Paul; "If by any Means I may ſave ſome!
