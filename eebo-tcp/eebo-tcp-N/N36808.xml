            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SERAPHINA: A NOVEL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SERAPHINA, born at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of noble and wealthy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, was the ſingle object of their affection. To a beautiful perſon ſhe added a cultivated underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that eaſy gaiety that is ſo rare an accompliſhment, while her mind diſplayed a firmneſs much ſuperior to what could have been expected at her age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:048183_0005_1025002584CA68F0"/>
When ten years old ſhe loſt her mother, and when twelve managed the affairs of her father's houſe. At ſeventeen her heart, become now mature, and warmed by the ardent climate in which ſhe was born, felt that void, that ſecret liſtleſsneſs which agitates ſouls of ſenſibility. She diſdained every common character, and ſought a heart ſhe had not yet found. She had heard much in praiſe of Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and eagerly wiſhed to viſit that country; and as her father had a conſiderable eſtate there, ſhe eaſily perſuaded him to accompany her
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:048183_0006_10250028252EB8F8"/>
thither; they accordingly ſet ſail for Meſſina.</p>
            <p>On their arrival in this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful country, the Elyſium of Italy, Seraphina was enchanted. The Sicilian ladies are fair, but the fair Florentine ſurpaſſed them all in beauty. A crowd of youths of the moſt noble families thronged around her; all wiſhed to pleaſe, ſome ſought her hand, but no one touched the heart of Seraphina: this triumph was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a Frenchman. Sicily about that time began to attract the attention of Europe. This
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:048183_0007_1025002BA3153768"/>
country, ſo rich and fertile, would have become a deſert under the iron yoke of Spain, had not the people reſolved to break it. The Sicilians called in the aid of France to aſſert their rights, and France ſent them troops, at the head of which was M. Vivonne, a man of diſtinguiſhed abilities and merit.</p>
            <p>This general was the brother of the famous Madame de Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, and in elegance of perſon and accompliſhed manners was the counterpart of his beauteous ſiſter. She was the miſtreſs of the king, and his favorite. Her influence had raiſed him to the rank of a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:048183_0008_1025002D343616C0"/>
marſhal of France, an honour of which his perſonal merit, valour, and abilities, rendered him worthy. Victorious alike in war and lovd, his only fault was derived from the manners of his nation. This was inconſtancy. He too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently violated the vows he ſwore to credulous beauties.</p>
            <p>He made his entrance into Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina in the character of viceroy, and the people received him with acclamations, as their long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deliverer. The city on this occaſion diſplayed all its magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. A band of martial muſic
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:048183_0009_10250030B87650B0"/>
opened the proceſſion; a ſplendid train of horſemen followed. Next came the magiſtrates of the city in their robes of ceremony, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the ſtate coaches, the pages, and guards, richly dreſſed in the livery of the viceroy; laſt came Vivonne himſelf, on a ſuperb courſer, and magnificently habited. He diſplayed the moſt exalted dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, mixed with complacence, the nobleſt, yet moſt condeſcending affability. Never did a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and perfect man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf to the eyes of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed multitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:048183_0010_1025003343519818"/>
All the balconies were filled with Meſſinian ladies elegantly dreſſed. The eyes of Vivonne were directed to them: he ſaluted them according to the degree of their beauty, their rank, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they made upon him. When he came before the balcony of Seraphina, he gazed a long time upon her. She was dreſſed in a white robe, and her hair neatly and elegantly adorned. In the midſt of a ſcore of beauties ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with jewels ſhe eclipſed them all; and Vivonne drew in the bridle of his horſe, that he might admire her for a longer ſpace.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:048183_0011_10250035212A3FE8"/>
The moſt inconſtant lover in the world was wounded, and wounded forever. Seraphina perceived it. The glances of Vivonne penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſoul, and to him ſhe ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her heart.</p>
            <p>Abſorbed in admiration and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhe was incapable of liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the voice of reaſon. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonne was notorious for his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: but love, which ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully triumphs in the warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of Italy, prevented every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. On the next day Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonne began a round of viſits to the ladies of Meſſina, and it will
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:048183_0012_10250037F2FF1978"/>
not be imagined that Seraphina was forgotten. His converſation with theſe ladies turned on news from the court, the eulogium of the king his maſter and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and agreeable flatteries. But before Seraphina he was mute, no gallant compliments, no deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the brilliant feſtivals of Paris, he addreſſed her only by tender, but expreſſive glances.</p>
            <p>But the eloquence of French gallantry would have had little effect on the fair Florentine. She had been accuſtomed to praiſes; and what more flattering praiſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:048183_0013_1025003B6EE0B3B0"/>
could ſhe receive than that which the eyes of Vivonne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſo well? Hope ſucceeded to the diſquiet ſhe had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and certain of being belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe abandoned herſelf without reſerve to the ſweet pleaſure of loving.</p>
            <p>Vivonne gave ſplendid enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments to all the nobility of Meſſina. Seraphina, who was preſent at them all, conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to dance; contented with the company and converſation of her lover, ſhe drank deep draughts of the nectar of love, One day,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:048183_0014_1025003D38410040"/>
at a particular ball, Vivonne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with a timid air and offered her his hand. A kind of ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſhot through the veins of Saraphina: ſhe roſe, her knees trembled under her; without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſpeak, ſhe made an obeiſance, tottered, found herſelf indiſpoſed, and immediately retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The next day Vivonne paid her a viſit to enquire concerning her health. He found her pale, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, her eyes caſt down, and with difficulty reſtraining her ſighs, What Frenchman, as well as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonne
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:048183_0015_10250040B426F7A8"/>
would not immediately have divined the cauſe of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady! He makes with tranſport a confeſſion of his paſſion, he preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and is liſtened to. Seraphina, all emotion, mutters a few words, and an ardent kiſs ſeals their union.</p>
            <p>Yes, Vivonne, I love you, ſaid Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphina, when ſhe had recovered her voice—I love you and glory in it. Doubtleſs in your country, women are more reſerved and cold, but in France there is no Mount Etna. Your diſtinguiſhed qualities, your virtues, all I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in you, and the love I read in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:048183_0016_1025004249012530"/>
your eyes, attach me to you with the fondeſt paſſion: be for ever the choſen object of my heart and the diſpoſer of my deſtiny.</p>
            <p>Vivonne, in reply, ſwore to her an eternal conſtancy; but this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſeldom the portion of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His heart, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained devoted to her longer than he himſelf could have expected. His time was divided between war and love. But the vivacity of his paſſion at length diminiſhed, and envious perſons, ſucceeded in their attempts to diſturb the happineſs of Seraphina. For who is the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:048183_0017_10250044CF975540"/>
warrior, or who the favourite of a prince, who ſuffers not by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of envy? It was whiſpered at Verſailles that Vivonne ſuffered himſelf to be entirely abſorbed by a blind paſſion, while the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers were in arms and the brave Ruyter under ſail for Sicily. The glory of the French arms, it was ſaid, could no otherwiſe be maintained, nor the Dutch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from an eaſy victory, but by appointing another commander.</p>
            <p>Madame Monteſpan with great difficulty prevented theſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs from reaching the ears of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:048183_0018_10250047A17308B8"/>
king. She haſtened to write to her brother, and inſiſted in the moſt preſſing terms on his renouncing a paſſion ſo prejudicial to his glory and his fortune. Vivonne, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued at the reproaches of his ſiſter, replied like a man of wit and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, that ſhe herſelf could not but know the weight of the chains of Cupid and his power: that tho' devoted to the object of his love, he had never neglected the ſervice of his king, nor had ever been, nor ever would be, on that account, wanting in the juſt diſcharge of his duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:048183_0019_1025004A811ED5B0"/>
An opportunity to prove the truth of this aſſertion ſoon preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf. The Spaniards had juſt concluded an alliance with the States General of Holland, of whom they had ſo long been the enemies, and whom they had treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as rebels. They demanded ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours againſt France, and it was reſolved to ſend a fleet to Sicily. This fleet was not numerous, but its ſtrength was deemed ſufficient, becauſe it was to be commanded by the celebrated Ruyter, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and experienced man, who from the low ſtation of a common ſeaman, had arrived at the rank of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:048183_0020_1025004D0EA81EF8"/>
admiral, and to whom the king of Spain had offered the title of duke; an honour which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>The firſt commander by ſea of the age in which he lived, whom few have equalled and none ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed; Ruyter, more than once the deliverer of his country, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed by the Engliſh, though their enemy, and dreaded by all the maritime powers of Europe, now advanced in years, but ſtill poſſeſſing all the fire and activity of youth, appeared at the head of the fleet of the United Provinces in the Mediterranean.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:048183_0021_102500508FACC588"/>
Vivonne exulted with joy that he was to enter the liſts with ſuch a rival and tore himſelf from the arms of Seraphina, for he had leſs difficulty to leave her than ſhe to part with him. He went on board the fleet, commanded by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Duqueſne. The French ſeamen impatiently demanded the battle with ſhouts of joy, while the Dutch admiral calmly prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it with a cool unruffled courage. In the mean time Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina waited with anxiety the iſſue of a battle which muſt decide, whether patriotiſm ſhould triumph or yield before its formidable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:048183_0022_102500521EAA5F50"/>
Seraphina, little mindful of the event of the war, thought only of her lover; inſtead of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe wiſhed him to poſſeſs fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to her; her farewell was cold and diſtruſtful, and nothing could conſole this fond beauty, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the indifference of Vivonne as the greateſt of miſfortunes.</p>
            <p>On a ſudden a report was ſpread through Meſſina, that the paſſion of Vivonne was known at the court of Verſailles and that the proud Monteſpan had required of her brother the ſacrifice of his love, and that Vivonne had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:048183_0023_10250054E772B970"/>
it. Seraphina, tranſported with anger and reſentment, wrote thus to the marſhal: "Why have you never ſpoken to me of your haughty ſiſter? Is it true that ſhe wiſhes to break the tender connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion between us? Conceal nothing from me. Does ſhe not reign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rival in the heart of your maſter and ſovereign? Yet would I not change my fortune for her's, while I retain your love. How have you received the command ſhe has dared to impoſe on you? Can you ſtill conſider her as your ſiſter, after the inſult of which ſhe has been guilty? Your anſwer
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:048183_0024_102500576E318BD8"/>
will either reſtore me to life or terminate it in deſpair."</p>
            <p>Vivonne, whoſe amorous ardour was now cooled, replied to her in ſoothing and vague terms, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her of the continuance of his love but he no longer felt the ſame paſſion as before): Seraphina was not to be deceived. All is over, exclaimed ſhe: the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man loves me no longer; but I will once more read his heart; and immediately aſſuming the diſguiſe of a man's habit, ſhe took a boat, and cauſed herſelf to be carried on board the admiral's ſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:048183_0025_1025005AEC5AC068"/>
The aſtoniſhment of Vivonne can ſcarcely be conceived when he ſaw a young man abruptly entering His cabin, and recognized Seraphina. I come ſaid ſhe, to require an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to my letter; that you ſent me not being ſatisfactory; but while the marſhal endeavoured to pacify her with ſome incoherent excuſes. Seraphina perceived a beautiful young girl who retired at her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. She inſtantly conjectured ſhe was her rival, for lightening is not more rapid than the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of jealous love; Vivonne had for ſome time ceaſed to-love her, another object had doubtleſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:048183_0026_1025005C83E5BDE0"/>
engroſſed his attention, and this beauteous and fatal object ſhe had ſeen. Seraphina was ſilent, but her looks loudly ſpoke her mind: ſhe made a ſign to her conductor, haſtily left the ſhip, and cauſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be carried back to Meſſina.</p>
            <p>She returned to that city with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word; a dreadful tempeſt heaved in her boſom, and gave birth to an extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. She knew that Ruyter lay at anchor before Agetta, and hiring a ſmall veſſel, ſhe cauſed herſelf to be conveyed to the Dutch fleet and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:048183_0027_1025005F5B6B0330"/>
carried on board the admiral's ſhip. Having procured an audience of him:—Are not you, ſaid ſhe, the invincible Ruyter?—I am Ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, anſwered he coolly; the title you give me belongs not to me, and it would be ridiculous pride ſhould I accept it.—You have however come hitherto vanquiſh the French—That is my higheſt ambition, my moſt ardent wiſh, and I will venture to declare, I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of ſucceſs.—Well then, illuſtrious commander, I come to offer you the means; for they are in my power.—In your power, madam? I cannot gueſs your
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:048183_0028_10250062D8AAA2E0"/>
meaning!—You know the mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal de Vivonne?—I have but little knowledge of him, madam, at preſent, but I have a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know him; I ſaw him once at the Hague, he appeared to me a brave man. I believe he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes as much merit as his ſiſter does beauty.—Who? Madame Monteſpan! Ah! I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the name of that woman.—Whence, madam, this averſion? But if you pleaſe we will mention her no more; for her brother I have the higheſt eſteem. The victory I hope to obtain will double my fame, and haſten the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:048183_0029_10250064679DB558"/>
time of our better acquaintance. Ah! would to heaven I had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er known him, he is the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, but, at the ſame time, the moſt perfidious of men.—I have heard that he poſſeſſes the moſt agreeable good qualities, but in what is your accuſation of perfidy founded? His courage and prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, I have frequently heard praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—And that praiſe he deſerves; in his attachment to his country and his king he has ever been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Ah! that he had been ſo in love: but he ſports with the moſt ſacred oaths, and is the deceiver of our ſex, Oh, did you know all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:048183_0030_10250066F81B20F0"/>
the crimes of this kind of which he has been guilty!—Madam, I underſtand you but imperfectly; I am indeed but little acquainted with the manners and character of your ſex. I have travelled much, and have every where found that what is called good or bad fortune varies according to the ideas of mankind. In Holland, my native country, our manners are very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; our women devote themſelves to domeſtic cares, they nurſe and educate their children, and are inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly employed in promoting the happineſs of their families. When we leave them, they moderate their
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:048183_0031_10250069B5F4DDC0"/>
regret, for they know we are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſervice of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—I believe you, brave hero, and I perceive well that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand me, if you know no other women than thoſe you have deſcribed to me. How ſhall I find words to explain to you what I ſuffer? I loved Vivonne, I was beloved by him; I exiſted only in that ungrateful man, and not in myſelf. The moſt inſulting infidelity has been my reward. I perceived it; I flew to him, on board his ſhip. Heavens! what did I there ſee! a rival, a beauty I confeſs; but both ſhall die.—
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:048183_0032_1025006D36CC5200"/>
Madam I perceive your heart is rent by a dreadful deſpair. What can have given birth to, or what have nouriſhed, ſo violent a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I know not. But what can I do for you?—Revenge me—Revenge, madam, is a paſſion abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unknown to me.—But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love is not ſo; with that you are doubtleſs acquainted.—No; I know the love of my duty, and the love of my country, but that love which is the offſpring of effeminacy and indolence, the fruit of a diſordered imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, has never reigned in
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:048183_0033_1025006ECC5B5868"/>
my heart. The place which that love muſt have occupied has long ſince been filled.—But are you not married?—I am for the third time.—How! three wives, and unacquainted with love!—My two former have been well ſatisfied with me; the third yet lives, and tells me the ſame. I have done for them all that I could do to render their lives agreeable. When I was at home, we never diſagreed: when abſent, I took care that they ſhould want for nothing. As often as I returned I ſaw and embraced them with
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:048183_0034_1025007155227A08"/>
pleaſure, but without ſuperfluous tranſports. I left them without immoderate regret; and felt only the pain excited by their tears, for I did not love to ſee them weep.—How! have you never felt that ſevere pain, that inexpreſſible pang, with which the laſt kiſs is given to adored lips, when it is neceſſary to tear ourſelves from an embrace to which we return an hundred times?—No, my duty commanded me to depart, and I went calmly, and without weakneſs.—And your children?—I have ſeveral: I leave the daughters with their mother,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:048183_0035_102500741415D498"/>
to conſole her in my abſence: the boys, when of ſufficient age, I take with me, to ſhew them in what manner they may riſe from the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a common ſailor to the rank of admiral. I have two at preſent on board, whom I hope ſoon to bring acquainted with your mareſchal.—That, fir, is to hope too much; the mareſchal is not ſo eaſy to conquer.—So much the better, I ſhall obtain the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſet a higher value on my victory.—Will you then refuſe the means I offer you to inſure this victory?—I know not yet what they are.—Behold this dagger.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:048183_0036_10250077958BEA38"/>
My careſſes were devoted to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonne while he was true to me; but this he deſerves ſince he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unfaithful. He ſhall die; I ſhould not have waited ſo long but that I am determined not to take my revenge by halves. I have wiſhed to inform you of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that you might aſſiſt me in it: for it is not ſufficient for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that Vivonne ſhould die: I wiſh alſo to deprive him of his glory, and compel that nation which delights to deceive us to fly before their enemies. Will you aſſiſt me in this project? I wait
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:048183_0037_1025007926535EF0"/>
your conſent. Brave Ruyter, have your fleet in readineſs, ſail towards Meſſina; I will precede you with my poignard in my hand. You ſhall ſoon be informed of the death of Vivonne; attack then with all your force, and the fleet of France, panic ſtruck, ſhall not even think of defence.—And can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, madam, that I can aſſiſt you in ſuch a deſign? I hope I ſhall never entertain ſuch a thought. I have never yet departed from the principles of juſtice in war, nor has the leaſt treachery polluted my conſcience. I have cultivated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity not leſs than courage; and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:048183_0038_1025007BAD5525F8"/>
I would die a thouſand times rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than change my conduct. I have ſailed on every ſea, fought againſt almoſt all the nations of Europe, and every where have I conducted myſelf ſo as to acquire eſteem. Firm againſt the Engliſh, haughty towards the Spaniards, formerly our enemies but now our allies; frank and open to the French, generous to the Swedes, when I defended the cauſe of the king of Denmark; every where I have been victorious, and every where honoured with ſome eſteem: even when engaged againſt the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:048183_0039_1025007E68E87920"/>
pirates of Algiers and Salle, I have not forgotten the rights of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. Such is my principles; the uſe of the poignard is unknown in Holland. Honour and our duty have placed arms in our hands; and, according to the example of our anceſtors, aſſaſſination will ever be a crime unknown to us.—Is this then your ultimate reſolution?—It is, madam, and ſuffer me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to renounce a project which makes my heart ſhudder, after it has braved a thouſand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. How could ſo ferocious a deſign have taken birth in the heart of a woman! Gentleneſs is the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:048183_0040_10250080F36011B0"/>
moſt powerful charm of your ſex: be calm: your ſoul is ſuſceptible of great emotions and great cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; give them a proper direction and renounce all ideas of ſo dark a revenge.—I had been told, replied Seraphina, that in the Belgie ſeas nature only produced half-formed ſketches of beings, and that the ſouls of their inhabitants were cold and frozen. Of ſuch phlegm I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had no idea. Farewell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible man, who are terrified at the idea of a poignard, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is that of a monk, and who pleadeſt the cauſe of the baſe man
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:048183_0041_10250083A0C89018"/>
who has made me ſuffer a thouſand deaths. Ah! I ſee it too plainly, all men combine together to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their own perfidy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our ſex. But I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge myſelf. Thus ſaying ſhe departed, and, with deſpair in her heart, her hair diſhevelled, and a mortal paleneſs in her counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance returned haſtily to Meſſina.</p>
            <p>A profound inſenſibility ſeemed to have taken place of all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that had agitated her; even the report of an approaching bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle between the two fleets made no impreſſion on her. She wiſhed
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:048183_0042_102500862806E708"/>
the defeat of Vivonne, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting herſelf for the cold Ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Soon after, the expected en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement enſued. The fleet of Duqueſne was the ſtrongeſt, and he had the greateſt number of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but the example of Ruyter effected wonders. His men fought with deſperation, and ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be fighting for their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all that was dear to them, than for the advantage of allies who had been ſo lately their bitterest enemies. At length the French gave way, two of their ſhips were ſunk, and Meſſina was ſeized with conſternation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:048183_0043_10250088AF973658"/>
At this news Seraphina felt a kind of joy. He flies, then, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſhe, the traitor flies: his pride is at length humbled. But this defeat did not ſatiſfy her. A ſhort time after, the French fleet, reinforced with ſhips, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ammunition, prepared for a ſecond engagement. The ſhips of Ruy<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, wanting the ſame ſuccours, and the Spaniſh ſhips, ill-built, ill-<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and worſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the encounter. Notwithſtanding, however, the natural pride of the nation, Ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone was ſufficient to counter-balance this fear and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:048183_0044_1025008B3AF2ED58"/>
But no human bravery can render its poſſeſſor invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. In the midſt of the fire, in the heat of the action, in the moſt dreadful moment, when victory ſeemed ready to decide in favour of the veteran and intrepid admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, he fell by a cannon ball, and with his fall ended the ſucceſs of that memorable day. The battle was not deciſive; but the death of Ruyter, who expired the next day of his wounds, completed the defeat. The allies were finally vanquiſhed in a third battle, and Duqueſne and Vivonne returned triumphant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:048183_0045_1025008EBB11F6A8"/>
The victory drew Seraphina from the lethargy in which ſhe ſeemed plunged: her heart more than once had offered up ſecret and involuntary, vows for her lover, while her offended pride required his deſtruction. Now he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, crowned with glory, and all the inhabitants of Meſſina haſtened to meet him with ſhouts of joy. Young maidens, from the balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, threw flowers on his head; and he paſſed through the city in triumph, appearing more amiable than ever. This ſcene which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Seraphina of the day on
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:048183_0046_1025009053384DA8"/>
which ſhe firſt beheld him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted her diſtraction.</p>
            <p>She ran to the great ſquare of Maſſina: there ſhe heard the ſongs of the people in honor of the hero, while ſome propoſed to erect a ſtatue to him. At theſe words a ſarcaſtic ſmile appeared on her lips, ſhe raiſed her voice, and ſpoke thus to the aſſembled Sicilians:</p>
            <p>Blind people! what can have given birth to this general enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm in behalf of the French? How long, and from what cauſe, has the antipathy you formerly
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:048183_0047_1025009325C03AF8"/>
entertained againſt that nation ceaſed? How differently did our forefathers think! A hatred to the French, and the ſtory of the Sicil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian widows, were the firſt ideas they tranſmitted to us. Have you forgotten, that this inconſtant and cruel nation has ſhed the moſt pure and illuſtrious blood? They ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither rank, youth, nor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. There is no people on the earth ſo dangerous to us as this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and perfidious nation, whoſe pleaſing manners are a dangerous charm, and who, to ſatiſfy their voluptuouſneſs, pollute the moſt reſpectable bonds, and to whom
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:048183_0048_10250096A8297A98"/>
the moſt ſacred promiſes have never been a reſtraint.</p>
            <p>A ſilence of ſome minutes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to this vehement harangue. Seraphina perceived the effect of it on every countenance. Is it neceſſary, exclaimed ſhe, to give you inconteſtable proofs that the French ſtill are what they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were? Alas! I am myſelf a wretched example of gallic perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Oh Meſſinians! my name and rank are known to you. You beſtowed diſtinction on me while my heart was yet free, and my
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:048183_0049_1025009837B50838"/>
honour without blemiſh. The dangerous Vivonne has deprived me of all, and left me only deſpair for my portion. This perfidious Frenchman has abandoned me; another victim to his deceitful vows has taken my place. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, tremble for your wives! fathers for your daughters! bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for your ſiſters! Who among you can beaſt himſelf ſecure from a ſimilar inſult?</p>
            <p>A murmur now ran through the crowd, the ſignal of general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and the populace repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a ſullen tone, the French
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:048183_0050_1025009AD56E5FB8"/>
are perfidious. Ah! exclaimed Seraphina, perceiving their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment excited, I ſee I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed myſelf to minds of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; you participitate in my hatred againſt Vivonne, and his nation. The noble Arago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe never treated us thus, even when they loaded us with taxes. They reſpected our manners, our modeſty, and never violated the oaths they ſwore to the tender ſex. Even when our reſiſtance obliged them to employ force, and render our yoke more heavy, they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from their auſtere virtues. Let us return to our former ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigns.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:048183_0051_1025009D941AB698"/>
Palermo, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of this iſland, is ſtill faithful to them. Their alliance with the Hollanders, their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the emperor, and their proximity to Naples, ſecures their power. Vivonne could have made no reſiſtance had Ruyter lived; and in Holland, there are yet other Ruyters, who will ſoon appear. Come, my friends, my fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, accompany me; let us ſhout forth, <hi>Long live the Spaniards,</hi> and let us drive the French who have ſo often inſulted us, for ever from our iſland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:048183_0052_102500A01E8D55B8"/>
It is the character of the Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans eaſily to receive ſudden impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The multitude who, ſome hours before, had extolled to the ſkies the victory of Vivonne, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the eloquence of a woman agitated by paſſion, whoſe beauty and expreſſive grief ſtill ſpoke when ſhe was ſilent, uttered a ſhout, which ſoon became general, and was propagated throughout the whole extent of the city, <hi>Long live the Spaniards, but let Vivonne die!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without regarding the numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous French garriſon, which was then in Meſſina, or remembering
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:048183_0053_102500A2AC877D88"/>
the victory the mareſchal had juſt gained, the multitude increaſed every moment, and ruſhed, with the impetuoſity of a torrent, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the palace of the viceroy, armod with whatever weapons came firſt to hand; ſome even bearing lighted torches; and who was at the head of this wild mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude?—a woman in tears.</p>
            <p>Vivonne was at table, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle apprehenſive of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance, when the news of the tumult was brought him. Without loſing a moment he put himſelf at the head of his guards,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:048183_0054_102500A53635BB38"/>
cauſed the gates of the caſtle to be opened, which his people had been at much trouble to barricade, and ſhewed himſelf to the riotous multitude. The firſt object which preſented itſelf was a woman hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dagger, which ſhe had lifted to ſtrike a French officer. The mareſchal flies to her, wreſts the poignard from her hand, and to his inexpreſſible aſtoniſhment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizes Seraphina. She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſpeak, but rage ſtifles her voice. Vivonne in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to pacify her. His voice, ſo powerful over her ſoul, only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes her deſpair. What then is
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:048183_0055_102500A7F3FA6198"/>
your deſign, madam, ſaid he? Leave my arm at liberty, replied ſhe, and you ſhall ſee me ſtrike a blow which ſhall tell you more than my words can explain. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonne let go her arm, caſting on her one of thoſe glances by which he had ſubdued her heart. Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phina felt the full force of it, and love, like lightning, again took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her ſoul. Ah! baſe man, exclaimed ſhe, you ſtill know but too well your power over me. I came to take your life; but now it is I who muſt die. I leave you to ſuffer the remorſe due to your infidelity. Behold, and judge
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:048183_0056_102500AB72A057A8"/>
whether my love was ſincere. And, in an inſtant, before Vivonne or thoſe about him were aware of her purpoſe, ſhe drew a concealed dagger, plunged it into her heart, and fell dead at his feet. The mareſchal threw himſelf on her body, without regarding in whoſe preſence he gave this proof of weakneſs and ſenſibility. His tears and grief, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſincere and heartfelt, diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the multitude; they commiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the painful pangs he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly felt, and preſently diſperſed without further diſturbance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:048183_0057_102500AD081A3FD0"/>
This tragic ſcene made ſuch an impreſſion on Vivonne, that he ceaſed to be a ſeducer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the arts of deceiving beauties. War and the fine arts from that time occupied his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His praiſes have been ſung by the moſt celebrated French po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. Boileau himſelf has given his eulogium. He was crowned with glory; but a tender and painful ſentiment, and the melancholy image of Seraphina, perpetually filled his heart, and compelled him, in the midſt of the moſt brilliant feſtivals, to heave involuntary ſighs.</p>

            <p>A FRIEND of mine, who is lately gone to Toulouſe, has ſent me from thence an account of ſome circumſtances which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long ago in that part of France, and which, ſhe ſays, are
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:048183_0059_102500B25D1D7DC0"/>
ſtill much the ſubject of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall tranſcribe this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, which I believe will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt you. Perhaps a novel-writer, by the aid of a little additional miſery, and by giving the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which actually happened a heightened colour—by taking his pallet, and daſhing with the full glow of red, what nature had only unged with pale violet, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpin a volume from theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials. Yet, after all, nothing is ſo affecting as ſimplicity, and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo forcible as truth. I ſhall therefore ſend you the ſtory exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I received it; and in ſuch
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:048183_0060_102500B4EC4A5548"/>
parts of it as want intereſt, I beg you will recollect that you are not reading a tale of fiction, and that in real life, incidents are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways placed as they are in novels, ſo as to produce ſtage effect. In ſome parts of the narrative you will meet with a little romance; but perhaps you will wonder that you meet with no more; ſince the ſcene is not in the cold philoſoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic climate of England, but in the warm regions of the ſouth of France, were the imagination is elevated, where the paſſions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire extraordinary energy, and where the fire of poetry flaſhed
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:048183_0061_1024A3EB9CDA3EE8"/>
from the harps of the Troubadours, amid the ſullen gloom of the Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is ages.</p>
            <p>A young Frenchman, whoſe uſual reſidence was at Paris, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travelled as far as Toulouſe the year before the revolution, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by a party of his friends to accompany them to Bareges, where ſome of them were going in purſuit of amuſement, and others in ſearch of health from the medical ſprings which riſe ſo plentifully, both in hot and cold ſtreams, among the Pyrenean mountains.</p>

               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:048183_0062_102500BA0655C7C8"/>
This young Pariſian, who had ſome taſte for the ſublime ſcenery of nature, felt that it would be luxury to leave a little longer the regular walks which art has plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Thuilleries, and the trim gardens and <hi>jets-d'eau</hi> ſhe has form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Verſailes, to wander among thoſe piles of mountains which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hang each other, and liſten to the torrents which fall down them with loud and irreſiſtible impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</p>

            <p>What powerful ſenſations does the firſt view of ſuch a ſcene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce!—We ſeem to begin a new exiſtence; every former impreſſion is for a while eraſed from the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, and the mind feels enwrapped and loſt in the ſtrong emotions of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:048183_0064_102500C1E4C77B48"/>
awe, aſtoniſhment, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Bareges was crouded, as it uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is in the ſeaſon, not only with French company, but alſo with ſtrangers, who travel from other countries, in order to uſe its cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated baths. The company amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves, as they generally do at water-drinking places, by ſauntering, lounging, cards, lotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, jeux-d'eſprit, and ſcandal.</p>
            <p>Bareges is a very expenſive place. Even moderate accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be purchaſed at a high
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:048183_0065_102500C1E4C77B48"/>
rate; and proviſions, as well as lodgings, are ſometimes obtained with difficulty. Bareges is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeldom reſorted to by any but people of conſiderable fortune, who can afford to level the obſtacles which mountains interpoſe to their conveniences and comforts, by the all ſubduing force of gold.</p>
            <p>Among a number of perſons of rank and fortune, there was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, one family at Bareges in a different ſituation. This family conſiſted of an elderly infirm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the palſy, and his daughter, a young woman about
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:048183_0066_102500C780673DB0"/>
nineteen years of age. Their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and mode of living ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to indicate, that, though in ſearch of relief this old officer had journeyed to Bareges, he had in ſo doing far exceeded the bounds of economy which his circumſtances preſcribed, and was forced to deny himſelf every accommodation his infirmities could ſpare. He lived in the moſt retired manner, in the worſt lodging at Bareges;—and while the other ladies were dreſſed in a ſtyle of expenſive variety and profuſion, his daughter wore only a plain linen gown, which though
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:048183_0067_102500C780673DB0"/>
always perfectly clean, was coarſe; and her dark hair was left unpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and without any ornament whatever. Fortunately for Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, however, (for that was her name) her perſon was calculated to make her coarſe gown appear to the beſt advantage; and though ſhe was not very beautiful, her countenance had an expreſſion of ſweetneſs which anſwered the end of beauty by exciting love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>The company at Bareges ſoon became acquainted with each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the ladies always took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Madelaine when they met
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:048183_0068_102500CA08A84F00"/>
her in their walks, which, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, did not happen very often, for her father was frequently unable to go out. When he did, he was ſupported on one ſide by Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and on the other by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. It was impoſſible to ſee with inſenſibility, the attention which this intereſting young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paid her father, whom ſhe nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quitted one moment. It was remarked with what careful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs ſhe uſed to lead him along the ſtreets of Bareges, walking the ſloweſt pace ſhe could, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſteps as he moved feebly
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:048183_0069_102500CD841A23F0"/>
on. And when he was not able to venture out, ſhe was ſeen at the window of their little parlour rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in order to entertain him.—Her looks and manner announced that her diſpoſition was naturally ſprightly, and that ſhe would have been gay, if her father had not been ſick. But all the cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe could aſſume while he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, was exerted to amuſe him, and ſhorten the tedious hours of languor and debility.</p>
            <p>Though Madelaine was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the obſcurity and ſecluſion in which ſhe lived preſerved her from the envy of the women.—
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:048183_0070_102500CF16A1DE78"/>
They knew well enough, that the gentlemen at Bareges were, for the moſt part, men of the world, who tho' they may admire beauty, and approve of virtue, are never ſo far the dupes of any tender or moral ſentiment as to let it interfere ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their vanity, their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or their intereſt. Although the French revolution had not yet happened, theſe ladies were aware that with reſpect to marriage, the age of <hi>calculators</hi> was already come, and therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine. The ladies joined with the men in admiring
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:048183_0071_102500D1EEA9F7F8"/>
the graces of her perſon, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able qualities which her conduct diſplayed. Madelaine, in ſhort became the object of general eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem.</p>
            <p>Auguſte, for ſo I ſhall call our young Pariſian, who has loſt his title ſince the laws of equality have been eſtabliſhed in his country—Auguſte ſpoke leſs of Madelaine than the other gentlemen at Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but it was perhaps becauſe he thought of her more. Sometimes in his ſolitary morning rambles he uſed to make compariſons between her and the Pariſian ladies, among whom he had paſſed the winter,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:048183_0072_102500D571E61FC8"/>
and the compariſon generally end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a deep ſigh. The ſcene of theſe meditations was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much in Madelaine's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Perhaps at Paris or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles, Auguſte might have been dazzled by the poliſhed graces of a fine lady rouged, powdered, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and equipped for conqueſt. Theſe artificial attractions might, perhaps, have accorded well enough with clipped trees and angular walks. But Madelaine's ſimple manners, Madelaine's natural ſmiles, and unſtudied bluſhes, were far more in uniſon with the Pyrennean mountains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:048183_0073_102500D705B0AA40"/>
One evening when Auguſte was walking in the town of Bareges with ſome ladies, he ſaw Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine at a little diſtance aſſiſting, with great difficulty, to ſupport her father, who appeared to be ſeized with a fit. Auguſte darted like an arrow toward the ſpot, and held up the officer till he found himſelf ſomewhat recovered; and then Auguſte, with a ſort of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle violence, obliged Madelaine, who was pale and trembling, to let go her father's arm, and ſuffer him to aſſiſt the ſervant in leading him home, which was but a few ſteps farther. Auguſte entered the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:048183_0074_102500D98E98F810"/>
houſe, where he remained till the old officer was a little revived;—and, after prevailing upon Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine to take a few hartſhorn drops, he retired.</p>
            <p>The next morning he felt that common civility required he ſhould pay the old officer a viſit and learn how he had paſſed the night. It happened that Madelaine had the very ſame idea. "Surely," thought ſhe, "it will be very ſtrange if this young man, who was ſo kind, ſo careful of my father, and who made me take ſome hartſhorn drops, ſhould neglect to call and enquire
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:048183_0075_102504F0F8E62598"/>
after us." This idea had come acroſs her mind ſeveral times; and ſhe was meditating upon it at her father's bedſide, when Auguſte was announced.</p>
            <p>The old officer, who had all the finiſhed politeneſs of his country and his profeſſion, received him in the moſt courteous manner; and though he ſpoke with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, yet he was profuſe in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for the ſervice Auguſte had rendered him. Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine's thanks were few, and ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed; but the tone in which they were uttered was ſuch that Auguſte felt he could have ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:048183_0076_1024A405C53E1A20"/>
his life to have deſerved them.</p>
            <p>The old officer ſtill continued ſick, and therefore Auguſte ſtill conſidered it as an indiſpenſable mark of attention to go every day, and learn the ſtate of his health.—He alſo began to feel that theſe viſits became every day more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his own happineſs. That happineſs was indeed embittered by many painful reflections. He well knew that to obtain his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the count de—'s conſent to marry Madelaine, was as impoſſible as it was for himſelf to conquer the paſſion ſhe had inſpired. He knew
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:048183_0077_1024A408708566E8"/>
exactly the order in which his father's enquiries would run on this ſubject. He was aware that there were two interrogatories to be anſwered. The firſt was—"How many thouſand livres has ſhe a year?" And the ſecond—"Is ſhe noble?" And nothing could be more embarraſſing than that the enquiry concerning fortune, would, he was ſure, come firſt; ſince that was the only article which could not be anſwered in a ſatiſfactory manner; for to Madelaine's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former nobility of France would not abſolutely contaminate the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:048183_0078_1024A40AD6F0C998"/>
pure ſtreams of noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <hi>rotu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> they had always ſufficient generoſity to abate ſome genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nobility in favour of a proper equivalent in wealth.</p>
            <p>Auguſte, while he was convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the impoſſibility of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his father's conſent to his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, did not pay Madelaine one viſit the leſs from that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when the uſual hour of his viſit arrived, he often ſuddenly broke a chain of admirable reaſon on the imprudence of his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to haſten to the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:048183_0079_1024A4576312ED78"/>
dwelling of her he loved. In a ſhort time he ceaſed all kind of reaſoning on the ſubject, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his heart without reſerve to the moſt violent and unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſion.</p>
            <p>Auguſte made a declaration to the old officer of the ſentiments which his daughter had inſpired. The old gentleman mentioned it to Madelaine, and ſhe only anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tears, of which he perfectly underſtood the meaning. When Auguſte explained his ſituation with reſpect to his father, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer deſired him to think of his daughter no more, Auguſte felt
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:048183_0080_1024A45C119E44E8"/>
that he might as well have deſired him to ceaſe to breathe. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his viſits, and the officer was ſoon reduced to that ſtate of langour and debility which left him neither the power nor the wiſh to forbid them. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints increaſed every day, and were attended with many alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſymptoms. The ſeaſon for the water of Bareges was now paſt, and all the company left the place except the old officer, who was too weak to be removed, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte, who, while Madelaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, had no power to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> himſelf from the ſpot. In a few
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:048183_0081_102500DC51455360"/>
weeks the old officer felt that his dying hour was near. Auguſte knelt with Madelaine at his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide—her voice was ſuffocated by tears, and Auguſte had ſcarcely power to articulate in broken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents that he would devote his life to the happineſs of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and ſoon after expired. Madelaine mourned for her father with uncontrouled affliction, nor could all the attentions of her lover diſpel that anguiſh with which her affectionate heart la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the loſs of her parent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:048183_0082_102500DEDD098090"/>
The winter being far advanced, ſhe propoſed to defer her journey to the diſtant province where ſhe and her father had lived, until ſpring, and to place herſelf in the mean time in a convent not far from Bareges. Auguſte exerted all the eloquence of love to induce her to conſent immediately to a private marriage. She heſitated at this propoſal; and while they were converſing together on the ſubject, the door of the room in which they were ſitting was ſuddenly thrown open, and Auguſte ſaw his father the count de—enter. He had heard of the attachment
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:048183_0083_102500E169E89F58"/>
which detained his ſon at Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and had haſtened to tear him from the ſpot before it was too late. He upbraided his ſon with great bitterneſs, and began alſo to upbraid Madelaine: but there was ſomething in her looks, her ſilence, and her tears, which ſtifled the terms of haughty reproach in which he was prepared to addreſs her; and ordering his ſon to leave the room, he deſired to ſpeak to her alone. After explaining to her the abſolute impoſſibility of her being ever united to his ſon, and his determination to diſinher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it him, and leave his whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:048183_0084_102500E3F230B1A0"/>
to his ſecond ſon, if Auguſte ſhould perſiſt in his attachment to her-after endeavouring to awaken her pride and her generoſity, he deſired to know where ſhe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed going. She told him her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of placing herſelf immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the convent of—. He approved of this deſign, and left her to go to his ſon. No ſooner was the door of the room ſhut, than Madelaine gave way to thoſe tears which ſhe had ſcarcely been able to refrain while the count was ſpeaking. She had never felt ſo ſenſibly her orphan condition as at this moment; and the dear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:048183_0085_102500E6924A4FE0"/>
of her fond father was mingled with the agony of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed love.</p>
            <p>Meantime the count de—declared to his ſon, that his only chance of ever obtaining his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, depended on his abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional ſubmiſſion to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and that he muſt inſtantly attend him to Paris. Auguſte ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly enquired what was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Madelaine; and his father told him that ſhe had determined to take refuge in the convent of—. Auguſte abſolutely refuſed to depart till he was allowed an
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:048183_0086_102500EA14A1F3B0"/>
conſtituent aſſembly, in all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and conſequences.</p>
            <p>The count de—, who was informed of the correſpondence between the two lovers, and who ſaw little hopes of his ſon's ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a paſſion which this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of letters ſerved to cheriſh, contrived means to have Auguſte's letters intercepted at the convent. In vain Madelaine enquired with all the anxiety of tenderneſs for letters. In vain ſhe counted the hours till the return of the poſt days. Poſt after poſt arrived, and brought no tidings of Auguſte.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:048183_0087_102500EBA448AA70"/>
Three months paſſed in the cruel torments of anxiety and ſuſpenſe, and were at length ſucceeded by deſpair. Madelaine believed ſhe was forgotten—forgotten by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte! She conſulted her own heart, and it ſeemed to her impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; yet, after a ſilence of three months, ſhe could doubt no longer.</p>
            <p>Poor Madelaine now recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with anguiſh, inſtead of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that all Frenchmen were free. She would have found ſome ſad conſolation in believing that all Frenchmen were ſlaves. It would have been ſome alleviation
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:048183_0088_102500EE39154BE8"/>
of her ſorrows if Auguſte had been forced to abandon her; and ſhe fancied ſhe could have borne to loſe him, if ſhe had been ſure that he ſtill loved her—it was loſing him by his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almoſt inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>The little pittance which Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, after paying her father's debts, had left for her own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, was inſufficient to defray her expences as a boarder in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. She had already by her ſweetneſs and gentleneſs, gained the affections of ſome of the nuns,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:048183_0089_102500F0F879C380"/>
to whom ſhe was alſo attached, and who inceſſantly conjured her to take the veil. "And why," ſhe ſometimes exclaimed, "why ſhould I heſitate my longer in ſo doing? Since Auguſte is loſt, what have I to regret in renouncing the world? What ſacrifice do I make; what happineſs do I reſign?</p>
            <p>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which ſhe knew but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: but to ſeparate herſelf irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably, and for ever, from him to whom her ſoul was devoted—to ſee him, to hear his voice no more—to take vows which would
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:048183_0090_102500F388934830"/>
make it even a crime to think of him—to baniſh him even from her thoughts—alas! Madelaine felt like Eloiſa—
<q>
                  <l>All is not Heaven's while Abel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard has part,</l>
                  <l>Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!</l>
               </q>
Sometimes too the idea occurred that Auguſte might love her ſtill—"And am I then," thought Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, "going to reduce myſelf to a ſtate in which I ſhall be forced to wiſh he were unfaithful, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſave me from the agonies of remorſe!"—She put off all thoughts
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:048183_0091_102500F6118AFF50"/>
of entering on her novitiate for ſome weeks longer—no letters ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and again her reſolution to take the veil returned. Why," cried ſhe, "why ſhould I ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to lament that inconſtant lover who thinks of me no more? Alas, did he not ſee the anguiſh of my ſoul at parting with him?—Does he not know the deſerted ſituation in which I am left?—Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other reſource than taking the veil—no doubt he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to hear I have done ſo—he will find in my renunciation of the world ſome excuſe for his infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:048183_0092_102500F991164C50"/>
—Oh, heavens! will Auguſte hear then that I am ſeparated from him for ever without one ſigh?—Ah, why need I deliberate any longer?—My trials will ſoon be paſt—I feel that my heart will break—yes, death will come to my relief—and in heaven I ſhall find my father!"</p>
            <p>Madelaine at length determined to join the holy ſiſterhood of the convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was fixed, when, proſtrate with her face toward the earth, and with

flowers ſcattered over her, and a part of her long treſſes cut off, ſhe was to enter upon that ſolemn tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preparatory to her eternal renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the world—of Auguſte!</p>
            <p>A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony, Madelaine was called to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, where ſhe found her lover, with ſome of the municipal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the town, wearing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſcarfs.</p>
            <p>Madelaine, at the ſight of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with difficulty reached a chair, in which ſhe fell back ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:048183_0094_102500FEA3F3C028"/>
while Auguſte could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear uttering ſome imprecations againſt the iron grate by which they were ſeparated, and which prevented him from flying to her aſſiſtance. He, however, procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed help, and Madelaine recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered.</p>
            <p>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had received the day before a decree of the national aſſembly, forbidding any nuns to be profeſſed. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the municipality had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given information of this new law to the abbeſs, who had
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:048183_0095_1025010034D73CA8"/>
conſented to allow Madelaine to leave the convent immediately. As he pronounced theſe laſt words, Madelaine looked at her lover.—Auguſte haſtened to explain to her that his uncle, who loved him, and pitied his ſufferings, had, at length, made a will, leaving him his fortune upon condition that his father conſented to his marriage with Madelaine.</p>
            <p>When her lover and the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers departed, Madelaine retired to her apartment, to give way to thoſe delicious tears which were poured from a heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:048183_0096_10250102E1FECDF8"/>
with wonder, thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and joy. When her firſt emotions had ſubſided, ſhe began to pack up her little wardrobe in preparation for leaving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent on the following day. "I always loved the revolution," thought Madelaine, as ſhe laid aſide the white gown in which ſhe was to be married the next morning; "and this laſt decree is ſurely of all others the beſt and wiſeſt—but it had come too late!"—At this idea Madelaine took up the veil for her novitiate, which lay upon her table, and bathed it with a flood of tears.</p>

The next morning, Auguſte and Madelaine were married in the pariſh church of—, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the ceremony, ſet out for Paris, where they now live, and are, I am told, two of the happieſt people, and the beſt patriots in France.</p>
