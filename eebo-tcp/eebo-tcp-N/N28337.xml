      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your husband had died for his native country upon the field of honor, as you were pleased to inform me, and left you wholly destitute.

                  <p>His Excellency has fallen into a trifling embarrass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and understanding this mansion to be inhabited by a very noble-minded gentleman, has sent me hither in quality of his <hi>valet-de-chambre</hi> —</p>

                  <p>In my capacity of <hi>game-keeper,</hi> I this morning shot a partridge—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>On my manor, I suppose?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>I trust your Excellency will pardon it; and I am au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, by my Lord, the Count, to say that he earnestly requests you will in return shoot as much game as you please upon his estates in Champagne.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>Not quite.—When we arrived at the inn, I was sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned into my master's presence, in quality of <hi>cook,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to dress the aforesaid partridge. While it was at the fire, the London coach arrived, and in it a lawyer, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very hungry.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>As is commonly the case with lawyers in this country.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:037765_0011_100F46E55723C078"/>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>My master's politeness being unbounded, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, as his <hi>butler,</hi> to lay a knife and fork for this lawyer. The partridge was served up—it was soon demolished—and, after dinner, a game at piquet was proposed. Here fortune was not favorable to the Count, though indeed his loss was insignificant, the trifling sum of three guineas, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which he offered to pledge his word of honor.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>A precious pledge!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet the lawyer had the unparallelled impudence to assert, that it was not a safe mortgage.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>In few words, then, your master is short of money?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>By no means!—He has several thousands now by him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet could not pay three guineas?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>His pocket-book is full of notes and bills of exchange, but unfortunately he is short of running cash. A cursed highwayman stopped us yesterday, and would not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till I had surrendered to him the sum of five hundred guineas, which I carried as <hi>cashier</hi> to his Excellency.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>Then the upshot is, that your master is in want of three guineas.—Take them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>I acknowledge this liberality with transport and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and am in despair that I cannot avail myself of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>Then what the devil do you want?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>Honor forbids our accepting any thing in the way of benefaction; but we have in our possession a nag, which we wish to sell, and which, as <hi>coachman</hi> and <hi>groom</hi> to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, I am commissioned to do myself the honor of offering you at the small sum of three guineas.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>A riding-horse!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>A nag, if you please—I only said a nag. He is now below in the court.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>I wish to oblige your master, but I can by no means make this purchase.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis a very clever beast I assure you. It was our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to have taught him by degrees the valuable art of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037765_0012_100F46E70538CEA8"/>
living entirely without food, and he has already made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable progress in acquiring it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>And does the Count mean to pursue his travels on foot?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>He is fond of pedestrianizing; 'tis a mere uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained mode of travelling.—If one comes to a fine pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, there is nothing to do but to sit down on the smooth turf, under the shade of a spreading tree, and feast one's eyes all day on the lovely scene.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>But such travellers are seldom well received at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish inns.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>When a man feels his own consequence, he concerns himself little about the opinion of the multitude.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>My friend, the money is entirely at your service, but I cannot permit the beast to be left.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>No money without barter. I intreat you, noble sir, to favor us upon this point!—I must not touch a shilling, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I am to leave our travelling companion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>But I do not want a nag, I never ride.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>So much the better for him; he will have nothing to do but to recover the fatigues he has undergone in our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In one word, sir, I intreat you to oblige my master! —You may depend upon the most noble proofs of his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the moment he is restored to his estates.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ful.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, well! here are the three guineas. I am much obliged to the Count for the confidence he has placed in me, and if he loves partridges, I beg the favor of his company to supper this evening.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ron.</speaker>
                  <p>Commend me to the English, say I—there is nothing like them for helping a man of quality out of his distresses. I hasten to the Count to carry him the money, together with this most obliging invitation—and if your honor should wish for a specimen of excellent French cookery, I entreat you to lay your commands upon Monsieur Pierre Ronsard, first cook to the gracious Count his master, a volunteer in the service of the holy Roman empire. <stage>Exit.</stage>

                  <p>By no means. Especially if it be taken into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the nag is only a mule.</p>

                  <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                  <p>He would not be the less a Count, though he were to ride upon a cat—as some people would still remain an ass, though mounted upon Bucephalus himself.</p>

                  <p>Not so easily as you suppose. I married a young French emigrant in Flanders, who must herself best know whether she was a widow or not.</p>

                  <p>I am transported!—I shall be ready for my journey in a few minutes. Gentlemen, your most obedient!—In the arms of my new husband, I shall soon forget that I ever had the honor of belonging to either of you; or if I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, the remembrance will be only as of a horrible dream. Adieu! and be assured that deeply as I interest myself in your fates, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to hear that you had both yawned yourselves to death!—Ha! ha! ha!— <stage>[Exit with a low curtesy, and a sarcastic look.]</stage>
