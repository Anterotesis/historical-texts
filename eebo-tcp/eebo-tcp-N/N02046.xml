            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BECAUSE all Men are <hi>Sinful,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are <hi>Mortal.</hi> For as <hi>by one Man Sin entred into the World, ſo Death hath paſſed upon all Men for that all have ſinned.</hi> But, Eternal Praiſes be to the Ever-living God, that, <hi>As by one Man's diſobedience many were made Sinners, ſo, by the Obedience of One ſhall many be made Righteous.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man-Mediator, is the Only One, by whom ſinful Men can be Saved. He ſaves, in <hi>Juſtifying</hi> Perſons by His <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> in Renewing and <hi>Sanctifying</hi> them by His <hi>Spirit.</hi> Praiſes be to His Great Name, that from time to time there are many ſuch Triumphs of His Grace. We have ground to hope (ſo far as we can judge) that Several lately remov'd from us by Death, were ſuch.</p>

Particularly, that Aged Handmaid of the Lord Madam <hi>Bridget Uſher,</hi> upon whoſe Death the following Sermon was Preached. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard to the contrary, but that from her Youth up, her Life was Sober, Vertuous, Religious. Ever ſince I have known her (which has been many Years) ſhe has had (and I think juſtly) the Character of an holy, blameleſs, cloſe Walker with God. She was firm and ſtedfaſt in the Faith, even to the end. She ſo walked, as to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour. She was watchful, not only over her <hi>Actions,</hi> but over her <hi>Words</hi> too; far from that <hi>backbiting, reviling</hi> temper, which too ſhamefully and commonly appears in many. She was very ready to promote and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>pious ſavoury Diſcourſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> a thing too much neglected by many Chriſtians. She was a wonderful Example of Chriſtian <hi>Patience</hi> under great Pains and Bodily Afflictions. She was a careful, conſtant, diligent <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender on God's publick Worſhip and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and would not ſuffer ſmall Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies or difficulties to keep her therefrom, as too many are apt to do.</p>
            <p>AS her Outward Carriage was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, courteous, religious; ſo her great Sollicitude was (as appear'd from Diſcourſe and Conference) to <hi>be a Chriſtian indeed,</hi>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002431_0005_0FDB42F8509FCC60"/>
to have <hi>Faith Unfeigned,</hi> to have Integrity and Uprightneſs of Soul <hi>before God that trieth the Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a long and holy Life, ſhe died in the Lord, and reſts from her Labours, and her Works follow her. Let us follow her, ſo far as ſhe followed Chriſt. To be ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and practically Godly and Religious; is our indiſpenſable Duty, higheſt Honour, and greateſt Intereſt. Let us be moſt ſtudious and careful to lead ſuch a Life; for we know not how ſoon we may be call'd to an Account by our Glorious Judge, who can't be deceiv'd and wont be mock'd.</p>
            <p>That the Sermon publiſhed herewith, by my dear and worthy <hi>Colleague</hi> and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Labourer in the Work of the Goſpel; may be Inſtrumental of quickening Perſons to an holy Life, which is the beſt Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death; is the Prayer of him, who writes this ſhort Preface,</p>

            <p>BUT another thing, whereby this Sex hath been not a little dignify'd, is the extraordinary Honour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> publick Teſtimony to the holy Child <hi>Jeſus:</hi> An account of which we have before us, in the Chapter containing our Text.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord Jeſus Chriſt being made under the Law, humbled himſelf to attend &amp; obſerve all the Inſtitutions and Ceremonies of it. He was circumcis'd, on the day and in the manner appointed. Afterwards at the time preſcribed, when he was about Six Weeks old, His Parents brought Him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (being a Firſt-born

Son) to preſent Him to the Lord, and offer a Sacrifice, according to the cuſtom of the Law.</p>
            <p>NOW, at the time when the Child <hi>Jeſus</hi> was preſented in the Temple, there came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (by the direction of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Jew, named <hi>Simeon,</hi> a juſt and devout and (probably) an aged Man, waiting for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Iſrael: who, ſeeing the Child, the Lord's Chriſt, (as it had been revealed to him, He ſhould do before his Death) He took him up into his venerable Arms, with the greater Affection &amp; Joy, with loud Thankſgiving and Praiſe, and with publick Declarations and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, upon the ſolemn and glad Occaſion. [See, Ver. 25, &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>AND then (that one of each Sex might bear <q>witneſs to Him, in whom both Men &amp; Women are invited to believe, that they may be ſaved</q>) there came in alſo at that happy juncture a godly aged <hi>Woman,</hi> to help make up a harmony of Confeſſions, and joyn with <hi>Simeon</hi> in a Teſtimony to the holy Jeſus:—which was not only a Reputation to the Child, and a Comfort to his Parents, but alſo an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002431_0010_0FDB4301F9BCC300"/>
given of her; and this rather more large and particular than that given of <hi>Simeon,</hi> though an eminent Man in Jeruſalem, 'tis ſuppos'd.</p>
            <p>HER <hi>Name</hi> is called <hi>Anna;</hi> which in Hebrew is Hannah, and in Engliſh is often abbreviated into Ann. It ſignifies <hi>Gracious,</hi> or <hi>Gratify'd,</hi> Anſwered, Comforted. The Woman in our Text, according to her Name, was both graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and gratify'd. She was ſtrong in the Grace of the Lord. Great Grace was upon her. She was highly favoured, and ſweetly comforted, when ſhe ſaw the Holy Jeſus preſented in the Temple.</p>
            <p>Further, WE have her <hi>Parentage</hi> mentioned. She was the Daughter of <hi>Phanuel:</hi> A Man of Note, we may ſuppoſe; or, his Name ſignifying <hi>The Face of God,</hi> it might be bro't in to remind us of <hi>Jacob'</hi>s Penuel or Phanuel<note n="‖" place="bottom">Gen. 32. 30.</note>; that now (as one obſerves) the myſtery of that ſhould be unfolded, when in Chriſt we ſhould, as 'twere, ſee God face to face, and our Lives be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>Again, WE are told the <hi>Tribe</hi> ſhe belong'd to which was that of <hi>Aſher;</hi> one of the Ten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, that revolted (under the Conduct of Jeroboam) from the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and from the true Worſhip or God, and that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried into the Aſſyrian Captivity. But tho' the Generality were in the defection, yet many particular Perſons continu'd in their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to <hi>David'</hi>s Family, united themſelves to <hi>Judah,</hi> and remov'd their Habitations thither,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002431_0011_0FDB43061D7EDF70"/>
to expreſs their Zeal for the true Line of Succeſſion, and to enjoy the true Religion, the pure Worſhip of God. The pious Woman in our Text, was (probably) the remote O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>spring of one that did do ſo, according to that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prophecy, Jer. 50. 4. <hi>In thoſe days—the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſhall come</hi> [to Jeruſalem] <hi>they and the Children of Judah together, going &amp; weeping,—to ſeek the Lord their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, WE have her <hi>Age,</hi> and her <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> deſcribed. She is ſaid to be a <hi>Widow,</hi> and ſhe had <hi>long</hi> been ſo. She liv'd in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd State but about ſeven years; and that it ſeems was in her Youth. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>She lived with an Husband ſeven years from her Virginity;</hi> which denotes her tender Age as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Chaſtity. Her Husband dying, and leaving her a young Widow, ſhe ſpent all the Remain of her Life in a ſolitary State, never marrying again; which the ſacred Hiſtorian ſeems to take notice of to her Commendation. For, in ſome Caſes, this may be a wiſe part, and very praiſe worthy. (See the Apoſtle's Judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 8, &amp; 40.) Yet there are other Caſes, wherein 'tis adviſeable to marry again. (See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9.) What <hi>Anna'</hi>s Caſe was, and what the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or Reaſons of her abiding in a ſingle State, it doth not appear. But ſo it was, and it ſeems to be commended in her, that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Widow to her dying Day.—And ſhe lived to very <hi>advanced</hi> Years. Tis ſaid, ſhe was of <hi>a great Age:</hi> She was a Widow of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>fourſcore and four Years.</hi> Some take it, ſhe
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002431_0012_0FDB4307390C3B98"/>
liv'd ſo long a Widow, which muſt make her to be upwards of an hundred. But others reckon it from her Birth, and call it the meaſure of her Life, not the duration of her Widowhood. Which ſeems rather the more probable: For it is unlikely that a Woman ſo very old, ſhould be capable of faſting and praying at that rate as ſhe is ſaid to have done. And ſuppoſing her to be but Eighty four Years old, this were a great Age; what but very few attain to; and which ſeldom permits any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Faſtings and Devotions; ſuch as we may think that godly Woman was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for.</p>
            <p>BUT again, in the Deſcription of Her, we may obſerve, She is ſtyled a <hi>Propheteſs.</hi> By which ſome think is meant, ſhe had the Spirit of Prophecy, and was inſpired to foretell future <hi>Events.</hi> But this Title is very ambiguous, and often uſed in a different Senſe in both Teſtaments. <hi>Deborah</hi> that judged Iſrael, is call'd a <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs:</hi> Which, for ought appears, only beſpeaks her to be a Woman of eminent Holineſs and Prudence, and Knowledge in the Law, whereby ſhe was ſingularly qualified for judging of the People, though not endowed with any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts and Graces<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pool'</hi>s Annota. on Judg. 4. 4.</note>. And perhaps nothing of extraordinary Inſpiration is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Word is applied to <hi>Anna.</hi> It may only mean that ſhe was a Mother in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; a wiſe Woman, knowing in the Scriptures,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002431_0013_0FDB430B99E38870"/>
and diſpenſing her Inſtructions, Counſels and Bleſſings to all about her, as a Mother to her Children, or a Propheteſs to the People. It was perhaps her ſpecial Employment to teach Children, and ſhe might make it her buſineſs to inſtruct the younger Women, which the Apoſtle makes a ſpecial Duty of aged Matrons. (Tit. 2. 3.) She was <hi>a Teacher of good Things:</hi> Not a public Preacher, but a private Inſtructor; full of godly Diſcourſe at all times, and (which is the leaſt that can be meant) applying her ſelf to inſtruct thoſe about her. Like another <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> of whom ('tis thought by many) her Son <hi>Solomon</hi> deſigns thoſe words as part of her excellent Character, Prov. 31. 26, 29. <hi>She open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her mouth with Wiſdom, and in her tongue is the law of Kindneſs.—Many Daughters have done vertuouſly, but thou excellest them all.</hi>—Anna might be call'd a Propheteſs on the account of her pious Diſcourſe, whereby her lips fed many. For godly Counſels &amp; Exhortations are oft-times (as well as Predictions) called <hi>Prophecies.</hi> Prov. 31. 1. <hi>The words of King Lemuel, the Prophecy that his mother taught him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, Another Excellency of this Woman celebrated in our Text, is her uncommon <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, <hi>She departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Faſtings and Prayers night and day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS the <hi>Fear of God</hi> that crowns &amp; completes the Character of the virtuous Woman. No doubt, <hi>Anna</hi> was in her general behaviour as becometh Holineſs,—ſober, grave and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things, juſt and honeſt, true and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002431_0014_0FDB430D44712560"/>
faithful, charitable and peaceable, and ſat an Example of moral Virtue in all the Inſtances of it. But 'tis only her <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, that is expreſsly mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the reſt being of little account without this, and being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily comprehended in it.</p>
            <p>'TIS ſaid of Her, <hi>She departed not from the Temple:</hi> which implies at leaſt her conſtant attending on the public Worſhip of God. The Generality of Expoſitors think it means no more. Not that ſhe had her <hi>Habitation</hi> in the Temple, but only gave her <hi>Attendence</hi> there conſtantly at the times of Divine Service. Thus the Prieſts were bid, (Lev. 10. 7) <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>They were continually in the Temple, praiſing &amp; bleſſing God:</hi> that is frequently, and always at Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-hours of Worſhip; as the Sacrifice offer'd Morning and Evening is call'd the <hi>continual</hi> Burnt offering. It may be explain'd by, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 42. where it is ſaid, <hi>DAILY in the Temple, and in every Houſe, they ceaſed not to teach &amp; preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>—Even ſo <hi>Anna</hi> kept cloſe to the Public Worſhip, was daily in the Temple at the hours of Prayer, Morning and Evening.—It is ſaid, <hi>She departed not from the Temple, with Faſtings and Prayers worſhipping night and day</hi>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 9. 14.</note>, that is, twice in a Week.—Others think that latter Clauſe relates to her <hi>private</hi> Conduct, and underſtand it of her voluntary occaſional Faſts and retir'd Worſhip<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Whitby <hi>refers it to this. See his Appendix to Mat.</hi> 6. 16.—<hi>So likewiſe Mr.</hi> Henry, <hi>&amp; others.</hi>
               </note>. She was in <hi>Faſtings</hi> and <hi>Watchings often</hi> (as 'tis ſaid of the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27.) and as it's ſaid of Epaphras (<hi>Col.</hi> 4. 12.) She laboured always fervently in Prayers. She not only obſerv'd the ſtated hours of common and daily Prayer, but in her Retirements pray'd <hi>night and day.</hi> She abounded in all private Acts of Devotion: Faſting and Prayer being put for the reſt, and including Meditation, Reading, &amp;c. Religious Exerciſes fill'd up her whole Life almoſt; ſhe having little worldly Buſineſs and Care to take her off, or being paſt Labour.</p>
            <p>Note (ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) "It is not prov'd that ſhe deſerted all outward Calling or Labour in the World, on pretence of Religion, while ſhe was able for it: and if it be done but when Age or Sickneſs diſableth one, it is lawful and well.—Again, 'Tis another Note of his on the place, She was not of the ſick mind of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane nominal Chriſtians, that cannot abide long Prayers and religious Strictneſs'. No, but ſhe gave her ſelf to Prayer (ſays Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> on the place) was always in a praying Frame, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

in pious Ejaculations, large in ſolemn Prayers, and very particular in her Interceſſions". And if ſhe had a Family, we may well conclude, ſhe alſo worſhip'd God <hi>with all her Houſe,</hi> and thus <hi>pray'd to God alway,</hi> as is ſaid of devout <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Like one that's a <hi>Widow indeed,</hi> (whom the Apoſtle deſcribes in 1 Tim. 5.) <hi>She truſted in God, and continued in Supplications and Prayers night and day.</hi> She was very frequent in her Devotions, like the Pſalmiſt, who ſaid, <hi>Morning and Evening and at Noon</hi> will I pray to thee; and at <hi>Midnight</hi> I will ariſe to give Thanks to thee: <hi>Seven times</hi> a day I will praiſe thee.</p>
            <p>THUS, this devout Widow liv'd a Life of Prayer; and to help her Devotion, ſhe was much in <hi>Faſting.</hi> She led a Life of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, us'd her ſelf to all proper acts of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Self-denial, and often employ'd thoſe hours in Faſtings and Prayers, which others generally waſte in ſleeping and feeding and diverting themſelves.—We may well then conclude Her to be an <hi>uncommon Saint,</hi> one of high Attainments in Grace and Knowlege. For <hi>The diligent band maketh rich.</hi> And indeed (as our famous and apoſtolical <hi>Hooker</hi> was wont to ſay) ſuch extraordinary Favours, as the <hi>Life of Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> muſt be attain'd and preſerved by the frequent uſe of ſuch extraordinary Means, as <hi>Prayer with Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> But (he adds) if Profeſſors grow negligent of theſe Means, <hi>iniquity</hi> will <hi>abound,</hi> and <hi>the Love of many wax cold.</hi>—Our <hi>Anna</hi> was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a very improved Saint, having ſo long and

            </p>
            <p>IN all, ſhe <hi>ſerved God.</hi> She faſted <hi>to the Lord,</hi> and worſhip'd God in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth.</hi> There was a real and an intended Homage to God, in her Faſtings and religious Exerciſes public and private. She glorify'd and pleas'd God.

            <p>AND O! how happily, how abundantly was this pious Woman in the iſſue recompenc'd for her long attendence on the Temple, and unweary'd Services and Devotions,—by the Favour of ſeeing the Meſſiah come, &amp; the Honour of bearing an early Teſtimony to Him!

They were Patterns of Conſtancy to the Publick Worſhip, and a readineſs to hear the Word, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, upon the Lord's Day, and all other Occaſions: and (which was pretty ſingular in them) they practiced (even to the laſt) the good old Way of <hi>writing</hi> after the Miniſter.

            </p>
            <p>BUT 'tis Time now to come to the <hi>Obſervations,</hi> that I particularly intended to diſcourſe upon, from the Text. We may take occaſion to obſerve—</p>
            <p>I. PUBLIC <hi>Worſhip is part of that Homage we owe to GOD, and what has been the uſual Practice of His People in all Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY the <hi>Temple</hi> in our Text, is meant the Place of God's ſolemn and public Worſhip, in Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>IN that Age and in every Generation, the People of God have had their ſtated <hi>Aſſemblies</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002431_0021_0FDB431CF930A3E8"/>
for religious Worſhip: And they have general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had ſome public and ſettled Places of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.—In the beginning of times, even in <hi>Abel'</hi>s days, we read of open and ſocial Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> in one age and another, we find erecting Altars for this Purpoſe. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs and in Canaan, had their Tabernacle (called, the Tabernacle of the Congregation) for the name of the Lord. In <hi>Solomon'</hi>s days, and afterwards, they had their <hi>Temple</hi> at Jeruſalem, and <hi>Synagogues</hi> through all the Land.—And in the times of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> Chriſtians have ever had their Aſſemblies for public Worſhip; and have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally had their appointed Places or Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes for it.</p>
            <p>YEA, the very <hi>Heathens</hi> have been wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to pay ſome public Homage to their Deities.</p>
            <p>INDEED, I think, the worſhipping God publickly is to be refer'd to the head of <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Religion, in the firſt place. Though there be poſitive Appointment of Goſpel Churches for the maintaining and carrying on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip of God; yet this public Homage is founded in natural Reaſons principally, at leaſt is ſupported by them. There are <hi>ſpecial</hi> Ordinances adminiſtred in Church-Societies, which are purely grounded on the Inſtitution of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is abſolute Head of the Church, and to whom ſupremely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Regulation of the Houſe of God: But public Worſhip in the <hi>general,</hi> is a Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of <hi>Nature.</hi> Natural Light tells us, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002431_0022_0FDB4321A2E833F8"/>
as we are God's Creatures, and made for His Service, we do (by conſequence) owe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Him: And alſo that ſeeing we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for Society, we ought (as we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity) to worſhip God in a ſocial Way.—God is the Author, Benefactor, Lord and Judge of Communities, as well as of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons: Therefore worſhip in Societies is due to God.—Further, The Intereſt we have in each others <hi>Welfare</hi> as Members of the ſame Body, (and which we are jointly to pray for, and give Thanks for, and endeavour the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of) does afford another and good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The Law of Nature does oblige Men to combine and convene in eccleſiaſtical Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Aſſemblies, for mutual Edification, as well as to unite in civil Communities for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Security, Strength and Order.</p>
            <p>BUT I wou'd not enlarge here. Some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hints may be given under the next Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: Which is,—</p>
            <p>II. <hi>GOD's Public Worſhip ought to be</hi> conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diligently <hi>attended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhould be ambitious of <hi>Anna'</hi>s excellent Character, of whom 'tis ſaid, <hi>She departed not from the Temple night nor day.</hi> We ſhould love the Houſe of God, the place where His Honour dwells. We ſhould deſire to dwell there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; take all Opportunities to come into God's Sanctuary, and conſtantly wait upon him there in all the Ways of His appointment.</p>
            <p>HERE I ſhall only conſider the <hi> Reaſons of the Doctrine,</hi> or ſhow the Obligations lying on Chriſtians to be conſtant and diligent in their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002431_0023_0FDB4322F6FCE780"/>
attending on the public Worſhip. They are various and numerous: But I ſhall endeavour to reduce them all under the following Heads. Now then, conſider—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD</hi> requires <hi>this of us in His Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE revealed Will of God is the Rule of Man's Duty. That then muſt be of the greateſt Weight with us in every caſe; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that preſcribes to us, we muſt attend and obſerve.</p>
            <p>NOW it's evident, that God in His Word requires us to frequent his Houſe, and wait on Him in public Worſhip diligently. It is plain, God required this of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And 'tis as plainly demanded of Chriſtians. That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy which looks forward to Goſpel times, is a declaration of God's preceptive Will, and Expectations concerning us: Iſai. 2. 3. <hi>Many people ſhall ſay, Come ye and let us go up to the houſe of the God of Jacob; and he will teach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>WE have an <hi>Apoſtolic Canon</hi> expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and rebuking <hi>Negligence</hi> in this Matter. Heb. 10. 25. <hi>Forſake not the aſſembling yourſelves together as the manner of ſome is.</hi> This Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Negligence implies a Demand of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Conſtancy in attending upon God's Worſhip. It directs Chriſtians to <hi>keep up</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies for religious Purpoſes, and requires all to frequent them.—That ancient Command is not yet out of Date. Lev. 19 30. <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary: I am the Lord.</hi> We muſt ſhew a due Reſpect and Reverence to the Houſe of God;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002431_0024_0FDB43248515F4C8"/>

               </gap>arther, <hi>The weekly Revolution of the Lord's Day</hi> calls for our frequent attending on his Public Worſhip. God has inſtituted a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath, which returns once every Week, and is to be ſolemnized partly, yea principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Public Worſhip. The Sabbath is not to be devoted to meer Idleneſs; nor to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in private Duties only, but in public Exerciſes alſo.—One End of the Sabbath is to acknowledge God as the common Creator and Benefactor of Mankind. And this End is beſt attained by a publick Appearance and joint Worſhip. Now to accommodate this, one certain Day is appointed to be the Sabbath. And this divine appointment does very evidently beſpeak the Sabbath to be deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peculiarly for public Worſhip. For, what need is there of a public Day for private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Every Man might have choſen his own Time for this, and ſuited the Day to his own Affairs. But God hath ſeen meet to fix the Sabbath on one particular Day and common Seaſon: And why has He done ſo, but that we might aſſemble together; and might know
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002431_0025_0FDB432889CC83B0"/>
               <hi>when</hi> to aſſemble ourſelves, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Trouble of agreeing upon the Time?—This Sabbath (as I ſaid) returns every week. The Seventh part of our Time is devoted to it, by the Fourth Commandment: which alſo obliges <hi>all</hi> to keep the Sabbath, and to obſerve it carefully. <hi>Remember</hi> the Sabbath to keep it holy. We muſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> forget the Sabbath at any time, nor wilfully neglect any of the Duties of it.—By virtue of this Precept therefore, we are bound to give our conſtant Attendence on the public Worſhip, one day every Week. <hi>Thus often</hi> at leaſt there muſt be a holy Convocation. <hi>Thus often</hi> we are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fail, to worſhip God publickly, if we can.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER we may obſerve, <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt has inſtituted particular Churches,</hi> which are Societies for Worſhip, united and agreeing to walk together in the Faith and Order of the Goſpel. Now the Nature, Ends, and Occaſions of theſe Societies call for their frequent Convention. There are Duties and Ordinances of a public Nature, to be obſerv'd by Chriſtians; which can't be attended by us in our own Cloſets or Families, but require a general Meeting of the ſeveral Members of the religious Body. And theſe Things we are call'd upon to attend with Frequency.</p>

            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, <hi>Preaching the Word</hi> is a public Ordinance. It ſuppoſes the preſence of ſome to hear, and requires a Convention of the Flock to be fed with Miniſterial Inſtructions. Now this Work is to be diligently attended by Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſters. 2 Tim. 4. 1, 2. <hi>I charge thee before God—, Preach the Word, be instant in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, out of ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. So 1 Tim. 4. 13. <hi>Give attendence to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine.</hi> And if Miniſters muſt be diligent in preaching, the People ſhould be diligent in attending.</p>
            <p>YEA, Chriſtians are expreſly <hi>requir'd</hi> to be diligent Hearers of the Word. Jam. 1. 19, 20. <hi>My beloved Brethren, let every man be ſwift to hear;—and receive with meekneſs the Ingra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, The <hi>Sacraments</hi> of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper are public Ordinances. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſo. Tho' in ſome extraordinary caſes it has
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002431_0027_0FDB432B39CA9228"/>
been and may be adminiſtred not in a public Congregation: yet (I preſume) 'tis expedient that it ſhould ordinarily be diſpenſed in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, in the Face of the Church. The Nature, Ends, and Uſes of Baptiſm ſpeak it proper and requiſite that it ſhould be openly adminiſtred and receiv'd. Now the Calls and Occaſions for this Ordinance are frequent: and therefore religious Aſſemblies for the Adminiſtration of this (among other Ordinances) ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.—Again, The <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Ordinance. Chriſtians muſt <hi>come together in the Church, into one place,</hi> when they would eat the Lord's Supper. (1 Cor. 11. 18, 20.) It is a common Feaſt, and one Inſtrument of the Communion of Saints, with one another as well as with Chriſt. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. <hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt? For, we being many, are one Bread and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</hi> or Loaf; the viſible ſign of Chriſt's Body, and emblem of the Union and Fraternity of His People. Now this Ordinance is of ſtanding Obligation, and to be <hi>frequently</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Church of Chriſt. 1 Cor. 5. 8. <hi>Let us keep the Feaſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26, 28. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this Cup, ſhew ye the Lord's Death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is a <hi>Feaſt;</hi> and we ſhould <hi>often</hi> ſeed upon our ſpiritual Food, for our Soul's nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and growth in Grace. Whenever the Feaſt is made, we are invited to come; and if we careleſly neglect it, we are guilty of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our backs on God, and ſlighting his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is the <hi>Memorial</hi> of Chriſt's dying and redeeming Love: which we are oblig'd in Gratitude to be <hi>often</hi> commemorating in all proper ways. It is called the <hi>Communion;</hi> being a ſpecial Means of ſweet Fellowſhip with God and near Acceſs to Him. Now we ſhould, be much in Communion with God, frequent in our religious Viſits and Approaches to Him. And therefore we ſhould be often at his Table, in his Houſe—Frequent Participation of the Lord's Supper is then the Duty of Chriſtians; and it is to be continu'd in to the end. <hi>Shew ye the Lord's Death, 'till He come;</hi> that is, 'till He come to judge the World, or (which is all one) 'till He call you away by Death.</p>
            <p>THUS I have made it appear, that by many <hi>Divine Precepts</hi> (direct of oblique) we are required to give our Attendence on the public Worſhip conſtantly and diligently.—We may now proceed to another Argument. Wherefore let us conſider—</p>

            <p>AND further, It is alſo peculiarly <hi>honorary</hi> to God. Public Worſhip duly performed, contributes more to the Honour of God, and the Credit of Religion, than any private and unſeen Devotions. Public Worſhip is the moſt open Teſtimony to the Being and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Providence of God. 'Tis a viſible Homage to God, whereby we <hi>glorify Him with our Bodies</hi> as well as Spirits; and <hi>honour Him with our Lips,</hi> as well as ſanctify Him in our Hearts.

3. WE might draw an Argument from the gracious <hi>PROMISES</hi> of God to ſuch as do their Duty in this matter.</p>
            <p>I mention'd ſeveral Promiſes before, as Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of public Worſhip's being <hi>acceptable to God.</hi> Here I mention them, as an Argument of it's being <hi>incumbent on us.</hi> I ſhall add in this place but two other Promiſes; and they are great and precious ones.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>If thou—call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words: then thou ſhalt delight thy ſelf in the Lord.—I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE and many other Promiſes there be to ſuch as are conſciencious Sabbatizers, and therefore ſtrict to the public Worſhip. Now theſe words of Promiſe are ſo many <hi>Bonds to Duty;</hi> Bonds as well as Motives; not only Invitations, but Obligations to it. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is natural and reaſonable, of our Duty from God's Promiſes. For, as one obſerves well, "There ſeems to be little difference betwixt what a <hi>Superior</hi> poſitively commands, and what He Kindly encourages". We ſhould

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>I might draw another Argument from the conſtant</hi> Inclination <hi>and Tendency of the</hi> New Nature <hi>in real Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Fruit of the Spirit is <hi>Love:</hi> Love to God, to his Name, Worſhip, and Service; Love to his Day, to his Miniſters and People: A Delight in the Communion of Saints; A Zeal for the public Good; Reſentment of public Evils, &amp;c. All which gracious Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have a tendency to bring us to the Houſe of God frequently: and they are all to be put into the <hi>Character</hi> of a devout Soul. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks the common Language of real Saints, when he ſays, <hi>How amiable are thy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, O Lord of Hoſts! I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ved the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thy Houſe. I was glad, when they ſaid unto me, Let us go into the Houſe of the Lord. Our feet ſhall ſtand within thy Gates, O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.—Becauſe of the Houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeek thy Good. If I forget thee, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, let my right Hand forget her Cunning. Let my Tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief Joy; which is builded as a City, whither the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the Lord, unto the teſtimony of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are the Diſpoſitions of a renewed Soul; and they are the fruits of the Spirit. Theſe divine Principles and Paſſions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd from above. And they are not implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in vain:</hi> but muſt be improv'd and purſu'd into agreeable practice. This is the Temper
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002431_0035_0FDB434033E5F708"/>
and Conduct of real Saints; and becomes ſo by the direction and operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>WE may hence then very well form an Argument for public Worſhip, and ſtrongly infer our Obligations to a diligent Attendence on it, as we would approve our ſelves the true Children of God, and not forfeit the Character of Chriſt's Diſciples.</p>
            <p>BUT let us conſider in the next place,—</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>OUR Duty is enforced and recommended by many worthy and warranted</hi> Patterns <hi>of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have the beſt Examples (worthy of all Imit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>WHAT more engaging Conſideration is there than the Example of our <hi>bleſſed Lord?</hi> Whoſe practice it was, in the days of His Fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to appear at the public Worſhip in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, ſometimes hearing and ſometimes teaching, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and in the Synagogues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and herein <hi>He has le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t us an Example, that we ſhould follow his Steps, and walk as he alſo walked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>primitive Christians</hi> were zealous Imitators of Chriſt in this: Of whom we read, Luke 24. 53. <hi>They were continually in the Temple, praiſing and bleſſing God.</hi> So Act. 2. 42. <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly</hi> in the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread and Prayers. They <hi>continued daily</hi> with one accord in the Temple (ver. 46.) So
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002431_0036_0FDB4341C2677E68"/>
Act. 9. 41. We read, <hi>that the Churches were edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, walking in the fear</hi> (the Worſhip) <hi>of the Lord.</hi> So we read of ſome (Act. 11. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.) <hi>That a whole year they aſſembled themſelves with the Church</hi> at Antioch; where the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians. And it ſeems to be ſpoken of as the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of the primitive Chriſtians to aſſemble every firſt day; Act. 20. 7. <hi>Upon the firſt day of the Week, when the Diſciples came together to break Bread, Paul preached to them.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> calls the firſt day the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> (Rev. 1. 10)</p>
            <p>NOW theſe Things were written for our <hi>Enſample.</hi> And we are called upon to be Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Be ye followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> So 1 Cor. 11. 1, 2, <hi>Be ye followers of me</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Now I praiſe you, Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances, as I delivered them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; For</hi> (as it follows ver. 23.) <hi>I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord that which alſo I delivered unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT now in the next place,—</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE Evidence of our Duty will ſhine with a more convincing Light, if we conſider the <hi>frequent, returning Occaſions</hi> there are for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip. There are public Occaſions often calling us up to the Houſe of God. Thus are there not public Mercies, which we ſhare in continually? And do not theſe demand pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> from every Member of the Body, and that frequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, Is there not continual occaſion for public <hi>Prayers?</hi> Are there not public Judgments to be deprecated?
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002431_0037_0FDB434342CDB278"/>
Public<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wants to be pray'd over? And the Caſes of public Perſons to be commended to God? And ſhould we not therefore frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet together for ſolemn Supplications and Interceſſions? Again, Is there not occaſion for public <hi>Confeſſions?</hi> Is there not public Guilt, to which every particular perſon's Sins do add, which calls for public Humiliations? And ſhould we not therefore frequently aſſemble to offer up our joynt penitent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to God, our Lawgiver and Judge? Again, Are there not religious <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Tranſactions,</hi> that demand public Meetings, and which need to be often repeated? Finally (in a Word) Have we not frequent occaſions to <hi>inquire</hi> at the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, to <hi>know</hi> our Duty; and do we not continually want <hi>new Supplys</hi> of Grace and Strength to <hi>do</hi> our Duty? We ſhould often go then to the Houſe of God; where He makes the brighteſt Diſcoveries and moſt bleſſed Communications of Himſelf unto His Children.</p>
            <p>THUS, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon us,</hi> by a conſtant ſucceſſion of various Occaſions, calling us to the Houſe of God continually. How unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable then muſt we be if we neglect that, which there is ſo much need for! The Reaſons of public Worſhip never ceaſe; the Occaſions for it are continually recurring. We ought then moſt diligently to attend it.</p>
            <p>BUT yet further to excite us to our Duty, let us, in the next place,—</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>CONSIDER the</hi> Advantages and happy Conſequences <hi>of a diligent Attendence on God's public Worſhip.</hi>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:002431_0038_0FDB43474DD4A640"/>
THESE are very many and very valuable: So that our <hi>Intereſt</hi> makes a ſtrong Demand upon us, and loudly pleads for the diſcharge of our Duty.</p>

HERE many Benefits often accrue to <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to unregenerate Souls.</hi> In God's Houſe is exhibited and held forth a bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> with all his ſaving Bleſſings, to every Sinner preſent. And here it pleaſes God ordinarily to meet his Elect, and begin his good Work in them. Here He graciouſly (by his Word and Spirit) convinces and converts them, opens their eyes, and turns them from darkneſs to light; from the power of Satan unto God: cauſes them to behold wondrous Things out of his Law and Goſpel: brings them to a fight of their Sin and Miſery by Nature, and of their Remedy by Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to a ſenſe of their need of Chriſt, and to a ſaving cloſure with him. In a Word, Here Sinners are brought to know the Things of their Peace, and to acquaint themſelves with God; and are begotten by his word of truth. Pſal. 87. 5. <hi>Of Zion it ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We read (fore-cited Act. 9. 31.) <hi>Then had the Churches reſt, and were edifyed, walking in the Fear of the Lord, and in the Comfort of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence thoſe expreſſions of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 84. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy Houſe.</hi>—<hi>Bleſſed is the man, whoſe ſtrength is in thee:</hi>—<hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength;</hi>

            <p>THE public Worſhip of God, if duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, has a <hi>natural</hi> Efficacy, to promote our Holineſs and Heavenly-mindedneſs. The very calling us out of our Houſes, and taking us off from our Secular Affairs, and engaging in religious Exerciſes, even theſe Things have a tendency to wean us from the World, and make us ſpiritually minded.—Again, The Preſence of our Fellow Saints is <hi>profitable</hi> to us in the Worſhip of God. This hath a natural influence to unite our hearts in brotherly Love; to diſpoſe us unto a becoming Reverence and Solemnity; to awaken our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to ſtrengthen our Faith, and to inflame our Devotion. The union of many devout Souls in a joint preſence, mutually raiſes and enlivens their affections. As the Collection of many diſperſed <hi>Rays</hi> into a narrow Compaſs, gives them a greater ſtrength and heat; or as the laying <hi>Coals</hi> of Fire together in a body, makes them burn the fiercer: Even ſo the Concurrence of a Multitude in the Solemnities of God's Houſe, tends to kindle and diffuſe a common Ardour in the worſhipping Aſſembly.

            <p>BUT then there is alſo a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Preſence of the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> our ſupreme Teacher and only Sanctifier; from whom the Saints often receive bleſſed Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, and ſpecial Communications, when waiting on him in his Houſe. Here they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive increaſe of Knowlege, and freſh ſupplies of Grace in the uſe of holy Ordinances: new Recruits of Strength, to fortify them againſt Temptations, to enable them unto Duty, &amp;c. I might obſerve, 'Twas, <hi>when they were all with one accord in one place,</hi> aſſembled for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, that there was ſuch a marvellous Effuſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as we read of, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>FURTHER, How often in the Aſſemblies of the Saints, are there the moſt refreſhing <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> derived to pious Souls! Here the Lord meets his People, and ſpeaks Peace unto them. They ſee him in his power and glory in his Sanctuary. They ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HERE are thoſe <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> as well as <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,</hi> that afford the trueſt, the ſweeteſt Pleaſure and Satisfaction to the ſpiritually

minded. Here they ſing the <hi>Songs</hi> of Sion, and celebrate the Praiſes of their God and Saviour. Here they pour out their Souls in humble <hi>Prayer,</hi> and are permitted familiarly to unboſom themſelves (in all their troubles) to their chief Friend and mighty Helper, the bleſſed God. Here they preach or hear the <hi>Word</hi> of Chriſt, which is better to them than their neceſſary food, ſweeter alſo than honey, and rather to be choſen than fine Gold. Here alſo they are admitted to <hi>faederal</hi> Tranſactions with God, which are the moſt awful, and yet joyful acts of Devotion. Here they ſit down at the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord; where they are brought nigh by the blood of the Lamb, and behold the King in his beauty. Here they feaſt upon the Memorials of Chriſt's dying Love, have their neareſt and moſt delightful approaches to God, and have their whole Souls ſometimes drawn out in ardent breathings and elevations heavenward. Their Hearts are inſpired with devout Fervours: and O how ſublime, how ſweet, the pleaſures of true Devotion! We read of the primitive <hi>Chriſtians, They gladly received the word; and they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, being stedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread &amp; prayers; and did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, praiſing God.</hi> How often are the Saints enlarged and carried out in Communion with God; and made joyful in his houſe of Prayer, by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwers of Peace, ſo that they cannot but ſay, <hi>It's good being here!</hi> Hither they
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002431_0044_0FDB435243086DA0"/>
come (it may be) with their various bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, their griefs, or fears, their doubts and temptations; as <hi>Hannah</hi> of old in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Soul came to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> or as <hi>Aſaph</hi> in his darkneſs and perplexity went into the <hi>Sanctuary of God:</hi> And here (like them) they receive help from above, obtain light and peace many times, ſo that they go away with their countenances no more ſad, and with their Mouths full of chearful Praiſes.</p>
            <p>IN a word, Here our Lord commands the Bleſſing, <hi>even Life for evermore.</hi> This is the Bleſſing out of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Bleſſing out of the <hi>houſe</hi> of God. This is the Benediction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced (from the Prieſts lips) upon the Congregation of the Lord: And if there be any Sons of peace among them, it comes down and reſts upon theſe devout Souls. This Bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is on the head of the Juſt. In the houſe of God they have Him by his witneſſing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to miniſterial Benedictions given in his Name. Here he ſeals them to the Day of Redemption. Here they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive bleſſed Aſſurances of their title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as are trained up and advanced in their meetneſs for Heaven; being inur'd to the Employments and anticipating the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of it. So that we may ſay with <hi>Jacob,</hi> Verily, <hi>this is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE may well then conclude with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, That <hi>it is good for us to draw near to God:</hi> And truly, the nearer the better. A devout and diligent waiting upon God in his houſe
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002431_0045_0FDB43546008D9F8"/>
is the ſure way, and ordinarily neceſſary, to our obtaining thoſe rich and great Bleſſings. Thus runs the Promiſe <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you,</hi> Jam. 4. 8. So Prov. 8. 34. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>watching daily at my Gates.</hi> Pſal. 92. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The oftner we come to the houſe of God, the better prepared for it we are like to be. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very opportunity duly imployed, will ſerve to confirm our Souls, to quicken and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our Graces, and improve our Comforts.</p>
            <p>IN a word, Waiting on God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances is the way to obtain thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings we need: And the more diligent and conſtant we are in the Application of proper means, the more likely we are to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the deſired End.</p>
            <p>NONE are got above the need of outward Helps and Means, whatever Proficiency they have already made in Knowledge and Grace.</p>
            <p>THE Benefit, the Succeſs of Ordinances is abſolutely in Chriſt's gift.</p>
            <p>WE have ground to hope for this Bleſſing to proſper us in the regular uſe of the Means at one time as well as another: And at all times, his Inſtitutions as means, have a like aptitude and tendency to the bleſſed End.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe Reflections then it appears, that we may look for a <hi>more abundant Bleſſing</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:002431_0046_0FDB435850D7C868"/>
to be upon us, the more conſtant and diligent we are in our ſerious attendence on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>NOW, what a ſtrong Incentive to our Duty is here, and what an irreſiſtible Argument is brought us? For every regular Motive affords a good Reaſon, and infers our juſt Obligations to a Thing. When Intereſt and Duty meet together and unite in their Demands, there is a double Bond upon us: And I would here add; None can rationally imagine but that, what hath ſuch an Aſpect upon our preſent and future Well-being, and ſo great a Tenden to our real Happineſs, as a cloſe Adherence to the public Worſhip of God thus apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath, muſt needs be our very important Duty, and bound upon us by the Laws of our own Conſtitution. For Self-love is a fundamental Principle in human Nature. Every thing has an innate and invincible <hi>Conatus</hi> or Endeavour and Propenſity towards it's own Perfection and Welfare: And every regular Exerciſe of this natural Paſſion is undoubtedly our proper Duty.</p>
            <p>BUT in the <hi>laſt</hi> place, I ſhall only add this one Hint further, to inforce all that has been ſaid,<abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>BY a frequent, ſteddy and devout Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the Worſhip of God in his Houſe, we ſhall <hi>imitate</hi> and hold a <hi>correſpondence</hi> with the bleſſed Congregation of Saints in the <hi>upper</hi> world, who are <hi>continually</hi> praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and ſerving him in his temple above
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002431_0047_0FDB4358F9E06800"/>
               <hi>day and night,</hi> and ſhall <hi>go no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> By worſhipping God aright here, we begin the Employment, that a bleſſed Eternity is to be ſpent in. And by Temple-Worſhip, in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, we do reſemble and have Communion with the glorious Society above, where Millions perhaps at once join their melodious Songs, and pay their exalted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions together. By this means there's a <hi>Harmony</hi> between Heaven and Earth; yea, in ſome ſort, a <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi> Churches walking in the faith and order of the Goſpel, are ſo many little Emblems of Heaven: and every pious Soul, when joyning in the public Aſſemblies, may juſtly look upon himſelf as tranſported into the very ſuburbs of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem; it being the neareſt Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and Approach to it in this World. In the ardours of his Devotion, the pious Soul mounts up, as upon Eagles Wings, and by faith joyns with the innumerable Company of glorify'd Spirits; mingling his humble praiſes with their triumphant adorations, and having ſometimes Joy unſpeakable and full of glory.—Altho' indeed, it is a Joy that a ſtranger intermeddles not with, and a Glory which the carnally minded know nothing of.</p>
            <p>BUT thus I have ſomewhat largely (much more largely than I at firſt intended) ſhown our manifold Obligations and Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be very conſtant and diligent in the practice of public Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:002431_0048_0FDB435B4F43A760"/>
               <hi>AND now, to apply in ſome general hints, what has been ſaid:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE much Compaſſion is due to ſuch pious Souls, as love and long for the Houſe of God, but are deny'd the advantage of public Worſhip, either wholly or frequently. <q>Such are truly to be pity'd and pray'd for, and (as there is opportunity) viſited and comforted<note n="†" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, Hence 'tis a fault and folly in Chriſtians (for the ſake of worldly Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations) to ſettle, and content themſelves in ſuch places, where the public Worſhip of God cannot be enjoy'd; where they forſake God, and forget his holy Mountain.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Hence 'tis the important duty of every Place and People deſtitute of God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip, to ſeek after the Settlement of Goſpel-Ordinances among them.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Chriſtians ſhould quicken and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and call upon one another (as there is occaſion) to go up to the Houſe of the Lord. Heads of Families ſhould command their Houſhold to keep the way of the Lord. Parents ſhould bring their Children betimes (as ſoon as can be convenient) with themſelves to the Houſe of God, and ſhould reach them an early Reverence and Eſteem for his public Worſhip.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Great is the Folly and Impiety of thoſe, who deſpiſe or lightly eſteem the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip, or any part of it; who count
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002431_0049_0FDB435CB34C56E8"/>
the public Attendence in God's Houſe a Burden, and the Sabbath a Wearineſs, and his Table or any of his Ordinances contemptible. Some there are who altogether abſent themſelves from public Worſhip: others that come to it but ſeldom; and Multitudes that attend it very careleſly; or very defectively, omitting ſome of the main duties of it.—But how great is the folly and guilt of all ſuch! O that they might be brought to Conviction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and no longer let any fooliſh Luſts, or carnal Reaſonings, or ſmall Inconveniences, detain them from the Houſe of God, or hinder them from their Duty in any Inſtance!</p>
            <p>BUT again, What has been ſaid, ſuggeſts matter of Humiliation to us all; in that we have no more affection and zeal towards the Houſe of God; that we are no more thankful for the Sanctuary-Opportunities we are ſo happily diſtinguiſhed withal above moſt in the World; that we bring forth no better fruit; and that we are ſo diſpos'd upon any trivial pretences many times to tarry away from the public Worſhip. O what a heavy Account, have multitudes of us to give up to God, of our abuſed or neglected Privileges!</p>
            <p>FURTHER MORE, What has been ſaid may ſerve to encourage and comfort ſuch as are careful duly to attend upon and to maintain the public Worſhip of God. Surely theſe ſhall receive the Bleſſing from the Lord, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs from the God of their Salvation! They take the beſt method to ſecure their own Happineſs, as well as to promote the Glory of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002431_0050_0FDB43614AD85E00"/>
God; and herein approve themſelves Men of Wiſdom and good Underſtanding.—And O how happy is the People, how happy the Places, that abound with Perſons of ſuch an excellent Spirit, and among whom the Houſe of God flouriſhes, and his Children like Olive-plants ſtand round about his Table. Happy is the People, that is in ſuch a Caſe. Surely Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nigh to ſuch a People, and Glory dwells in their Land. Peace will be within their Wails and Proſperity in their Palaces. This they have ground to hope for, from that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 24, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Finally, LET what has been ſaid, <hi>excite</hi> us all diligently and devoutly to frequent the public Worſhip of God, and not depart from his holy Temple. Let us all be firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of our Duty, and Intereſt, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Obligations, in this matter. Let none neglect the Houſe of God out of <hi>Profaneneſs.</hi> Take heed leſt there be any prophane Perſon among you, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> deſpiſing Goſpel-privileges. Let none neglect the public Worſhip out of ſpiritual <hi>Pride,</hi> as thinking themſelves wiſer than their Teachers, or better than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and of too high Attainments to ſtoop to the common forms of Worſhip. Let none neglect public Worſhip from a <hi>miſtaken notion</hi> as if they could perform their Devotions as acceptably, and get as much Good, at Home, as in the Church of God. This will appear a miſchievous Error, if what has been ſaid before be impartially weigh'd. O let there not be occaſion to complain, as to any of us,

               <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a Fool to get wiſdom, ſeeing he hath no heart to improve it.</hi>—Let us conſider how inexcuſable an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Abſence at any time from the Houſe of God is; how dangerous frequent Abſence, and what a ſad ſymptom of a carnal mind it carries in it.

Altars amiable. And let us attend all the parts of divine Service: coming ſeaſonably, that we may not miſs the Prayer (or any branch of it) which uſually begins the public Worſhip; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And let none content themſelves with the ſtanding Exerciſes only, without attending thoſe more ſolemn and extraordinary parts of public Worſhip, the Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> They that neglect theſe, are very defective in their Worſhip &amp; Chriſtianity: and ſuch are now ſolemnly call'd on to repent of and reform their criminal Delinquencies. If we would be accounted righteous before God, we muſt walk in all the Ordinances &amp; Commandments of the Lord, without any blameable Omiſſions. And (I might add) without any blameable mixture of humane Inventions. Let us adhere ſtedfaſtly then to <hi>that way</hi> of Worſhip, which we find to be moſt <hi>Scriptural;</hi> and ſtick cloſe to thoſe <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> in which we impartially judge is the moſt of true <hi>Goſpel-Order &amp; pure Religion.</hi>—But then let us not ſatisfy our ſelves with enjoying pure Inſtitutions and right Methods of <hi>Worſhip and Diſcipline:</hi> there muſt be in us a <hi>clean Heart,</hi> and a <hi>right Spirit;</hi> elſe bodily Exerciſe will profit us little. We muſt be <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>ſerious,</hi> as well as regular and frequent and abounding in our Worſhip. Let us then be careful in our Preparation at all times, and watchful in our Attendence, fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord: and whatever we do, do all in the name of Chriſt. So ſhall we ſecure the great

            <p>BUT it is time now to come to the other Obſervations from the Text; which I muſt give only a few Glances upon, having extended my Diſcourſe already beyond the uſual Limits. Wherefore—</p>
            <p>III. WE may obſerve, it's mention'd here in <hi>COMMENDATION</hi> of <hi>Anna,</hi> that ſhe <hi>departed not from the Temple:</hi> and it affords us this Leſſon, <hi>That 'tis a commendable thing, in Aged Perſons eſpecially, to be conſtant and diligent (as they are able) in attending upon the public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; and 'tis what they ſhould ſtudy to be exemplary for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a Duty, incumbent on them, in common with others. However eſtabliſh'd &amp; improv'd in Grace they may be, yet they are not above the need of Ordinances: and however advanc'd in Years, they muſt never think themſelves paſt them, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it only for young Beginners. It is expected of them that have dwelt in the Houſe of the Lord, that they ſtill bring forth Fruit even <hi>in old Age,</hi> (Pſal. 92. 14.) That they continue their Attendence on public Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and grow in their Fruitfulneſs under them.</p>
            <p>MOST commonly Aged Perſons have ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Advantages and Accommodations to attend God's Houſe with a greater frequency than others; I mean particularly, in reſpect of freedom from Buſineſs, and worldly Avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               </gap>it looſe from the Cares and Buſineſs of the World, as well as to be weaned much from the Diverſions &amp; Converſation of it. Indeed Elder Perſons, as well as Younger, ſhould have ſome Calling or Employment, in which they ought to ſpend part of their Time, for the ſerving of their Generation, and not devote themſelves (as the manner of ſome is) to Sloth and Eaſe; which often betrays them into many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts. However, It is not expected of the Ancient, nor is it commonly needful, that they attend their ſecular Affairs with that Induſtry and Application, which is both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and commendable in younger People. Perſons in Years may be allowed more Relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and may in ſome caſes exchange a difficult or inferiour Calling, for a more eaſy and honourable Employment. Nevertheleſs, in their ſerving of God and working out their own Salvation, it is incumbent on them and becomes them to be eminently zealous and induſtrious.

How pleaſant his Sabbaths; and how glad ought they to be, when called upon to go up to the Houſe of the Lord! There they ſhould be waiting for the Salvation of God! And not depart from his Temple!</p>
            <p>IT is expected of aged Saints, that their long <hi>Experience</hi> of the Sweetneſs and many Benefits of God's public Worſhip do inflame their Zeal and Love to his Houſe.</p>
            <p>AND then who ſhould be <hi>Examples</hi> to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not the aged Saints? Theſe ſurely are in an eminent degree obliged to be exemplary. They ſhould ſtudy to be living Rules to their Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; bright Patterns of all Piety, and Virtue; particularly of a love to and diligent attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the houſe of God. It is required of the Aged, that they be <hi>in behaviour as becometh Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> and that they be <hi>Teachers of good things</hi> by pattern as well as precept. (Tit. 2. 3.) A ſteddy and zealous Attendence upon the public Worſhip and Ordinances of God's houſe, is one inſtance of good Behaviour becoming Holineſs, in aged Saints eſpecially; and is one of thoſe good things, which they are requir'd to teach the Younger, and lead them into by their own inviting practice. Example is generally more attractive and engaging than bare Inſtruction. The Example of Aged Perſons carries a peculiar Authority &amp; Impreſſion with it; their Juniors
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002431_0056_0FDB4371C7BF0458"/>
being led, by a principle of Reverence and Eſteem, to the Imitation of them. When therefore Aged People are careleſs and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent about the public Worſhip, and omit any Duties or Ordinances of it. They ſet an ill Example, that will probably prove infectious and inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aring, eſpecially to younger Ones, to their Children, and Servants, and others. It is then a very aggravated miſ-behaviour, and double Guilt in aged Perſons, to neglect the Houſe of God, or the Table of Chriſt. In them it ſeems to be an open condemning the Divine Appointments, and giving a Judgment in favour of Irreligion, upon long obſervation or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: whence it often proves a ſtumbling and Temptation to younger People. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a very unſeemly, unnatural, and criminal thing in them. Hence then aged Perſons ſhould beware they don't ſet an ill example in this matter: but on the contrary, let their Light ſo ſhine before others, that they may (by the winning Pattern) be induced in like manner to glorify God. Elder Chriſtians ſhould go before others, and lead by their example in a diligent, reverent and early attendence on the public Worſhip: Thus they'l take one happy method to propagate the ſpirit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and a Love to God's houſe, unto coming Generations.</p>
            <p>Finally. IN a word, It behoves aged People, to be very frequent, and double their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in attending on public Worſhip, in order to redeem the many Opportunities they have loſt in the courſe of their Lives, to repair

IN every Generation God has had ſome, that have faithfully adhered to him, publickly own'd and worſhip'd him. Some of all Ages, ſome of both Sexes; Old and Young, Male and Female. My Text leads me only to take notice of the <hi>Ancient,</hi> and the <hi>Female. Anna</hi> is the Inſtance in our Text, who was a Widow of great Age, and departed not from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And in the Chapter preceeding, we have another famous inſtance in aged <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> of whom that excellent Character is given, <hi>ſhe was righteous before God, walking in all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances &amp; commandments of the Lord blameleſs.</hi>—And how many may we ſuppoſe were <hi>Aged</hi> Women (beſides <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord) among the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Jeſus</hi> to his Croſs; concerning whom we have that honourable Record, Act. 1. 14. <hi>They continued</hi> (with the Brethren) <hi>in prayer and Supplication with one accord.</hi>—Alſo among the <hi>honourable Women</hi> &amp; devout <hi>Greeks,</hi> of whom we read, (Act. 17.) that they <hi>received the word with all readineſs, and ſearched the Scriptures daily,</hi>—We may ſuppoſe not a few were Aged Ones.—No doubt they were chiefly <hi>ancient</hi> Matrons, that compos'd the <hi>Women's Meeting,</hi> to which <hi>Paul</hi> preached; as we read, Act. 16. 13. <hi>On the Sabbath we went out of the City by a River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, where Prayer was wont to be made, and we ſat down and ſpake to the Women, which reſorted thither.</hi> We read of <hi>Mark'</hi>s pious Mother, at whoſe houſe many were gather'd together praying, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 12. Furthermore, How cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated is <hi>Timothy's</hi> Grand-Mother <hi>Lois,</hi> and

his Mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> for the unfeigned Faith, that dwelt in them, and which (no doubt) was expreſſed in all Worſhip and Devotion. Again, What a notable Woman was <hi>Priſcilla</hi> (one in Years Probably) whom we find attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Public Aſſemblies, and in private inſtructing <hi>Apollos</hi> a public Teacher; whom the Apoſtle calls his <hi>Helper in Chriſt,</hi> and unto whom ſays he) not only I give Thanks, but alſo <hi>all the Churches of the Gentiles.</hi> Again, we read of the <hi>Elect Lady</hi> (with <hi>her Siſter</hi>) walking in the Truth, and beloved of all them that have known the Truth.—So we read of <hi>

            </p>
            <p>BUT what ſhall I more ſay? For the time would fail me to tell of <hi>Eve</hi> (the Mother of all Living) and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Rebekah,</hi> and <hi>Deborah</hi> her Nurſe; of <hi>Miriam,</hi> who preſided in an Aſſembly of pious Women of Iſrael, leading the Song in the praiſes of God, as afterwards did <hi>Deborah</hi> that judged Iſrael; ſo likewiſe <hi>Huldah,</hi> the Propheteſs, who is ſaid to dwell in the College at Jeruſalem; and <hi>Naomi,</hi> and <hi>Hannah,</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and many other holy Women in old time, who truſted in God, and continued in Supplications and Prayers; who brought forth fruit in old Age, and were ſtill flouriſhing in the Courts of the Lord.</p>
            <p>IN all Ages of the Church there have been ſome ſuch; Daughters that have done virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; and aged Mothers in Iſrael, that have
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002431_0060_0FDB437DB2595FB0"/>
               <hi>excelled</hi> in Virtue and been ſhining Patterns of vital Piety and Devotion. In <hi>Church Hiſtory</hi> we meet with many Inſtances, worthy to be added unto thoſe which the <hi>Scripture-Story</hi> preſents us withal.</p>
            <p>AND no part of the World (I believe) is capable of furniſhing out a better Hiſtory, than <hi>New-England,</hi> the place of our happy Abode; which (through the Grace of God) has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been very highly favoured and honored in this Regard. From the beginning to this day, our pious praying Mothers (who always make up a conſiderble part of our Congregations for Worſhip) have been in no little degree the Strength and Beauty of our Churches.</p>
            <p>BUT alas! How is the Glory departing from us, in this reſpect as well as others! The firſt ſtock of godly Men &amp; Women is long ſince extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Their Succeſſors fell ſhort of them abundantly, both in number and worth; as the preſent Generation does even of them. Yet (bleſſed be God) there is ſtill a remnant among us, in whom the power and life of Religion is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſome aged Women as well as Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Godlineſs, whoſe grave Faces and good Deportment in the Houſe of God and at his Table, add no little beauty and ſolemnity to our worſhipping Aſſemblies.—May they ſtill live, our Glory and Joy, our Strength and Safety! And the Lord God of our Fathers make them a thouſand times ſo many as they are; and bleſs them as He hath promiſed, ſaying, <hi>Even to old age I am He, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you and deliver you!</hi> Iſai. 46. 4.</p>

BUT I haſten now to the laſt Obſervation from the Text; which is—</p>
            <p>V. <hi>AMONG other Saints, the</hi> aged Handmaids <hi>of the Lord do particularly deſerve a Name in Iſrael; are to be highly eſteem'd and honour'd, and their Memory reverenc'd after their Deceaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are required to honor all them that fear the Lord, but eſpecially the <hi>aged</hi> Saints. Theſe are, while <hi>living,</hi> to have a peculiar Reſpect ſhown them. Whatſoever, Infirmities natural or moral may attend them, yet they are worthy of double Honour from us. Lev. 19. 32. <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary Head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God.</hi> So 1 Tim. 5. <hi>Rebuke not</hi> (magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) <hi>an aged Perſon, but intreat him as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the elder Women as Mothers. Honour Widows that are widows indeed, who truſt in God, and continue in prayers night and day, and are well reported of for good Works.</hi> Such aged Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men muſt be honour'd, valu'd, reverenc'd, and (if poor) well maintain'd. Eſpecially the Children of ſuch ſhould put this Honour upon them. Hence the Apoſtle adds, <hi>If any Widow have Children or Nephews</hi> (Grand-children or other near Relations) <hi>let them learn firſt to ſhew Piety at home, and to requite their Parents, for this is good and acceptable before God.</hi>—The fifth Commandment requires Children to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Father and Mother, and that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aged. It is great Impiety to neglect, or any way diſregard our Parents eſpecially in their advanced Age. Hence that Caution,

We ſhould honour their hoary heads; ſtudy to make their age eaſy to them as much as poſſible; wiſh for the leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening out of their pious and uſeful Lives; and not be weary of them nor contemn them (as the manner of ſome is) altho' they ſhould out-live their Serviceableneſs. Our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> has ſet us a bright Example of filial Duty to our aged Parents, who ſeeing his poor widow-Mother ſtanding by his Croſs (as he was dying) ſaid to his beloved Diſciple, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Mother!</hi> And from that hour, that Diſciple took her to his own home, (Joh. 19. 27.) The very light of Nature, and the cuſtom of moſt civiliz'd Nations teach us to honour Old-Age, eſpecially when crowned with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: And particularly to honour it in our own Parents. Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> paſſes that ſevere Sentence upon Children that do not ſhew Piety at home, <hi>That they have denied the Faith, and are worſe than Infidels.</hi> Thus then we are obliged to put honour upon aged Saints, and particularly our aged Mothers while living. They are alſo to be honoured <hi>after their Deceaſe.</hi>

            <p>THUS, the <hi>Death</hi> of ſuch is to be <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi> The Loſs of any real Saint is to be conſider'd and bewail'd: But eſpecially the Loſs of elder Chriſtians. Yea, the Death of aged Women that fear the Lord (whatever

Though full of days, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Shock of Corn in it's ſeaſon, Yet their Death is to be lamented.

            <p>THEY are alſo <hi>to be had in Remembrance,</hi> and their Memory to be <hi>bleſſed.</hi> They are to be remembered with Love and Honour; and being dead, yet with <hi>Abel</hi> to be ſtill <hi>ſpoken of</hi> with Praiſe.

               <hi>Anna</hi> (of whom we have ſuch an honorable Mention here) doubtleſs was <hi>deceaſed</hi> long before the Goſpel of <hi>Luke</hi> was written; tho' her Death be not expreſly taken notice of. The deceaſed Children of God are not to be ſoon forgotten. Eſpecially eminent Saints whether Men or Women, their Names ſhould live with us, after they are dead; and their Memories be dear and precious to us. As to their Infirmities and Blemiſhes, theſe indeed ought to be bury'd in oblivion and ſilence: But their Virtues and Excellencies are to be remembered and ſpoken of with honour. The Dead may be praiſed (as they deſerve it) with good Authority, the inſpired Hiſtorian having ſet us a pattern; as well as the royal Prophet (long before) in his funeral Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um on his Brother <hi>Jonathan.</hi> And how full of <hi>Elegy</hi> is the <hi>Eleventh</hi> Chapter to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;</hi> wherein we have the Apoſtle celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Names of many ancient Worthies, and ſummarily rehearſing their Story: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom we find ſeveral <hi>Women</hi> (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd or refer'd to) as aged <hi>Sarah;</hi> the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sareptha;</hi> and the <hi>Shunammite,</hi> who was (probably an aged as well as) a great Perſon.</p>
            <p>AND did not our Saviour decree that honour to a Woman (Mark 14. 9.) <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, this alſo that ſhe hath done, ſhall be ſpoken of for a memorial of her!</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends this Woman's Piety to the Applauſe
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002431_0065_0FDB4389469D40A8"/>
of his People in all ſucceeding ages; and by his direction, the memory of it is perpetuated in the ſacred Records, which of all the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of Fame, will ſound the longeſt as well as loudeſt. <q>Though the honour of <hi>Christ</hi> is principally <hi>deſigned</hi> in the Goſpel, yet the honour of his Saints and Servants is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>overlook'd.</hi>
               </q> The memory of this Woman was to be embalmed; not by <q>dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church to her, (as One<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> remarks,) or keeping an annual Feaſt in honour of her, or preſerving a piece of her broken Box for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Relique: but by reſerving a Record of her Piety, in the Archives of the Church, and making mention of it in the preaching of the Goſpel: wherby Honour redounds to Chriſt himſelf, who in this world, as well as in that to come, will be <hi>glorified in his Saints, and admired in them that believe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, AS their Memory is to be preſerv'd and reverenc'd, ſo their exemplary Piety is to be <hi>imitated</hi> by Survivers. <q>The <hi>Dying</hi> of old Chriſtians ſhould be the <hi>Quickning</hi> of young Ones.</q> As the old Stock of Profeſſors goes off, there ſhould be a freſh Supply out of the ſucceeding Generation, that the Cauſe of God may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>LET it then be a brief Addreſs to the riſing and ſtanding Generations among us, in the

Words of the Apoſtle, (Heb. 6. 12.) <hi>Be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them, who through faith and patience do inherit the promiſes.</hi> Let us endeavour by a diligent Imitation of them (as well as we can) to fill up the Vacancies that are made by the removal of one and another of the paſſing Generation. Let the <hi>Daughters of Zion</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly be exhorted, to ſtudy a Conformity to the excellent Patterns, which you have ſeen in the holy Lives of ſome of the devout Mothers in Iſrael. Let our young Women preſerve a great Eſteem for the aged Handmaids of the Lord; improve them while they live; lament them when they die; and as you riſe up in their room, labour to make good their ground, ſtand in the gaps, and repair the breaches; that there may be as little miſs of them as poſſible. Seek God betimes. Seek firſt the Kingdom of God. Flee youthful Luſts. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Holineſs, and adorn your ſelves with good Works, as did the holy Women in the old time. Wherein they followed Chriſt do you follow them. Whatſoever you have ſeen vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, pious, &amp; praiſe-worthy in any gone before you, diligently imitate the ſame. Cry to God for a double portion of that good Spirit which was in them, and give him no reſt, till it be fallen upon you. With God is the reſidue of the Spirit. Ask and ye ſhall receive.</p>
            <p>TO conclude, Let all the Servants of Chriſt among us ſend up their fervent Cries to the Throne of Grace, in behalf of the riſing Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that God would pour out his Spirit
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002431_0067_0FDB438D7A81D820"/>
from on high upon them, that they may be a godly Seed, a Generation of his praiſe. Beg of God, that He would graciouſly cloſe up the Breaches made in our Walls by the removal of the Prudent and the Ancient, the Honorable and the Devout, of both Sexes: That He wou'd raiſe up of our Sons and our Daughters to be Nazarites, ſeparated and ſanctified ones, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to repair the Loſſes, and bind up the Wounds we are at preſent bleeding under: That our Sons may be as Plants grown up in their Youth, and our Daughters as Corner-Pillars, poliſhed and prepared for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. That the Lord would appear in his Glory, and build up our Sion; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the bars of her Gates, and bleſs her Children within her.</p>
            <p>THUS ſhall the Generation going off, lay down their hoary Heads in the Grave, with Comfort, ſeeing a hopeful Progeny coming on, to take and fill their places.</p>
            <p>THUS ſhall the Throne of Chriſt endure among us, and our Candleſtick not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>THE Beauty of the Lord our God will be upon us, and Glory dwell in our Land.
