            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHOEVER will peruse, with attention, the faithful page of history, will find the same causes invariably producing the same effects.</p>
            <p>PUBLICK VIRTUE, or a strong sense of our interest in the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prosperity of the government of which we are members, piety towards GOD, fortitude, justice, temperance, frugality, and industry, have ever led to empire and political grandeur; while, on the other hand, LUXURY, that most baneful and destructive disease of the <hi>body politick,</hi> hath ever proved, and ever will prove, fatal to PUBLICK VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUE, ever blast the fairest constitution, and finally pull down in ruins the strongest empire.</p>
            <p>NEITHER the great despotick government, nor the small free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, can withstand its baleful effects.</p>

            <p>ROME, in her youth and <note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 1.</note> manhood, the seat of piety, the purest patriotism, simplicity of manners, justice, honour, temperance, fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and splendid poverty, in her old age was seized with the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical disease, and, at last, fell a victim to the most infamous, degrading venality and political depravity that ever destroyed a once great and free people. When, after the conquest of <hi>Antiochus the Great, luxury</hi> was introduced at ROME, the <hi>manners of the</hi> people soon began to feel its pernicious effects; but when CARTHAGE, her dreaded rival, sunk under the weight of her all-conquering arms, and ceased to exist, an irresistible torrent of corruption overwhelmed the mistress of the world, and prepared her the ready victim of her own corrupt citizens.</p>
            <p>ALL veneration for religion, oaths, justice, modesty, and decency, became annihilated; the love of their country, which had enabled the ROMANS to accomplish so many splendid atchievements, was now no more: <hi>money,</hi> which alone could enable them to satisfy their insatiable, artificial wants, became the sole object of their pursuit: <note n="†" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 2.</note>
               <hi>poverty,</hi> which in the virtuous ages of the Republick, had been so truly honourable,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019017_0008_0FA95CB68E914B38"/>
was then become reproachful and contemptible; the rich employed their wealth to acquire power, and their power, when acquired, in every species of violence and oppression.</p>
            <p>IN her last stage of political depravity all the honours and offices of the State where openly sat up to <note n="*" place="bottom">Omnia venalia, omnia exeunt in lucio, SAL.</note> sale; and finally, when the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious parricide, JULIUS CAESAR, appeared, the PUBLICK LIBERTY and the <hi>whole empire</hi> became the object of purchase, and the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate sons of ROME suffered themselves and every thing to become the property of one of their fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>THE introduction and progress of <hi>freedom</hi> have generally attended the introduction and progress of <hi>letters and science.</hi> In despotick go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments the people are mostly illiterate, rude, and uncivilized; but in States where CIVIL LIBERTY hath been cherished, the human mind hath generally proceeded in improvement,—learning and knowledge have prevailed, and the arts and sciences have flourished.</p>
            <p>IN the justly celebrated city of antient ATHENS, as well as in the other free cities and States of GREECE, where nothing existed to depress or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract its elastick force, the <hi>human mind</hi> expanded freely, reached the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest heights of elevation, and by the most vigorous, the most noble, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, produced whatever can do honour to the heart, the head, the hand of man. <hi>There,</hi> under the invigorating shade of PUBLICK LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY, that other TREE OF LIFE, were brought forth those exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site works of labour, of art, of learning, and of invention, which for ages charmed the astonished world; even the history of some of which continue to delight the more enlightened of all civilized coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at this very day; while the inimitable surviving works of their Orators, Poets, and Philosophers, afford infinite satisfaction, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and instruction to the <hi>modern</hi> world. By her conquest of <hi>Greece</hi> ROME acquired a knowledge of, and a taste for, the more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arts and sciences; nor was it long after her conquest of the polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019017_0009_0FA95CB74AFA8048"/>
and enlightened people of <hi>that</hi> country before she transplanted into <hi>Italy</hi> most of the noble inventions and improvements of her new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. In both countries the arts and sciences continued afterwards to flourish, and in ROME progressively to aspire to true <hi>attick</hi> beauty and excellence, until that memorable aera in which the mistress of the world, by the unbounded luxury, <note n="*" place="bottom">Corrumpere et corrumpi soeculum vocatur. TAC.</note> venality, and profligacy of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated sons became unworthy longer to enjoy that FREEDOM which is ever the companion of piety, love of our country, frugality, justice, and temperance. At or about that period the improvements of the <hi>human mind</hi> seem nearly to have reached their meridian altitude. It was not long, however, that they remained even stationary; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the reign of the deceitful, treacherous, ungrateful, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive <hi>Octavianus,</hi> the second despot Caesar of the fallen Republick, the arts and sciences began to decline their languid heads.</p>
            <p>THE horrible despotism of many of the succeeding Emperors co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incided to extinguish the glorious flame of emulation, to depress and debase the free spirits of the human race, and to cast a deep gloom upon every thing liberal, great, and noble. THE PUBLICK having become the property of one man alone, no other thought the same, or any thing tending to its glory or exaltation, worthy of <hi>his</hi> notice or deserving of <hi>his</hi> attention. The spirits of men were then broken by the <hi>wildest misrule,</hi> and universal dejection and despondency must have prevailed among <hi>all</hi> of finer feeling, understanding, and taste.

A more mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, though a more melancholy, picture of an arbitrary, despotick government is not, perhaps, to be produced in any other history or to be met with in any other author whatever: a picture, the features of which <hi>we</hi> cannot too often contemplate, and from which <hi>we</hi> may learn to admire, to love, to be enthusiastically attached to that mild form of equal government which <hi>we</hi> now so happily enjoy, and for which, under the Almighty Disposer of all things, <hi>we</hi> are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately indebted to that most fortunate event, the anniversary of which <hi>we this</hi> day celebrate, and which every <hi>true American</hi> ought <hi>ever</hi> gratefully to commemorate.</p>

arts and sciences began to lift up their dejected heads. But, alas! these days of sunshine were short and fleeting. A tumultuous, unbridled, military government soon succeeded, when every thing appeared as dark, or, if possible, more dark and gloomy than before. Life was as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secure, and agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, finding no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, no protection, dwindled away, decayed, and sunk into universal neglect.</p>
            <p>INFAMOUS as the <hi>British Nabob-makers in the East,</hi>—the military despots made and unmade Emperors, and in one instance, the <hi>Praetorian guards</hi> compelled the Roman people to submit to a state of degradation which sunk them to the level of the vilest slaves, and even to the level of the brute creation.

ABOUT that memorable period when William the bastard, Duke of Normandy, invaded and <note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 4.</note> conquered <hi>England,</hi> by the death of HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROLD and the defeat of the <hi>English</hi> at the battle of <hi>Hastings,</hi> gleams of scientifick light began to beam through the Gothick cloud and to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate the European world. By that conquest, the <hi>vanquished na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were put into a situation of receiving the rudiments of science and of cultivation, and of emerging from their former barbarous and rude state of manners. Gradual and flow, however, was the progress of human knowledge and improvement, even in the other parts of the European world until the fourteenth century, when the great designs of that benevolent Being who ruleth over all, began to ripen into birth. In this remarkable century, literature suddenly diffused itself through most parts of <note n="†" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 5.</note> Europe, <hi>gun-powder,</hi> the <hi>art of printing,</hi> and the <hi>mariner's compass</hi> were invented, LUTHER appeared in Germany, and a <hi>reformation in religion</hi> took place; and, at last, towards the close of that century, <note n="‡" place="bottom">He set sail from Cadiz the second day of August, 1492, a little before sunset, and after a passage of thirty-three days he landed upon one of the Bahama islands, to which he gave the name of St. Salvador.

Had the calm, mild voice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring REASON been duly heared, the poor, ignorant, deluded people would have receded from the disgraceful contention convinced that to <hi>them,</hi> the consequence of the brutal conflict, <hi>slavery,</hi> was the same, whether a tyrant of the <hi>House of York</hi> or of <hi>Lancaster</hi> prevailed. But, alas! <hi>their</hi> minds were then debased by slavery <note n="†" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 9.</note>; <hi>their</hi> understandings were clouded with ignorance, bigotry, and error. <hi>Villenage,</hi> that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest fruit of <hi>feudal policy,</hi> was then still in full force in ENGLAND: <hi>freedom</hi> was then unknown in that unhappy kingdom.

By <hi>tenure</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> was bound to attend the KING in his wars for a certain number of days, <note n="‡" place="bottom">For forty days.</note> and, in like manner, by a similar law of bondage, was the wretched <hi>vassal</hi> compellable to follow and serve his LORD in those wars.</p>

IN the reign of HENRY the VII. <hi>commerce</hi> began to lift her head in <hi>England,</hi> the arts and sciences to bud, and manufactures to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; a revolution in the <hi>manners</hi> of the people began to take place and paved the way for a revolution in the system of government; the <hi>Commons,</hi> who had been generally in a state of ignorance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon their <hi>feodal</hi> Lords, began to be enlightened by science, and the whole kingdom to entertain a more just opinion of the dignity and rights of mankind.

Bright and, in general, happy was the distinguished long reign of that <note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 12.</note> affable and popular Queen, who, by her vigorous exertions in the cause of LIBERTY enabled the oppressed States of <hi>Belgia</hi> to throw off the intolerable yoke of the bigotted tyrant, PHILIP the II. of <hi>Spain,</hi> and fully to establish then independence. The introduction and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of freedom attended the introduction and progress of science, of arts, manufactures, and commerce, and the fair tree of LIBERTY now first began to <hi>blossom</hi> in ENGLAND; <hi>Virginia</hi> was discovered by Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh</hi> and was attempted to be settled, and the land we now dwell in was found out by <hi>Gosnold.</hi> No Sovereign ever held the sceptre in ENGLAND who appears to have gained such an universal ascendency over the affections of the people as ELIZABETH, nor any of their Monarchs so sincerely and affectionately to have loved that people.</p>

which he transplanted into his new dominion, suddenly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to places of power and profit, and to titles of the highest honour and distinction. The vain disposition of the pedantick Monarch, who imagined himself possessed of inexhaustible learning and of never-failing judgment, prevailed upon him to join the impious, sycophantick <note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 14.</note> lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the church, and from a <hi>Judge</hi> to turn a personal, loquacious, and furious <hi>advocate</hi> against the Dissenters, then denominated <hi>Puritans,</hi> of whom were our enlightened, manly ancestors. After having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued as <hi>an advocate,</hi> and as <hi>a Judge</hi> determined, against those men who knew that the <hi>liturgy of the church of England</hi> was little more than mere translation of the old Popish mass-book, and that too many of the forms and foppish ceremonies of the Roman church was retained in the church of their native country, JAMES issued two proclamations, the one commanding <hi>Jesuits</hi> and <hi>Popish Priests</hi> to leave the kingdom; in which, however, he intimated that <hi>he would have a regard to tender consciences;</hi> the other enjoining the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> to a strict <hi>conformity to the established church,</hi> and in which he gave <hi>them</hi> no hope of any, the least indulgence.

The intolerant zeal of a tyrannical <note n="†" place="bottom">Archbishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who succeeded the adulating, priestly, sycophant <hi>Whitgift.</hi> See appendix, No. 15.</note> high priest, supported by arbitrary principles of an impolitick King, soon produced a severe prosecution of the Puritans, and many families, among whom were the first of our pious ancestors, were compelled to fly from their friends, their relations, and their native land, and to seek for liberty and rest in foreign countries. The first church of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors with their venerable pastor took refuge in <hi>Holland</hi> where, finding the <hi>manners</hi> of the people more licentious than <hi>they</hi> thought

consistent with true piety, after a few years residence, they first form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the resolution of seeking an asylum from <hi>royal</hi> and <hi>prelatick tyranny</hi> in the wilds of this new world. Having a firm reliance upon the goodness and mercy of their GOD, they embarked for <hi>Hudson's River,</hi> committed themselves to the raging element of the sea, and resolutely determined to live or to die FREEMEN. Their <hi>manners,</hi> formed by letters and a religious education, and exercised in the schools of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and oppression, were pious, simple, frugal, decent, patient, resolute. HE who neither slumbers nor sleeps,—HE who directeth <hi>all</hi> things in the heavens and in the earth, covered them with HIS al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty wings, and in his wisdom decreed that this then dreary wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness should receive the determined fugitives.—Strong to labour and patient of fatigue, the dark, thick woods of the ancient forest fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and the country around them soon began to blossom like the garden of Eden. Conscious of the grateful duties they owed to their Common Parent and Benefactor, they soon regulated the publick offices and ceremonies of religion, and, sensible that the <hi>manners</hi> of a free people depend greatly upon <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>publick instruction,</hi> they wisely instituted publick free schools for the education of youth in every part of their settlement, the benefits of which we all feel the effects of even at this very memorable day. Thus began the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this country, not by fellow-subjects <hi>sent out</hi> under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, patronage and protection of the parent-state, but by an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>a persecuted sect of christians,</hi> who had been compelled to fly their native country and seek for shelter and protection, first in foreign States, and afterwards in the wilds of this then uncultivated land.</p>

Then the country had so increased in people and in commerce that it attracted the rapacious eyes of the ministerial harpies, who soon discovered an anxious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to quarter their hungry minions upon, and to draw a revenue from, the descendants of those very persons whom the tyranny and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry of English Kings and of English Bishops had driven from their native country and cruelly compelled to seek an asylum in the then uncultivated wilderness of <hi>America.</hi>

            <p>THE infamous <hi>Edward Randolph</hi> came over from ENGLAND in the year 1676; but because the independent FREEMEN of this country, conscious of their own dignity, received him not with all that humble submission with which slaves receive their haughty master, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conceived, and ever after retained, a most inveterate hatred to the people and to the government of this Commonwealth, wrote to his abandoned Sovereign, his Ministers and Bishops, made several voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to ENGLAND and back again; like many of his more modern

brethren, most grossly misrepresented the actions of our manly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors and of <hi>their</hi> Government in <hi>church</hi> and <hi>state;</hi> wrote and talked, and worked, and wriggled himself into places of profit and trust; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated with a few unprincipled traitors who then disgraced this their native country; nor ever ceased his vile, malicious labours until he had overturned the then mild, equal government of MASSACHUSETTS<note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 18.</note>; and in the stead thereof procured and arbitrary tyranny to be here esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. His iniquitons, base triumphs, however, lasted not long; for, in less than three full years, the false accuser and his despot friend, the royal Governour, Sir <hi>Edmond Andross,</hi> by the stern hand of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting justice, were hurled headlong from their new seats of lawless power and avarice.</p>
            <p>THE sacred fire of liberty was smothered for a while nor shewed abroad its chearing light, but still it was not quite extinct: in former days it had been carefully preserved, and highly cherished by our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ancestors, and it had been seen to flame most bright before the leyes of their <hi>well instructed</hi> descendants. The annihilation of their chartered rights by the tyrant JAMES the II. the last <hi>male Monarch</hi> of the detested house of <hi>Stuart</hi> that disgraces the annals of <hi>English history,</hi> the restrictions of their trade, the <hi>restraint of the publick press,</hi> and the oppressions, exactions, and insolence of the new exotick Governour, of the unprincipled <hi>Randolph,</hi> and of the other royal minions, rouzed the people into action and kindled up the dying sparks of PUBLICK LIBERTY, which soon burst forth with irresistable violence and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all those enemies of FREEDOM and of MASSACHUSETTS.</p>
            <p>UPON the 18th day of April, 1689, the inhabitants of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try suddenly rushed to arms, under the conduct of the gallant young <note n="†" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 19.</note> NELSON marched to the citadel, and there compelled the tyrant, <hi>Andross,</hi> to surrender up the fort and government at discretion, together with <hi>Randolph</hi> and all the traitors who had fled there for protection.</p>
            <p>A REVOLUTION, unknown to them, had two months before taken

            <p>THE new King and Queen granted us a new <note n="†" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 21.</note> charter, our country again flourished and increased, the <hi>manners</hi> of our forefathers were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and the rising generation imbibed and cherished the same inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent spirit of freedom which had so conspicuously distinguished their virtuous ancestors, the publick seminaries of learning were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and encouraged, and the <hi>whole body of the people</hi> were instructed in letters and in the rudiments of useful knowledge.</p>
            <p>THE same causes still produce the same effects,—and the <hi>manners</hi> and principles of our people, formed by the same modes of education, thank GOD! even at this day, are nearly similar to those of their great forefathers.</p>
            <p>IN no part of the habitable globe is learning and true <hi>useful</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge so universally disseminated as in <hi>our native country.</hi> Who hath seen a native adult that cannot write? who known a native of the age of puberty that cannot read the bible? In what other land do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon country people who bring their produce to the daily markets, so readily calculated, and by a <hi>memoritor arithmetick</hi> so duly ascertain the various prices of the numerous commodities they vend? Where are the people who so universally interest themselves in all publick political matters as our fellow-citizens at large, and our hardy yeomanry in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular? Who are better acquainted with the various, daily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the earth than the whole body of this people? Who debate more freely? Who, in general, conclude more justly?—and to whom are we indebted for these invaluable advantages, for the distinguishing characteristick of a knowing and enlightened people? Under GOD, we certainly derive all these benefits from the piety, wisdom, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our renowned forefathers, who, sensible that the manners and principles of a people depend upon education, took care, by the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019017_0020_0FA95CC3B408B590"/>
of publick schools, to instruct every one in the knowledge of letters, religion, and civil liberty.</p>
            <p>FROM the time of the <hi>new charter</hi> nothing happened among us so material as to merit our particular attention at present. In the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding reign of Queen ANN, the last of the <hi>Stuart</hi> name that filled the English throne, an event, however, of the greatest importance to US and to the ENGLISH took place. In the fifth year of the reign of that Queen a statute passed for the <note n="*" place="bottom">It took place on the first of May, 1707.</note> union of the two kingdoms of ENGLAND and SCOTLAND; by the fourth article of which, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that "ALL the subjects of the united kingdom shall have full freedom of trade and navigation to any port within the united king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and <hi>the dominions thereto belonging;</hi> and that there should be a <hi>communication of all other rights</hi> which belonged to the subjects of either kingdom."</p>
            <p>BY this article our <hi>tender, nursing mother,</hi> as she has been most falsely and impudently called, without consulting our legislative bodies, or asking the consent of any one individual of our countrymen, assumed upon herself to convey, as stock in trade, one full undivided moiety of <hi>all the persons</hi> and <hi>all the estates and property of the</hi> FREEMEN <hi>of</hi> AME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICA to an <hi>alien</hi> who will prove an harsh, cruel, and unrelenting step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother. Then, too much blinded with foolish affection for that country whose oppressions had forced our stern, free-minded progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors into these remote regions of the world,—into an howling and a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage wilderness,—like children, not yet attained to the years of reason and discretion, who inconsiderately suppose their parent ever in the right, our predecessors sat quiet under the arbitrary disposition, nor once mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured aloud at the unnatural, and to us iniquitous, transaction.</p>
            <p>OUR new parent, GREAT-BRITAIN, then made our <note n="†" place="bottom">By the second article of the act of union, the succession to the monarchy is to be to the Princess <hi>Sophia,</hi> Electoress and Dutchess Dowager of <hi>Hanover,</hi> in default of issue of the then Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
               </note> Kings, appointed our Governours, and <hi>kindly</hi> sent many of her needy sons to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019017_0021_0FA95CC575B47578"/>
live upon the fruits of our toil, to reap where neither <hi>she</hi> nor <hi>they</hi> had sown, and to fill the various offices which she had generously created here, for <hi>her</hi> and <hi>their</hi> own emolument. Every twentieth cousin of an ale-house-keeper who had a right of voting in the election of a member of Parliament was cooked up into a <hi>gentleman,</hi> and sent out here, commissioned to insult the hand that gave him daily bread. Although greatly displeased with these injurious proceedings we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the harsh hand of our unfeeling, selfish step-mother, nor once remonstrated against <hi>these</hi> her unjust, her cruel usurpations.</p>
            <p>GREAT-BRITAIN involved herself in a war with Spain and France, and, considered as a part of her property, we became entangled with <hi>her enemies,</hi> with whom <hi>we</hi> had no reasonable cause of dispute. Out of revenge to her, those enemies annoyed our trade, and, from the then formidable harbour of <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> the French threatened an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation to our fishery.</p>
            <p>IN that critical, and by us unsought for, situation, OUR COUNTRY flew to arms, and with a small determined host of hardy men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced in the more regular rules of war and of modern attack, in less than three months, compelled the veteran soldiers of France to surrender their once supported impregnable fortress to the resolute, persevering yeomanry of New-England <note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 22.</note>.</p>
            <p>IN the conquest of Cape-Breton, the undaunted, bold, enterprising spirit of our stern forefathers appeared eminently displayed in their intrepid sons: AMERICA rejoiced, MASSACHUSETTS gloried in her children, and the European world stood astonished at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, great event.</p>
            <p>OUR good and <hi>tender-nursing</hi> step-mother soon discovered her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal regard for her darling offspring, and shortly after that conquest, without condescending even to ask or sollicit <hi>our consent,</hi> restored to <hi>her</hi> enemy the well-known DURKIRK of NORTH-AMERICA. It may
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019017_0022_0FA95CC58996C5E0"/>
be asked, by what right did GREAT-BRITAIN so arbitrarily dispose of the conquest of our arms? By the same right which she afterwards so openly avowed, so arrogantly ENACTED, that "SHE had a right to bind AMERICA in all cases whatever <note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 23.</note>." A right by which all our lives, our liberties, and our properties were asserted to be at her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less disposal, at her merciless domination; by which she could trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or sell <hi>every person</hi> in AMERICA and all their estates to the Sultan of the East, the Emperor of Morocco, or to any other despot of the Asiatick, or of the European, world.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSING that MASSACHUSETTS was a colony originally <hi>sent out,</hi> supported and protected by GREAT-BRITAIN, which I do not, I cannot, admit; yet it by no means follows that she could le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally or honestly exercise, the right she had assumed over us. <hi>"Colonies"</hi> say the <note n="†" place="bottom">Thucid.</note> Corcyrean Embassadors to the Athenians, "<hi>are not sent out to be the</hi> SLAVES, <hi>but to be the</hi> EQUALS <hi>of those that remain behind;</hi>" and <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Roman Pro-consul of <hi>Greece,</hi> in the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> after his return from his government, tells the Embassadors of King <hi>Antiochus</hi> that "<hi>colonies were not sent into AEolis and Ionia to be held in slavery</hi> by Kings but to spread that ancient nation over the world <note n="‡" place="bottom">Liv.</note>. How different were the notions and declarations of those illustrious <hi>ancients,</hi> in regard to colonies, from those entertained and ENACTED by our late ungracious step-mother!</p>
            <p>EARLY in the reign of GEORGE the II. the British Parliament passed an act "<hi>for the more speedy recovery of debts in his Majesty's plantations in America,</hi>" whereby a new species of evidence, unknown to the <hi>common-law of</hi> ENGLAND, was introduced here, and an <hi>ex parte</hi> affidavit or deposition of any hired or perjured villain was made to bind the property and the person of <hi>every American</hi> on this side the Atlantick, while none other than the <hi>viva voce</hi> testimony of the witness himself present in the open <hi>court of law</hi> in ENGLAND, could be admitted to establish any fact or demand against a native or even a foreign resident in that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019017_0023_0FA95CC652B9F5E8"/>
country <note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 24.</note>. Our manufactures were soon injuriously restricted, the free use of the common element, <hi>water,</hi> was prohibited to us, and the working up our own raw materials also in some cases was denied to us: injuries and oppressions great and grievous, but, when compared with the intolerable badges of slavery enacted in the succeeding tyrannical reign, light and trifling.</p>
            <p>IN 1756, another war was declared by GREAT-BRITAIN against FRANCE, excited by a number of clamourous, interested British merchants, who had been accumulating enormous fortunes from the tobacco trade, the fur trade, and the trade of the southern colonies, as they were then denominated.</p>
            <p>AMERICA joined hand in hand with her harsh step-mother, and, assisted by the superiour abilities of one great <note n="†" place="bottom">The late Earl of Chatham, then Mr. PITT.</note> statesman, enabled her to carry her flag triumphant throughout the four quarters of the globe. Before this war closed, the good old King died, full of years and full of glory, when the bright days of Britain began to darken, and were soon to be obscured with clouds, and storms, and tempests which were to shake her Empire to the centre.</p>
            <p>A YOUNG, proud Monarch, of puny genius and of pigmy talents, with an unfeeling heart and an unrelenting obstinacy, succeeded GEORGE the II. who now determined to raise his minion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable House of <hi>Stuart,</hi> to the first offices of the State, and permit him to ride over the heads and disgrace the persons of the ablest Counsellors and of the noblest families in ENGLAND. Every true whig and friend to the revolution of 1688 was soon marked out, and devoted as a publick enemy, almost every officer of government in ENGLAND was changed in the space of a few months, and in less than three years a venal Parliament was bribed, most openly, to sanctify a shameful peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:019017_0024_0FA95CC718508C60"/>
LIKE all his family, an enemy to PUBLICK LIBERTY, the tyrant minion turned his baleful thoughts toward this fair land of <hi>native freedom,</hi> resolved to blast the fruits of all our great-forefather's care. It is true indeed that the indignation of the English e'er long compelled the wretch to quit his <hi>publick station,</hi> to fly from open day, and skulk behind the throne.</p>
            <p>THERE sheltered and protected from the storms of patriots and of injured FREEMEN he provoked his royal pupil, and all his base, mean tools of power to plunder us by act of Parliament, and boldly to assert that we were not entitled to any sort of right but what our selfish step-dame might be pleased to give us. Finding that you called aloud for law and justice, and insisted on the rights of free Americans, by <note n="*" place="bottom">Four governments, in the American islands and on this Continent, were disposed of to four Scotsmen, on one and the same day, on of whom was afterwards the <hi>famous</hi> Commissioner <hi>Johnson.</hi> How pleasing must it be to the whole realm of <hi>England</hi> to view her <hi>two Scotch Chief Justices,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Mansfield</hi> (the liberty-loving <hi>Murray</hi>) and Lord <hi>Louthborough</hi> (the whiggish <hi>Sawney Wedderburne</hi>) who was so free with the black-ball and brush, at the COCK-PIT, in defending the <hi>hypocritick traitor, the parricidious Tons Hutchinson,</hi> and in bedaubing the truly excellent Doctor <hi>Franklin.</hi>
               </note> Governours of his own choice and of <hi>his own country,</hi> and by a <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army</hi> he determined to subjugate AMERICA to a most lawless domination.</p>
            <p>THE dire effects of the standing army quartered in this town you all but too well remember!</p>
            <p>THE night of the fifth of March, 1770, is a night much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered!—It was a night of horror and of the blackness of darkness! The innocent, unarmed inhabitants of this peaceful though much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>injured town then fell victims to the brutal violence of the mercenary slaves of GEORGE the III.—To every species of insult, at last was added this infernal outrage. Methinks, I realize the terrors of that night!—I see your streets contaminated with murder and with blood! methinks, I hear the confused noise of small-arms, rage, and tumult! I see the base, savage-ruffian drive the remorseless steel through the warm brain-pan of the lovely, hapless youth—the fallen, dying Maverick!
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019017_0025_0FA95CC7E635E028"/>
methinks I hear the quick, shrill shrieks of matrons and of maids, while "groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky."</p>
            <p>BUT, lo! appears the matchless, dauntless patriot, ADAMS, the stern, determined father of our glorious revolution, surrounded by a noble band of brave compatriots of this insulted town.</p>
            <p>HUSHED is the spreading tumult!—Instant they form a firm, long line of march.—In sullen silence, as they pass the British guards, "deliberate valour breathes in every soul" and thoughts of deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge fire every manly breast. To the solemn temple of their GOD the slow procession moves—and there,—
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>" In full convene the city Senate sat,</l>

'Tis there resolved that <hi>"every British troop shall instantly retire."</hi> None dares to disobey:—the appalled military cut-throats fly the town, and peace and order once again resume their ancient seats.</p>
            <p>NEW modes of extortion are soon again devised in BRITAIN, and a more numerous military force is sent from thence to awe you into submission.</p>
            <p>THE pure flame of liberty, left brightly burning by our first fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, now kindles up anew. Close to the muzzles of the cannon of their men-of-war, the devoted tea is thrown into the ocean, and the insolent tyrants and <hi>traitors</hi> of the new-fangled Board of Customs fly for safety and hide their miscreant heads among the British troops. GREAT-BRITAIN shuts your port,—deprives you of that common <note n="†" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 25.</note> element which the kind Parent of the Universe made for all, and vainly tries to desolate <hi>the seat of publick virtue;</hi> and still to irritate you more, destroys, like JAMES the II. of the tyrant <hi>Stuart'</hi>s race, each chartered right.</p>

            <p>AT last the flames of open war burst forth. The mercenary troops in darkness march for CONCORD, and unprovoked discharge their murdering arms upon our unoffending countrymen.

            <p>BUT soon the deadly contest wears a darker face.—From their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered garrison the Britons now pour forth, to drive our raw militia from their slender lines near <hi>Bunker'</hi>s gently rising hill <note n="§" place="bottom">See appendix, No. 27.</note>.

            <p>Now, almost hand to hand, the foes, too confident, display their dreadful front; "full of deliberate valour bent on daring battle."—At once five hundred fiery messengers of death, from freedom's sons sure aim'd, fly thick amid the bold assailants.

SUCH a sudden depravity, such a rapid degeneracy of our manners hath plunged us deep in debt and difficulty, stript us of our cash, and brought us into great contempt.

The instances of the noblest patriotism among them are almost innumerable. <hi>Caius Mucius Scaevola,</hi> the <hi>Decii,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> are, among others, most astonishing; and during the first five hundred years of ROME, we often meet with characters of the most shining and exalted virtue.</p>

               <p>How noble does the Roman Embassador, <hi>Fabricius,</hi> appear in his celebrated conferrence with King <hi>Pyrr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus,</hi> where <hi>he</hi> tells the King that the information he had received relative to <hi>his</hi> poverty was true; tells him that an house of mean appearance and a small spot of ground from which, by his own labour, he supported himself, was his whole estate: at the same time, he informs <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that his poverty renders him by no means less considerable in his country, nor in the least degree unhappy; that fortune supplies him with whatever nature actually requires, and that if he was without superfluities, he was without any <hi>desire</hi> for them; that with superfluities it was true he should be in a better situation to assist the needy, the only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for which the rich are to be envied; that small however, as were his possessions he could neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less contribute somewhat towards the support of the State and the assistance of his friends.

FRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRICIUS then enumerates the great offices to which, notwithstanding his poverty he was eligible, and then goes on to inform the King, that his poverty did not affect his consequence in the Senate; that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen honoured him for that very poverty which Pyrrhus considered as disgraceful, &amp;c. and when the great <hi>Quinctius Cincinnatus</hi> was called to the Dictatorship, the deputies from the Senate found him follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plough at his little sabine farm.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Praetorian bands</hi> were a body of guards, amounting to near fifteen thousand men, distinguished by double pay, and by privileges superiour to the soldiers of the legions. They owed their institution to that crafty tyrant <hi>Augustus,</hi> who stationed only three cohorts (about fifteen hundred) of these guards in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, during his reign; but the dark, unrelenting monster <hi>Tiberius</hi> afterwards assembled the whole corps at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there fixed them in a permanent camp, well fortified and advantageously situated. After the murder of the cruel, dissolute Emperor <hi>Commodus,</hi> by his favourite concubine <hi>Marcia,</hi> on the 31st of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, A. D. 192, the virtuous <hi>Pertinax</hi> was elected and acknowledged Emperor, to whom the <hi>Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian bands</hi> took the oath of allegiance; after which, and before the expiration of eighty-seven days, some hundreds of these lawless ruffians, at noon-day, marched towards the Imperial Palace, where there compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions upon guard immediately threw open the gates and joined them in the assassination of their excellent Prince, whose head, after dispatching him with many wounds, they cut off, fixed upon a lance, and carried in triumph to their camp. Incredible as it may appear, even in these moments of horror, <hi>Sulpicianus,</hi> the father-in-law of the murdered <hi>Pertinax,</hi> then in their camp, was so dead to decency, humanity, and all sense of publick virtue that he began to treat with these flagitious, military cut-throats for the vacant throne; when the more avaritious of the Praetorians, apprehensive that, in a <hi>private contract</hi> they should not obtain the highest price for so valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ramparts; and, with a loud voice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that the <hi>Roman world</hi> was to be disposed of, to the best bidder, by publick auction. <hi>Julianus</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <hi>Sulpicianus;</hi> the former promising to each soldier six thousand two hundred and fifty drachms (about two hundred and sixty-six pounds lawful money) while the other offered only five thousand drachms (a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better than two hundred and thirteen pounds lawful money.) To <hi>Julianus</hi> they then immediately threw

open the gates of their camp, declared him Emperor, took the oath of allegiance to him, placed him in the centre of their ranks, surrounded him on every side with their shields, and proceeded with him through the deserted streets of <hi>Rome</hi> in close order of battle to the Senate, who dared not to resist, but pretended great satisfaction at the <hi>happy</hi> revolution, and acknowledged him Emperor.</p>

                  <hi>CAMDEN,</hi> who is quoted by <hi>Wright,</hi> asserts that the <hi>English</hi> were dispossessed of their hereditory estates by <hi>William</hi> I. and the lands and farms divided among his soldiers, but with this reserve, that they should do <hi>homage</hi> to him and his successors; and the Lord <hi>Verutam,</hi> also quoted by <hi>Wright,</hi> asserts that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror got by right of conquest all the land of the realm into his hands in demesn, taking from every man all estate, tenure, property, and liberty of the same except religious and church lands, and the lands of <hi>Kent.</hi> But now let us hear Sir William Blackstone's opinion of the conquest by <hi>William the Bastard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"THE nation at this period seems to have groaned under as absolute a slavery, as was in the power of a warlike, an ambitious, and a politick prince to create. The consciences of men were enslaved by four eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasties, devoted to a foreign power, and unconnected with the civil state under which they lived: who now imported from Rome for the first time the whole <hi>farrago</hi> of superstitious novelties, which had been engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the blindness and corruption of the times, between the first mission of Augustine the monk, and the Norman conquest; such as transubstantiation, purgatory, communion in one kind, and the worship of saints and images; not forgetting the universal supremacy and dogmatical infallibility of the holy see. The laws too, as well as the prayers, were administered in an unknown tongue. The ancient trial by jury gave way to the impious decision by battle. The forest laws totally restrained all rural pleasures and many recreations. And in cities and towns the case was no better; all company being obliged to disperse, and fire and candle to be extinguished, by eight at night, at the sound of the melancholy <hi>curfeu.</hi> The ultimate property of all lands, and a considerable share out of the present profits, were vested in the King, or by him granted out to his Norman favourites; who, by a gradual progression of slavery, were absolute vassals to the crown, and as absolute tyrants to the commons. Unheard of forfeitures, talliages, aids and fines, were arbitrarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the pillaged landholders, in pursuance of the new system of tenure. And, to crown all, as a consequence of the tenure by knight-service, the King had always ready at his command an army of sixty thousand knights or <hi>milites:</hi> who were bound upon pain of confiscating their estates, to attend him in time of invation, or to quell any domestick insurrection. Trade, or foreign merchandize, such as it then was, was carried on by the Jews and Lombards; and the very name of an English fleet, which King Edgar had rendered so formidable, was utterly unknown to Europe: the nation consisting wholly of the clergy, who were also the lawyers; the barons, or great lords of the land; the knights or soldiery, who were the subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate landholders; and the burghers, or inferior tradesmen, who from their insignificancy happily retained, in their socage and burgage tenure, some points of their ancient freedom. All the rest were villains or bondmen."</p>

               <p>"ANOTHER violent alteration of the English constitution consisted in the depopulation of whole countries, for the purposes of the King's royal diversion; and subjecting both them and all the ancient forests of the kingdom, to the unreasonable severities of forest laws imported from the continent, whereby the slaughter of a beast was made almost as penal as the death of a man." It was a fixed maxim in this reign, according to <hi>Mr. Hume,</hi> as well as in some subsequent, that no <hi>native of the island</hi> should be advanced to any dignity ecclesiastical, civil or military; that not contented with those large forests, which the former Kings possessed in all parts of England; he resolved to make a new forest near Winchester, the usual place of his residence: and for that purpose, he laid waste the country in Hampshire for an extent of thirty miles, expelled the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants from their houses, seized their property, even demolished churches and convents, and made the sufferers no compensation for the injury. At the same time he enacted new laws, by which he prohibited all his subjects from hunting in any of his forests, and rendered the penalties much more severe than ever had been inflicted for such offences. The killer of a deer or boar, or even of a hare, was punished with the delinquent's eyes; and that at a time, when the killing of a man would be atoned for by paying a moderate fine or composition. And the same author asserts that the conqueror divided all the lands of <hi>England,</hi> with very few exceptions, except the royal demesnes, into baronies, and that he conferred these, with the reservation of stated services and payments, on the most considerable of his adventurers.

the people; and he scrupled no measure, however violent or severe, which seemed requisite to support his plan of tyrannical administration. Sensible of the restless disposition of the Northumbrians, he determined to incapacitate them ever after from giving him disturbance, and he issued orders for laying entirely waste that fertile country, which, for the extent of sixty miles, lies between the Humber and the Tees. The houses were reduced to ashes by the merciless Normans, the cattle seized and driven away, the instruments of husbandry destroyed; and the inhabitants compelled either to seek for a subsistence in the southern parts of Scotland, or if they lingered in England, from a reluctance to abandon their ancient habitations, they perished miserably in the woods from cold and hunger. The lives of an hundred thousand persons are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to have been sacrificed to this stroke of barbarous policy." After all this let <hi>English pride</hi> continue to assert that <hi>their nation</hi> was not ever <hi>actually</hi> conquered by <hi>William the Bastard.</hi>

               <p>"IT was by accident only, that King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. had not a considerable hand in those great naval disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, by which the present age was so much distinguished. Columbus, after meeting many repulses from the courts of Portugal and Spain, sent his brother Bertholomew into England, in order to explain his projects to Henry, and crave his protection for the execution of them. Henry invited him to England; but his brother, in returning to Spain, being taken by pirates, was detained in his voyage; and Columbus, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, having obtained the countenance of Isabella, was supplied with a small fleet, and happily executed his enterprize. Henry was not discouraged by this disappointment: he fitted out Sebastian Cabot, a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian, dwelling in Bristol; and sent him westwards in 1498 in search of new countries. Cabot discovered the main land of America towards the sixtieth degree of northern latitude: he sailed southwards along the coast, and discovered Newfoundland, and other countries: but returned to England, without making any conquest or settlement. Elliot and other merchants in Bristol made a like attempt in 1502 The King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended fourteen thousand pounds in building one ship called the <hi>Great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>"BUT though this improvement of navigation, and the discovery of both the Indies, was the most me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable incident that happened during this or any other period, it was not the only great event by which the age was distinguished. In 1453, Constantinople was taken by the Turks; and the Greeks, among whom some remains of learning were still preserved, being scattered by these barbarians, took shelter in Italy, and imported, together with their admirable language, a tincture of their science and their refined taste in poetry and eloquence. About the same time, the purity of the Latin tongue was revived, the study of antiquity became fashionable, and the esteem for literature gradually propagated itself throughout every nation of Europe. The art of printing, invented about that time, facilitated extremely the progress of all these improvements: the invention of gun-powder changed the whole art of war: mighty innovations were soon after made in religion, such as not only affected those states that embraced them, but even those that adhered to the ancient faith and worship: and thus a general revolution was made in human affairs throughout this part of the world; and men gradually attained that situation, with regard to commerce, arts, and sciences, government, police, and cultivation, in which they have ever since persevered."</p>

As soon as the consternation which this occasioned permitted him to reflect upon the nature of an appearance so extraordinary, he discerned in it a source of comfort and hope. He justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that such a vast body of water, as this river contained, could not be supplied by any island, but must flow through a country of immense extent, and of consequence, that he was now arrived at that continent, which it had long been the object of his wishes to discover. Nor was he mistaken; for it amply answered his expectations." <hi>Columbus</hi> made his fourth and last voyage in 1502, just one hundred years before <hi>Gosnold</hi> discovered this country.</p>

               <p>WE meet with this preamble to a law enacted at the very beginning of the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> II. says Mr. <hi>Hume;</hi> "Whereas divers persons of small garrison of land or other possessions do make great retinue of people, as well of esquires as of others, in many parts of the realm, giving to them hats and other livery of one suit by year, taking again towards them the value of the same livery or percale the double value, by such covenant and assurance, that every of them shall maintain other in all quarrels, be they reasonable or unreasonable, to the great mischief and oppression of the people, &amp;c. This preamble contains a true pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the state of the kingdom. The laws had been so feebly executed, even during the long, active, and vigilant reign of Edward III. that no subject could trust to their protection. Men openly associated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, under the patronage of some great man, for their mutual defence. They had public badges by which their confederacy was distinguished. They supported each other in all quarrels, iniquities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions, murders, robberies, and other crimes. Their chieftain was more their sovereign than the King himself; and their own band was more connected with them than their country. Hence the perpetual tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulence, disorders, factions, and civil wars of those times: hence the small regard paid to a character or the opinion of the publick: hence the large discretionary prerogatives of the crown, and the danger which might have ensued from the too great limitation of them. If the King had possessed no arbitrary powers, while all the nobles assumed and exercised them, there must have ensued an absolute anarchy in the state." "The scaffold, as well as the field, streamed incessantly with the noblest blood of England, spilt in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between the two contending families whose animosity was now become implacable."</p>

Above an hundred thousand of the vanquished were shortly after cut to pieces in their camp by the Greeks, who, determining to rid their country of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, refused to give quarter to any. Miserable was the fate of that part of the army led off by <hi>Xerxes.</hi> After having expended all their provisions, they were compelled to live upon herbs and to eat even the leaves and bark of trees. Broken down and dispirited with disgrace, fatigue, and famine, the pestilence at last overtook them; they fell down by the way, and many were destroyed by vultures and by beasts of prey.

                  <hi>James Stuart,</hi> commonly called <hi>James</hi> the I. immediately upon hearing of the death of the Queen, and of his being proclaimed King in <hi>England,</hi> began his journey from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for LONDON. Great was the concourse of people who were every where brought together by idleness, curiosity, or interest to see their new sovereign. His <hi>fears</hi> were immediately affected, and he published a proclamation forbidding such a tumltuous resort. His ignorance of the <hi>law of England</hi> and the high idea he had conceived of his present power betrayed him into the absurd violence of hanging a thief without trial, upon his arrival at <hi>Newark.</hi>

               <p>MRS. MACAULAY mentions his exposing his pedantry to all Europe in his publications. Among other of his contemptible, pedantick, ridiculous compositions and publications is the following dedication, which is transcribed from his works:—</p>
               <p>"To the honour of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ The Eternall Sonne of the Eternall Father, The onley Theanthropos Mediator and Reconciler of Mankind, In Signe of Thankfulness, His most humble, and most obliged Servant, James By the Grace of God, King of Great Britaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Doeth Dedicate and Consecrate This his Declaration."</p>
               <p>He also published a treatise concerning witches which he intitled <hi>Demonology.</hi> In the second year of his reign he gave the royal assent to "An act against <hi>conjuration, witchcraft,</hi> and <hi>dealing with evil and wicked spirits.</hi>" By this act the penalty for practising <hi>conjuration</hi> or <hi>invocation,</hi> whereby any person is killed or lamed, declaring, by <hi>witchcraft,</hi> where any thing is hidden, procuring unlawful love, &amp;c. is, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond offence, felony. In a dispute with the House of Commons relative to a matter of privilege, in the case of <hi>Sir Francis Goodwin,</hi> he tells them that they derived all matters of privilege from him, and by his grant. He afterwards sent them a message, "that he commanded them as an <hi>absolute King</hi> to confer with the Judges" who in those days had given their opinion against the Commons. The House complied with the insolent command, but the ridiculous tyrant, who was present at the conferrence, had little cause for triumph. The Commons produced such a multitude of precedents to justify their right to judge of returns, that the royal conjurer compromised the matter with them, and, in his own way and language, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their right. He told them that "he <hi>granted</hi> it <hi>royally</hi> as King <hi>James</hi> sweetly and kindly out of his good nature. In one of his speeches to his Parliament he says, "Kings are in the word of God itself called <hi>Gods,</hi> as being his vice-gerents on earth; and so adorned and furnished with some sparkles of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity." All history however shews that out of a million of these Gods there is scarcely one that is not of the <hi>infernal</hi> kind. From history Kings in general appear nothing more than scourges of the human race, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

IN another speech, this ridiculous creature tells the Parliament, "that as to dispute what GOD may do is blasphemy, so is it sedition in a subject to dispute what a <hi>King</hi> may do in the height of his power." Having considered a few of the follies and pedantick absurdities of this monarch, we will now take a view of the darker and more infamous parts of his character. He was the first crowned head in <hi>England</hi> that ever was adulated with the impious title of <hi>Sacred Majesty:</hi> and it was <hi>James</hi> the I. assisted by the <hi>spiritual gentry,</hi> the Bishops, who attempted to ram down the throats of the people the monstrous doctrines of divine, indefeasible right, passive obedience, non-resistance, &amp;c. That he was scandalously fond of <hi>Somerset</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> even Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> the apologist for the House of <hi>Stuart,</hi> does not deny; for he confesses that <hi>James</hi> loved the former with so profuse a passion and unlimited an affection, as left no room for any rival or competitor; and he admits that Lord <hi>Hay</hi> was apprized of the King's passion for youth and beauty and exterior appearance; and yet Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> says that the passion of <hi>James</hi> seems not to have contained in it any thing criminal or flagitious. And, in his character of this strange creature, he says, that <hi>James</hi> never discovered any tendency, even the smallest, towards a <hi>passion for</hi> any mistress. <hi>Robert Garr,</hi> an handsome Scots youth was made known to the King through Lord <hi>Hay,</hi> when, by means of an unruly horse, he got his leg broken: The King ordered him into his own palace and to be attended constantly by his own physicians; and he often visited him during his confinement. On his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, <hi>James</hi> made him a knight and a gentleman of the bedchamber, and in a short time afterwards he was made Treasurer of Scotland, Viscount Rochester, a Privy Counsellor, a Knight of the Garter, and at last Earl of Somerset. In a few years the courtiers contrived to bring another handsome youth, <hi>George Villiers,</hi> afterwards created <hi>Duke of Buckingham,</hi> to supplant <hi>Somerset</hi> in the King's affections. <hi>Somerset</hi> and his wife, the infamous lady Essex, having procured Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> to be basely and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly poisoned in the Tower of London, the King was informed of the fatal secret; whereupon she affected more than usual attention to <hi>Somerset,</hi> with whom he retired to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> having commanded Lord Chief Justice Coke, and Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> the Attorney-General to take upon themselves the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; telling my <hi>Lord Chief Justice Coke</hi> that <hi>Somerset</hi> and his <hi>wife</hi> had made him a pimp, to carry on their bawdry and murder; and therefore commanded him to examine the affair with strict scrutiny, and to spare no man whatsoever; adding, "GOD's curse be upon you and your's if you spare any of them, and <hi>God's curse be upon me and mine, if I pardon any of them." Lord Chief Justice Coke</hi> issued his warrant against <hi>Somerset</hi> to apprehend him for the murder of <hi>Overbury,</hi> whom in the most base, treacherous, and cowardly manner he had caused to be poisoned in meats, tarts, jellies and even in salt, all sent to him by <hi>Somerset</hi> as from his best friend. <hi>James Franklin,</hi> one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, confessed that one Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> came to him from the <hi>Countess of Somerset,</hi> and wished him from her to get the strongest poisons he could for <hi>Sir Thomas Overbury;</hi> that accordingly he bought seven, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                  <hi>aqua sortis, white arsenick, mercury, powder of diamonds, lapis costitus,</hi> great <hi>spiders,</hi> and <hi>cantharides.</hi> All these not destroying him, one <hi>Weston</hi> was employed, who mixed <hi>Rasalgar</hi> in his broth, gave corrosive <hi>sublimate of mercury</hi> and <hi>white arsenick</hi> to be mixed up in the tarts and jellies sent to him, and last ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministered a glister to <hi>Sir Thomas,</hi> poisoned with <hi>corrosive sublimate,</hi> which carried him off. On the 5th of May, 1613, <hi>Somerset,</hi> then <hi>Lord Viscount Rochester,</hi> sent a letter to <hi>Sir Thomas,</hi> in which was a white powder, desiring <hi>Sir Thomas</hi> to take it, informing him that <hi>it would make him more sick; but that he need not be afraid as he would make it a means of his delivery, and for the recovery of his health.</hi> The poor, unsuspecting man, never dreaming of such treachery, but conceiving it a friendly potion, took the powder, which proved to be white arsenick "whereupon his sickness grew more violent and vehement, and his languishment increased." <hi>See State Trials</hi> vol. 1. p. 327, 346, 347. The Lord Chief Justice's warrant was actually served upon <hi>Carr Earl of Somerset,</hi> while <hi>James,</hi> who according to Mrs. <hi>Macaulay,</hi> had an <hi>unseemly way of lolling on his favourite's neck,</hi> was indulging himself in that posture. <hi>Somerset</hi> exclaimed against the outrage, arresting him in the King's presence; but <hi>James</hi> could not be prevailed on to remit it; and <hi>feigning an entire ignorance of the affair;</hi> cried, "nay, man, if <hi>Coke</hi> sends for me I must go;" then, after the most affectionate farewel, as soon as <hi>Somerset</hi> was carried off, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed "Go, and the deel go with thee, for I will neere see thy face more." <hi>See Mrs. Macaulay's Hist. vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 89. Sir <hi>Jarvis Elwes,</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, Mrs. <hi>Turner, Richard Weston,</hi> and <hi>James Franklin,</hi> were all severally tried, on separate indictments, for the poisoning and murder of Sir <hi>Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> were all found guilty, were all executed, and in their last moments confessed the fact. Somerset's Countess plead guilty; himself, after a fair trial, was found guilty, and sentence of death passed upon them; but <hi>James,</hi> notwithstanding his solemn execration, pardoned them, and they enjoyed a pension of four thousand pounds sterling per annum.</p>
               <p>THE Countess of <hi>Somerset</hi> had been married while she was a child to <hi>Robert,</hi> the young <hi>Earl of Essex. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

on his travels. Upon his return home, he pressed for the possession of his privileges: <hi>she,</hi> attached to the glittering fortune of her paramour, <hi>Somerset</hi> (then Lord Viscount <hi>Rochester</hi>) refused; not without hope, by means of such conduct, to regain her freedom. "A process was commenced by the Countess against her husband for insufficiency. James, who condescended to be a party in all the intrigues of his favourites, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested himself so warmly in the affair, that a divorce was obtained on this plea, though Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, had declared very strongly against it. The divorce was followed by the marriage of lady Frances and the Viscount; and kept with such ostentation by the court, that the city of London compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented them with an invitation to dinner. The bridegroom was made on this occasion Earl of Somerset." "SIR THOMAS OVERBURY, a man of some abilities, who had devoted his talents to the fortune of Somerset, had been the friend, the adviser, and the manager of all his business, depending on the freedom and sacredness of such a connection, exclaimed strongly to him against the folly and infamy of the match, Somerset had the weakness to tell his mistress; Overbury, from that hour, was doomed to destruction, and, on the first trivial pretence which offered, flung into prison. In this state, rage and despair drew from him some indiscreet threatenings, which alarmed the fears of Somerset. He was conscious that Overbury was a formidable enemy, from the nature of the secrets he had been entrusted with. Self-preservation concurred with resentment; the murder of Overbury was determined and perpetrated."</p>

               <p>SOMERSET persuaded the King to appoint <hi>Overbury</hi> Embassador for <hi>Russia,</hi> and then persuaded <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> to refuse to go, though he was no way averse to the employ. In those dark days of tyranny this was deemed a <hi>contempt of majesty,</hi> for which <hi>Overbury</hi> was committed close prisoner in the Tower. <hi>Somerset</hi> made him believe that his appointment was owing to his enemies who wanted to remove him out of the kingdom, and thereby prevent his further rise, and assured him that if he would refuse the employ he should soon be released from the Tower and restored to favour. Unsuspicious of any treachery the credulous <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> gave full and ready credence to the base, perfidious, inhuman <hi>Somerset.</hi> He was committed to the Tower for <hi>a contempt of the King's majesty.</hi> Immediately the Lieutenant and other officers of the Tower were charged, and <hi>Sir Jarvis Elwes,</hi> the tool of <hi>Somerset,</hi> was appointed the Lieutenant. All the victuals, wines, &amp;c. for the prisoner's use, were sent from <hi>Somerset'</hi>s house to the unsuspecting man; but the soup, the tarts, the jellies, and even the very salt was poisoned.</p>

               <p>HENRY, Prince of Wales, dying suddenly, was supposed to have been carried off by poison, with the privity and approbation of his father and of <hi>Somerset,</hi> that father's pathick, and that <hi>Overbury</hi> was one of the instruments made use of on that occasion. HENRY was adored by the populace, and had drawn all the younger and more splendid of the nobility into his train. <hi>See the tragical History of the Stuarts.</hi> When <hi>Somerset</hi> was about to be tried for the truly infamous murder of <hi>Overbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Weldon</hi> relates; that Sir <hi>George More</hi> came to tell him he must prepare for his trial on the morrow; <hi>Somerset</hi> refused to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and said, "<hi>the King durst not bring him to trial.</hi>" On <hi>More'</hi>s informing the King of these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, he burst into tears, and intreated him to use his utmost skill to soothe the prisoner, by whatever means, into temper and submission. <hi>See the notes in Macanlay's Hist. vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 91. Lord Chief Justice <hi>Coke,</hi> in his charge to the grand-jury, touching <hi>Overbury'</hi>s murder, observed that "poisoning was a vice of foreign growth; that it was but lately that their tables in <hi>England</hi> were made snares unto them: and he added, "I wish that sweet babe <hi>Prince Henry</hi> may have had fair play for his life!". For these and other expressions made use of by the Lord Chief Justice, at the trial of <hi>Overbury'</hi>s murderers relative to the death of <hi>Henry,</hi> Prince of Wales, he was shortly after removed from his post. <hi>See the tragical Hist. of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts and State Trials, vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 347. <hi>the note at the conclusion of the arraignment of Sir Thomas Monson, Kt. for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury,</hi> 4<hi>th December,</hi> 1615.

"Yea, said the King's card-holder; where if he does not play his master-prize, your Majesty shall never trust me." This so run in the King's mind, continues the author, as the next game he said he was sleepy, and would play out that set next night. The gentleman departed to his lodging; but was no sooner gone but the King sent for him; what communication they had I know not (yet it may be can more easily guess than any other) but it is most certain, next under GOD, that gentleman saved his life; for the King sent a post presently to London, to let the Chief Justice know he would see Monson's examination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to see if it were worthy to touch his life for <hi>so small a matter.</hi> Monson was too wise to set any thing but fair in his confession; what he would have stabbed with, should have been (<hi>

               <p>THE people used to salute their Queen with shouting aloud, "GOD save Queen Elizabeth!" to which she always returned, "GOD save you, my good people."</p>
               <p>To prove the assertion as to the revolution in the manners of the <hi>English,</hi> &amp;c. I shall here quote two passages from Sir <hi>William Blackstone'</hi>s Commentaries, vol. 4. p. 426, 427.</p>
               <p>"THE great revolutions that had happened, in manners and in property, had paved the way, by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible yet sure degrees, for as great a revolution in government: yet, while that revolution was effecting, the crown became more arbitrary than ever, by the progress of those very means which afterwards reduced its power. It is obvious to every observer, that, till the close of the Lancastrien civil wars, the property and the power of the nation were chiefly divided between the King, the nobility, and the clergy. The commons were generally in a state of great ignorance; their personal wealth, before the extension of trade, was comparatively small; and the nature of their landed property was such, as kept them in continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon their feudal lord, being usually some powerful baron, some opulent abbey, or sometimes the King himself. Though a notion of general liberty had strongly pervaded and animated the whole consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, yet the particular liberty, the natural equality, and personal independence of individuals, were little regarded or thought of; nay even to assert them was treated as the height of sedition and rebellion.</p>
               <p>"BUT when learning, by the invention of printing and the progress of religious reformation, began to be universally disseminated; when trade and navigation were suddenly carried to an amazing extent, by the use of the compass and the consequent discovery of the Indies; the minds of men, thus enlightened by science and enlarged by observation and travel, began to entertain a more just opinion of the dignity and rights of mankind. An inundation of wealth flowed in upon the merchants, and middling rank; while the two great estates of the kingdom, which formerly had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, detected in their frauds and abuses, exposed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of the populace, and stripped of their lands and revenues, stood trembling for their very existence. The nobles, enervated by the refinements of luxury, (which knowledge, foreign travel, and the progress of the politer arts, are too apt to introduce with themselves) and fired with disdain at being rivalled in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence by the opulent citizens, fell into enormous expences: to gratify which they were permitted, by the policy of the times, to dissipate their overgrown estates, and alienate their ancient patrimonies."</p>

               <p>DAVID RIZZIO, according to Buchanan, was born at <hi>Turin</hi> in Savoy; the son of a poor man who got a poor subsistence by teaching the first grounds of musick. He followed into Scotland <hi>Morettius,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of the Duke of Savoy: being left by the Embassador, he applied to the Queen's musicians to be admitted into their society, upon trial, where he performed so well that he was retained as one of her majesty's band. He soon grew into great favour, and was consulted upon matters of State, and was soon
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:019017_0047_0FA95CE3888C9170"/>
flattered and courted by the Nobility who even attended his levee with great adulation. He applied to <hi>Henry Stuart Lord Darnley,</hi> son of the Earl of Lenox, who was to marry the Queen and whom <hi>Rizzio</hi> induced to believe that he was the means of the Queen's fixing her eye upon him for her husband. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Buchanan, the Queen's marriage with HENRY, and his private recourse to her was now much talked of, as well as the too great familiarity between her and <hi>David Rizzio,</hi> who procured the marriage between Mary and Lord Darnley to be hastened; though the <hi>Scots</hi> were not for it, and the <hi>English</hi> were very much against it. The marriage took place on the 29th July, 1565, and gave great offence not only to the Nobility but also to the Commons. <hi>Rizzio'</hi>s power and authority with the Queen increased daily, and she soon discovered evident symptoms of disgust towards her husband, who, left he might interrupt her private pleasures, was obliged to go away into the country in a very cold, severe season. <hi>Rizzio</hi> was then admitted to sit at her table in a small room, and sometimes she would even eat with him at his lodgings.

Suspicions of a disagreeable nature, upon his return to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> were infused into the ears and breast of the uxorious, young King, who, being informed one day, that <hi>Rizzio</hi> was gone into the Queen's bed-chamber, was determined to see with his own eyes and to judge for himself. He therefore made for that bed-chamber; but coming to a door of which he himself had the key, he found it bolted on the inside; an incident he had never before experienced. He knocked, but no answer was returned. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this insult upon his honour, he now turned his thoughts to vengeance. Having communicated to some of his domesticks his determination to cut off this base, insolent reptile, they approved of the measure. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Queen of England, having sent a very long, obliging letter to the Queen, <hi>Mary,</hi> one day, began to read the same to many of her Nobles who were present, when this impudent, low fellow, <hi>Rizzio,</hi> stood up and ordered her to "read no more, she had read enough, she should stop." None present dared to reprove him for such his outrageous insolence; as they were well acquainted with his imperious temper, and were but too sensible that he had several times rebuked even the Queen herself with more severity than her husband had ever presumed to exercise towards her. Shortly after, when the Queen one night was at supper, in a small room with the Countess of <hi>Argyll</hi> and <hi>Rizzio,</hi> the Earl of Morton and a great number of his friends at the same time walking in an outer chamber, the King went out of his own chamber, by a private way, up to the room where the Queen, <hi>Rizzio,</hi> and the Countess were at supper, followed by Lord Ruthven armed, and four or five more. The Queen, upon their entering the room, was surprised, especially to see the ghastly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> who had just risen from a long and dangerous sickness, in armour, and asked "what was the matter?" <hi>Ruthven</hi> commanded Rizzio to "rise, and come out; for the place he sat in was not fit for him." The Queen immediately rose and interposed her body to protect <hi>Rizzio.</hi> The King took her in his arms and bade her not be afraid, that they meant her no harm, but added that the death of that villian was resolved on. He was hau'ed into the next room, and from thence into the outer chamber, where he was dispatched with many wounds; which, however was contrary to what had been first intended, which was to have hanged him up in publick. This is according to <hi>Buchanan'</hi>s account. Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> mentions other circumstances attending the assassination of <hi>Rizzio.</hi> He says that "<hi>Rizzio,</hi> aware of his danger, ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his mistress, and seizing her by the waist, called aloud to her for protection; while she interposed in his behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties. That the impatient assassins, regardless of her efforts, rushed upon their prey, and by overturning every thing which stood in their way, increased the horror and confusion of the scene; that <hi>Douglass,</hi> seizing Henry's dagger, stuck it into the body of <hi>Rizzio,</hi> who, screaming with fear and agony, was torn from <hi>Mary</hi> by the other conspirators, and pushed into the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, where he was dispatched with fifty-six wounds." <hi>Mary</hi> had promoted <hi>Rizzio</hi> to the office of Secretary; and, according to <hi>Buchanan,</hi> had intended to have raised him up to the degree of the Nobles. She soon found another paramour in the profligate Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> whom she raised to the highest power, and after having scandalized herself with him in the most infamous manner, she caused poison to be administered to her husband, who was retiring to his father at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> being incapable any longer to submit to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and indignities <hi>Mary</hi> continually exercised towards him. The poison not effectually destroying him, it was rumoured that he intended to fly the kingdom and go to France, which induced this cruel, wicked woman first of all to write to him letters full of love and tenderness, then to visit him at <hi>Glasgow</hi> where she caressed him with every shew of affection; persuaded him to be carried back to Edinburgh in a litter; that as the palace was too noisy for a sick person, and that he should reside in a solitary house within the city, where she caused her bed to be put into a chamber below his. In the evening of the night of her husband's mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which we shall shortly relate, she came to him with a large retinue, spent several hours with him, often kissed him, pretended every tender mark of the purest conjugal love towards him, and, in token of her
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:019017_0048_0FA95CE5397F8B20"/>
affection, gave him a ring before she departed.—Under pretence of attending the marriage of one of her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants she returned to her palace, and there, according to the tragical history of the Stuarts, had a ball. <hi>Bothwell</hi> soon after went disguised to the house where the poor, young, sick King lay, and by means of the key of the bed-chamber which had been given to him by the Queen, he with his associates softly entered the room where the unhappy <hi>Henry</hi> lay asleep.—They immediately seized him by the throat and strangled him, as they did one of his servants who lay near him; then they carried their bodies into an adjacent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and then set fire to a large quantity of gun-powder, lodged for that purpose, which blew the house to pieces. After this, she procured <hi>Bothwell</hi> to get divorced from his wife and to marry her, against the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal sense of her kingdom. Vengeance at last overtook her; she was obliged to fly into <hi>England,</hi> where she was afterwards tried, condemned, and beheaded for a conspiracy against Queen ELIZABETH. Such, from History, appears to have been <hi>Mary Stuart Queen of Scots,</hi> the mother of <hi>King James the</hi> I. <hi>of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> such was the stock from whence have sprung the succeeding Monarchs of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi> and yet <hi>Mary</hi> and her son <hi>James,</hi> were, according to the nonsensical, bigot-cant of the times; the LORD'S ANOINT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED, though to the eye of a Republican, from their abominable actions, they will seem justly to merit the title of THE DEVIL'S ANNOINTED. The sycophantick bishops and courtly adulators of JAMES the I. used to call him the <hi>Solomon</hi> of the age; the <hi>Spanish Embassador</hi> observed <hi>that</hi> might be true, for "he certainly was the son of <hi>David.</hi>"</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Puritans</hi> presented a petition to <hi>James</hi> the I. signed, among others, by seven hundred and fifty clergymen, praying a reformation of sundry of the articles of the established church. It was on the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this petition that <hi>James,</hi> from Judge, turned advocate. The hearing was at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and among other extraordinary flashes of <hi>reasonable argument,</hi> he told them that <hi>presbetery</hi> agreed as well with <hi>monarchy</hi> as God with the Devil; that <hi>he</hi> would not have <hi>Tom, Dick</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> meet to censure <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his</hi> council."

               <p>THE ABBE RAYNAN, in his History of the BRITISH SETTLEMENTS IN NORTH-AMERICA, says,</p>
               <p>In this fatal crisis, most of the Puritans were divided between submission and opposition. Those who would neither stoop to yield, nor take the pains to resist; turned their views towards North-America, to seek for that civil and religious liberty which their ungrateful country denied them. The enemies of their peace attempted to shut this retreat against these devout fugitives, who wanted to worship God in their own way in a desert land. Eight ships that lay at anchor in the Thames ready to sail, were stopped; and Cromwell is said to have been detained there by that very king whom he afterwards brought to the scaffold. Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm, however, stronger than the rage of persecution, surmounted every obstacle; and that region of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was soon filled with Presbyterians. The comfort they enjoyed in their retreat, gradually induced all

those of their party to follow them, who were not attrocious enough to take delight in those dreadful catas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophes which soon after made England a scene of blood and horror. Many were afterwards induced to remove thither in more peaceable times, with a view to advance their fortunes.

               <p>IN ENGLAND, the <hi>eldest son</hi> succeeds to the <hi>whole of the real estate,</hi> or lands held by his father in FEE, so that it is by no means uncommon there to see the eldest son possessed of a great, perhaps an enormous estate, and all the other children, though equally deserving, in mean, and sometimes in very indigent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. It most commonly happens however, that between persons of considerable fortune who are about to intermarry, a settlement of the estate is made, in which care is taken to encumber or charge the estate with a certain sum for the younger children of the intended marriage.—This sum is seldom more than equivalent to two or three years nett proceeds, or clear income of the estate: of course, if there are a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous family of younger children, there will be extreme inequality between each of such children and the elder brother. Doctor <hi>Price</hi> in his "OBSERVATIONS on the IMPORTANCE of the AMERICAN REVOLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, and the means of making it <hi>a benefit</hi> to the world;" under the section of an <hi>unequal distribution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> observes, that "the tendency of this," (the right of primogeniture) "to produce <hi>an improper inequality,</hi> is very obvious. This disposition to raise a name, by accumulating property in <hi>one branch</hi> of a family, is a vanity no less unjust and cruel, than <hi>dangerous to the interests of civil liberty;</hi> and no <hi>wise state</hi> will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it" Many a vain fool and many an unnatural parent in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in other countries where <hi>real estate</hi> are devisable by will, having an unfettered property, leave the bulk, and sometimes the whole of their estate to the <hi>eldest son,</hi> or to a <hi>favourite</hi> child, without regard to humanity or the laws of equity and natural justice. The law of <hi>inheritance</hi> introduced here by our republican ancestors, was not the law of discent and of inheritance, for ages, established in the monarchical country they had left. After the Romans had been obliged to leave <hi>their province of Britain</hi> in order to support their tottering empire, the Scots and Picts invaded and ravaged the country, and drove the into the woods and mountains. Vain was their application to AEtius the Roman General: even their letter, inscribed <hi>the groans of the Britons,</hi> could not prevail upon him to send a detachment to their assistance, while the dreadful <hi>Attila</hi> was in the empire. The Scots and Picts paying them a second visit, as disagreeable as the first, by the advice of <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern,</hi> the chief of their Princes, they sent into Germany and invited over the Saxons, who were a branch of the ancient Visigoths, to defend them; assigning to them the beautiful and fertile isle of <hi>Thanet</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> for their residence. The strangers soon dispossessed the Britons of the very country they had been invited over to defend against the Barbarians of the north, driving such as escaped the sword, into the mountains of Wales. The AEra of the Saxons first coming into England according to some authors, was in the year of Christ 124; though Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> fixes it 24 years later.—The Northern conquering nations, of which the <hi>Saxons</hi> were a branch, brought with them their <hi>feudal</hi> or military policy which they established in the countries they subdued. This <hi>military policy</hi> "was devised as the most likely <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Thus a proper military subordination was naturally and rationally enough inferred and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and an army of Feudataries were, as so many stipendiaries, always on foot, ready to muster and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the defence of their country: so that the feudal returns of <hi>fealty,</hi> or mutual fidelity, and aid were not originally <hi>ex pacto,</hi> but seem to have been politic, or rather natural, consequences drawn from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent necessity, these warlike people were under, of maintaining their ground with the same spirit, and by the same means they had got it. But as the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> were every day more and more alarmed by
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:019017_0050_0FA95CE69964D6D8"/>
the progress of the northern standard, many of them went into this or a like policy, as the strongest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment; and in imitation of it, they, reserving the <hi>dominium</hi> or <hi>propriety</hi> of the lands they gave, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled out some of their own possessions or territories under an <hi>express fealty,</hi> engaging their beneficiaries or feudatories, to make them like returns of fidelity and aid, as followed from the design and nature of an <hi>original feud,</hi> from whence the feudal obligations probably began to be considered as <hi>renders,</hi> or <hi>services of render:</hi> calculated for the benefit of the proprietary, who was, in respect of the <hi>dominium</hi> or propriety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in him, from henceforth called <hi>dominus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE feudal policy having obtained thus far, the few countries that had not [as above] gone into it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated themselves <hi>prince</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> as <hi>lord</hi> and <hi>feudatary,</hi> to stand by and assist each other in cases of common danger and concern: in consequence whereof, and of the <hi>fealty</hi> expressed or implied in such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, every man's possession was considered as a FEUD or <hi>stipend,</hi> and became as such a pledge or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the due observance of his <hi>fealty;</hi> so that the feudal policy thus hinted, and thus advanced, was now become the military policy of the western parts of the world; and military aid or service (as now call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) was understood to be the real or fictitious terms of all propriety or possession in <hi>Europe."</hi>

               <p>WRIGHT'S TENURES, <hi>p.</hi> 7, 8. 9, 10, 11. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>IT is difficult, according to <hi>Wright,</hi> to <hi>determine precisely</hi> the time when FEUDS or <hi>tenures</hi> were first brought into <hi>England;</hi> lord <hi>Coke,</hi> the Judges of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the case of tenures, Mr. <hi>Selden, Nathaniel Bacon,</hi> and others are of opinion that tenures, were not brought into <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> but that they were common among the <hi>Saxons:</hi> and he cites Saltern de <hi>antiquis Britan. Legibus,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> who agrees that the <hi>feudal laws</hi> were all brought into <hi>Europe</hi> by the ancient <hi>Goths,</hi> and by them settled in all the provinces of the Roman Empire which they conquered, and among the rest by the <hi>Saxons in England,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>FEUDS, being a <hi>military policy,</hi> neither <hi>women</hi> nor <hi>priests</hi> were <hi>originally</hi> permitted to, or could become tenants or feudataries, because the stipulation of holding or enjoying the FEUD, was upon condition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a service purely military, of defending in person, and by arms, the <hi>land</hi> or FEUD whenever it should be attacked; and <hi>this</hi> the delicacy and imbecility of the fair sex, and the religious profession of the priesthood forebade. And that <hi>females</hi> in particular, could not enjoy or hold a <hi>proper</hi> FEUD is clear from many authors, and particularly from <hi>Wright,</hi> who, in his tenures, folio 178, says, "As to the preference of <hi>males</hi> it must be remembered, that <hi>females</hi> could not by the feudal law succeed to a <hi>proper</hi> FEUD; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were unequal to the duties or services, for the sake of which it was chiefly created. And if it be farther observed, that it is <hi>ex pacto,</hi> or by the <hi>custom</hi> of particular countries, that they are even at this day admitted to succeed to any; it cannot seem strange, that the feudal preference given to <hi>males</hi> should prevail with us: because as <hi>feud, fee,</hi> and <hi>tenure,</hi> are synonimies, and import but one and the same policy, such preference is plainly agreeable to the nature of <hi>tenures</hi> and highly reasonable." It is highly probable that all <hi>proper</hi> FEUDS might originally, upon the death of the father, descend to <hi>all the sons equally,</hi> as <hi>gavelkind</hi> lands in the county of <hi>Kent</hi> in England, do at this day, because the greater the number of the feudataries, the more likely was the FEUD to be defended and preserved. That the tenure of <hi>gavelkind</hi> is of <hi>feudal original,</hi> I think, there can be no doubt, as well because of the <hi>males</hi> inheriting before, or in exclusion of, the <hi>females,</hi> as its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the general tenture of the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> at the <hi>Conquest:</hi> and that so it was, is fully established by Lord Chief Justice <hi>Holt,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> delivering the opinion of the Court in the case of <hi>Clement</hi> versus <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damore</hi> says, "That it appears (though <hi>Coke</hi> be of a contrary opinion) that all the lands in <hi>England</hi> before the Conquest, and for some time after, were generally gavelkind." And he refers to <hi>Lamb. Saxon Law</hi> 167, &amp;c. "But soon after the Conquest (adds that great, learned, and <hi>honest</hi> Chief Justice) for the better strength and <hi>support of the crown,</hi> knight service tenure was introduced, and the course of <hi>descent altered,</hi> and the whole made descendible to the <hi>eldest son,</hi> to the intent that their tenants in knight-service who by their tenure were to wait on the King in <hi>his wars,</hi> might do it with more dignity and grandeur: so, in this instance the ancient <hi>Saxon law</hi> was <hi>then altered."—See</hi> 6<hi>th Modern Reports, fol.</hi> 120. Lord Chief Justice <hi>Holt</hi> seems to give the true reason why the course of descent was altered in England by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That the <hi>pride of the King</hi> might be indulged by being attended in his wars by tenants capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of sustaining and displaying dignity and grandeur. The English lawyers give also another, and which is a very plausible reason, why the eldest son ought to have enjoyed the FEUD or whole estate. The eldest son (say they) was soonest able to do the duties of the feud, and was compellable to do those duties; as he was obliged to do the duties and to bear the burthen of the feud, it seems but reasonable that he should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:019017_0051_0FA95CE75D676F70"/>
the benefits, the <hi>perquisites</hi> of the feud. I acknowledge that there seems to be some semblance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this: but for what reason is the right and privileges of primogeniture still continued and now in force in England, seeing that all <hi>feudal</hi> tenure and <hi>military services</hi> have been so long abolished; that the common law declares that <hi>cessante causa cessat effectus,</hi> and <hi>cessante rations lagis cessat etiam ipsa lex?</hi> The only reasons that can be given, I should suppose, are, that it was the usage of their fore-fathers; that it is very proper in a monarchical government, and that even an unfeeling fool has a right to dispose of his own as he sees fit, and of sacrificing nature to vanity, if he thinks proper so to do.</p>
               <p>OUR manly ancestors <hi>knew</hi> that <hi>equality was equity;</hi> and <hi>their</hi> principles were truly <hi>republican;</hi> but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> the Mosaical law to be of <hi>Divine institution, they</hi> thought themselves <hi>obliged</hi> in conscience to make some distinction between the eldest son and all the other children: they therefore assigned to the eldest son a <hi>double portion</hi> of all his father's estate, real and personal, in conformity to the 17th verse of the 21st of Deutronomy. In the abstract of the code of laws prepared for the <hi>Commonwealth of the Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> printed in London in 1655, and republished in the 3d vol. of <hi>Hutchinson's Hist.</hi> p. 161, &amp;c. chap. iv. sect. v.

               <p>FEARING that the explicit enacting of these laws might give umbrage to the <hi>monarchical kingdom of England,</hi> which then <hi>claimed</hi> a jurisdiction over them, in the GENERAL LAWS <hi>of the Massachusett's colony,</hi> revised and published by order of the GENERAL COURT <hi>in October,</hi> 1658, they wisely omitted to specify these <hi>particulars.</hi> They begin their law-book as follows:</p>

               <p>RANDOLPH came from England to Massachusetts, with a letter from King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. "to the Governor and Magistrates of the town of Boston," for so was the letter directed; and with copies of petitions and complaints from, <hi>Mason</hi> and <hi>Gorges,</hi> about the extent of their patent line: and he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from the lords of trade to enquire into the state of the colony: in other words, to act as a spy. For <hi>all</hi> the particulars of this inimical genius, we refer the reader to <hi>Hutchinson's History of Massuchusetts Bay.</hi> In his letter to King <hi>Charles the</hi> II. among other things, he complains, that the Governour and all the Council but <hi>three</hi> continued covered while the king's letter was reading, whereas <hi>he</hi> had pulled-off <hi>his hat</hi> as soon as the letter was begun to be read, and his example was followed by the three only. He mentions in this letter, that one day, when he was paying a visit to the Governour, be observed to the Governour, that he had taken notice, since his arrival in <hi>Boston,</hi> of several ships haring came in from <hi>Spain, France,</hi> the <hi>Streights, Canaries,</hi> and other parts of Europe, contrary to his Majesty's laws of trade, &amp;c. "That the Governour freely declared to him that the laws made by his Majesty and his Parliament, obligeth them in nothing but
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:019017_0052_0FA95CE809845338"/>
what consists with the interest of that colony." In the same letter he mentions a discourse between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and <hi>Josiah Winslow,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq.</abbr> Governour of New Plymouth, wherein, according to <hi>Randolph, Governour Wins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> expressed his great dislike of the "magistrates of Boston to your Majesty's royal person, and your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under their government," &amp;c. "That during my stay at Boston I made acquaintance with severall of the chief inhabitants and some of the magistrates and did particularly informe myself of the humour, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and affections of the people, and found the principal inhabitants, some whereof are the chief officers of the militia, and the generality of the people, complaining of the arbitrary government and oppression of their magistrates and doe hope your Majestie will be pleased to free them from this bondage by establishing your own royall authority among them and govern them according to your Majesties lawes. And many of the better sort did intreat me to represent this their condition to your Majestie, not daring publickly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse their desires or complaint by petition, because of the severity and arbitrary proceedings of their rulers, and that many of them have been sufferers for petitioning formerly." After this he returned to England, and in 1678 came back again with a commission as Inspector and to make seizures, and bring informations for breaches of trade. He went back again the next winter to renew his complaints, and returned in 1681, with a commission as <hi>Collector,</hi> and <hi>Surveyor,</hi> and <hi>Searcher</hi> of the customs in <hi>New-England.</hi> In April, 1681, he had the insolence to set up a protest on the Exchange in <hi>Boston,</hi> against the acts of the Court. He afterwards brought to <hi>Boston</hi> the King's letter of the 21st of October, 1681, complaining "that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector had not been able to execute his office to any effect." It was therefore required, "that fit persons be sent over, without delay, to answer these complaints, with power to submit to such regulations of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as <hi>his Majesty</hi> should think <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it." Very pretty indeed! Agents were accordingly sent to England; but <hi>Randolph</hi> followed them. The Governour had desired him to do nothing to the prejudice of the colony. <hi>He</hi> promised "that if they would make a <hi>full submission to his Majesty, he</hi> would endeavour to procure his Majesty's royal pardon, and the continuance of their privileges, so far as that they should have liberty of conscience and the free exercise of their religion, and that no money should be raised without the consent of the people." What impudence, what insolence in this low fellow!</p>
               <p>HE exhibited to the Lords of the Privy Council articles of high misdemeanor against a faction in the <hi>General Court,</hi> sitting 15th February, 1681. After this <hi>Randolph</hi> had the audacity to return, and brought with him the death-warrant of the government, a <hi>quo warranto,</hi> in 1683. The charter was vacated the following year by judgment being entered up for the King, and the country in a manner deprived of all government until 1686, when the Rose frigate, in the month of May arrived from England with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to <hi>Joseph Dudley</hi> as President, and to divers others of the Council to take upon them the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration. On the 19th day of December, 1686, Sir <hi>Edmund Andross</hi> arrived at Nantasket, in a fifty gun ship, commissioned by <hi>James</hi> the II. Governour of New-England, and he appointed among other vultures, the incendiary <hi>Randolph,</hi> to be of his Council; whom he also appointed licenser of the press. Sir, <hi>Edmund,</hi> against the wills of the proprietors, made use of a meeting-house to perform the service of the church of <hi>England</hi> in; and he threatened to shut up that meeting-house, and to punish any man who gave two pence towards the support of a non-conformist minister, if <hi>he</hi> was refused the use of that meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house. <hi>Randolph</hi> had the insolence to reprove and threaten the Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> for exacting taxes from the Quakers for the support of the ministry in that Colony. Several congregations had agreed to set apart days of thanksgiving on account of <hi>James'</hi>s proclamation for a general religious toleration. The tyrannical Governour forbade them. He told them they should meet at their peril, and that he would send soldiers to guard their meeting-houses; <hi>swearing upon the Evangelists (libro tacto)</hi> a thing never known here, and not in practice ever after, and which was then introduced by the Governour and his associates, and such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused so to take an oath in that mode were fined and imprisoned. The fees of office were multiplied and were also extortionate. <hi>Randolph</hi> was made Secretary, and he farmed his office to <hi>West,</hi> who extorted larger fees than even <hi>Randolph</hi> had exacted of <hi>West,</hi> of whom he once complained, when he was his deputy, that he ran away with a hundred pounds a year of his dues. The charter being vacated, the people were told that they had now no right to their <hi>lands</hi> and that they must petition and take out patents for their estates. The like hath since been practised in other parts of the British dominions. Enormous fees were demanded for these patents by their pacious Governour and his associates; and with four or five of his Council Sir <hi>Edmund Andross</hi> laid what taxes he pleased. Petitions were presented to the King and his Ministers against these proceedings, and for liberty to have an House of Representatives, but as little regard was paid by <hi>James</hi> II. and his Ministry to those petitions, as by <hi>George</hi> III. and his Ministry, to the petitions preferred a few years since by Congress and by several of the Legislative Bodies of the late Colonies. In a letter to the <hi>Bishop of London, Randolph</hi> advises the <hi>fining</hi> sufficiently of <hi>Danford</hi> and <hi>Richard'</hi>s (two of the faction as he calls them) by the King, "and well if they escape so, they can go to work for more." He
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:019017_0053_0FA95CEC722BE710"/>
presses the Bishop "to send over able and sober Ministers, that we (himself and his brethren of the church of England) will contribute largely to their maintainance, but <hi>one thing will mainly help</hi> when <hi>no marriages hereafter shall be allowed lawful but such as are made by the ministers of the church of England.</hi> In a letter to the <hi>Earl of Clarendon</hi> he says, "His Majesty's <hi>quo warranto</hi> against their charter and sending for <hi>Tho. Danforth, Sam. Nowell,</hi> a late factious preacher and now a magistrate, and <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Fisher</hi> and <hi>Elisha Coke,</hi> deputies, to attend and answer the articles of high misdemeanures I have now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited against them." &amp;c. "will make the whole faction tremble." Again, in the same letter, "I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech your Lordship that I may have consideration for all my losses and money laid out in <hi>prosecuting seizures here in</hi> 1680." Again, "My Lord I have but one thing to remind your Lordship, that nothing their agents <hi>can</hi> say or do in <hi>England</hi> can be any ground for his Majesty to depend upon." And in the same letter, "Their forces are very inconsiderable, more for shew than service. <hi>I will engage</hi> with five hundred of his Majesty's guards to drive them out of the country." Forgetting what he had said in his answer to several heads of inquiry concerning the state of New-England in 1676; wherein he set forth, to the fourth quere proposed by the Lords of the Committee of Council for Trade and Plantation, "that they have no standing army, but their trained bands are twelve troops of horse and six thousand foot; each troop consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sixty horse besides officers, are all well mounted and completely armed with back, breast, head-piece, buffe coat, sword, carbine, and pistols, each troop distinguished by their coats. The foot also are very well furnished with swords, muskets, and bandaliers." "Their late wars have hardened their infantry, made them <hi>good firemen,</hi> and taught them the <hi>ready use of their arms;</hi>" and also admits that their whole force is equal to forty thousand men. Yet this incendiary, who wished to desolate Massachusetts, could drive them out of their country; that is, could with the greatest case drive the whole forty thousand men, among whom were these six thousand seven hundred and twenty good firemen, completely armed, and who knew the ready use of their arms, out of this country with only five hundred of his Majesty's guards. This naturally brings to our recollection the assertion of the vain boaster who a few years since made the Commons of Britain believe that he could go through <hi>America</hi> with five thousand British troops. Attempts have been made with bodies of British troops much more numerous, who have delivered up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their arms to these despised <hi>Americans.</hi> In a letter to the Arch-bishop of Canterbury <hi>Randolph</hi> mentions it having being said in the Privy Council by some noble Lords in their (our country's) favour "that provided they might have liberty of conscience in matters of religion, they would voluntarily submit to have one of their meeting-housen to be disposed of by the President and Council for the use and exercise of the religion according to the <hi>church of England,</hi>" and that this was said, in answer to a motion, made by the Arch-bishop, that one of their <hi>meeting-houses</hi> in <hi>Boston</hi> should be <hi>ordered</hi> to be set apart for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose." And in the same letter he "humbly represents to HIS GRACE, that the <hi>three meeting-houses</hi> in Boston might pay <hi>twenty shillings</hi> a week apiece, out of their contribution towards the defraying <hi>our church</hi> charges; the same being less per annum than each of their ministers receive." I shall quote no more of his letters but refer the reader to the appendix in the 3d vol. of Hutch. Hist. where, if he loves New-England, or regards the natural rights of men, he will find his breast swell with indignant resentment against this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling, selfish, base, tyrannical wretch.</p>

               <p>THE act of the British Parliament—For the more easy recovery of debts in his Majesty's plantations and colonies in America passed in the year 1732, the V. Geo. the II. By this statute it is enacted that after the 29th day of September in that year, "in any action or suit then depending or thereafter to be brought in any court of law or equity in <hi>any</hi> of the said plantations, for or relating to any debt or account, <hi>wherein any person residing in Great-Britain</hi> shall be a party, it shall and may be lawful to and for the plaintiff or defendant, and also to and for any witness to be examined or made use of in such action or suit, to verify or prove any matter or thing by <hi>affidavit</hi> in writing, upon oath, <hi>unless Quakers, and then upon solemn affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> before the Mayor or Chief Magistrate of any city, borough, &amp;c. in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where or near to which the <hi>deponent or affirmant</hi> shall reside and certified and transmitted under the common seal of such city, &amp;c. shall be allowed to be of the same force and effect, as if the <hi>deponent or affirmant</hi> had appeared and sworn or affirmed the matters contained in such affidavit or affirmation <hi>viva voce</hi> in open court, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>IT is true there is a clause in this act for the punishment of persons who should be guilty of perjury in such affidavits or affirmation. But what benefit could accrue to an American from that clause? How could he convict the party of perjury? He could not do it without carrying his witnesses to <hi>Great-Britain, there</hi> indicting the criminal, and <hi>there</hi> producing his witnesses face to face, in open court. It may be a question whether the late revolution has not worked an annihilation of that act of Parliament <hi>here.</hi> It is a matter worthy the attention of every legislature of the UNITED STATES whether all evidence so takest ought not to be admissible in all <hi>our</hi> courts until <hi>Great-Britain</hi> shall enact a law of reciprocity, and admit in <hi>all her courts,</hi> at home and abroad, similar evidence taken here, as equal to the <hi>viva voce</hi> testimony of witnesses at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in open court</p>

               <p>THE battle was really fought on <hi>Breed's Hill,</hi> which is much lower than <hi>Bunker's Hill;</hi> and indeed the rising of the ground is so gentle that you scarcely can perceive it. One would have thought from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count published, ten years ago in the <hi>London Gazette,</hi> that it had been an high, steep mountain, and that the intrenchments were amazingly strong. A rail sence ran across the field;—the new troops pulled up another rail sence, and fixed that parallel to the first sence, at about two feet distance, and filled up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy between with new-mown hay which was making in the field. This was the tremendous breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. The redoubt in which <hi>Doctor,</hi> or rather <hi>General, Warren</hi> was killed, was behind, at a little distance from the breast-work, and was not finished. About five hundred Americans was the number actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and they killed and wounded near fifteen hundred of the enemy. I have had it from British officers, who were present, that they never saw so severe a fire while it continued. The <hi>Yankies</hi> had no proper mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, their pieces were not of the same bore and not one in twenty had a bayonet. There were several far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers there who had never before seen or heard a cannon fired, and this can be proved by incontestable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if necessary.—Though many had leather shoe-strings and wore leather aprons, yet they were all good marksmen, and could hit their bird even upon the wing.</p>
               <p>IT is astonishing that our raw militia should so resolutely stand the terrible cannonade and bombardment of the Britons, from the Somerset of 64 guns, their frigates the Lively and the Glasgow, from their gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats in Mistick river and Charles's river, and from their battery of heavy cannon and bomb-battery on Copse Hill. There appears to have been a capital mistake or error committed on both sides. It now seems to have been a piece of madness in our men to have crossed the peninsula in order to take possession of a place where there was no water, and where they might be surrounded and have their retreat completely cut off; and on the other side we cannot account for the conduct of the British in attacking, as they did, when they might have completely secured the peninsula, and compelled every man in twenty-four hours to have surrendered without firing a shot; as they had neither water nor provisions.—But <hi>it was to be otherwise:</hi>—and we now see, and acknowledge with gratitude, the over-ruling providence of that gracious Being who humbleth the proud, and turueth into foolishness the wisdom of the wise.</p>

               <p>THAT beautiful, elegant, new <hi>meeting-house</hi> in Brattle Square was made use of as a barrack by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, the <hi>Old-North meeting-house</hi> was pulled down and used for fire-wood, and that noble, spacious build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Old-South meeting-house,</hi> by General Burgoyne, was turned into an hypodrome or riding-school, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as it is asserted, a carpenter of the town offered to erect as large or a larger building for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, without expence to the British government, if the General would spare that meeting-house. The General perhaps had a particular dislike to that meeting-house, as the annual Oration on the massacre of the Fifth of March, 1770, had been regularly delivered there, and the town-meeting was adjourned to <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="xx" facs="unknown:019017_0056_0FA95CEFA3023820"/>
meeting-house when it was resolved that all the British troops should quit the town. It was curious enough to transport a regiment of horse from Britain, and then to be under the necessity of sending upwards of three thousand miles for their provisions, <hi>America</hi> not furnishing oats or hay to these strangers; and this might fret the General. He might be vexed also at the borrish <hi>Yankies</hi> who would not permit him to exercise his horses out of the town. Whatever might be his provocations, it is however with regret that truth obliges us to condemn a gentleman of General Burgoyne's knowledge and learning in this scandalous and barbarous transaction, and in so wantonly burning the deserted town of Charlestown. The fact is undeniable that there was not one American militia man in that town at the time it was sat on fire, by a carcass thrown from Copse-Hill (where General Burgoyne commanded) upon the meeting-house of that wantonly-destroyed, ancient town. Every one of the inhabitants but one had quitted the town early in the morning, when they found the men of war began to fire upon Breed's-Hill, and he, a poor ideot, who, as an object of charity resided in the Alms-House, was the only person left in the town when the meeting-house was sat on fire, and the whole place then nearly destroyed. It might have been sport and a <hi>fine sight</hi> to the British General, but it was ruin and an heart-beaking appearance to the numereous, helpless proprietors and inhabitants, many of whom then lost their all. About twenty houses only escaped the flames that day, and those were set on fire and destroyed by the <hi>humane</hi> Britons on the next day, Sunday. When <hi>Titus,</hi> the Roman Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, besieged <hi>Jerusalem</hi> he, though an Heathen (as <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us) repeatedly and earnestly entreated the Jews to let him <hi>save</hi> their temple; but they refused to hear; they first sat fire themselves to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of their temple, and most obstinately persisted to resist every effort of <hi>Titus,</hi> until the Romans were at last compelled to destroy that glorious building. Even the barbarous <hi>Goths,</hi> under their King <hi>Alaric,</hi> when they sacked Rome, A. D. 410, shewed a regard to humanity and religion; they respected the churches as holy and inviolable sanctuaries; and they received with reverential awe the consecrated plate and ornaments. If the Britons wished to irritate and exasperate the <hi>New-England</hi> men, there was no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod so effectual for that purpose as that of destroying and polluting their places of publick worship.</p>

               <p>THE insults which many of the inhabitants received from the officers and soldiers of the British army, and from many of the Tories who have now the modesty to shew their fronts among those very people, cannot be very readily forgot. Among the rest, that polished and most amiable, upright patriot and cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, the late most worthy Dr. COOPER, was insulted in the open street by a British officer. The death of this divine orator was universally lamented.</p>
