         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE period for a new election of a Citizen to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Executive Government of the United States being not far distant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts must be employed in desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the person, who is to be clothed with that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>, it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline being considered among the number of those <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of whom a choice is to be made.</p>
            <p>I beg you, at the same <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to do me the justice to be assured, that this resolution has not been taken, without <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> regard to all the considerations appertaining to the relation, which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a du<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service which silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eal for your future interest; no defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of grateful respect for your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both.</p>
            <p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to which your suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a de<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erence for what appeared to be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. I constantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, consistently with motives, which I was not at liberty to disregard, to return to that retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, previous to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>
            <p>I rejoice, that the state of your concerns, ex<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ernal as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propiety; and am persuaded whatever partiality may be retained <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my services, that in the present circumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination to retire.</p>
            <p>The impressions with which I first undertook the ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

In the discharge of this trust, I will only say, that I have with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and administration of the government, the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. No<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscious, in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of myself; and every day the encreasing weight of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> admonishes me more and more that the shade of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>Towards the preservation of your government, and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles however specious the pretexts.—One method of assault may be to effect, in the forms of the constitution, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which will impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown.

            <p>Observe good faith and justice towards all nations, cultivate peace and harmony with all; Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no great distant period, a great Nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alted justice and benevolence.
