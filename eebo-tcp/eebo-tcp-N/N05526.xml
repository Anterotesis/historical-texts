            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AND God ſpake all theſe Words, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I <hi>am</hi> the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the houſe of bondage.</p>
               <p>I. Thou ſhalt have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:007005_0113_102AE26B6BE15278"/>Gods before me.</p>
               <p>II. Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or any likeneſs <hi>of any thing</hi> that <hi>is</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above, or that <hi>is</hi> in the earth beneath, or that <hi>is</hi> in the water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not bow down thyſelf to them, nor ſerve them: for I the Lord thy God <hi>am</hi> a jealous God, viſiting the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:007005_0114_102AE26D7042B0C8"/>iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <hi>generation</hi> of them that hate me: and ſhewing mercy unto thouſands of them that love me, and keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>III. Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:007005_0115_102AE26FDEF90038"/>him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in vain.</p>
               <p>IV. Remember the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day to keep it holy: ſix days ſhalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and do all thy work: but the ſeventh day <hi>is</hi> the ſabbath of the Lord thy God: <hi>in it</hi> thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daughter, thy man-ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor thy
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:007005_0116_102AE271DE19B040"/>cattle, nor thy ſtranger that <hi>is</hi> within thy gates: for <hi>in</hi> ſix days the Lord made heaven and earth, the Sea and all that in them <hi>is,</hi> and reſted the ſeventh day: wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, and hallowed it.</p>
               <p>V. Honour thy father, and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:007005_0117_102AE27369DD8780"/>Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>
               <p>VI. Thou ſhalt not kill.</p>
               <p>VII. Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery.</p>
               <p>VIII. Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</p>
               <p>IX. Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy neighbour.</p>
