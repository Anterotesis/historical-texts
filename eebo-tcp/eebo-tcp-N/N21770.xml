            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>JOHN FAUSTUS</hi> was born in the town of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of <hi>Weimer,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a poor huſbandman, and not able well to bring him up; yet having an uncle at <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> a rich man, and without iſſue, he took this <hi>Fauſtus</hi> from his father and made him his heir, inſomuch that his father was no more troubled with him; for he remained with his uncle at <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> where he was kept at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in the ſame city, to ſtudy <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;</hi> but <hi>Fauſtus</hi> being of a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mind, and otherwiſe addicted, plied not his ſtudies, but betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028655_0004_0FDA3BACD602CBD0"/>to other exerciſes, which his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle hearing often, rebuked him for it; as <hi>Eli</hi> oftentimes rebuked his children for ſinning againſt the Lord, even ſo this good old man laboured to have <hi>Fauſtus</hi> apply his ſtudy to <hi>Divinity,</hi> that he might come to the knowledge of God and his law. But it is manifeſt that many virtuous parents have wicked children, as <hi>Cain, Reuben, Abſalom,</hi> and ſuch like, have been to their parents. So <hi>Fauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> having godly parents, who ſeeing him to be of a forward wit, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bring him up in virtuous ſtudies, namely, of <hi>Divinity;</hi> but he gave himſelf ſecretly to <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy</hi> and <hi>Conjuration,</hi> inſomuch that few or none could perceive his profeſſion.</p>
               <p>But to the purpoſe, <hi>Fauſtus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at ſtudy in the univerſity, and was by the Rectors, and ſixteen maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters afterwards, examined how he had profited in his ſtudies; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found by them, that none of his time were able to argue with him in <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028655_0006_0FDA3BAE5447FC70"/>names ſo well, that he ſtudied day and night therein, inſomuch that he could not abide to be called <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> but waxed a worldly man, and named himſelf an <hi>Aſtrologian,</hi> and a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> and for a ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow ſometimes a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and did great cures; namely, with <hi>herbs, roots, waters, drinks</hi> and <hi>clyſters;</hi> and without doubt he was paſſing wiſe and excellent in holy ſcriptures: <hi>But be that knoweth his maſter's will, and doth it not, is worthy to be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> It is written. <hi>No man can ſeve two maſters, and thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> But <hi>Fauſtus</hi> threw all this in the wind, and made his ſoul of no eſtimation, regarding more the worldly pleaſures than the joys to come; therefore at the day of judgment there is no hope of his redemption.</p>

               </head>
               <p>YOU have heard before, that all <hi>Fauſtus</hi>'s mind was to ſtudy the arts of <hi>Necromancy</hi> and <hi>Conjuration;</hi> which exerciſe he followed day and night, and taking to him the wings of an eagle, thought to fly over the whole world, and to know the ſecrets of heaven and earth; for his ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was ſo wonderful, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in uſing his <hi>Vocabula,</hi> figures, character, conjuration and other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emonial actions, that in all haſte he put practice to bring the Devil before him, and taking his way to a thick wood near <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> called in the <hi>German</hi> tongue <hi>Spiſſer holt,</hi> that is in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Spiſſer</hi>'s <hi>Wood,</hi> as <hi>Fauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> would oftentimes boaſt of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the crew, being in jollity, he came to the wood one evening into
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028655_0008_0FDA3BB2F42526D0"/>the croſs way, where he made with his wand a circle in the duſt, and within that many more circles and characters; and thus paſt away the time till it was nine or ten of the clock at night; then began Dr. <hi>Fauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to call on <hi>Mephoſtophiles</hi> the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, and to charge him in the name of <hi>Belzebub,</hi> to appear there preſently without any longer ſtay; then preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the Devil began ſo great a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the in the wood, as if heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and earth would have come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the trees with wind bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their tops to the ground; then fell the Devil to roar, as if the whole wood had been full of Lions, and ſuddenly about the circle run the Devil, as if a thouſand waggons had be running together on paved ſtones: After this, at the four corners of the wood it thundered horribly, with ſuch lightning, as if the whole world to his ſeeming had been on fire. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> all this while, half amazed at the Devil's ſo long tarrying, and doubting whether he were beſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide any more ſuch horrible conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028655_0009_0FDA3BE40EBFF0A0"/>thought to leave his circle and depart; whereupon the Devil made him ſuch muſick of all ſorts, as if the Nymphs themſelves had been in the place: Whereat <hi>Fauſtus</hi> revived, and ſtood ſtoutly in his circle, expecting his purpoſe, and began again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the ſpirit <hi>Mephoſtophiles,</hi> in the name of the Prince of Devils, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his likeneſs; whereat ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, over his head hung hovering in the air, a mighty dragon; then calls <hi>Fauſtus</hi> again after his deviliſh manner, at which there was a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous cry in the wood, as if hell had been open, and all the tormented ſouls curſing their condition. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently not three fathom above his head, fell a flame in manner of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and changed itſelf into a globe; yet <hi>Fauſtus</hi> feared it not, but did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade himſelf that the Devil ſhould give him his requeſt before he would leave. Oftentimes after to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions he would boaſt that he had the ſtouteſt head under the cope of Heaven at command. Whereat they anſwered. <hi>They knew none ſtouter than the Pope or

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028655_0013_0FDA3BE6DB0C2DD8"/>he ſat pondering how he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his requeſt of the Devil, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loſs of his ſoul; yet he was fully reſolved with himſelf, rather than to want his pleaſure, to do what the ſpirit and his Lord ſhould condition upon.</p>

                  <hi>FAUSTUS</hi> continued in his dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliſh cogitations, never moving out of the place where the ſpirit left him, ſuch was his fervent love to the Devil. The night approaching this ſwift flying Spirit appeared to <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> offering himſelf with all ſubmiſſion to his ſervice, with full authority from his Prince, to do whatſoever he would requeſt; if <hi>Fauſtus</hi> would promiſe to be his. This anſwer I bring thee, an anſwer muſt thou make by me again; yet I
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028655_0014_0FDA3BB75DE34A78"/>will hear what is thy deſire, becauſe thou haſt ſworn to me to be here at this time. Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> gave him this anſwer, though faintly for his foul's ſake. That his requeſt was none other, but to become a Devil, or at leaſt, a limb of him, and that the ſpirit ſhould agree to theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles following:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That he might be a ſpirit in ſhape and quality.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That</hi> Mephoſtophiles <hi>ſhould bring him any thing, and do for him whatſoever he deſired.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That</hi> Mephoſtophiles <hi>ſhould at all times appear at his command, and in what form or ſhape ſoever he would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe points the ſpirit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Dr. <hi>Fauſtus, That all this ſhould be granted him, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028655_0015_0FD9BB73D204CEE8"/>fulfilled, and more, if he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree unto him upon certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as followeth:</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Dr.</hi> Fauſtus <hi>ſhould give himſelf to his Lord</hi> Lucifer, <hi>body and ſoul.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>For confirmation of the ſames he ſhould make him a writing in his own blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That he would be an enemy to all chriſtian people.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>That he would deny the chriſtian belief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That he let not any man change his opinion, if any man ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to diſſaude or withdraw him from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farther, the ſpirit promiſed <hi>Fauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to give him certain years to live in health and pleaſure, and when ſuch years were expired, that then <hi>Fauſtus</hi> would be fetched away; and if he would hold theſe articles and conditions, that then he ſhould have whatſoever his heart would wiſh or deſire; and <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſhould quickly perceive himſelf to be a ſpirit in all

Hereupon Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi>'s mind was ſo enflamed, that he forgot his ſoul, and promiſed <hi>Nephoſtophiles</hi> to hold all things as he mentioned them; he thought the Devil was not ſo black as they uſed to paint him; nor Hell ſo hot as the people ſay.</p>

               <p>AFTER Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> had made his promiſe to the Devil, in the morning betimes, he called his ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it before him, and commanded him, that he ſhould always come to him like a Friar, after the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and with a bell in his hand, like St. <hi>Anthony;</hi> and to ring it once or twice before he appeared, that he might know of his certain coming: Then <hi>Fauſtus</hi> demanded of his ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, <hi>What is his name?</hi> The ſpirit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>my name is as thou haſt ſaid,</hi>

               <p>DR. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſitting penſive hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but only one boy with him, ſuddenly there appeared his ſpirit <hi>Mephoſtophiles,</hi> in likeneſs of a very man, from whom iſſued moſt dreadful fiery flames, inſomuch that the boy was afraid; but being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by his maſter, he bid him ſtand ſtill, and he ſhould have no haerm: The ſpirit began to bleat, as in a ſinging manner. This pretty ſport pleaſed Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> well, but he would not call his ſpirit into the counting houſe, until he had ſeen more: Anon was heard a ruſhing of armed men, and trampling of horſes: This ceaſing, came a kennel of hounds, and they chaſed a great hart in the hall, and there the hart was ſlain. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> took heart, came
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028655_0021_0FDA3BEB183697D8"/>forth and looked upon the hart; but preſently before him there was a lion and a dragon together, fighting ſo fiercely, that <hi>Fauſtus</hi> thought they would have thrown down the houſe; but the dragon overcame the lion, and ſo they vaniſhed. After this came a peacock and a peahen, the cock bruſtling of his tail, and turning to the female, beat her, and ſo vaniſhed. Afterwards followed a furious bull, that with a full fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ran upon <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> but coming near him vaniſhed away. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward followed a great old ape, this ape offered <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the hand, but he refuſed; ſo the ape ran out of the hall again. Hereupon fell a miſt in the hall, that <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſaw no light, but it laſted not; and ſo ſoon as it was gone, there lay before <hi>Fauſtus</hi> two great ſacks, one full of gold, another of ſilver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> was heard by <hi>Fauſtus</hi> all manner of inſtruments of muſick, as organs, clarions, lutes, viols, cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, waits, hornpipes, flutes, anomes, harps, and all manner of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028655_0022_0FDA3BBC9CF1F538"/>other inſtruments, which ſo raviſhed his mind, that he thought he had been in another world. Hereat came <hi>Mephoſtophiles</hi> into the hall to <hi>Fauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> apparelled like a Fryar, to whom <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſpake, thou haſt done me a wonderful pleaſure in ſhewing me this paſtime; if thou continueſt as thou haſt began thou ſhalt win my heart and ſoul, yea, and have it. <hi>Mephoſtophiles</hi> anſwered, <hi>This is nothing, I will pleaſe the better; give me thy hand writing.</hi> At which words the wretch put forth his hand, ſaying, <hi>hold thee there haſt thou my promiſe. Mephoſtophiles</hi> took the writing, and willed <hi>Fauſtus</hi> to take a copy of it; with that the perverſe <hi>Fauſtus</hi> being reſolute in his Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, wrote a copy thereof, and gave the devil the one, and kept in ſtore the other.

               <p>DR. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> having given his ſoul to the Devil, renouncing all the powers of Heaven, confirming all his lamentable actions with his own blood, and having already dilivered his writing now into the Devil's hand, the which ſo puffed up his heart, that he forgot the mind of a man, and thought himſelf to be a ſpirit. Thus <hi>Fauſtus</hi> dwelt at his uncle's houſe at <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> who died and bequeathed it in his teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his choſen <hi>Fauſtus. Fauſtus</hi> kept a boy with him that was his ſcholar, an unlucky wag, called <hi>Chriſtopher Wagner,</hi> to whom this ſport and Life that he ſaw his Maſter followed, ſeemed pleaſant. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> loved the boy well, hoping to make him as good or better ſeen in his helliſh exerciſes than himſelf, and he was fellow with <hi>Mephoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philes;</hi>

Beſides that <hi>Fauſtus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was become ſo cunning, that when he opened his window, what Fowl ſoever he wiſhed for, it came preſently flying into the houſe, were it never ſo dainty.

               <p>Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> fell into deſpair with himſelf fearing, if he ſhould motion matrimony any more then the Devil would tear him to pieces. <hi>For this time</hi> (quoth he to <hi>Mephoſtophiles) I am not minded to marry: Then doſt thou well,</hi> anſwered his Spirit.

Wherefore in all haſte, he called unto him his ſpirit <hi>Mephoſtophiles,</hi> deſiring him ſome more of the ſecrets of Hell; what pain the damned are in; and how they were tormented? to whom <hi>Mephoſtophiles</hi> anſwered, <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> thou will have me tell the of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Hell, and of the pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Know, <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> that Hell hath
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028655_0031_0FDA3BF7A4E5C918"/>many figures, ſemblances, and names, but it cannot be named or ſignified in ſuch ſort to the living that are damned, as it is to thoſe that are dead, and do both ſee and feel the torment thereof. For Hell is ſaid to be deadly, out of which there never came any to life again but one, but he is nothing for thee to reckon upon; Hell is blood-thirſty, and is never ſatisfied: Hell is a vally into which the damned ſouls fall; for when the ſoul is cut of man's body, it would gladly go to the place from whence it came, and climbeth up above the higheſt hills, even to the Heavens, where being by the Angels of the firſt model denied entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in conſideration of their evil life ſpent on earth) they fall into the deepeſt pit or valley, that hath no bottom, into a perpetual fire which ſhall never be quenched. Therefore is Hell called everlaſting pain, in which is never hopes for mercy; ſo it is called utter darkneſs, in which we ſee neither the light, the ſun, moon, nor ſtars; and were our
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028655_0032_0FDA3BC688100A88"/>darkneſs like the darkneſs of night, yet were there hopes of mercy: But ours is perpetual darkneſs, elean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the face of God. Hell hath alſo a place in it called <hi>Chaſina,</hi> out of which iſſueth all manner of thunder and lightnings, with ſuch ſhriekings and wailing, that often times the very Devils themſelves ſtand in fear thereof. For one while it ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth wind, with exceeding ſnow hail and rain, congealing the water into ice; with the which the damned are frozen, gnaſh their teeth, howl and cry, and yet cannot die.</p>
               <p>Other whiles, it ſendeth forth moſt horrible hot miſts, or fogs with flaſhing of flames of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; wherein the ſorrowful ſouls of the damned lie broiling in their reiterated torments; yea, <hi>Fauſtus</hi> Hell is called a priſon, wherein the damned lie continually bound; it is called <hi>Pernicious,</hi> and <hi>Exitium,</hi> death deſtruction, hurtfulneſs miſchief, a miſchance, a pitiful and evil thing, world without end, and mark. Hell is the nurſe of death, the heat of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028655_0033_0FDA3BFA26ACD930"/>of fire, the ſhadow of Heaven and Earth, the obligation of all goodneſs; the pains unſpeakable, the griefs unremovable, the dwelling of the Devils, dragons, ſerpents, adders, toads, crocadiles, and all manner of venomous things and noiſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the pubble of ſin, the ſtinking far aſcending from the <hi>Stygian</hi> lake brimſtone, pitch, and all manner of unclean metals; the perpetual and unquenchable fire, the end of whoſe miſeries was never purpoſed by God. Yea, yea, <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> thou ſayeſt I ſhall, I muſt: nay, I tell thee the ſecrets of our kingdom, for thou buyeſt it dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thou muſt and ſhalt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of our torments; there ſhalt thou abide horable torments, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, crying, burning, freezing, melting, ſwiming in a labarynth of miſeries, ſcolding, ſmoaking in thine eyes, ſtinking in thy noſe, hoarſeneſs in thy ſpeech, deafneſs in thy ears, trembling in thy hands, biting thine own tongue with pain, thy heart cruſhed as with a preſs, thy bones broken, the Devils toſſing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028655_0034_0FDA3BC7E6684298"/>firebrands unto thee; yea, thy whole carcaſe toſſed on muck-forks from one Devil to another; yea, <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> then wilt thou wiſh for death, and he will fly from thee; thine unſpeakable torments ſhall be every day augmented more and more, for the greater the ſin the greater is the puniſhment; how lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou this, my <hi>Fauſtus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly thou wilt have me tell thee that which only belongeth to God, which is, if it be poſſible for the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come again into the favour of God, or not: Why <hi>Fauſtus</hi> thou koweſt that this is againſt thy prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe; for why ſhouldeſt thou deſire to know that, having already given thy ſoul, to the devil, to have the pleaſure of the world, and to know the fecrets of Hell, therefore thou art damned, and how canſt thou then come again to the favour of God? Wherefore I diſcreetly anſwer, no; for whomſoever God hath forſaken, and thrown into Hell, muſt there abide his wrath and indignation, in that unquenchable fire, where is no
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028655_0035_0FDA3BFB9824F050"/>hope of mercy to be looked for, but abiding perpetual pains, world without end: Therefore my <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> as thou comeſt to Hell with theſe qualities, thou mayeſt ſay with <hi>Cain,</hi> my ſins are greater than can be forgiven, go hang thy ſelf like <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi> And laſtly, be contented to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer torments with <hi>Divas.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know, <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> that the damned have neither end nor time appointed, in the which they may hope to be releaſed.</p>

Firſt entered <hi>Belial</hi> in form of a bear, with curled black hair to the ground, his ears ſtanding upright; within, his ears were as red as blood, out of which iſſued flames of fire; his teeth were at leaſt a foot long, and as white as ſnow, with a tail three ells long at the leaſt, having two wings, one behind eacharm; and thus one after another, they appeared to <hi>Fauſtus</hi> in form as they were in Hell. <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelf ſat in the manner of a man all hairy, but brown coloured like a ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel curled, and his tail turning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on his back as the ſquirrels uſe; I think he could crack nuts too like a ſquirrel. After him came <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> in curled hair of a horſefleſh colour; his head like the head of a bull, with a mighty pair of horns, and two long ears down to the

The reſt of the Devils were in form of unreaſonable beaſts; as ſwine, harts, bears, wolfs, apes, buffes, goats, antelopes, elephants, dragons horſes, aſſes, lions, cats, ſnakes, toads, and all manner of ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerpents and worms; yet came in ſuch ſort, that every one at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the hall, made their rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and ſo took their places, ſtanding in order as they came, until they had filled the whole hall, wherewith ſuddenly fell a moſt horrible thunder-clap that the houſe ſhook as if it would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len unto the ground; upon which every monſter had a muck-fork in his hand, holding them towards <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> as though they would run a tilt at him: Which when <hi>Fauſtus</hi> perceived he thought upon the

               <p>THERE was a learned man of the town of <hi>Halberſtat,</hi> named <hi>N.

               <p>BUT I pray you in what kind or manner do ſpirits uſe to vex men ſo little by day, and ſo greatly by night? Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> anſwered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpirits are of God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the light, their dwelling is in darkneſs, and the clearer the ſun ſhines, the farther the ſpirits have
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028655_0054_0FDBBEA6B9C8F418"/>their abiding from it; but in the night when it is dark, they have their familiarity and abiding near unto us men. For in the night we ſee not the ſun, yet the brightneſs thereof ſo lighteth the firſt moving of the firmament, as it doth here on earth in the day, by which reaſon we are able to ſee the ſtars and planets in the night; even ſo the rays of the ſun piercing up in the firmament, the ſpirits abandon the place, and ſo come near us on Earth, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs filling our heads with heavy dreams and ſtrong fancies, with ſhrieking and crying in many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſhapes. And ſometimes when men go forth without light, there falleth to them a fear, that their hair ſtandeth up an end; ſo many ſtart in their ſleep, thinking there is a ſpirit by them, groping or feeling for him, going round about the houſe in their ſleep, and many ſuch like fancies; and all this is, becauſe in the night the ſpirits are more familiarly by us, then we are deſirous of their company, and ſo
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028655_0055_0FDBBEA8BB1E9CF0"/>they carry us, blinding us, and plaguing us more than we are able to perceive.</p>

For out of the mightieſt potentates' courts in thoſe countries, he would ſend his ſpirit to fetch away their beſt cheer.

The <hi>Jew</hi> that never was a friend to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> thought with himſelf, this fellow is right for my purpoſe, that will lay his limbs in pawn for money, and was therewith very well content: Wherefore Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> took a ſaw, and therewith ſeemed to cut of his leg, but not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did not ſo.

And for my part, (quoth the <hi>Jew</hi> to himſelf) this will never profit me any thing; and with theſe words, he threw the leg into a ditch. All this <hi>Fauſtus</hi> knew right well, therefore within three days after, he ſent for the <hi>Jew</hi> to make him payment of his ſixty dollars: The <hi>Jew</hi> came and <hi>Fauſtus</hi> demanded his pawn, there was his money ready for him.

In fine, all manner of muſick was heard there in that inſtant, whereat all the glaſſes and goblets, cups and pots that ſtood upon the board, began to dance; then Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> took ten ſtone pots, and ſet them down on the floor, where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they began to dance, and to mite one againſt another, that the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028655_0075_0FDBBEE8854C81A0"/>ſhivers flew round about the houſe, at which the whole company fell a laughing: Then began the other jeſt; he ſet an inſtument upon the table, and cauſed a mighty great ape to come againſt them, which ape began to dance and ſkip, ſhewing them merry conceits. In this and ſuch paſtime, they paſſed away the whole day; when night being come, Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> bid them all to ſupper, which they agreed to; for ſtudents in theſe caſes are eaſily intreated; where he prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to treat them with a banquet of fowl, and afterwards they would go all about with a maſk. Then Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> put forth a long pole out of the window, whereupon preſently came innumerable birds and wild fowl, and ſo many as came, had not power to fly away again; but he took them, and flung them to the ſtudents, who lightly pulled of the necks of them, and being roaſted, then made their ſupper; which being ended, they made themſelves ready for the maſk. Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded every one to put on a clean

So it was that he fell in deſpair with himſelf, and pined away to ſkin and bone: But when he opened the matter to Dr. <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> he aſked counſel of his <hi>Mephoſtophiles,</hi> the which told him what to do. Hereupon Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> went home to the gentleman, and bid him be of good chear, for he ſhould have his deſire, for he would help him to that he wiſhed for, and that this gentlewoman ſhould love none other but him only.

<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028655_0094_0FDBBF27F30EF7F8"/>he fell in love with her, and made her his concubine and bedfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for ſhe was ſo beautiful a piece, that he could not be an hour from her, if he ſhould therefore have ſuffered death; ſhe had ſtolen away his heart, and to his ſeeming in time ſhe was with child, whom <hi>Fauſtus</hi> named <hi>Juſtus Fauſtus.</hi> The child told Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> many things which were done in foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but in the end, when <hi>Fauſtus</hi> loſt his life, the mother and the child vaniſhed away both together.</p>

               <p>NOW when this will was made, Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> called unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſaying, I have thought of thee in my teſtament, for that thou haſt been a truſty ſervant unto me, and faithful, and haſt not opened my ſecrets: And yet farther (ſaid he) aſk of me before I die, what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.

                  <hi>be not thou ſo cowardly minded; for although thou loveſt thy body, it is long unto the day of judgment, and thou muſt die at laſt, although thou live many thouſand years: The</hi> Turks, <hi>the</hi> Jews, <hi>and many an</hi> unchriſtian <hi>emperor are in the ſame condition; therefore, my</hi> Fauſtus, <hi>be of good courage, and be not diſcomfited, for the Devil hath promiſed that thou ſhalt not be in pains as the reſt of the damned are.</hi> This and ſuch like comfort he gave him, for he told him falſe,, againſt the ſaying of the holy ſcriptures.

               </head>
               <p>MY truſty and well beloved friends, the cauſe why I have
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028655_0106_0FDA3C93A9DEF2C8"/>invited you into this place, is this: For as much as you have known me theſe many years, what manner of life I have lived: practiſing all manner of conjurations and wicked exerciſes, the which I obtained through the help of the Devil, into whoſe deviliſh fellowſhip they have brought me; the which uſe, the art and practice, urged by the deteſtable provocation of my fleſh, and my ſtiffneeked and rebellious, will, with my filthy infernal thoughts, the which were ever before me, pricking me forward ſo earneſtly, that I muſt perforce have the conſent of the Devil to aid me in my devices. And to the end I might the better bring my purpoſe to paſs, to have the Devil's aid and furtherance, which I never have wanted in my actions, I have promiſed him at the end and accompliſhment of twenty four years, both body and ſoul, to do therewith at his pleaſure; this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal day, theſe twentyfour years are fully expired; for night beginning, my hourglaſs is at an end, and the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028655_0107_0FDA3CCC393C30F0"/>direful finiſhing whereof I carefully expect; for out of all doubt he will fetch me to whom I have given my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in recompence of his ſervice, body and ſoul; and twice confirmed writings with my proper blood: Now have I called you, my well beloved lords, friends and brethren, before that fatal hour, to take my friendly farewell, to the end that my departure may not hereafter be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from you, beſeeching you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (courteous loving lords and brethren) not to take in evil part any thing done by me; but with friendly commendation to ſalute all my friends and companions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, deſiring both you and them, if ever I have treſpaſſed againſt your minds in any thing, that you would heartily forgive me; and as for thoſe lewd practices, theſe full twenty four years I have followed, you ſhall afterwards find them in writing; and I beſeech you let this my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable end, to the reſidue of your lives, be a ſufficient warning, that you have God always before your
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028655_0108_0FDA3C9642A0AF08"/>eyes, praying unto him, that he will defend you from the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Devil, and all his falſe deceits, not falling altogether from God, as I wretched and ungodly damned creature have done, having denied and defied baptiſm, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s body, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and heavenly powers and earthly men; yea, I have denied ſuch a God, that deſireth not to have one loſt. Neither let the evil fellowſhip of wicked companions miſlead you, as it hath done me; viſit earneſtly and often the church; war and ſtrive continually againſt the Devil, with a good and ſtedfaſt belief in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and uſe your vocation and holineſs. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to cloſe my troubled oration, this is my friendly requeſt, that you would go to reſt, and let nothing trouble you; alſo if you chance to hear any noiſe or tumbling about the houſe, be not therewith afraid, for there ſhall no evil happen unto you; alſo I pray you riſe not out of your beds; but above all things, I intreat you, if
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028655_0109_0FDA3CCEDEB0AC98"/>hereafter you find my dead carcaſe, convey it into the earth, for I die both a good and bad <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> though I know the Devil will have thy body, and that would I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give him, ſo that he would leave my ſoul to quiet; wherefore I pray you, that you would depart to bed, and ſo I with you a quiet night, which unto me, notwithſtanding, ſhall be horrible and fearful.</p>
               <p>This oration was made by <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> and that with a hearty and reſolute mind, to the end he might not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort them; but the ſtudents wondered greatly thereat, that he was ſo blinded, for knavery, conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſuch fooliſh things, to give his body and ſoul to the Devil; for they loved him entirely, and never ſuſpected any ſuch thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had opened his mind to them: wherefore one of them ſaid unto him, ah! Friend <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> what have you done to conceal this matter ſo long from us? We would by the help of good divines, and the grace of God, have brought you out of the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028655_0110_0FDA3C97DD44FB20"/>net, and have torn you out of the bondage and chains of ſatan, whereas we fear now it is too late to the utter ruin both of body and ſoul. Dr. <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> anſwered, I durſt never do it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though often minded to ſettle myſelf to godly people to deſire counſel and help, and once my old neighbour counfeled me, that I ſhould follow his learning, and leave all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations: Yet when I was minded to amend, and to follow that good counſel, then came the Devil and would have had me a way, as this night he is like to do; and ſaid, ſo ſoon as I turned again to God, he would diſpatch me altogether. Thus even thus, (good gentlemen and dear friends) was I inthralled in that fatal bond, all good deſires drowned, all piety vaniſhed, all purpoſe of amendment utterly exiled, by the tyrannous oppreſſion of my deadly enemy. But when the ſtudents heard his words they gave him counſel to do nothing elſe but call upon God, deſiring him, for the love of his ſweet ſon Jeſus Chriſt's
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028655_0111_0FDA3CD0953B8C00"/>ſake to have mercy upon him: Teaching him this form of prayer: O God! Be merciful unto me, poor and miſerable ſinner; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into judgment with me, for no fleſh is able to ſtand before thee! although, O Lord! I muſt leave my ſinful body with the Devil, being by him deluded; yet thou in mercy may preſerve my ſoul.</p>
               <p>This they repeated to him, yet he could take no hold: But even as <hi>Cain,</hi> he alſo ſaid, That his ſins were greater than God was able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give. For all his thoughts was on the Writing, he meant he had made it too pithy in writing it with his own Blood. The Students and the others that were there, when they had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, they wept, and ſo went forth; but <hi>Fauſtus</hi> tarried in the hall, and when the gentlemen were laid in bed, none of them could ſleep, for that they attended to hear if they might be privy to his End. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that between twelve and one o'clock at midnight, there blew a mighty ſtorm of wind againſt the Houſe, as though it would have
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028655_0112_0FDA3C9B010F60A8"/>blown the foundation thereof out of its Place. Hereupon the Students began to fear, and go out of their beds, but they would not ſtir out of the chamber, and the hoſt of the houſe ran out of doors, thinking the houſe would fall. The Students lay near unto the hall, wherein Dr. <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> lay, and they heard a mighty noiſe and hiſſing, as if the hall had been full of ſnakes and adders, with that the hall doors flew open, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> was, then he began to cry for help, ſaying, murther! much ther! but it was with half a voice, and very hollow, ſhortly after they heard him no more: But when it was day, the Students that had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en no reſt that night, aroſe and went into the hall, in which they left Dr. <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> where notwithſtanding they found not <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> but all the hall ſprinkled with blood, the brains cleaving to the wall, for the devil had beaten him from one wall againſt another: in one corner lay his eyes, in another his teeth; a fearful and pitiful Sight to behold. Thon began the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028655_0113_0FDA3C8BD2503B80"/>to wail and weep for him, and ſought for his body in many places; laſtly, they came into the yard, where they ſaw his body lying on the horſe-dung, moſt monſtrouſly torn, and fearful to behold; for his head and all his joints were daſhed to pieces. The forenamed Students and Maſters that were at his death, have obtained ſo much, that they buried him in the village where he was ſo grievouſly tormented. After which they returned to <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> and coming into the houſe of <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> they found the ſervant of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> very ſad, unto whom they opened all the matter, who took it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavily. There they found this hiſtory of Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> noted, and of him written, as is before declared; all ſave only his end, the which was after, by the Students, thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed. Farther what his ſervant noted thereof, was made in another book. And you have heard held by him in his life the ſpirit of fair <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who had by him one ſon, the which was named <hi>Juſtus Fauſtus,</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:028655_0114_0FDA3C9CD5813FC0"/>even the ſame day of his death they vaniſhed away, both mother and ſon. The houſe before was ſo dark, that ſcarce any body could abide therein. The ſame night Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> appeared to his ſervant lively, and ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him many ſecret things which he had done, and hidden in his life-time. Likewiſe there were certain which ſaw Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> look out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by night, as they paſſed by the houſe.</p>
               <p>And thus ended the whole hiſtory of Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi>'s conjuration, and other acts that he did in his life; out of which example every chriſtian may learn; but chiefly the ſtiffnecked, and highminded, may thereby learn to fear God, and to be careful of their vocation, and to be at defiance with all deviliſh works, that God hath moſt precifely forbidden; to the end we ſhould not invite the Dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il as a gueſt, nor give him place as that wicked <hi>Fauſtus</hi> hath done: For here we have a wicked example of his writing, promiſe, and end, that we may remember him, that we go
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028655_0115_0FDA3CD60B519928"/>not aſtray, but take God always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, to call alone upon him, and to honour him all the days of our life, with heart, and hearty prayer, and with all our ſtrength and ſoul, to glorify his holy name, defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the devil and all his works; to the end we may remain with Chriſt in all endleſs joy, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi> That wiſh I to every chriſtian heart, and God's name be glorified.</p>

               <head>A Conjuring Tale.</head>
               <p>AT ſuch time when Perukes were as ſcarce as money is now amongſt moſt men a gentleman who had loſt his hair by a fit of ſickneſs, was forced with the firſt to make uſe of one of them. It happened that he and his boy that attended on him, riding down into the country, there fell ſuch a ſhower of rain, which continued ſo long as obliged them to take up their lodging at a paltry alehouſe in a country village, where ſeeing the weather prove ſo bad, he was reſolved to lie there for that night: After ſome ſhort can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which went by the name of a ſupper, the gentleman was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to his lodging chamber, which was hung with cobwebs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of cloath of Arras; his boy alſo was ſhewn to another chamber,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028655_0129_0FDA3CE80E236280"/>ſomething inferiour you may be ſure to that of his maſter's; which was alſo richly hung with ſpiders tapeſtry, whilſt the gentleman was making himſelf ready, the maid peeped in at a hole under the door (which was made for the cat to go out and in) that when he was abed ſhe might fetch away the candle. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undreſſed himſelf, he pulls off his Peruke, and ſets it upon a ſtool by him, which the maid perceiving, verily imagined that he had pulled off his head; and ſo conceited ſhe was of it, that ſhe ran down to her dame, telling him, that the gentleman who lodged there, was no other than an arrant conjurer, for ſhe ſaw him with her own eyes pull off his head, and ſet it on a ſtool by him; and if ſhe doubted any thing of the truth thereof, if ſhe would go up, ſhe might ſee it ſtanding there at that preſent. Her dame, though ſomething hard of belief of what ſhe heard, yet to ſatisfy her maid's curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, went up; where peeping like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in at the hole, and ſeeing it upon the ſtool, ſhe was then of the ſame
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028655_0130_0FDA3CB06A8DA188"/>opinion with her maid; and ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they were both thereof, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them durſt fetch the candle, and the gentleman was forced to put it out himſelf. That night was ſpent in a great deal of fear, they judging that bad weather to proceed from the conjurer, and expecting yet worſe; but when in the morning they ſaw all fair, and a ſerene ſky, they changed their opinion, and that tho' he was a conjurer, yet that now he would do no more harm. Whilſt they were now entered into this good opinion of him, one of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours came in who had loſt a horſe, whom he judged to be ſtole, for which he made a great complaint. Hold your peace, ſaid ſhe, I can tell you a way which I warrant you will fetch your horſe again: we have a conjurer that is now lodged in our houſe, who for half a dozen of beer, I queſtion not but will do your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and therewithal ſhe went up to the gentleman, acquainting him with her neighbour's loſs, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſiſtance for gaining him
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028655_0131_0FDA3CB2605AF198"/>again; for, ſaid ſhe, I know you have ſkill in the black art, my maid and I ſeeing your head laſt night up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtool, when as the reſt of your body was gone to bed. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perceiving her folly in her grand miſtake, and willing to have ſome mirth after his wet journey, told her, that for her ſake he would do his beſt endeavour for her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and that when he was ready, he would raiſe a ſpirit which would quickly tell him where the horſe was. The woman overjoyed at theſe words ran down and told her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that he would have his horſe again within an hour, and that if he would ſtay ſo long, he ſhould ſee him come galloping to him again in a full career; this news pleaſed him ſo well, that he reſolved to ſtay. In the mean time the gentleman was conſulting with himſelf how to bring his purpoſe the beſt way to effect: In order thereto, he told his boy that he muſt act the part of a dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il; and to perſonate him the better, whilſt I am gone down to ſpeak with them about the buſineſs do
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028655_0132_0FDA3CB667C2D158"/>you turn your coat the wrong ſide outwards, and creep under the bed where you muſt lie till I ſpeak theſe words, <hi>Elhavareuna, Phonſonthon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chya, Heydonicus Towronus Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis Keptoribus;</hi> then do you come forth from under the bed, and make as hideous a noiſe with your mouth as you can poſſible. The boy prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to do as he bid him; and when his maſter was gone down, he went about his buſineſs; but remembering with himſelf, that in the chamber where he lodged, there lay a raw bulls hide, left there by ſome butcher he thought that would perſonate the Devil far better than his coat; and thereupon he ſudenly fetched it, and wrapped himſelf therein, with the horns apearing juſt over his head; which having done, he crept under the bed, expecting the event: Soon after he was fixed, came up his maſter, the dame, the maid, and the fellow that had loſt his horſe; when the gentleman having a chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in his hand, marked them every one out a circle; then placing them therein, he bid them not to ſtir
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028655_0133_0FDA3CEA1C15BA50"/>out of them, whatever they ſaw: So pulling a book out of his pocket, he began to read ſome hard uncouth names, and at laſt came to thoſe words, <hi>Elhavareuna,</hi> &amp;c. when the boy made his appearance from under the bed, with a great pair of horns and a bellowing noiſe: His maſter, who knew not of his boy's new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention for acting the devil, ſeeing ſuch a hideous thing to appear, thought it had been the devil indeed who had come to have puniſhed him for undertaking to conjure, and thereupon he ran as faſt as he could drive, making but one ſtep from the top of the ſtairs to the bottom: The woman and the man ſeeing the gentleman run, thought likewiſe the devil was come to fetch them for being ſpectators, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ran as faſt as he, tumbling down the ſtairs on the neck of one another. The boy ſeeing them all run in ſuch diſorder, thought alſo that the devil was indeed come for him for acting his part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to throw off his cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering; but he had before ſo faſtened
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028655_0134_0FDA3CB7DC96EC88"/>it upon him, that ſeeing he could not pull it off, he ran with it on; when coming to the top of the ſtairs, the hide ſo wrapped about his legs that it threw him from the top to the bottom amongſt them; when they hearing the horns to make a clattering, ſo ſhrieked and bellowed as if the devil had been amongſt them indeed. Sad was the effects of this their conjuring: One had his noſe broke, another his ſhins, ſome hurt their elbows, ſome their thighs, and others their backs, the gentleman loſt his Peruke, the wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fell with their heels upwards; and to conclude, not any one of them ſped ſo well, but he had more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a ſurgeon than a conjurer.</p>

                  <hi>The</hi> Jeſuit <hi>and</hi> Friar.</head>
               <p>A Jeſuit preaching at the great church in <hi>Padua,</hi> towards the end of his ſermon, fell into a large
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028655_0135_0FDA3CEBE1600D58"/>commendation of the order of the Jeſuits, extolling it above all, the religous orders that then were, or ever had been in the world, giving God thanks, that he had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be of that order, and in the cloſe of his diſcourſe, he told his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory that he would acquaint them with a viſion which he had lately ſeen. The other night, ſaid he, I dreamed that I was in hell, where methought I ſaw Popes, Emperors, Kings, Queens, Cardinals, Biſhops, Abbots, Monks, Friars, and ſome of all ſorts of men, both eccleſiaſtical and ſecular, but not one Jeſuit amongſt them all; which made me to bleſs God that ever I was born to be of ſo bleſſed a ſociety, which though it had ſent ſo many thouſands of that holy order to the grave, yet never any of them went to hell; and ſo he concluded his ſermon with a freſh encomium on the ſociety of Jeſuits. The next <hi>funday</hi> after, a dommican fryar preached in the ſame church, and he alſo, towards the end of his ſermon, fell upon the high praiſes of the order of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits;
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028655_0136_0FDA3CBACA6E22B0"/>repeating much of the Jeſuit's ſermon the day before, and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf that it was not his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be of that holy order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none ever went to Hell, as the reverend father had told them the day before; at laſt he told the people, that he had alſo ſeen a viſion, and dreamed likewiſe one night that he was in Hell, where he ſaw popes, emperors, kings, cardinals, and all ſorts of orders, as the Jeſuit had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſhewed them the day before; but not a Jeſuit (ſaid thefryar) could be ſeen among them all. Then thought I to myſelf, O what a bleſſed order is this, that there ſhould not be a Jeſuit there! and ſtill I caſt my eyes all over hell, wiſhing myſelf had been a Jeſuit and not a dominican, to ſee not one piece of that order there. At laſt methought I beckoned a little Devil to me, and aſked him ſoftly in his ear, whether there were any Jeſuits in that place or not? He anſwered, that there were none there, but that they were kept in a Hell by themſelves, which is a great room under this,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028655_0137_0FDA3CEFACB34C60"/>where (ſaid the Devil,) there be abundance of them; and they come hither ſo faſt, that my maſter <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> ſcarce knows where to beſtow them; and beſides they are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly that if they were not kept by themſelves, every body would be ſoon weary of this place: Adding withal, that his maſter durſt not let them have any gunpowder, for fear they ſhould blow up Hell itſelf.</p>

                  <hi>ACARPENTER</hi> had married a very handſome woman to his wife, but that ſhe wearing corkſhoes, it made her light heel'd. This <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter</hi> uſed to work about a mile from home: but for the love he bore to his wife, he would every night come back to bed with her, although it ſeemed, ſhe had rather have had his Room than his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for no ſooner was he gone, but his Place was ſupplied by anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whom ſhe loved more dearly; his next Neighbour, who by Trade was a <hi>Grocer.</hi> It happened one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028655_0138_0FDA3CBBB4C0BED8"/>that the <hi>carpenter</hi> went for that he was accuſtomed; but before his Place was cold, another was gotten therein. He had not gone a Quarter of a Mile, but there fell ſuch a Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Rain, with Likelihood of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, that he returned back again, and drawing the Latch, went into the houſe; which the <hi>Grocer</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, crept out of Bed and got under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it as faſt as he could. It being not yet Day, the Carpenter pulled off his clothes and went to bed; where he had not lain above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, but it ceaſed raining, gave great hopes of a fair day; which the good wife perceiving ſeared her lover would catch cold by being without his clothes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the bed, ſhe jogged her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, telling him now the ſky was very clear, and therefore deſired him to riſe and go to work. The <hi>Carpenter,</hi> who was very obſervant to his wife, did accordingly; but it became ſo dark that he could not ſee, he miſtook, and put on the <hi>Grocer</hi>'s breeches inſtead of his own; and ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his journey, when putting his hands
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028655_0139_0FDA3CF312D05860"/>in his pocket to pull out his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, he found there a handful of money, at which he much marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, knowing not how it ſhould come there; only he thought it was no bad luck to have his pockets ſo lined; yet was he in a quandary whether he was a wake or in a dream, he being ſeldom maſter of ſuch a purchaſe. Putting his hand in his other pocket, he found there a bunch of keys, a note book, and ſome other papers; which increaſed his wonder more then before: But look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down towards his legs, he ſaw the breeches were all full of ribbands, whereas his own never had one on them. Not knowing what to think thereof, he reſolved to go home and confer with his wife. In the mean time the <hi>Grocer</hi> miſſed his breeches, and telling the good wife thereof, they knew not what to do, only ſhe thought it was his beſt way not to ſtay, judging her huſband had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them on, which might occaſion his ſudden return. And indeed her ſuſpicion proved true; but the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band returned home, where he
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028655_0140_0FDA3CC0DE72CCC0"/>found his wife weeping and wali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and taking on moſt bitterly: He aſked her the reaſon thereof; O! ſaid ſhe, the <hi>Grocer</hi> at the next door faſt night brought a pair of breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es heither for me to mend for him, and I being willing to earn a penny, and not always to rely upon your gettings took the buſineſs upon me; ſince which time, I know not how, ſome body hath come in and ſtolen them away? but if I knew the cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oldly rogue that had them, I would have him hanged if it were poſſible. Then caſting her eyes fully upon him, O lack! Huſband, ſaid ſhe, I ſee you have gotten them on: only I was afraid they had been loſt; but herein I will have more care of ſuch things as long as I live. The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hereupon pulled them off, and gave them to his wife; but withal told her, that he had rather allow her twopence out of his day's wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then that ſhe ſhould earn a penny in ſuch ſort.</p>
