            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I left England in November laſt; and, not having then completed the three laſt chapters propoſed in the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, I left this chapter on <hi>REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE</hi> in the hands of the book-ſeller, deſiring him to publiſh it by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But the violent attacks on the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Preſs in that country, which took place about that time, induced him to ſuppreſs the publication of this, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the ſale of the other. He has lately ſent me the Manuſcript; which I now offer, without any alteration, to the Engliſh Preſs in Paris.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.</head>
            <p>A NATION is ſurely in a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, when the principal object of its government is the increaſe of its public revenue. Such a ſtate of things is in reality a perpetual warfare between the few individuals who govern, and the great body of the people who labour. Or, to call things by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names, and uſe the only language which the moral nature of the caſe will juſtify, the real occupation of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors is to plunder or to ſteal, as will beſt anſwer their purpoſe; while the buſineſs of the people is to ſecrete their property by fraud, or to give it peaceably up, in proportion as the other party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it; and then, as a conſequence of being driven to this neceſſity, they ſlacken their induſtry, and become mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable through idleneſs; in order to avoid the mortification of labouring for thoſe they hate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026617_0004_0FD0806C4409C870"/>The art of conſtructing governments has uſually been to organize the ſtate in ſuch a manner, as that this operation could be carried on to the beſt advantage for the adminiſtrators; and the art of adminiſtring thoſe governments has been, ſo to vary the means of ſeizing upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property, as to bring the greateſt poſſible quantity into the public coffers, without exciting inſurrections. Thoſe governments which are called deſpotic, deal more in open plunder; thoſe that call themſelves free, and act under the cloak of what they teach the people to reverence as a conſtitution, are driven to the arts of ſtealing. Theſe have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better by theft than the others have by plunder; and this is the principal difference by which they can be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Under theſe <hi>conſtitutional</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments the people are more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and create property faſter; becauſe they are not ſenſible in what manner and in what quantities it is taken from them. The adminiſtration, in this caſe, operates by a compound movement; one is to induce the people to work, and the other to take from them their earings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:026617_0005_0FD0806DC20F5FD0"/>In this view of government, it is no wonder that it ſhould be conſidered as a curious and complicated machine, too myſterious for vulgar contemplation, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being moved by none but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced hands, and ſubject to fall in pieces by the ſlighteſt attempt at inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or improvement. It is no wonder that a church and an army ſhould be deemed neceſſary for its ſupport; and that the double guilt of impiety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion ſhould follow the man who offers to enter its dark ſanctuary with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane light of reaſon. It is not ſurpriſing that kings and prieſts ſhould be ſuppoſed to have derived their authority from God, ſince it is evidently not given them by men; that they ſhould trace to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſource claims which nature never has recognized, and which are at war with every principle of ſociety.</p>
            <p>I conſtantly bear in mind, that there is a reſpectable claſs of men in every country in Europe, who, whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately intereſted in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the governments or not, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly attached to the old eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026617_0006_0FD0806F43E0EF68"/>
forms. I know not how much pain it may give them to ſee expoſed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view the various combinations of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which appear to me to compoſe the ſyſtem. But I ſhould pay a real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to their ſenſibility, in ſuppoſing that their anguiſh can be as great on viewing the picture, as mine has been in attempting to draw it; or, that they can ſhudder as much at the proſpect of a change, as I have done in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſociety under the diſtortions of its preſent organization. I ſee the noble nature of man ſo cruelly debaſed—I ſee the horſe and the dog in ſo many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces raiſed to a rank far ſuperior to beings whom I muſt acknowledge as my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, and whom my heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but embrace with a fraternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which muſt increaſe with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults I ſee them ſuffer—I ſee the pride of power and of rank mounted to ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable a height in thoſe whom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident has called to direct the affairs of nations—I ſee the faculty of reaſon ſo completely dormant in both their claſſes, and morality, the indiſpenſable bond of union among men, ſo effectually baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026617_0007_0FD08071105DB280"/>
by the unnatural combinations, which in Europe are called Society—that I have been almoſt determined to relinquiſh the diſagreeable taſk which I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to myſelf in the firſt part of this work, and, returning to my country, endeavour in the new world to forget the miſeries of the old.</p>
            <p>But I reflect that the contemplation of theſe miſeries has already left an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my mind too deep to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily effaced.—I am likewiſe convinced that all the moral evils under which we labour, may be traced without difficulty to their proper ſource—that the ſpirit of inveſtigation, which the French ravo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution has awakened in many parts of Europe, is ſtimulating the people to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the enquiry, and will conſequently lead them to apply the remedy. Under this proſpect, every perſon who but thinks he can throw the leaſt light upon the ſubject, is called upon for his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and this duty to his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture becomes more imperious, as it is increaſed by the probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026617_0008_0FD080724887F5C0"/>In conſidering the ſubject of <hi>Revenue and Expenditure,</hi> as in other articles that I have treated, I ſhall confine myſelf chiefly to the great outlines of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; only noticing its effect on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral habits of men; habits which muſt be conſidered as the vital principles of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and which ought always to be kept in view as the firſt object of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in its original conſtitution and in every part of its adminiſtration. I was indeed ſenſible that this ſubject would require more details; and that it might be uſeful to form an eſtimate of the quantity of contributions neceſſary for any given portion of mankind united in a national intereſt; as we might thus be convinced how ſmall a revenue would be ſufficient for all the purpoſes of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional government. But I find myſelf happily relieved from this part of my taſk, by the appearance of the ſecond part of the <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> in which this branch of the ſubject is treated in that perſpicuous manner which might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from its author; a man whom I conſider as a luminary of the age, and one of the greateſt benefactors of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026617_0009_0FD0B92363A83450"/>
Neither my work, nor any other that ſhall be written for ages to come, will ſurely find a reader, who will not have read the <hi>Rights of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are gregarious in their nature; they form together in ſociety, not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from neceſſity, to avoid the evils of ſolitude, but from inclination and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual attachment. They find a poſitive pleaſure in yielding aſſiſtance to each other, in communicating their thoughts and improving their faculties. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in man is the ſource of morals; they have their foundation in nature, and receive their nouriſhment from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. The different portions of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that call themſelves nations, have generally eſtabliſhed the principle of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to the individuals who compoſe a nation, the excluſive enjoyment of the fruits of their own labour; reſerving however to the governing power the right to reclaim from time to time ſo much of the property and labour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals as ſhall be deemed neceſſary for the public ſervice. This is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral baſis on which <hi>property,</hi> public and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026617_0010_0FD0B924E6174438"/>
private, has hitherto been founded. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have proceeded no farther. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in a more improved ſtate of ſociety, the time will come, when a different ſyſtem may be introduced, when it ſhall be found more congenial to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial nature of man to exclude the idea of ſeparate property, and with that the numerous evils which ſeem to be entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it. But it is not my intention in this work to enter upon that enquiry.</p>
            <p>When the feudal ſyſtem, with all its ferocities, was in full operation, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior lord, who repreſented the power of the ſtate, granted the lands to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate vaſſals, on condition of military ſervice. They engaged to ſerve in the wars of the lord Paramount a certain number of days in the year, at their own expence. Thus they ſtipulated as to the <hi>quantity</hi> of ſervice; but gave up the right of private judgment, as to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the war.</hi> This is the origin of the revenue ſyſtem of modern Europe; and it began by debaſing the minds of the whole community; as it hurried them into actions, of which they were not to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026617_0011_0FD0B926616A4A70"/>
enquire into the juſtice or propriety. Then came the <hi>ſocage tenures;</hi> which were lands granted to another claſs of vaſſals, on condition of ploughing the lords fields and performing his huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry. This was a more rational kind of ſervice; though by a ſhocking pervertion of terms, it was called leſs honorable.</p>
            <p>In proportion as war became leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, and its profits more precarious than thoſe of huſbandry, the tenures upon knight-ſervice were converted into ſocage-tenures; and finally it was found convenient in moſt caſes, eſpecially in England, to make a commutation of the whole in money, in certain fixed ſums; and this, by its ſubſequent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications and extentions, has obtained the name of a land-tax. Theſe feudal revenues of the crown, though they were ſuppoſed to be ſufficient for the ordinary purpoſes of government, were capable of being increaſed on any extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and ſuch extraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſure to happen, as often as the government choſe to draw more money from the people. It began this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026617_0012_0FD0B928078798D8"/>
under the name of <hi>aids to the king,</hi> ſubſidia regis; and, in England (before it was found neceſſary to work the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine by regular parliaments) various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients were uſed to raiſe from differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent claſſes of the community theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aids. In many caſes the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the pope was brought in to the aſſiſtance of the king, to enable him to levy money for the court. The pope, as head of the church, received a revenue from the people of England through the Engliſh clergy; and the king, on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſions, agreed with him that he ſhould double his demand; on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the additional ſum to be raiſed, ſhould be divided between themſelves.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cunningham's Hiſtory of Taxes, page 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A perpetual pretext for theſe addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al impoſitions was always to be found in foreign wars. Edward the Firſt muſt ſubdue the Welch; a long ſucceſſion of kings made the glory of the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conſiſt in the reduction of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; others, in conquering the tomb of Chriſt; and others, the crown of France. But in common occurrences, where the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026617_0013_0FD0B929620B0AC8"/>
call for money could not be predicated on any national object ſufficiently glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to excite the enthuſiaſm or rouſe the fears of the people, it was the policy of the king to detach ſome particular claſſes of the community from the common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and to extort money from them, as from a common enemy. Thus all ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were heavily taxed on coming into the realm; thus Jews, with all the wealth they poſſeſſed, were declared to be the abſolute property of the king;<note n="*" place="bottom">In one of the laws of Edward the Confeſſor (which was repeatedly enforced long after the conqueſt, and perhaps is not repealed to this day) the clauſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jews is in theſe words: <hi>Judoei et omnia ſua ſunt regis; quod in quiſpiam detinuerit eos, vel pecunium eorum, perquirat rex, ſi vult, tanquam ſuum proprium.</hi>
               </note> thus, after the religion of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was changed, the papiſts and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors were taxed double to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the national religion; and thus the king could take a ſavage advantage of the misfortunes of individuals, and ſeize their property, under the title of <hi>wrecks; waifs, treaſure-trove, ſtrays, amercements</hi> and <hi>forfeitures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, and a vaſt variety of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, have been practiſed by the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026617_0014_0FD0B92AECFFD238"/>
Engliſh government, to legalize partial robberies, and take poſſeſſion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's money, without the trouble of aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it. But all theſe means were inſufficient to ſupply the unlimited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of a government founded on Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Privileges, Rank and Ignorance. The moſt effectual way to carry on the great buſineſs of revenue was found to be through the intervention of a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and for this purpoſe the farce of repreſentation has been acted over in this country, to much better effect than any ſpecies of fraud or violence has been in any other.</p>
            <p>It would be an inſult to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any reader at this day, to deſcribe to him a thing ſo well known, as the manner in which this game is played between the different branches of the government. The ſecret is out; and the friends of the ſyſtem, who uſed to be occupied in concealing its operation, are now engaged in defending it. The drift of their defence is to change the mode of the deception; and perſuade the people by <hi>argument,</hi> to ſuffer to paſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026617_0015_0FD0B92C84967FE0"/>
before their eyes in open day-light, ſcenes which have hitherto been acted only in the dark. The curtain has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from their hands; and they now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the play can go on without it. This for England, forms a new era in cabinet politics. While the ſyſtem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame, the ſcheme for carrying it on is totally new-modelled; and, like other novelties in the courſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man improvement, it becomes a proper ſubject of our inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>I have known a juggler, who, after having for a long time excited wonder and drawn money from the multitude, by tricks which were ſuppoſed to be the effect of magic, would come forward with an engaging frankneſs, and declare that there was really nothing ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in the art; that it was only the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a little experience and attention to phyſical cauſes, not beyond the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of any one in the company; that, though he had deceived them thus far, he was now ready to undeceive them; and, for another fee, he would go through the ſame courſe again, with the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.

This ingenuous confeſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled their curioſity; the ſpectators continued their attention, and renewed their contributions.</p>
            <p>The government of Great-Britain, under King, Lords and Boroughs, is now defended, both in and out of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, by arguments unknown to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer politicians. As nearly as any words, except the right ones, can expreſs the full force of theſe arguments, they are ſtated by their authors in the following language: "No people ever has been or ever can be capable of knowing what is for their own good, of making their own laws, or of pretending to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them after they are made: as the people of England, during the time of the commonwealth, imbibed a different opinion, it has been thought beſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the laſt revolution, to cheriſh them in their error, in order to come more eaſily at their money. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told them that they were free; that they, as Engliſhmen, ought to be free, becauſe their anceſtors were ſo; that Engliſh liberty was the envy and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026617_0017_0FD0B92F63473060"/>
of the world; that the French were their natural enemies, becauſe they were ſlaves; and it was neceſſary to make a war once in ſeven years, to keep up this idea; that we are ſorry for the increaſing burthen of their taxes; but that was a circumſtance not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by a free people, as they had the privilege of taxing themſelves, and their taxes were the price of their freedom in church and ſtate; that, we intended to leſſen their burthens as ſoon as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our religion and to our happy conſtitution were deſtroyed. But now, gentlemen, we ſee you have diſcovered, and we are willing to acknowledge, that this was all a deception: as to liberty it is but a name; man gives it up on entering into ſociety, in order to enjoy the benefits of being governed; it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was nor ever will be, realized by any nation under heaven; witneſs the horrors of pretended liberty in France, the daily aſſaſſinations and perpetual robberies which you ſee in Mr. Burke's book from beginning to end; witneſs the late infatuation of the Americans; who, already recovering their ſenſes, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026617_0018_0FD0B931562AB2A8"/>
ſick of their boaſted independence,<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a ſerious argument, uſed by ſeveral writers as well as parliamentary and coffee-houſe orators, to prove that liberty cannot exiſt in any country. See <hi>Dr. Tatham</hi> and others.</note> are now wiſhing to return to the protection of their mother-country, where they could purchaſe their laws ready made by us, who underſtand the buſineſs; as to the church, we are convinced it is no matter on what ſort of religion it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, provided it be well connected with the ſtate. We ſhall ſay nothing in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>burthen of taxes,</hi> as it has been falſly called, the phraſe itſelf has no longer any meaning; it is now clearly known that public taxes are, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a public benefit; every well-wiſher to his country muſt wiſh them increaſe; and for that purpoſe he will do all in his power to multiply the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for creating them; for it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all good ſubjects, that a national debt is national proſperity, and that we grow rich in proportion to the money we pay out. We are as frank to confeſs, as any caveller is to aſſert, that the Houſe of Commons is not a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the people; it has no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026617_0019_0FD0B932666DEBD0"/>
with them, and it is no longer to our purpoſe to ſuppoſe that it has; for the people have nothing to do with the government, except to be governed; but the Houſe of Commons is retained in the ſtate, for the ſame reaſon that the other branches of the legiſlature, and the courts and armies are retained, for the ſake of increaſing the wealth and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the people in the augmentation of the revenue."</p>
            <p>Let any perſon look over the whole chaos of writings and ſpeeches that have been publiſhed within the laſt year againſt innovations in the government, and I believe he will ſcarcely find an argument more or leſs than what are here compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Now this is clearly a different ground from what has heretofore been taken in this country for the ſupport of the old ſyſtem. It uſed to be thought neceſſary to flatter and deceive; but here every thing is open and candid. Mr. Burke, in a frenzy of paſſion, has drawn away the veil; and ariſtocracy, like a decayed proſtitute, whom painting and patching will no longer embelliſh,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026617_0020_0FD0B933ED835A18"/>
throws off her covering, to get a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by diſplaying her uglineſs.</p>
            <p>It is hard to pronounce with certainty on the ſucceſs of a project ſo new; but it appears to me extremely improbable that the naked deformities of deſpotiſm can long be pleaſing to a nation ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened as the one to which theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are addreſſed. I cannot but think they are ill addreſſed, and that their authors have miſſed their policy in ſuffering the people to open their eyes to their true ſituation. It is certain that the Cardinal de Richelieu has given them different advice. He, like moſt other great men, is leſs known by his writings than his actions; but he left a poſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous work, called a <hi>Political Teſtament,</hi> which has been remarkably neglected by thoſe for whoſe good it was intended; and by none more than by the preſent friends of ariſtocracy in England. That profound politician obſerves, "That ſubjects with knowledge, ſenſe or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are as monſtrous as a beaſt with an hundred eyes, and that ſuch a beaſt would never bear its burthen peaceably.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026617_0021_0FD0B93563D5BC90"/>
The people muſt be hood-winked, or rather blinded, if you would have them tame and patient drudges. In ſhort, you muſt treat them every way like pack-horſes or mules, not excepting the bells about their necks; which by their perpetual jingling, may be of uſe to drown their cares."</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved, however, that in the buſineſs of taxation, which is nearly all the buſineſs of a public nature that is done by the government in England; a policy not very different from that of Richelieu, has been practiſed with great ſucceſs. The aggregate quantity of the revenue raiſed upon the people has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been ſomewhat known; but the portion paid by each individual, and the time, manner and reaſon of his paying it, are circumſtances enveloped in total darkneſs. To keep the ſubject ignorant of theſe things is the great ſecret in the modern ſcience of finance. The money he pays to government being incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with every thing on which he lives, all that he can know of the matter is, that whether he eats, drinks or ſleeps,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026617_0022_0FD0B936E26FC3F0"/>
walks or rides, ſees the light or breathes the air—whatever he does, drains from him a tax; and this tax is to ſupport the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury of thoſe who tell him they are born to govern. But on which of theſe func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the tax falls the heavieſt—whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greateſt proportion lies upon his bread or his beer, his ſhoes or his hat, his labours or his pleaſures, his virtues or his vices, it is impoſſible for any man to know. As therefore he cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the whole of his animal functions, without ceaſing to exiſt, and as this expedient is not often ſo eligible as ſubmitting to the impoſition, there is no danger but the tax will be collected.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to deſcribe, perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceive, the quantity of evils wrought in ſociety from this mode of collecting revenue by deception; or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty in ſuch a manner, that the people ſhall not be ſenſible when or how it is paid. This is extremely unlike that manly principle of mutual confidence on which men unite in ſociety. It is the reverſe of that conduct, which, ariſing from the open integrity of our own hearts,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026617_0023_0FD0B938A208F3A0"/>
is the guarentee of integrity in others. It is a policy that muſt have originated from two contending intereſts in the nation, from a jealouſy of their own power in the legiſlative body, from a knowledge that ſomething was wrong in themſelves or in the ſyſtem, and from a conſciouſneſs that one or the other, or both, were unworthy of the confidence of the people by whom they were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>I am aware that in the doctrine which I ſhall labour to eſtabliſh on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſhall have to encounter the whole weight of opinion of modern times. Men of all parties, and of all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both the friends, and the enemies of equal liberty, ſeem to be agreed in one point relative to public contributions: <hi>That the tax ſhould be ſo far diſguiſed, as to render the payment imperceptible at the time of paying it.</hi> This is almoſt the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point in which the old and new ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems agree, in thoſe countries where a change of principle has taken place; it is one of thoſe rare poſitions, on which theoriſts themſelves have formed but
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026617_0024_0FD0B93B0B587AE0"/>
one opinion. It is therefore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much reflection, and as great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of caution as a ſerious advocate for truth ought ever to obſerve, that I ſhall proceed to examine a poſition, which, reſting on the accumulated experience of mankind, has not yet been ſhaken by enquiry.</p>
            <p>I will begin by acknowledging the force of two obſervations, which go to the ſupport of the preſent ſyſtem as it applies to moſt of the exiſting govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and to the preſent ſtate of ſociety in Europe: 1. As long as public reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues muſt remain as great as they now are, and as diſproportioned to the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſguiſe the taxes on which they depend; otherwiſe they cannot be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. 2. As long as theſe revenues are applied to the purpoſes to which they now are, it is impoſſible to collect them but by fraud or violence; and violence has been found by repeated trials, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in England, not to anſwer the purpoſe ſo well as fraud. While ſociety remains divided into two parties, which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026617_0025_0FD0B93C6E2D8880"/>
are conſtitutionally oppoſed to each other, it is impoſſible but that they muſt regard each other as enemies, and their conduct muſt be the dictate of mutual averſion. When the people ſee that paying money to their governors, is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to their enemies, they certainly never can give it with a good will; and when they know that this money ſerves only to ſtrengthen the hands of their oppreſſors in forging new weapons of oppreſſion againſt themſelves, they muſt feel an obligation lying upon them to withhold it, rather than to pay it. In this caſe, defrauding the revenue is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not only as juſtice to themſelves, but as a duty to their children. A tax under theſe circumſtances is more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally objectionable than the <hi>Dane-gelt,</hi> which was formerly paid in England: that contribution was made by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to hire a foreign enemy to leave them in peace; and it always had a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary good effect. But a contribution paid to the people's enemies at home, who being few in number, muſt ſoon, if unſupported, fall of themſelves, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promiſe even a temporary benefit;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026617_0026_0FD0B941708CD540"/>
the hand of the enemy that receives it, does not ſo much as lay down its weapon while it graſps the money. As long therefore as ſociety continues in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſordered condition, any arguments drawn from moral propriety muſt be overpowered by the ſtrong voice of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; for reaſons of nature generally fall in a conflict with reaſons of ſtate.</p>
            <p>But as a new order of things begins to make its appearance, and principle is no longer to be borrowed from prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, we will endeavour to diſcover the ground of the received doctrine relative to taxation; and enquire how far that doctrine is, in itſelf, an object of reform. Out of the ſeventeen millions ſterling which are annually paid into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer in England, but about two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and a half are levied in direct tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; that is, in taxes laid in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to be paid directly to the fiſcal officers by the perſons on whom the burthen falls. Theſe are chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the taxes on lands and houſes. In France, before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the proportion of direct taxes was
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026617_0027_0FD0B942EE95A0F0"/>
much greater. According to the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of M. Necker, it was near eight millions ſterling, out of about twenty-four millions and a half, of which the public revenue conſiſted. This is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a third; while the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in England is little more than a ſeventh. Theſe proportions are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome of the moſt approved rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners on the ſubject, in each country, particularly M. Necker and Sir John Sinclair, to be as high as it would be prudent to go with direct taxation. The remaining portion of the immenſe revenues in theſe two kingdoms, about ſixteen millions and a half for France, and fourteen and a half for England, was raiſed in the former, and is ſtill raiſed in the latter, by indirect taxation; by cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, exciſe, and inland duties of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds, called <hi>taxes on conſumption.</hi> The art of impoſing theſe, ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their collection, is to incorporate the ſum to be raiſed for government with the price of every thing for which men pay their money in the courſe of life. It is the hook within the bait of all our pleaſures, of all our convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026617_0028_0FD0B9447B0957A0"/>
and of all our neceſſaries. The hook cannot be ſeparated from the bait, nor the bait from our exiſtence. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to individuals, the queſtion is not, ſhall we pay the tax? but, ſhall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt? The continuance of life is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the tax; and the language of the ſyſtem is, pay the debt to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or pay the debt to nature.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid in Ethics, on the ſubject of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> that, ſuppoſing there is no choice of action, there can be no moral agency, and no virtue. We will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the propriety of the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or of the conſequences drawn from it, as it reſpects our relation to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and our ſubjection to the great laws of nature; but there can be no doubt that the reaſoning is juſt, when applied to the laws of ſociety. Perhaps it is true, that, where I am prompted by the inviſible deſtiny of nature, to do an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the good of my fellow-creatures, this action is virtuous; but when the neceſſity for this action ariſes directly from the poſitive laws of ſociety, in whoſe favor it is to be performed—when
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026617_0029_0FD0B945E1F1D990"/>
the argument derives its force from the ax held over my neck, no idea of virtue can be annexed to the action; it is merely mechanical. On this ground we may eſtabliſh a poſition, which I believe will not be controverted: that the exerciſe of <hi>private judgment</hi> is the foundation of <hi>moral virtue;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that all operations of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment carry deſtruction to the latter, in proportion as they deprive us of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. An arbitrary order impoſed by a maſter, whether it be upon a nation or a ſimple domeſtic ſervant, tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe the mind, and cruſh that native dignity which is abſolutely neceſſary to the exiſtence of merit, or of ſelf-appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. And the effect that ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der produces on the mind is nearly the ſame, whether the action enforced be right or wrong.</p>
            <p>The true object of the ſocial compact is to improve our moral faculties, as well as to ſupply our phyſical wants; and where it fails in the firſt of theſe, it certainly will fail in the laſt. But where the moral purpoſe is attained, there can
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026617_0030_0FD0B94764037B80"/>
be no fear but that the phyſical one will be the inſeparable conſequence; place ſociety on this footing, and there will be no aid or duty that the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt can require from individuals, but what every individual will underſtand. His duties, when firſt propoſed, will all be voluntary, and being clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be founded on the good of the whole community, he will find a greater perſonal intereſt in the performance than he would in the violation. There is no poſition more undeniable in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, than that this would always be the caſe with a great majority of any people; and if we ſuppoſe a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of refractory perſons, who, from want of original conſent, or from a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent change of opinion, ſhould refuſe to perform their duties; in this caſe, the opinions of the great majority aſſume the ſhape of government, and procure a compliance by compulſion and reſtraint. This is the only ſure foundation on which we can ever build the real dignity of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or the correſponding energy of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is eſtabliſhing the moral relations of men on the moral ſenſe of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026617_0031_0FD0B948E1377AA0"/>
men; and it is this union alone that can cheriſh our eſteem or command our reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>On this plan, it is of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance that the wants of the ſtate ſhould never be diſguiſed, and that the duty of the individual, in ſupplying thoſe wants, ſhould never be performed by deception. If the ſtate be properly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized, ſuch diſguiſe and deception will be unneceſſary; and if we wiſh to preſerve it from degeneration, they will be extremely dangerous; as, by attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moral ſenſe of the people, they ſap the foundation of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>When a company of merchants, or other private men, engage in an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe that requires contributions in money, we hear of no difficulties in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtipulated ſums among the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent partners in the company. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry partner makes it his buſineſs to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of the concern; he expects an advantage from the enterpriſe, and pays his money with the ſame wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, as he would pay it in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate buſineſs. He would feel himſelf
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026617_0032_0FD0B94A63B85538"/>
inſulted, if any diſguiſe were thrown upon the ſubject, to cheat him into his duty. Indeed, when the enterpriſe has come to an end, or when there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of loſs, or a ſuſpicion of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management in the agents, it is natural to expect a reluctance in payment, which is only to be overcome by the arts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or the compulſion of law. But this is not the caſe while the company is in a proſperous condition, and while its members are united by mutual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in purſuit of a common intereſt. A nation, whoſe government ſhould be habitually in the hands of the whole community, would always be a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this proſperous condition; its concerns would be a perpetual and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing enterpriſe, in which every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual would find his intereſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his confidence. Perſonal protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and public happineſs would be the objects aimed at in the adminiſtration; and theſe would be infallibly attained, becauſe no human accidents could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. There could be no ſuſpicion of miſmanagement in the agents, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perpetually under the controul of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026617_0033_0FD0B94BE1FC7468"/>
the whole people. Every reaſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which could induce individuals to withhold their pecuniary contributions, would be entirely removed; and the ſame motives which influence a man to give his attention and pay his money in his own perſonal concerns, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to do the ſame things in the concerns of the public.</p>
            <p>If theſe poſitions are not true, then have I miſconceived the character of the human heart, and the real effects to be wrought on ſociety by a rational ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of government; but if they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be true, it ought to be an indiſpenſable maxim to aboliſh and avoid every veſtige of indirect taxation. It muſt appear evident, that to raiſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the people by any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, than by openly aſſigning to every one his portion, and then demanding that portion as a direct contribution, is unneceſſary to the object of revenue, and deſtructive to the firſt principles of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. It has long been complained of in England (ſo long that the complaint has almoſt ceaſed to make any impreſſion
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026617_0034_0FD0B94DB29B8930"/>
even on the minds of thoſe who repeat it) that <hi>the Exciſe is an odious tax.</hi> The reaſon on which the complaint is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is what the principle of government, and of the oppoſition to the government, would naturally ſuggeſt; but it is not the reaſon which I ſhould aſſign. The tax is ſaid to be odious, chiefly becauſe it throws a vexatious power into the hands of the revenue officers, to ſearch the houſes and inſpect the affairs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals. As long as the government and the people are two oppoſite parties in the ſtate, at continual enmity with each other, it is natural that each party ſhould wiſh to conceal its operations, the better to ſucceed in their mutual hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and defence; for ſecrecy is one of the weapons of war. But if the ſtate conſiſted of nothing more than one great ſociety compoſed of all the people, if the government was their will, and its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their happineſs, the reaſons for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy would ceaſe, the inteſtine war would ceaſe, the parties would ceaſe.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of the ſtate and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of individuals might be ſafely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026617_0035_0FD0B94EE33FBA38"/>
to all the world. An open gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of conduct, the reciprocal ſign and guarentee of integrity, would mark the character of every member of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether acting as a public agent, or as a private citizen.</p>
            <p>But the great objection which ought to be made againſt the Exciſe, is the ſame as will apply to Cuſtoms, Duties, and all other tricks of a ſimilar kind, by which the money is drained from the people without their knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The whole ſyſtem of indirect taxation, ſo univerſal in Europe, ſo much extolled by the ableſt financiers, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in compoſing their enormous maſſes of extorted revenue, is wrong from its foundation, and muſt be vicious in its practice. It is built on the great ariſtocratical principle, that men muſt be governed by fraud; and it can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to that ſyſtem of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which divides the nation into two permanent parties, the party that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and the party that pays.</p>

But the late criſis in the government of France, when the people found it neceſſary to reviſe their Conſtitution, offered an occaſion for making ſome remarks which I thought might be uſeful to them on the buſineſs then lying before them. I therefore pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a ſhort Treatiſe on the Defects of their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in "<hi>A Letter to the National Convention,</hi>" in which are particularly treated the ſubject of <hi>Lotteries,</hi> that of public <hi>Salaries,</hi> and ſeveral other matters, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have come into this Eſſay on Revenue.</note> Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and Annuities upon ſeparate lives, merits the ſevereſt cenſure, and ought to be held up to the execration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the moment we are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the real principles of our nature, in managing the affairs of nations. A tontine partakes at once of the nature of lotteries and of ſimple life-annuities, and involves in itſelf the principal vices of both. Like a lottery it is founded in the ſpirit of gambling; and like a life-annuity, it detaches a man from the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and intereſts of his friends, of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and of all mankind, except thoſe of the particular claſs of the tontine to which he belongs; and to them he is rendered, in a literal ſenſe; a mortal enemy.</p>

The reaſon of this is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by Adam Smith.<note n="*" place="bottom">Wealth of Nations, Book V. Chap. III.</note> It was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſuperior influence, in that country, of thoſe unnatural diſtinctions among families, which prevent them from aſſociating with each other on the principles of mutual attachment; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples congenial to the human heart, and no leſs neceſſary to individual happineſs, than to the good order of ſociety and the proſperity of the ſtate. The pride of birth and the jealouſy of rank operate on ſociety like congelation and concuſſion on a body of water: they freeze up the whole maſs, and break it into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pieces; which refuſe to unite among themſelves, or to anſwer the purpoſes which nature has aſſigned to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The genius of ariſtocracy, by the diſtinctions of birth, had eſtabliſhed in France almoſt as many ranks as there were families. Theſe were perpetually repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and repelled, tormented by jealouſies,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026617_0038_0FD0B9540041AC80"/>
and kept aſunder by artificial averſions, which ſilenced the voice of nature, and counteracted every object of ſociety. A man in this frozen, iſolated and repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtate of things, becomes a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the government to ſeduce into a ſelfiſh hoſtility againſt the generous du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life, by the temptation of life-annuities. An elegant French author deſcribes the annuitant as having ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every ſentiment moſt dear to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart: "He amaſſes his whole capital upon his own head, makes the king his univerſal legatee, ſells his own poſterity at the rate of ten per cent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherits his brothers, nephews, friends, and ſometimes his own children. He never marries; he vegetates, until the return of the quarter day, and enquires with eagerneſs in the morning, whether he is ſtill alive; his whole exerciſe of body and mind conſiſts in going once in three months to the notary at the corner of the ſtreet, to ſign his receipt, and obtain a certificate, that he is not yet dead." The officers of government know very well the advantages derived from long humid winters and epidemical
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026617_0039_0FD0B955A3BF6DA0"/>
diſeaſes; and they muſt delight in the winnings of the game thus played by the public treaſury in partnerſhip with death.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>But how is it poſſible that a wiſe government could throw open the gate to thoſe numerous and incredible diſorders, which are the offspring of annuities on lives? The bands between parents and children broken, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs penſioned, celibacy authoriſed, ſelfiſhneſs trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, cruelty reduced into ſyſtem and practice; ſuch are the ſmalleſt evils which ariſe from theſe annuities.

            <p>I am ſenſible that all theſe maxims, which go to a change of ſyſtem in the collection of revenue, are deſtined to reſt merely in ſpeculation, in all countries ſtill afflicted with unnatural plans of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for ſo they muſt reſt, until a total change of principle ſhall have
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026617_0040_0FD0B95722AECCA8"/>
taken place. But let it not be ſaid that, on this account, the hints here given, are uſeleſs. If they are founded in truth and reaſon, the French Republic will ſoon be able to adopt them. By the time that its government ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently ſettled, its public debt will doubtleſs be very conſiderably reduced. Its neceſſary revenue will then be ſo ſmall, compared with what it hitherto has been, the people will be ſo far ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the dignity of freemen, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the duties of citizens, that they will find a ſenſible pleaſure, rather than a ſervile taſk, in paying their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions to the ſtate. This reaſoning may likewiſe be thought worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; where perhaps it may be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame effects. With reſpect to the other countries, we muſt wait. A reformation of ſo deep a nature muſt be preceded by a perfect regeneration of ſociety; ſuch as can only be expected from a radical change of principle in the government.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that men, whoſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the management of public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026617_0041_0FD0B958C314CD98"/>
has taught them to judge with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity on the various perverſities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, will find many obvious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to a theory different from that on which their practice has been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If I do not anticipate all their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in form, I certainly mean to do it in ſubſtance; for I am not unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of their weight. Where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is to be raiſed only for <hi>honeſt</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and where it is to be kept within a moderate compaſs, ſo that the taxes are to be no more than what a well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized community would be willing to lay upon itſelf, all arguments againſt raiſing the whole by direct taxation are deducible to theſe two points: the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident</hi> temper of one claſs of men, and the unreaſonable <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> of others, have always rendered it difficult to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from them their contributions by direct and open means. The firſt of theſe claſſes comprehends many of the poor labouring people in the great towns. Theſe people are in the habit of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all they can earn, if not for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life, at leaſt for ſuperfluous or vicious gratifications. They never
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026617_0042_0FD0B95A2142CD10"/>
provide for a future want, even their own; much leſs would they think of providing for the wants of the ſtate. As it is vain to aſk for money where it does not exiſt, no tax can be collected by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying directly to that claſs of men. It is therefore thought beſt to mingle the tax with their meat and drink; and, ſince they will ſpend all their money for theſe, let a part of it go to the ſtate.</p>
            <p>To this argument ſeveral anſwers may be offered: <hi>firſt,</hi> it is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure owing to the inherent defects of the government, that ſuch a claſs of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident men is found in any ſociety. That men of good intellects and ſound conſtitutions ſhould be inattentive to the means of procuring happineſs, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly contrary to the analogy of nature. Indeed we overlook the cauſe when we go back to nature for it; there is no doubt but it is always to be found in their relative ſituation in the ſocial ſtate. It is the want of early inſtruction, or the want of proper objects of emulation to ſtimulate the mind to a ſenſe of its own dignity, as relative to the ſociety in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026617_0043_0FD0B95BE72A61E8"/>
which it had to act. When the man is taught to know and feel that he never can riſe above the condition of a beaſt of burthen, he acts at leaſt a conſiſtent part, perhaps even a wiſe part, in blunting his feelings, and beating down his mind to the level of his deſtination. But it is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe that perſons in general, who are found in the claſs above deſcribed, have to go through the ſame proceſs of reaſoning, and then of killing their reaſon, in order to arrive at this condition. Such indeed muſt have been the origin of the buſineſs in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but afterwards, the greater part are <hi>born</hi> in this element of apathy: they are ſurrounded all their lives by no other examples but beings of this ſort; and they never have a thought or wiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their preſent ſituation. Their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object is to baniſh all thought and ſtifle every wiſh; and whether they periſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the walls of an ale-houſe, or in a king's ſhip, or on the king's gallows, is to them a matter of perfect indifference.</p>
            <p>Such is the deplorable condition of a numerous claſs of beings whom mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026617_0044_0FD0B95D24E753A0"/>
and miniſters muſt recognize as their fellow-creatures; and if they are called more <hi>vicious</hi> than their rulers, it is becauſe we have perverted the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word. But I am not finding fault with <hi>men</hi> of any particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever. In this drama of human miſery, in which ſo many diſtorted cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are acted, our moral faculties are warped and fitted to the part aſſigned us; and we perform it without ſcruple or enquiry. The judge upon the bench is ſcarcely more to blame, than the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid felon he condemns. The oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and the oppreſſed, of every deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, are, in general, juſt as wicked and juſt as abſurd as the ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment requires. In mercy to them all, let the ſyſtem be changed, let ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be reſtored, and human nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who compoſe the middle claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of mankind, the claſſes in which the ſemblance of nature moſt reſides, are called upon to perform this taſk. It is true that, as reaſon is ſlow in returning to the mind from which it has been ſo
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026617_0045_0FD0B95EA77AF2E8"/>
fatally baniſhed, it will require ſome time to bring the men, who now fill the two extremes in the wretched ſcale of rank, to a proper view of their new ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of citizens. Minds that have long been cruſhed under the weight of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and pride, or of miſery and deſpair, are equally diſtant from all rational ideas of the dignity of man. But even theſe claſſes may be brought back by degrees to be uſeful members of the ſtate; and there would ſoon be no individual, but would find himſelf happier for the change. Place government on the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the whole people, and they will always have wiſdom enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> under this natural organizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtate, ſhould there remain a ſmall number of improvident men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to perform the duties of active citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, there would be many reaſons for excuſing them from any part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic burthen. It is probable that very few inſtances would be found, where the inability did not ariſe from mental or bodily defects; in which caſe, their
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026617_0046_0FD0806644A7B238"/>
claim on ſociety for a ſupport, would take place of any claim that ſociety could have upon them for the payment of a tax. In addition to theſe, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a few others, who, from accidental loſſes, or other misfortunes to which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate property is liable, might be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anſwer the demand of the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; theſe the government would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally excuſe. If, after theſe, there ſhould remain another claſs, who, wantonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of their own happineſs and of their ſocial duties, ſhould be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means of payment (which is a ſuppoſition I admit only for the ſake of argument) the loſs to the ſtate would be very trifling in omitting to collect from them. It would bear no compariſon to the infinite miſchiefs that proceed from the ſyſtem of diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>As to the other point of objection, ariſing from the unreaſonable <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> of ſome ſorts of people, which makes it difficult to come at their money by any direct application to their perſons, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a farther conſideration. But to give it a full diſcuſſion would lead to a
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026617_0047_0FD0B961B9ADEA38"/>
new range of ſpeculation into human nature, extending to a length which I fear would be diſproportionate to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits aſſigned to this chapter. I cannot be ſatisfied with the common opinions we have entertained in regard to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that <hi>property</hi> would naturally have upon the human mind. I ſay <hi>naturally,</hi> not in contradiſtinction to the <hi>ſocial</hi> ſtate, but in contradiſtinction to the <hi>unnatural</hi> ſtate, in which government, founded on conqueſt or accident, has hitherto placed mankind. A natural ſtate of ſociety, or a nation organized as human reaſon would dictate, for the purpoſe of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the greateſt quantity of our phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical wants, with the correſponding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our moral faculties, has never yet been thoroughly tried. It muſt be confeſſed therefore that the opinions we have formed of the human heart ſtand a chance of being erroneous; as they have been forme under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of impreſſions which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to its nature. The picture of man could not have been fairly drawn while he ſat with a veil upon his face. Theſe
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026617_0048_0FD0B96346F3D0D0"/>
facts being premiſed, if we wiſh to come at his genuine character, the hiſtory of his actions muſt be received with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caution; as but little reliance can be had upon their teſtimony. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths of error in which he has been forced to wander, the deluſive tapers with which he has been conducted, and the load of abuſes under which he has had to ſtruggle, muſt have dimmed his underſtanding and debaſed his moral powers, to a degree that cannot yet be accurately known. He riſes into light, aſtoniſhed at what he is, aſhamed of what he has been, and unable to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at what he may arrive.</p>
            <p>Some general traits, however, may be diſcovered in his character, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized as the genuine ſtamp of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Among theſe may be reckoned a certain deſire in every individual of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the good opinion of his fellow-creatures. Some degree of diſtinction, at leaſt ſo far as to acquire an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of character among his equals, and merit their reſpect and confidence, is doubtleſs natural to man; and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:026617_0049_0FD0B965641A62C8"/>
in a true ſenſe, is natural, is, in the ſame ſenſe, laudable. A man, without the artificial aid that ſociety gives him, has but two reſources on which he can rely for obtaining this reſpect; theſe are his <hi>phyſical</hi> and his <hi>moral powers.</hi> By the cultivation of one or both of theſe, he renders himſelf uſeful, and merits the diſtinction that he wiſhes. Property, which is called, perhaps with ſufficient accuracy, the creature of ſociety, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to individuals, only for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate benefit; or at moſt as a pledge of their attachment to the community, by which it is guaranteed. It is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, on the true principles of ſociety, that an individual ſhould diſpoſe of any part of his own property to the benefit of the public. So much of it as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic requires in contributions, is demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a right; it belongs to the ſtate by the nature of the ſocial contract, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for the guarantee of the reſt. It cannot be intended therefore that this ſhould be the way in which a man ſhould uſe his property, to procure to himſelf reſpect; neither is it ſo in fact. The reliance he has upon it, for the purpoſe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026617_0050_0FD0B9656A1E97C0"/>
of reſpect, is founded on a different principle. Except ſuch proportion as is neceſſary in ſupplying his perſonal wants, the poſſeſſor makes uſe of his property as a ſign, or as a ſubſtitute, of perſonal merit. Indeed ſo far as his property is the fruit of his own exerſions, it is not an unnatural indication of abilities; and even where it has deſcended to him from his anceſtors, it is not a more unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ground of pretention, than heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary titles of any other deſcription.</p>
            <p>On this principle, it is eaſy to trace the beginnings of a deviation from a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional eſtimate of things, in our attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to property. A government which had been founded in violence, and was to be carried on for the excluſive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a ſmall proportion of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, muſt have been under the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at all times, of ſupporting itſelf by impoſition. This circumſtance goes at once to the diſcouragement and diſguiſe of the <hi>moral powers</hi> of individuals; as they muſt ceaſe to be cultivated, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ceaſe to be reſpected. As the nation, at the ſame time, grew more
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026617_0051_0FD0B966E1FF9148"/>
numerous, and the ſucceſs of war and other great operations were found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend leſs on <hi>bodily ſtrength,</hi> this too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to loſe its eſtimation, and could no longer be relied on, as a title to reſpect. A natural reſource therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which to eſcape from theſe unnatural reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was found in a veneration for external and fallacious ſigns of merit, appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to individuals. This was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of all hereditary titles of honor; and it muſt likewiſe have been the origin, at leaſt in a great meaſure, of our exceſſive attachment to property.</p>
            <p>There is another point of view in which this theory may be placed, that will ſhow it to be ſtill more probable. In the ſame proportion as this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for property offered a reſource to individuals, on their giving up the natural rights of cultivating their perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al talents, it alſo became a neceſſary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in the hands of the government. It is eaſy to perceive, that, in a ſyſtem where every thing depends on heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rank, the perſon placed at the head
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026617_0052_0FD0B968C6214E30"/>
ought always to be entitled to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhare of reſpect. And where ſhould a king ſeek for this, but in exterior pomp? Neither wiſdom nor ſtrength can be made hereditary, but titles and property may. It was abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that thoſe qualities, in which the king might be rivalled or ſurpaſſed by his ſubjects, ſhould be brought into diſrepute; and that all mankind ſhould fix their admiration on thoſe in which he could excel. Governments of this kind are ſure to be adminiſtered in ſuch a manner, that the king ſhall always be the richeſt man in the nation; and they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally go farther, and make other men rich in proportion to their ſervility to him. It is thus that the order of nature is invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and names are ſubſtituted for things. The ſimple uſes of <hi>property</hi> are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſplendid magnificence of <hi>wealth.</hi> This becomes the great and almoſt univerſal object of human ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it excites the gaze and veneration of all claſſes of men. Individuals are really not to be blamed, nor their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be called in queſtion, for this manner of eſtimating things. Exterior
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026617_0053_0FD0B969E3176218"/>
pomp is, in fact, more uſeful to them, than perſonal qualifications. It indeed often takes place of all the ſolid enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life; and it never can be ſtrange that it ſhould do ſo, as long as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures that reſpect, the deſire of which is doubtleſs among the ſtrongeſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our nature. We never hear of a man committing ſuicide for the want of a loaf of bread, but it is often done for the want of a coach.</p>
            <p>Such is the paſſion, and ſuch, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is the <hi>origin</hi> of the inordinate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for property, in the preſent ſtate of manners. The greater part of rational men agree that theſe things are wrong; they agree that the general taſte and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of mankind, on this ſubject, are erroneous; and they wiſh they could be changed. The only point in which I differ from theſe men in opinion is, that I have no doubt but theſe things <hi>will</hi> be changed. I think we diſcern the radical cauſe of the evil; I think that cauſe will ſoon be removed; and the remedy will inevitably follow; becauſe it is nothing more than a ſimple opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of nature, recovering herſelf from reſtraint. I am not preaching a moral lecture on the uſe of riches, or the duty of charity; I am endeavouring to point out the means by which the neceſſity for ſuch lectures may he ſuperceded. A duty that runs contrary to habit, is hard to be enforced, either by perſuaſion or by law. Rectify our habits, and our duties will rarely be omitted.</p>
            <p>Good men in all civilized nations, have taken unwearied pains, and given themſelves real grief of heart, in cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vices and recommending the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mankind, relative to the uſe and abuſe of property. Their labours have doubtleſs done ſome good; for we may readily conceive that the quantity of miſery in the world is not ſo great as it might have been without them. But theſe men have not penetrated to the root of the evil; or rather, they have overlooked it; and the remedies they have propoſed have always been partial, unpromiſing, and without ſucceſs. They lay the blame to the natural propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the human heart, and call upon
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026617_0055_0FD0B96E8A858AE0"/>
individuals for reformation. Whereas, the fault lies not ſo deep, nor is he cure to be looked for from individuals, even with reſpect to themſelves. Habit is the ape of nature; it aſſumes her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and palms its vices upon her. And as the univerſal habit with reſpect to the ſubject now in queſtion has ariſen out of unnatural and degrading ſyſtems of government, a reformation can be expected, only from referring back to nature for a change of thoſe ſyſtems; and there is no doubt but this remedy will be effectual.</p>
            <p>Eſtabliſh government univerſally on the individual wiſhes and collected wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the people, and it will give a ſpring to the moral faculties of every human creature; becauſe every human creature muſt find an intereſt in its welfare. It muſt afford an ample ſubject for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and exertion; which cannot fail to give a perpetual improvement to the mind, and elevate the man to a more exalted view of himſelf, as an active member of that ſocial ſtate, where vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue has a ſcope for expanſion, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026617_0056_0FD0B96F2191E328"/>
is ſure to be rewarded. Being thus reſtored to nature, every thing is eaſy and progreſſive; the individual looks to himſelf for his title to reſpect, the moment he becomes habituated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and know that this is the only title that will anſwer his purpoſe. The idea of relying on the glare of exterior pomp, whether it be of wealth or hereditary rank, muſt be regarded as what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is in fact, the effort of a weak mind to cover its own weakneſs. Such efforts being reſented by the people, as attempts to impoſe upon their underſtanding, they muſt fall into diſrepute and be laid aſide. They cannot be uſeful, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be kept in countenance, in a ſociety founded on the baſis of human reaſon.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to conceive to what an extent this circumſtance would operate on the character of the human mind, with reſpect to its attachment to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. If the preſent ſyſtems of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are unnatural, I am convinced that this part of the human character is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural; and a change in the former muſt produce a change in the latter.

One of the uſes of property, that of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing reſpect, would be entirely cut off. And it muſt be conſidered that this is the uſe that has generally had the moſt powerful effect upon the mind; becauſe it is immoderate and unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is well known that rivals in the diſplay of wealth are among the moſt jealous rivals in the world; and that there is uſually no limit to the deſires of a man on this ſubject, when they once paſs the limit of his real or expected wants.</p>
            <p>One ſimple fact, with reſpect to the French nation, is almoſt ſufficient of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſupport the opinion I here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. But I thought it neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adducing that fact, to recur to the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oretical principles; in order to ſhew that both the fact and the opinion are founded in nature, and therefore may be truſted, ſo far as they go, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a practical ſyſtem. It is well known that the national character of that people within four years has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone almoſt a total change, with regard to the eſtimation of exterior marks of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026617_0058_0FD0B97284667AE8"/>
diſtinction, of every kind. What is called Rank, ariſing from hereditary ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, had formerly as great an influence in the country, as at court; it was held as ſacred, in the moſt ſequeſtered walks of life, where actions obey the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of the heart, as in the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant aſſembly, where they are regulated by a Maſter of Ceremonies. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for wealth itſelf in any nation to be more reſpected than titles were in France among all claſſes and deſcriptions of people. Their veneration for King was proverbial through the world; and this was only a ſample of their univerſal reſpect for every thing that bore the name of hereditary tokens of rank. Their adoration for theſe diſtinctions could ſcarcely be conſidered as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of habit; it had ſo far wound it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the native character and ſoul of a Frenchman, that it could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from an element of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But the change of government, like a chymical analyſis, has ſeparated the droſs of habit from the gold of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it has melted off the courtier and ſhewed us the man.</p>

               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:026617_0059_0FD0B973A30531D8"/>This is not all. <hi>The brilliance of wealth</hi> has likewiſe in that country loſt its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer value; it being no longer conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either by the proprietors or by others, as capable of commanding reſpect. I know it will be ſaid, in anſwer to this, That it is owing to a temporary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; that the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have taken the government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own hands, are envious towards the rich, and are aiming to reduce all men to a level in regard to property. The plaineſt reply to this aſſertion which has often been repeated is, what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour itſelf would make, <hi>that it is not true.</hi> No people ever ſhewed a more ſacred regard to private property than the French have uniformly done, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole revolution. And, as if to put calumny to the bluſh, and baffle all theories of ſophiſtry againſt a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reclamation of rights, this regard to private property has been in proportion to the irregularity of their movements, and the opportunity for pillage. It is to be wiſhed that governments themſelves would learn a leſſon of honor from theſe examples of anarchy, inſtead of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing venal writers to abuſe them.</p>

               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:026617_0060_0FD0B97525927820"/>It cannot be denied, that in all other parts of Europe there are two diſtinct purpoſes to which property is applied, —a reſource againſt phyſical wants, and a reſource for perſonal reſpect. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that in France it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ceaſed, in a great meaſure, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the laſt of theſe purpoſes. The cauſe of this is perfectly natural, and I have no doubt that it muſt be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. The ſame effect will be produced in other countries, by placing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on the ſolid baſis of reaſon, inſtead of propping it up on the totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foot-ſtool of impoſition.</p>
            <p>I am aware that my argument is ſtill expoſed to one objection, from thoſe readers who are acquainted with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of ſociety in <hi>America.</hi> It will be ſaid, that the people of the United States manifeſt a great attachment to property, conſidered as <hi>wealth,</hi> and merely for the purpoſe of parade; that, though their government is American, their manners are European. To this I reply, in the firſt place, that the charge is true only in a limited ſenſe. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026617_0061_0FD0B976C456FE10"/>
of riches in that country, even on the minds of thoſe who poſſeſs them, is by no means ſo great as it is in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. But this anſwer will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſatisfactory to the objector, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſo to me. We muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the fact to exiſt, at leaſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree, and endeavour to ſearch out the cauſe. The people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have been always accuſtomed to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their maxims, as well as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from the various nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, from which they emigrated: in the trading towns, many of the preſent inhabitants are really Europeans, having been in the country but a ſhort time; and emigration is perpetually ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all parts of the ſtates with new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures: faſhions, and a taſte for expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive modes of living, are imported with other merchandiſe. In the article of Public Salaries, the governments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been too much guided by European ideas; which ſuppoſe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that public officers ſhould enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope themſelves in pomp and ſplendor, in order to inſpire a veneration for the laws. For though ſalaries in general
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026617_0062_0FD0B97823843578"/>
were fixed at the revolution on a ſcale ſo low as to bear little proportion to what was common in Europe, and tho' in ſome inſtances they have been ſince reduced, yet they are ſtill ſo high as to bear little proportion to what they ought to be. Theſe things have a great effect on the general maxims of life in that country. But theſe things can never apply to Europe; and, on a change of government and manners in the old world, they will ceaſe to apply to the new.</p>
            <p>The Americans cannot be ſaid as yet to have formed a national character. The political part of their revolution, aſide from the military, was not of that violent and convulſive nature that ſhakes the whole fabric of human opinions, and enables men to decide which are to be retained as congenial to their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which ſhould be rejected as the offspring of unnatural connections. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, the weight of oppreſſion there had never been ſo great, nor of ſo long a duration, as to have diſtorted in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant degree the moral features of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026617_0063_0FD0B979F108A878"/>
man. He recognized himſelf as the ſame being, under the new ſyſtem as the old; for the change of form had not been ſo perceptible as to require a great change of principle. Under theſe circumſtances, the people continued moſt of their antient maxims, though they were a mixture of foreign and domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; and, as habit is a coin current in all countries, it is not ſurpriſing that whatever had received the ſtamp of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the poliſhed nations of Europe, ſhould be adopted without ſcruple by the offspring of thoſe nations in America.</p>
            <p>The circumſtance of their not being inveſted with what is called national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, though hitherto a ſubject of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, will in future be much in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. The public mind being open to receive impreſſions from abroad, they will be able to profit by the practical leſſons which will now be afforded them from the change of ſyſtem in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world. It will be found there, as it is now found in France, that the diſplay of wealth will ceaſe to be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged as an emblem or ſubſtitute for
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026617_0064_0FD0B97BCC05A300"/>
perſonal talents; and it will be coveted every where, in a leſs degree than at preſent; as it will fail to gratify the paſſion for reſpect. It may be farther remarked, that this is not the only cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in which the ſtate of ſociety in America will be eſſentially benefited by a change of manners in Europe.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be confeſſed, after all, that this is a theory to which it is hard to gain proſelytes; eſpecially among that claſs of men, whoſe knowledge of the world has taught them a caution which ſhuns the allurements of audacious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. And, ſince it muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to experience, to that I truſt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. I profeſs nothing more in this work, than to contemplate the <hi>effects</hi> that a general revolution will produce on the affairs of nations. But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating theſe, it is eſſential that we ſhould be appriſed of the correſponding change that will neceſſarily be wrought on the character of man; in order that, being prepared for the event, he may think of ſuch arrangements as ſhall be likely to prevent his relapſing into the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which have coſt him ſo much miſery.</p>

               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:026617_0065_0FD0B97CA3347380"/>A chapter which treats on the ſyſtem of abuſes ſo generally adopted in <hi>raiſing</hi> a revenue, can ſcarcely be cloſed with ſatisfaction to the reader, without ſome reflections on the correſponding abuſes which are found in the <hi>application.</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing of high ſalaries, civil liſt, peace eſtabliſhment, and the other enormities on which privileged orders and ſenſeleſs places depend. Theſe will ſo ſoon fall, with the wretched plans of government they ſupport, that it really ſeems like an ungenerous triumph, to wiſh to haſten their fate. When the buſineſs of government ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, like other buſineſs, on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of common ſenſe, it will be paid for, like other buſineſs, in proportion to the ſervice performed. And unleſs this proportion be ſtrictly obſerved in the payment, theſe principles will not long be obſerved in the ſervice. But our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in this place, on the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of revenue, will chiefly be confined to the ſubject of Public Debts. This ſubject becomes more important at this time, not merely on account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent magnitude of thoſe debts in moſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026617_0066_0FD0B97E33C70140"/>
of the ſtates of Europe, but as relative to the principle on which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and ſupported. Should this principle be found to be dangerous to liberty, and ſuitable only to a vicious form of government, it will furniſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of deep reflection to a nation that wiſhes to eſtabliſh its affairs on the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of reaſon and nature.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt take a review of that mode of anticipation, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to moſt of the modern govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Europe, and known by the name of the <hi>funding ſyſtem.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention (for ſo the art of funding is ſometimes called) has received from the hands of different writers, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of cenſure, as well as much unqualified and injudicious praiſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when conſidered with reference to its wide ſweep of attending circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it preſents itſelf to the mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a variety of aſpects, and forms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a ſtupendous object of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; having produced effects that have far ſurpaſſed the limits of previous cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation or belief. In politics and war,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026617_0067_0FD0B97FA1E5B818"/>
it has changed the face of Europe. With regard to other concerns, both of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and individuals, its effects have been various, contradictory, deluſive, and incapable of accurate eſtimation. It has aſtoniſhingly multiplied the force and activity of trade; but it has increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an equal degree the quantity of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and deſtructive ſpeculation. It has converted commerce into a weapon of war; and it has made of that tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous calamity an alluring inſtrument of commerce. It has brought theſe two occupations, ſo extremely oppoſite in their nature, to a cordial coalition and mutual ſupport; and thus by the aid of both, it facilitates every project of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in the government; until it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliariſes the public mind to a ſerious acquieſcence in a paradox, which muſt have excited the ridicule of any age ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed only to common calculation— That the more a nation is debilitated and exhauſted, the more ſplendid and powerful it grows. Indeed the ſyſtem is replete with ſo much apparent good, attended with its ſolid weight of evils, that we may be thought to incur the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026617_0068_0FD0B98180A02800"/>
guilt of partiality or inattention, ſhould we fail to qualify our cenſure with ſome degree of approbation.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion, Whether the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of funding ought to be admitted in all its latitude, can be decided only by ſtriking the balance of good and evil in the effects that it muſt from its nature produce. And I think, on conſidering the ſubject as relative to a free republic, the balance will be found much more on the ſide of the evil, than it is when applied to the old plans of government.</p>
            <p>The benefits, to be derived from the ſyſtem, are of two kinds:—<hi>commercial,</hi> as it facilitates the buſineſs of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and <hi>political,</hi> as it aids the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the great operations of war. It is well known, or at leaſt it is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally believed, that the public debt in England, being funded on the baſis of mortgaging the national revenue for its intereſt, has created a prodigious maſs of capital in the hands of trade. By furniſhing men with a kind of ſtock, which they are ſure of turning into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026617_0069_0FD0B982A3916478"/>
at any moment they chooſe, it ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them to vary their operations with ſuch facility, as to ſeize many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in domeſtic and foreign markets, which muſt otherwiſe paſs without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. It is in a great meaſure to this circumſtance, that many perſons (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps without a due conſideration of cauſes) have attributed the flouriſhing ſtate of commerce in this kingdom. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſince it is found that commerce has increaſed with the augmentation of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the argument in favor of unlimited funding has become ſo ſeducing, that the paradox has ariſen almoſt to a ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm; it is ſaid that public inſolvency is public wealth, and the national debt is itſelf a national benefit.</p>
            <p>The advantages of a <hi>political</hi> nature, which are derived from the principle of funding, conſiſt in eſtabliſhing ſuch an unqueſtionable credit, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can at all times borrow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means or the intention, or even the promiſe of payment. This credit anſwers all the purpoſe of an inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſury, on which the government
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026617_0070_0FD0B98422E06010"/>
may draw at any moment, and to any amount. It is eaſy to conceive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe facility thus given to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of adminiſtration. It enables them to begin, on the ſhorteſt notice and with the greateſt ſecrecy, the moſt expenſive operations, and then to purſue them to any extent; and this without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſhes of the nation. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludues the neceſſity of accumulating a national treaſure by previous taxation and economy; a meaſure which muſt always be attended with the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of loſing the uſe of the money, from the time it is hoarded, until it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. It likewiſe avoids the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of another operation no leſs to be dreaded by officers of government in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; I mean a ſudden augmentation of taxes, by which the people ſhould be called upon to ſupport the expences of the year, within the year. A meaſure which, if not ſometimes impoſſible, would often be hazardous to the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of miniſters, and to the ſucceſs of extraordinary enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:026617_0071_0FD0B985F3EFC6C0"/>Such is the general ſummary of the advantages derived from the Funding Syſtem; and this opens to our view the train of evils with which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted. Theſe I fear will be too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to be particularly noticed, and too great to be readily conceived. In the hands of an adminiſtration, I will not ſay <hi>corrupt,</hi> but an adminiſtration whoſe intereſt is in any meaſure differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from that of the nation at large, this ſyſtem is the moſt dangerous inſtrument that can be imagined; as it is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of incalculable force, and may be always wielded without oppoſition. This, from the nature of the ſubject, muſt be the caſe; becauſe the expences of any projected enterpriſe being charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on poſterity; the party moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in making the oppoſition, is not in being at the time, and cannot be heard in its remonſtrance. Thus, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of war, which is the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the Funding Syſtem, it enables governments to hire men to ſlaughter each other with more than their own ſwords. They wring out of the hard earnings of future generations the means
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026617_0072_0FD0B9884A000730"/>
of deſtroying the preſent. Here is a double violence with the generation, that goes to war by the aid of funding, commits on the age that is to follow. It precludes the exiſtence of one part of ſociety, by deſtroying thoſe who ſhould have been their progenitors; and it charges the portion of poſterity, that eſcapes into exiſtence, with the expences of killing the fellows of their anceſtors. And theſe expences they muſt pay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cruel diſadvantage of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of half their natural reſources, by a diminution of their natural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>As military operations are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, every man killed or deſtroyed in war, coſts to the nation upwards of a thouſand pounds ſterling. This calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is taken from a view of the laſt war in which England was engaged. The nation expended in that war, as ſtated by Sir John Sinclair,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the Reve<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Great-Britain, in battles, hoſpitals, and priſons; probably it did not exceed 139 thouſand. So that the people of this country are now conſoling themſelves for the loſs of their friends and relations, by paying for their execution at the rate of a thouſand pounds a head. Other jobbs performed in ſuch a wholeſale manner are generally charged at a cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate; but this is more expenſive than the buſineſs of a like nature, which is done in the formality of detail, at the Old Baily and Newgate.</p>
            <p>It requires but a ſlight obſervation on the character of the times in different ages, to ſhow that the object of war, and the ſpirit with which it is conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have been altogether different, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the preſent century, from what they were in more remote periods of modern hiſtory. In the maratime nations of Europe, the object of war has changed from religion to commerce; from a point of honor among kings, to a point of profit among merchants, miniſters and generals. Theſe ſubjects have nothing in their nature ſufficiently animating to
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026617_0074_0FD0B98A29D3AFF8"/>
rouſe the enthuſiaſm of a whole nation to ſuch a degree, as to render it ſafe for the projector of a war to apply to the people for their immediate ſupport. Therefore, to find the means of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on, they reſort to a principle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial to the object of the war; and it becomes ſupported, as it is projected, in the ſpirit of commerce. But, as all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive wars, in every poſſible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, can only be maintained by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the people, the government in this caſe recurs to a commercial decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and induces them to undertake the burthen, on condition that the weight of it be ſhifted off to a future peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. Such is the origin of funding; and it has evidently riſen out of the neceſſity that governments were under, of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principle of deception, in order to conform to the ſpirit of the times.</p>
            <p>As an engine of ſtate, the funding ſyſtem has completely taken place of religious enthuſiaſm; and mankind have been hurried on to their own deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the former, within the two laſt ages, with as little prudence and as
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026617_0075_0FD0B98A312BDC30"/>
much deluſion, as they were by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the twelfth century. Indeed, I ſee no reaſon why a genuine cruſade could not have been undertaken, even by the government of Great-Britain within the laſt fifty years, and carried on to any extent, by the aid of the funding ſyſtem. For the principle of the ſyſtem is ſuch as to prevent men from enquiring into the object of the war; as every inducement to ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is almoſt completely taken away, with reſpect to every claſs of ſociety. One claſs, by the previous operation of the ſame ſyſtem in the increaſe of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are rendered ſo wretched in their domeſtic condition, that they are glad to engage as ſoldiers in any cauſe, for the ſake of the pay, ſo pittifully ſmall as the pay of a ſoldier is; another claſs, and one that has great influence on the public opinion, is compoſed of generals, contractors, miniſters and ſecretaries, with all their dependants, who are ſure to make a profitable jobb of any war, however it be conducted, and whatever be its object; another claſs conſiſts of idle ſpeculators in the funds, whoſe chance
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:026617_0076_0FD0B98BE2F5AD30"/>
of gain increaſes with the joſtling of public affairs, and eſpecially with the augmentation of the debt; while the reſt of the community, who cannot be rendered active by the allurements of private profit, are rendered paſſive by deferring the payment of the loſs.</p>
            <p>From the time when the predatory ſpirit, which led the northern Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ravage the ſouth of Europe, had ſubſided, and given place to its natural offspring, in the eſtabliſhment of feudal monarchy, the hiſtory of this quarter of the world begins to aſſume a conſiſtent ſhape; and it offers itſelf to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, as relative to the ſpirit of nations, under three ſucceſſive aſpects. Theſe are the ſpirit of Hierarchy, the ſpirit of Chivalry, and the ſpirit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Out of theſe different materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als the genius of the government has forged inſtruments of oppreſſion almoſt equally deſtructive. It has never failed to cloud the minds of the nation with ſome kind of ſuperſtition, conformable to the temper of the times. In one age it is the ſuperſtition of religion, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:026617_0077_0FD0B98D221D6600"/>
the ſuperſtition of honor, in another the ſuperſtition of public credit.</p>
            <p>The deplorable uſe that has been made of the laſt of theſe, during the preſent century in England, and for a much longer period in ſome other governments, has induced many perſons to regret that the ſpirit of commerce has ever become predominant over that of chivalry and that of the church. They ſee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted meanneſs in the one, which ill compares with the open enthuſiaſm of the other two. But, before we find fault with what ſeems to be the order of nature in theſe events, we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the effects that it has and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, in the progreſs of ſociety and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Chivalry and hierarchy taught us to believe that all men who did not pay homage to the ſame monarch, or uſe the ſame mode of worſhip with ourſelves, were our natural enemies, and ought to be extirpated. The ſpirit of commerce has brought us acquainted with thoſe people; we find them to be like other men, and that they are really uſeful to us in ſupplying our wants. As their
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026617_0078_0FD0B98EA2F599A8"/>
exiſtence and their proſperity are found to be advantageous to us in a commerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al point of view, we ceaſe to regard them as enemies; and refuſe to go and kill them, unleſs we are hired to do it. But as commerce may deal in human ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as in other things, when ever the government will offer us more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for deſtroying our neighbours than we can get by other buſineſs, we are ready to make enemies of our beſt friends, and to go to war, as we go to market, on a calculation of profit.</p>
            <p>This is the true ſpirit of commerce, as relative to war. But as this ſpirit has made us better acquainted with all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations, and with ourſelves, it has excited a diſpoſition for enquiry into the moral relations of men, with a view to political happineſs. The reſult of this enquiry is now beginning to appear. It has already convinced us that there can be no poſſible caſe in which one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be the <hi>natural</hi> enemy of another; and this leads us to diſcover the cauſe why they have been <hi>factitious</hi> enemies. The whole is found to have been a fatal deception perpetually impoſed upon each
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026617_0079_0FD0B990211F56F0"/>
nation by its own government, for the private benefit of its adminiſtrators. The ſame ſpirit of enquiry is now lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people to change the form of their governments, that ſociety may be reſtored to its proper foundation, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral happineſs of the great community of men.</p>
            <p>On examining the ſucceſſion of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which mark the character of the times through theſe different periods, it appears that, when the ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce had become predominant, the only engine of ſtate, which could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon to excite the people to war, was the eſtabliſhment of a national cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by funding the national debts. And we ſhould not be wide from the truth in aſſerting, that to the funding ſyſtem alone the principal commercial nations of Europe are to attribute the wars of the preſent century, as well as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous debts under which they have learned to ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>Such have been the effects of funding, under the old forms of government; and having aſcertained the principles on
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026617_0080_0FD0B991A1477C48"/>
which it has operated in producing theſe effects, we ſhall be better able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it be admiſſable in the policy of a free republic. In this great criſis of human affairs, it behoves man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to probe the wounds of nature to the bottom, and to remove every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence which might prevent a perfect cure.</p>
            <p>Men of contemplative minds, as well as thoſe of practical knowledge, have now become ſo generally agreed in the neceſſity of the funding ſyſtem, that, though they diſcern the evils to which it muſt expoſe a nation, I fear it is one of the laſt of their eſtabliſhed maxims that they will be willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſeverity of diſcuſſion. The univerſal opinion is that a ſtate cannot exiſt without a national credit; unleſs it put itſelf to the diſadvantage of hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up money, and keeping a treaſure in reſerve. And this latter meaſure, beſides the inconvenience above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, of loſing the uſe of the capital while it lies inactive, would throw into the hands of the executive government,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026617_0081_0FD0B993297363A0"/>
the ſame dangerous power which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to them by the means of credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this reſpect their reaſoning is juſt; and perhaps a full treaſury would be the greateſt evil of the two.</p>
            <p>But after all, what is the advantage of a national credit? I mean, in the ſenſe in which it is generally underſtood, the facility of raiſing a capital on long annuities, by a mortgage of revenue. Shall we not find on an inveſtigation of this very ſimple queſtion, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage derived from ſuch a credit (even ſuppoſing it never to be abuſed) can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be applicable to the old ſyſtems of government? Will it not appear that it is an advantage totally unneceſſary to a rational and manly adminiſtration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the wiſhes of a free and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened people? I am ſuppoſing, and it is but fair to ſuppoſe, that ſuch a people will always underſtand their own intereſt. Or, at leaſt, if they make a miſtake, it will be the miſtake of the nation, not of the miniſters; they will never ſuffer an enterpriſe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, but what is agreeable to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026617_0082_0FD0B994C640D098"/>
of the active citizens. This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will never engage in any offenſive war. Indeed, as ſoon as the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nations adopt the ſame change of government, the buſineſs of war will be forgotten; but in the interval, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this event, a real republic can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand in need of funds, as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative for war, unleſs it be invaded. It is even ſafer without funds; becauſe they might be a temptation to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of government to counteract the ſpirit of the republic. In caſe ſuch a people be really attacked by an enemy, then it is that the force of ſociety may be ſeen and calculated. But the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation does not turn on the cabinet-rules of royal arithmetic; the power of the republic for the purpoſe of defence does not depend on a national credit, in the ſenſe above-mentioned, or the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of borrowing money; the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in making up its eſtimate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, never aſks, how many ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have we in pay? And how many recruits can we enliſt or impreſs? But of how many men does the nation conſiſt? Armies ſtart into being by a ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:026617_0083_0FD0B9962BBEFD68"/>
impulſe; every citizen feels the cauſe to be his own, and preſents his perſon or his proviſions and his arms, not as an offering to a tyrannical maſter, of whoſe intentions he would be ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but as a defence of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and property. The enemy being repulſed, whatever inequalities may be found to have ariſen in this emulous contribution, are liquidated and ſettled on a general ſcale of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Even ſuppoſing the war to be of long continuance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to require ſums of money beyond the voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and beyond the power of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent taxation for the time; (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in a wealthy and well regulated republic, would be an extraordinary thing, and I believe never would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur) in ſuch a caſe, the juſtice of the cauſe, and the natural magnanimity which habitual freedom inſpires, would be a ſufficient guarantee for loans, at home or abroad. It is true in nature, and the truth muſt prove itſelf beyond contradiction to the world, as ſoon as
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:026617_0084_0FD0B997A2C8C518"/>
it ſhall have opportunity to judge, that a great people accuſtomed to exerciſe their rights, would never violate their duties.</p>
            <p>Injuſtice may be expected from gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments founded in uſurpation; it is their natural character, the tenure on which they hold their authority. They never can be juſt, unleſs they deviate from their principle. What is called their <hi>penal juſtice,</hi> as well as their <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary juſtice,</hi> is only the fruit of their fears; and ought to be regarded only as an evidence of their conſtitutional weakneſs. As every thing they do, muſt be done by the force of money, it is neceſſary that they ſhould eſtabliſh a character for mercantile punctuality, to ſerve as a ſubſtitute for the quality of juſtice, which quality the nature of their exiſtence denies them. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of this is the caſe with govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments founded in reaſon and nature, where all the people have an active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Juſtice there is the firſt article in the ſocial compact; and as neither policy nor principle can ever admit of a
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026617_0085_0FD0B99921B25F90"/>
deviation from this, the event is not to be expected.</p>
            <p>This is the kind of national credit that is proper for a free republic. It is involved in the nature of their ſyſtem, and ſpurns thoſe extraneous aids which artificial credits have required. I ſhould conſider it as a circumſtance dangerous to the progreſs of ſociety, if the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, which are to raiſe out of the ruins of theſe antiquated maſſes of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſhould retain the two great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of finance, on which much of that error has been ſupported. To raiſe the revenue by <hi>diſguiſing the taxes,</hi> and to force a public credit by <hi>dint of fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> have been equally neceſſary to the ancient ſyſtem; and it appears to me that they would be equally deſtructive to the new.</p>
            <p>How the national debts that now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in ſeveral countries, are to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, under a change of government, is indeed a queſtion of ſerious magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Probably that of France will be nearly extinguiſhed by the ſale of the national domains. That of Spain, and

thoſe of moſt other Catholic countries, may be balanced in the ſame way. In ſome Proteſtant nation, where the debts and the domains have loſt their relative proportion, the caſe will be widely <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
