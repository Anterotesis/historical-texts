      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>AND Wiſdom and Knowledge ſhall be the Stability of thy Times, and Strength of Salvation: The Fear of the Lord is his Treaſure.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN our Context we have an Account of the great Diſtreſs and Danger <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhould be brought into for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Injuſtice, <hi>Behold their valiant Ones ſhall cry without</hi>; thro' Grief and Fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their invading Enemies;—and <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Peace ſhall weep bitterly</hi>; probably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their great Degeneracy and Backſlidings from the holy Truths and Ways of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006985_0005_102AB0AA08939A38"/>The holy Prophet alſo ſpeaks of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation the Sinners of <hi>Zion</hi> ſhould be bro't into, and how the Saints and Servants of the Lord ſhould pray to God for them, in ſuch a Day of Diſtreſs, in that Language, v. 2. <hi>O Lord be gracious to us, we have waited for thee, be thou their Arm every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our Salvation alſo in the Time of Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then we have an Account of the holy Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they ſhould enjoy in the midſt of this Trouble, v. 15th and 16th. <hi>He that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, he that deſpiſeth the Gain of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that ſhaketh his Hand from holding of Bribes, that ſtoppeth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and ſhutteth his Eyes from ſeeing Evil, he ſhall dwell on high, his Place of Defence ſhall be the Munition of Rocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet further ſpeaks of the Deſtruction of their Enemies, and God's appearing on the Behalf of his People, in which he would be greatly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, v. 5th. <hi>The Lord is exalted, for he dwelleth on high; he hath filled Zion with Judgment and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>; and v. 10th. <hi>Now will I riſe, ſaith the Lord, now will I be exalted</hi>; and then ſpeaks of the happy Settlement of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State upon this. Religion ſhould revive, and their civil State flouriſh.</p>
            <p>This is evidently intimated in the Words of my Text, together with the following Context.</p>
            <p>Their pious King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his People were hereby encouraged with an Aſſurance, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God ſhould be their Saviour and Refuge, in every Day of Trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006985_0006_102AB0E3F06A4980"/>Here's</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. A gracious Promiſe of God for them to ſtay themſelves upon; <hi>Wiſdom and Knowledge ſhall be the Stability of thy Times, and Strength of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's a deſireable End propos'd, ſays an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </note> on this Place, and that is the <hi>Stability of the Times</hi>; that Things be not diſturb'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing'd at Home; and the <hi>Strength of Salvation</hi>; Deliverance and Succeſs againſt Enemies abroad.</p>
            <p>And here's the Way and Means for obtaining this End; <hi>Wiſdom and Knowledge</hi>; not only <hi>Piety,</hi> but <hi>Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this it is which by the Bleſſing of God will be the Stability of our Times, and the Strength of Salvation; that Wiſdom which is firſt pure, then peaceable, and which ſacrificeth private Intereſt to the public Good. Such Prudence as this will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Truth and Peace, and fortify the Bulwarks in Defence of them.</p>
            <p>Here's</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. A pious Maxim of State, for the King and his People to govern themſelves by, <hi>The Fear of the Lord is his Treaſure</hi>—God's Treaſure in the World, from which he receives his Tribute, or rather, it is the Prince's Treaſure. A good Prince accounts it ſo, that Wiſdom is better than Gold, and he ſhall find it ſo.</p>
            <p>And then obſerves, that true Religion is the beſt Treaſure of any Prince, or People; it denominates them rich.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:006985_0007_102AB0ADA661B2E8"/>Be ſure, thoſe Places that have wiſe and good Rulers, able and faithful Miniſters, ſerious and pious People, encreaſing among them, are really rich, and it contributes to that which makes a Nation rich in this World. It is therefore moſt certainly the Intereſt of a People to encourage and ſupport Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion among them, and to take heed of every Thing that threatens to hinder it.</p>
            <p>The Words I have read may be look'd upon as a remarkable gracious Prophecy, concerning the Peace and Proſperity of the Church and People of God, not only under the happy Reign and Government of this excellent King, but in future ſucceeding Ages, with reſpect both to their civil and religious Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: And if it might be fulfilled in the Age and Day in which we live, we ſhall certainly ſee better Times than we have done in the Times and Years wherein we have ſeen ſo much Evil, for which <hi>the Embaſſadors of Peace,</hi> and many faithful Servants of the Lord, have had cauſe to <hi>weep bitterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to theſe Words, I ſhall enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> What may be more particularly meant by the ſeveral Phraſes, or Expreſſions, in the Text?</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> Shew of what Advantage it would be to the Church and People of God, to have theſe Words fulfilled in our Times.</p>
            <p>And then make ſome <hi>Application</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006985_0008_102AB0E842EAE320"/>I am,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſhew what may be more particularly meant or imply'd in the ſeveral Phraſes or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Text.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, What by <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi>?</p>
            <p>It may mean <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and divine; and that comes from above, from the Father of Lights, the inexhauſtible Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, <hi>in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi> That <hi>Wiſdom that dwells with Prudence,</hi> and that ſhall be profitable to direct in all Matters of Importance, with reſpect to outward and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, civil or eccleſiaſtical Affairs, in which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Welfare is concern'd; and more eſpecially with reſpect to that Knowledge and Wiſdom that is divine and heavenly, which makes Men of all Orders, and in every Station, <hi>Wiſe</hi> for their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal Intereſts; ſo that they know God and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom to know is Life eternal.</p>
            <p>Án infinitely wiſe and gracious God is pleas'd to accompany with his Bleſſing the Means of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and learned Education, for the qualifying and accompliſhing Men for the Service of God, and their Generation, in various Offices and Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which they may be inſtrumental of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the publick Good, in a greater or leſſer <hi>Sphere,</hi> as God in his Providence ſhall call, incline, and diſpoſe them to it.</p>
            <p>And all theſe Talents, Advantages and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations ſhall be bro't under a ſolemn Conſecration

            </p>

            <p>More particularly;</p>
            <p>That <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> are Men knowing in the Times; Men of <hi>Political Wiſdom</hi>; Men of Knowledge and Prudence, able to diſcern Time and Judgment; <hi>wiſe Men and Underſtanding, and known among their Tribes,</hi> and Men of extenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and capable of judging what may be moſt conducive to promote the publick Weal in all Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; are Men of a <hi>Genius</hi> for Government, and able to judge what Laws may be beſt enacted for promoting the civil and religious Intereſts of their People, and for ſuppreſſing all Sin and Wickedneſs, that threatens the Ruin of a People in all their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; are Men of Wiſdom to ſearch into Matters to be conſidered by them, that they may judge on

            <p>That the <hi>common People</hi> are well inſtruted, and evidently under the good Impreſſions of a religious Education, and deſirous of living quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty; that they may obey the Laws of God, and the Laws of their Rulers, if not <hi>repugnant</hi> to the Laws of God.</p>
            <p>That they are, in a Word, a reformed, righteous and godly People, ſteadfaſtly adhereing to the holy Truths and Ways of God, and are adding to their Faith, Virtue, to Virtue, Knowledge, to Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godlineſs, Brotherly-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charity.

            <p>And having thus ſhewn what may be meant by Wiſdom and Knowledge being the Stability of the Times; I paſs to conſider the next Expreſſion, of <hi>Wiſdom and Knowledge being the Strength of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may imply in it, That this will lay a happy Foundation for obtaining from an infinitely wiſe and gracious God, all that Mercy and Salvation we may ſtand in need of as a <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Lord will ride upon the Heavens for our Help, and in his Excellency upon the Skies; That he will ſtir up his Strength and come and ſave us: that he will ſcatter all impending, dark and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006985_0014_102AB0F1CF57D758"/>
threatning Clouds, by the Light of his Countenance; that Salvation ſhall be nigh to us, and Glory yet dwell in the Land.</p>
            <p>That he will pour out his Spirit on our Rulers, Miniſters and Churches, and revive his Work in the midſt of the Years, and in Wrath remember Mercy.</p>
            <p>That our Times ſhall be Times of a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, thoro' Repentance, and Reformation of all God-provoking Evils; and God will then ſave us from our Sins, and deſolating Judgments, and yet delight to build and to plant us, and not to pluck us up, and pull us down.</p>
            <p>That though he may give us the Bread of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and the Water of Affliction, our Eyes ſhall yet ſee our Teachers, that they ſhall not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Corners, nor our Candleſticks be removed out of their Places, and we ſhall not be in vain wiſhing for the Days of the Son of Man.</p>
            <p>It may imply in it, That the Name of the Lord is our ſtrong Tower, and that we ſhall flee to it and be safe; that we may put our Truſt in God, as the Hope of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Saviour and Strength in every Day of Trouble; and that we ſhall be hid under the Shadow of his Wings until theſe Calamities ſhall be over-paſt, and ſhall finally obtain <hi>Salvation</hi> with eternal Glory in the coming World.</p>
            <p>I proceed to conſider briefly, the other and laſt Expreſſion, of <hi>the Fear of the Lord being his Treaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006985_0015_102AB0B871A3C768"/>It may, in a Word, mean the Lord's giving to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> a Heart to <hi>fear</hi> him: And their chief Treaſure and Delight, as an Expoſitor ſays on this Place, is, and ſhall be in promoting the Fear and Worſhip of God, which ſhall be a great Honour aud Safe-guard to themſelves and People.</p>
            <p>It may mean, That the Lord has wro't in their Hearts, a reverential holy Fear of Him, ſo that they ſet the Lord always before them, and ſtand in awe of him, as the ſupreme, almighty Ruler and Governor among the Nations, and as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually looking down from Heaven upon them, to ſee how they ſeek and ſerve him, and diſcharge the various Duties incumbent on them, in their ſeveral Places and Stations; and hence are ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to keep a Conſcience void of Offence towards God and Men, in all their Adminiſtrations, and to have the Teſtimony of their Conſciences for them, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity they have their Converſation in the World.</p>
            <p>And this is an inexpreſſible Support and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them, in their various Offices and Stations.</p>
            <p>No worldly Treaſure is ſo near and dear as this; they prefer their Intereſt in the Approbation and Favor of God, to all the Honors, Riches and Pleaſures of this World.</p>
            <p>They eſteem it much better to get Wiſdom than Gold, and to get Underſtanding, rather to be choſen than Silver. They love the Commandments of God above Gold; and make the Word of God the Man of their Counſel, a Light to their Feet,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006985_0016_102AB0F355B35FC8"/>
and a Lamp to their Paths. And all their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Behaviors in every Station and Condition of Life, are under the Government of this holy Principle, ruling in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>And now I proceed to the <hi>ſecond</hi> general Head of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew of what Advantage it would be to the Church and People of God, to ſee the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this Prophecy in our Times?</p>
            <p>It's certain nothing could conduce more to keep off waſting Judgments, and to promote the public Weal and Tranquility of a People, both in their civil and religious Intereſts, than to be endow'd with this Wiſdom, Knowledge, and the Fear of God. This would bring on that Stability of the Times, and Strength of Salvation, we ſo much need at this Days.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall only ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It would be a happy Means of averting threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Judgments.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of procuring all needed Mercies and Bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It would be a happy Means of averting threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the want of this Wiſdom, Knowledge, and Fear of the Lord that provokes a holy and righteous God to ſend down his Judgments on us. So it was with his profeſſing People of old, who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006985_0017_102AB0BAF7295A68"/>
were called on <note n="†" place="bottom">Hoſea, Ch. 4th.</note> to hear the Word of the Lord, who had a Controverſy with the Inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there was no Truth, nor Mercy, nor <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God; but Swearing, and Lying, and Stealing, and committing Adultery, and other ſcandalous Iniquities abounding in the midſt of them; and therefore the Prophet ſays, The Land ſhall mourn, and every One that dwelleth therein ſhall languiſh; and Deſtruction be bro't upon them for lack of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Becauſe they had rejected <hi>Knowledge,</hi> God wou'd alſo reject them. They had forgotten the Law of their God, and he wou'd alſo forget their Children: And becauſe they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him, as they were increaſed, therefore he wou'd change their Glory into Shame; puniſh them for their Ways, and reward them their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays concerning this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 59th.</note> None calleth for Juſtice, nor any pleadeth for Truth, they conceive Miſchief, and bring forth Iniquity, and there is no Judgment in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they had made them crooked Paths, and by going therein ſhould not know Peace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judgment would be far from them, neither ſhould Juſtice overtake them; they waited for Light, but behold Obſcurity, for Brightneſs, but they walked in Darkneſs: Though they looked for Judgment there was none, and for Salvation, but it was far from them.</p>
            <p>And what now was the Cauſe of all this?—Their Tranſgreſſions were multiply'd, and their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006985_0018_102AB0F64ED180B8"/>
Iniquities teſtify'd againſt them, in tranſgreſſing and lying againſt the Lord, and departing away from their God, ſpeaking Oppreſſion and Revolt, conceiving and uttering from the Heart, Words of Falſhood; and Judgment was turned away back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Juſtice ſtood afar off; Truth was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in the Street, and Equity could not enter; and the Lord ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him that there was no Judgment, and ſo the Wrath of God came down upon them. God has expreſly declar'd in his Word, that if his People will not be reformed, but walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary unto them, and puniſh them yet ſeven Times more for their Sins.</p>
            <p>But what Encouragement have we to fear the Lord, and obey his Voice; and that upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and returning to the Lord, he will have Mercy on us, and not bring threatned diſtreſſing Calamities upon us; that we ſhall be deliver'd from Earthquakes and Wars, Famine and Peſtilence, and every other deſolating Judgment, and the Lord would repent him of what further Evil he had thought to do unto us.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> It wou'd be a happy Means of procuring all needed Mercies and Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>God has in his Word abundantly encourag'd the Beſtowment of ſuch Bleſſings, if we become a righteous and godly People.</p>
            <p>We might then hope for God's gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his People; that his Eye would be on them for good continually; that he would appoint
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006985_0019_102AB0BE6C1FD660"/>
Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks, as he did about <hi>Zion</hi>; and command Deliverance and Salvation for them in Times of Fear and Danger, and blaſt the Attempts of their invading Enemies, by marvellous Interpoſitions of Providence, as in Times paſt.</p>
            <p>And when their Ways pleaſe the Lord, will cauſe their Enemies to be at Peace with them, and their Peace ſhould be as a River, and their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as the Waves of the Sea.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Throne</hi> ſhall be eſtabliſhed by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and that Righteouſneſs abound, that ſhall exalt his People; and we ſhall feel the happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of it, in all Orders and Societies of Men.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> would be then Miniſters of God for Good; Fearers of God, Men of Truth, and Haters of Covetouſneſs; zealous in diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all Immorality, Sin and Wickedneſs, and promoting Piety and Virtue, Peace and good Order.</p>
            <p>We ſhould have our Judges reſtored, as at the firſt, and our Counſellors as at the Beginning. We might then hope for a happy Union in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, for promoting the publick Tranquility; that Judgment ſhould run down our Streets as Water, and Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream, have it's free Courſe and due Exerciſe among us; that our Officers ſhould be Peace, and Exactors Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the Cry of Unrighteouſneſs, Oppreſſion and Extortion be no longer heard in the Land.</p>
            <p>And Things ſhou'd yet go well in the midſt of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006985_0020_102AB0F94521B0B0"/>And we ſhould be ſmiled on in our <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> and religious as well as civil Affairs; and the Land be always favour'd with a learned, ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, pious and faithful Miniſtry; and the Churches of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt have Grace, Mercy and Peace multiply'd to them, and be flouriſhing under the Dews of Heaven; be as well-water'd Gardens and fruitful Fields, which the Lord has bleſſed; and be increaſed with the Increaſes of God; filled with true and genuine Converts, and Converts with Righteouſneſs and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Means of Education</hi> ſhou'd be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſmiled on; <hi>Schools of Learning</hi> always duly promoted and encouraged, for the Inſtruction and Government of our Children and Youth; and the <hi>College</hi> continued a great and rich Bleſſing to the Land; a Fountain whoſe Streams ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and make glad the City and People of God; and from whence our Churches ſhall be ſupply'd with able and faithful Paſtors, to feed them with Knowledge and Underſtanding, and to break the Bread of Life unto them.</p>
            <p>In a Word, If Wiſdom and Knowledge might be the Stability of our Times, and Strength of Salvation, and the Fear of the Lord our Treaſure, we might hope that our Priviledges, religious and civil, ſhould be continued, and tranſmitted as a valuable Inheritance to the lateſt Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And God, even our own God, would maintain our Cauſe, as the Matter might require; and raiſe up Friends and Benefactors for us; and diſappoint the Devices and Deſigns of thoſe that wiſh us ill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006985_0021_102AB0C0EB21F248"/>And we ſhould yet find Favour before the King and his Miniſters, and the <hi>Agency</hi> for us be always under his gracious Conduct and Direction, and the Things which belong to our Peace not be hid from them who are intruſted with our Counſels.</p>
            <p>Such Bleſſings both of the Providence and Grace of God, have we Reaſon to hope for, if the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> in my Text ſhould be fulfill'd, and we ſhould become a wiſe, righteous and holy People. Such Righteouſneſs wou'd ſoon exalt a People, we are aſſur'd from the Word of God, while Sin will be a Reproach to us, and bring down the Judgments of Heaven on us: So that we may now apprehend ſomething of the Advantage, it would be to the Church and People of God, to ſee the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Prophecy, as it would be a happy Means of averting threatned Judgments, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing many deſirable needed Favours and Bleſſings from the Father of Mercies, and God of all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace.</p>
            <p>I now come to the APPLICATION.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may from what we have heard learn, <hi>the Reaſon why our Times have been, and are ſo melancholy at this Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is becauſe Wiſdom and Knowledge have not been the Stability of the Times; the Fear of the Lord has not been our Treaſure.</p>

            <p>How many are wiſe to do Evil, but to do Good have no Knowledge?

            <p>And while it is thus with the Generality of God's Covenant profeſſing People, we may not look for better Times; but may fear the Infliction of more diſtreſſing Judgments, if we remain an impenitent and incorrigible People, refuſing to be reformed.</p>

            <p>This has been, I truſt, and will be your Prayer to the God of all Wiſdom, from whom comes down every good and perfect Gift.</p>
            <p>You know it was the Prayer of a wiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ruler; <hi>Give me now Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; that I way go out and come in before this People: And God ſaid unto him, Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is given unto thee</hi>

            <p>You will have your Hearts and Pens employ'd in the Choice of thoſe, whom you verily believe will be able and faithful Councellors; Men of Knowledge and Diſcerning, acquainted with the State and Intereſts of their Country, and heartily well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected

Men of Integrity, of known Virtue and Piety, Courage and Reſolution, and ſteady Friends to our civil and religious Priviledges; and that will conduct in our political Affairs under the Government of a publick Spirit, and a generous diſintereſted View to the publick Good.</p>
            <p>If Wiſdom, Knowledge and the Fear of God, are ſo neceſſary to the Stability of the Times, and ſuch Qualifications ſo requiſite in civil Rulers; let the Conſideration of it have a governing Influence on your Hearts, in the publick Tranſactions of this Day, that you may herein approve your ſelves to an omniſcient GOD, who will accurately and criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally obſerve from what Principles, and with what Views you ſhall act in this important Affair.</p>
            <p>You have been, I truſt, looking out, for the moſt able, wiſe and underſtanding among our Tribes, and thoſe eſpecially who <hi>Fear the Lord</hi>: For it cannot be rationally tho't, (as an able Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Ruler once ſaid in a Sermon on the like Occaſion,) that ſuch as have not the Fear of God ruling in their own Hearts, are qualify'd as they ought to be, for the weighty Charge of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">In the 14th Vol. of the Republick of Letters, for <hi>September,</hi> 1734.</note>; and well worthy of a great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Regard, on ſuch a Day as this.</p>
            <p>The Qualifications are enumerated and deſcribed by him in the following Manner.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:006985_0030_102AB107733DD410"/>
               <p>Before the good Senator can be thoroughly accompliſhed, he muſt be well acquainted with the Cuſtoms of his own Country, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his Country-men, their Tempers, Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and general Behaviour, their Sentiments and Opinions concerning the preſent Poſture of Affairs, and all the remarkable Occurrences and Paſſages of public Life.</p>
               <p>He muſt thoro'ly underſtand the Laws of his own Country: He muſt be well acquainted with the true Nature of War and Peace; what Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Enmities his People are engaged in, and what Leagues and Treaties are ſubſiſting between them and their Neighbours; what Taxes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready impoſed on the Subject, or neceſſary to be demanded; what the Rights of the People are; and what the Proceedings of the Miniſtry; what Diſcipline is obſerved; or in what Manner the Laws are executed; what are the Diſpoſitions of the Populace, and how at preſent they ſtand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; what are their Diſcontents of Differences; and how they are to be allay'd and pacify'd; what is the preſent State of Morality; how the Youth of his Country are educated and employ'd; what Principles, Cuſtoms and Rules of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity are neceſſary to be introduc'd to moralize a People; and what is the preſent State of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the public Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt he be ignorant of the Genius, Laws, Manners, Intereſts, Rights and Demands of his Countries, Allies and Confederates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:006985_0031_102AB13C33F2C078"/>He muſt be no Stranger to the Reaſons and Ends of Government, nor to the Proceedings of all the Courts of Judicature, or public Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>He ſhould know what daily occurs in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; what are the Characters of thoſe he is principally concerned with; and what are the Deſires and Expectations of his Fellow-Subjects.</p>
               <p>Thus ought he to abound with <hi>Wiſdom, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and Experience.</p>
               <p>His Reſolution ſhould be fixed in all Things to think and act aright.</p>
               <p>He ſhould ſcorn to be implicitly and ſervilely a Follower of the Opinions or Dictates of others.</p>
               <p>He ſhould never look upon any Thing as juſt and right, worthy of Praiſe and agreable to his Character, but what is dictated to him by Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Virtue, by sound Reaſon, and the Laws of his Country.</p>
               <p>A Senator ſhould alſo know perfectly the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Limitation, and Extent of the Kingly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Kings were made, not for their own, but their People's Sake, and ſhould in all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Undertakings prefer the common to any private or ſeperate Intereſt whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The great Deſign of their Government is, that the Rights and Liberties of their People might be preſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:006985_0032_102AB108F914DAA0"/>The Senate have an Authority, and Dignity concurrent with the Regal; and to this Body they owe proper Deference and Regard, and ſhould always be in readineſs to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</p>
               <p>The ſupreme Power of Kings was intended as a Security for the good and virtuous, and as a Terror to the Wicked. It was lodg'd in their Hands, as Avengers of the Wrongs and Injuries of their Subjects, Protectors of their Liberties, and Judges to decide between the Good and the Evil.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I will add but one Paragraph more.</p>
            <q>
               <p>A good and upright Judge is the Life and Soul of the Law, and the living Oracle of a Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>It is the proper Buſineſs of ſuch a One to be the Miniſter of Juſtice, his firſt and greateſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment to know and diſcern what is true and right. The Laws of his Country are his only Guide and Direction, to which he will ſtrictly conform himſelf in all his Opinions, Proceedings and Sentences. From theſe he will never vary in the leaſt Point whatſoever; but will give Judgment always as they direct, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the well-known Principles of Juſtice and Equity. Anger and Paſſion, Hope, Love and Affection, Hatred and Malice, and every the leaſt Shadow and Suſpicion of theſe, will be baniſh'd far off, from every Tribunal and Court of Judicature where he preſides, together with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006985_0033_102AB13E9172DF88"/>
Bribery and Corruption, Fear and Terror, Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Flattery, and whatſoever may obſtruct or pervert the regular Courſe of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Moſt certain it is, That no Order of Subjects whatſoever, has contributed more to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sedition, Strife and Oppreſſion, than a Sett of Judges, who have been of a mercenary, corrupt and adulterous Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, By a due and regular Courſe of Juſtice a Nation is preſerv'd in Peace and Unity. Love &amp; Good-will are every where promoted; Complaints and Grievances, Hatred and Animoſities ceaſe; and a People is raiſed to that Pitch of Happineſs, as to fear no Evil, and to want nothing which is good for them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Such uſeful, generous Sentiments as theſe, are diffuſed thro' that excellent Work of the noble Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor he refers to; and he adds, <q>They cannot be too univerſally known, too frequently inculcated, or too deeply-radicated in the Breaſts of all thoſe, who are Lovers of the publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and heartily ſollicitous for it's Preſervation and Advancement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to addreſs my ſelf,</p>
            <p n="3">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006985_0034_102AB10CD17DFF30"/>
the Times better; and if God will bleſs our faithful Labours, Wiſdom and Knowledge ſhall be the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our Times, and Strength of Salvation, and the Fear of the Lord our Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Be we then exhorted to do our utmoſt, that this evangelical Prophecy in my Text may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd in our Day.</p>
            <p>The great End and principal Deſign of our Miniſtry, is to teach Men <hi>Wiſdom, Knowledge</hi> and <hi>the Fear of God.</hi>

            <p>And if we are deſtitute of the miniſterial Gifts and Graces of the Spirit of God, how poorly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd ſhall we be for this ſacred Office, by which we are bro't ſo near to God!</p>
            <p>Let us mourn for all the Provocations, We, or any of our Order of Men, have given to God, to deny his Bleſſing on the Miniſtry and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Rulers, or our <hi>own</hi>; and by Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the great Sacrifice of Atonement for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Forgiveneſs; and humbly beg of God to give us that divine and heavenly Wiſdom and Knowledge we ſo much need, to qualify us for the faithful Diſcharge of our Miniſtry; and that he would make us wiſe to win Souls; and that we may no longer have ſo much cauſe to weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006985_0035_102AB141F0060D58"/>
becauſe of an unſucceſsful Miniſtry; that we labour in vain, and ſpend our Strength for nought and in vain. But if we are faithful, our Judgment is with the Lord, and our Work with our God, and we ſhall be glorious in the Eyes of the Lord tho' Iſrael be not gathered, and many ſhou'd go on, to receive the Grace of God in vain, and even die without Wiſdom, and Salvation be forever far from them.</p>
            <p>But let us beg of God, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> that we may not be ſent to make any blind Eyes blinder, and hard Hearts harder, that Men ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and be healed; but that the Hand of the Lord may be with us, and a great Number believe, and turn to the Lord, and become his willing and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient People in the Day of his Power; that he would therefore give to his People every where hearing Ears and underſtanding Hearts, that they may know and increaſe in Wiſdom, Knowledge and the Fear of God; and ſo the Seals of our Miniſtry be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd, who ſhall be our Joy and Crown of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in the Day of the Lord, if we may find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Lord in that Day; and after we have preached to others, not be <hi>ourſelves Caſt-aways.</hi>

            <p>May the repeated Inſtances of the Death of our Brethren in the Miniſtry, awaken our moſt ſollicitous Endeavours to get ready for that awful Day; and the Death of that faithful Servant of the Lord, in a particular Manner, whom we lately followed to his Grave <note n="*" place="bottom">The Reverend Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

and will not forſake their evil Ways, and return to the Lord, and the crying Sins they have been ſo often warned of, and humbled for, are ſtill abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of them, this will be a ſufficient Provocation to a holy God, to withold his Bleſſing from their wiſeſt and beſt concerted Meaſures to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Proſperity and Happineſs of their People.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Whatever, ſays one, the Advantages are which Rulers have to promote the People's Good, and whatever Pains they take to improve them, yet Rulers themſelves are but ſecond Cauſes, and will fail in their Endeavours, and of their Aims, as God ſhall withold his Bleſſing; and that God oftentimes does, as a juſt Puniſhment of the People's Sins.</p>
               <p>When any Detriment befalls the State, it is common for the Miniſters of it to bear the Blame, when as they many Times leaſt deſerve it: For if there be an ungrateful, murmuring, proud Spirit, a mutinous, envious and rebellious Spirit an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious Spirit prevailing among a People, it is not all the Counſels of the wiſeſt, nor Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prudent, nor the Conduct of the moſt ſufficient Men, that can keep off Ruin from them.

               <q>There is much of the Succeſs of Government depending upon the ſuitable becoming Behaviour of the People under it.</q> If they continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and unreformed, they may look for that awful Judgment, <hi>not to have ſtrong Rods for Scepters to rule them.</hi> Their Sins deſerve it; and the Lord has threatned thus to puniſh the Iniquity of his People. <q>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had degenerated, and their Religion was become Formality, and their Devotion, Hypocriſy, the Lord faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.14. <hi>The Wiſdom of their wiſe Men ſhall periſh, and the Underſtanding of their prudent Men ſhall be hid.</hi> Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> threatens the People, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 12.25.</note>
                  <hi>But if ye ſhall ſtill do wickedly, ye ſhall be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, both ye and your King.</hi> When the Lord forſakes thoſe that have the Rule of his People, no wonder if we here cauſe to complain as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.12. <hi>They which lead thee, cauſe thee to err.</hi> But the Riſe of this Miſchief is often in the Wickedneſs of the People. So when God left <hi>David</hi> to ſin in numbering the People, it is ſaid, It was becauſe God's Anger was kindled againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               </q> And ſo will the Sins of his proſſeſing People now, enkindle his Anger againſt them, and bring yet greater Darkneſs and Diſtreſs upon them.</p>
            <p>When a People highly favour'd of God with a precious Day of Goſpel-Grace and Advantages for getting of Wiſdom, will not hear Counſel and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Inſtruction, but deſpiſe Reproof; and will not obey the Voice of their Teachers, yea, hate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and will not chooſe the Fear of the Lord; it may be look'd on as a Time of awful Deadneſs

and Degeneracy indeed. And if it be ſo with us at this Day, yet we are now to hear the Voice and Call of Chriſt the <hi>Incarnate Wiſdom of God,</hi> in ſuch pungent, affectionate Language as that <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov 8th Ch. beg.</note>; Doth not Wiſdom cry, and Underſtanding put forth her Voice; ſhe uttereth her Voice in the Streets; ſhe crieth in the chief Place of Concourſe; in the City ſhe uttereth her Words, ſaying, unto you, O Men, I call, and my Voice is to the Sons of Men; O ye ſimple underſtand Wiſdom; and ye Fools be of an underſtanding Heart. How long ye ſimple ones, will ye love Simplicity, and the Scorners delight in their Scorning, and Fools hate Knowledge? Turn you at my Reproof; behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 22.23.</note>.</p>
            <p>And what Encouragement have we to ſeek for Wiſdom, Knowledge and the Fear of God: <note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. Ch.3d.</note> My Son, if thou wilt receive my Words, and hide my Commandments with thee, ſo that thou incline thine Heart unto Wiſdom, and apply thine Heart to Underſtanding; yea, if thou wilt cry after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and lift up thy Voice for Underſtanding; if thou ſeekeſt her as Silver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid Treaſures, then ſhalt thou underſtand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God: For the Lord giveth Wiſdom; out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Underſtanding. He layeth up found Wiſdom for the Righteous; He is a Buckler to them that walk uprightly. He keepeth the Paths of Judgment, and preſerveth the Way of his Saints. Then ſhalt thou underſtand Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Judgment and Equity, yea every good
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006985_0040_102AB115E8007E68"/>
Path. When Wiſdom entereth into thine Heart, and Knowledge is pleaſant unto thy Soul, Diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, Underſtanding ſhall keep thee. And in the <hi>third</hi> Chapter, from the 13<hi>th</hi> Verſe, Happy is the Man that ſindeth Wiſdom, and the Man that getteth Underſtanding; for the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of it is better than the Merchandize of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold. She is more precious than Rubies, and all the Things thou can't deſire are not be compared to her. Length of Days is in her right Hand, and in her left Riches and Honour. Her Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths are Peace. She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her. Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee: She ſhall bring thee to Honour when thou doſt embrace her. She ſhall give to thine Head an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee.</p>
            <p>What greater Encouragement can we deſire, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> to ſeek and plead for divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom and the Fear of God? But yet how many, tho' they have now a Price in their Hands for getting this Wiſdom, have no Heart to it? And are practically ſaying to almighty God, depart from us, for we deſire not the Knowledge of thy Ways.</p>
            <p>And the Fear of the Lord, is ſo far from being their Treaſure, that this World with it's Honours, Riches and Pleaſures, is dearer to them, and more eſteem'd and valued, than the Favour of God, or the Riches of an heavenly Inheritance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:006985_0041_102AB14B65914F40"/>Their Time and Tho'ts are ſwallow'd up in worldly Purſuit; in adding to their worldly Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and Treaſures; and they ſpend their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which is not Bread, and their Labour for that which ſatisfys not. The Cares of the World and Deceitfulneſs of Riches choke the Seed ſown in their Hearts, and ſo it becomes unfruitful: The Spirit of this World eats out the Vitals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And tho' they may keep up a Form of Godlineſs, they are utter Strangers to the Power of it, governing their Hearts and Lives.</p>
            <p>Have we not Reaſon to fear, that the Number of ſuch has been awfully increaſed, and great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation thereby given to God, to ſcatter Darkneſs in the Paths of our Rulers, and to bring us into perplexing Straits and Difficulties on many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, out of which we are not extricated to this Day?</p>
            <p>The lamentable Degeneracies and Backſlidings of this People, have been the procuring Cauſe of all the Tokens of the divine Anger.</p>
            <p>And if they ſhall perſiſt in them, it will look awfully with reſpect to the Infliction, not only of more temporal Judgments, but of ſpiritual Plagues and Judgments too, which are more to be depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than any other; and we ſhall have reaſon to fear that the Lord has caſt many away from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and taken his holy Spirit from them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</p>
            <p>But may God of his infinite Mercy be better to us than our Fears; and by gracious Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Spirit, revive his Work in the midſt of the Years, and in Wrath remember Mercy for the whole Body of this People, in giving Wiſdom, Knowledge and the Fear of God to them; that our Fleſh may no longer tremble for fear of God, and have ſo much reaſon to be afraid of theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being inflicted on us.</p>
            <p>And we ſhall have reaſon to hope they are not as yet; if this People ſhall be generally ſtirring up themſelves to engage in the Fear and Service of God, to get Wiſdom, and with all their gettings to get Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And O that all the People of the Land were wiſe and underſtood this, and would conſider their latter End! This is the affectionate Wiſh of the great God concerning this People; and ſo is that, O that there were ſuch an Heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and their Children forever!</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:006985_0043_102AB14CEAB4D0C8"/>That our rightful and lawful Sovereigh, <hi>King</hi> GEORGE <hi>the Second,</hi> may be <hi>wiſe</hi> as an Angel of God; that he may be long continued a nurſing Father to his Church and People; both at home and abroad; and that the PROTESTANT SUCCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION <hi>in his illuſtrious Houſe</hi> may abide before the Lord, and no Weapon formed againſt it ever proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

            <p>That our PRIVILEDGES, <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>ſacred,</hi> may be continued; that we may never come to know the Worth of them by the Want of them.</p>
            <p>That Wiſdom and Knowledge may be the Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>our</hi> Times; that GOD would therefore vouchſafe his gracious Preſence with our <hi>General Aſſembly this Day,</hi> in the important Affair before them, and in all the public Affairs relating to the Peace and Proſperity of the <hi>Province</hi> thro' the Year; that all may be over-rul'd to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Glory of God, And the beſt Good of this People; and that the providential Preſence of God may ſtill be as a Wall of Fire round about us, and that his ſpiritual Preſence may be the Gory in
