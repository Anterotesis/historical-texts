            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>REVEREND SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I heard you was writing in anſwer to me, in the heat of your ſpirit, and that your papers had paſſed thro' Mr. Hopkins's hands, I did not expect a calm, fair, equitable examination of things, and I do not find it. 'Tis moſt evident that you did not write under the influence of that wiſdom which is <hi>without partiality,</hi> but hearkened, a great deal too much, to the counſels of the wiſdom which is of men; which has cauſed you to wander far out of the way of truth, equity and honor, to my injury and your own hurt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not point out and reprove all your faults in what you have written againſt me: that would ſwell this letter into a large volume: but ſome things I muſt tell you. <hi>If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, tell him his fault.</hi>—A few things only, I briefly mention in the firſt part, and haſten to your appendix.</p>
            <p>You ſay (p. 19)
<q>Does it not deſerve a ſmile to ſee Mr. H. quoting Preſident Edwards's anſwer to Taylor, in confutation of my opinion?—He is ſo fully of my ſentiments on this head, that I am <hi>bold</hi> to ſay, Mr. H. never read him, or does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, or elſe <hi>injured his conſcience in quoting him.</hi>
               </q>
Neither of theſe is true, Doctor. I read that book many years ſince, and have now in my poſſeſſion a manuſcript, wrote A.D. 1762, in which I obſerve ſome of that great man's doctrinal inconſiſtencies, and ſhew the falſhood and abſurdity of his notion of perſonal identity, and of Adam and all his children being one <hi>complex moral perſon</hi> or <hi>moral whole.</hi> If you are diſpoſed to publiſh it, it is at your ſervice. It will enable you to judge whether I underſtand the book; and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012066_0003_0F899389334215E8"/>
perhaps may give you a clearer underſtanding of it—As to inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my conſcience in quoting him, this is a wonderful thought, Doctor I quoted theſe words from you,
<q>This contrariety to God is <hi>innate</hi> and <hi>interwoven</hi> with the very frame of our hearts.</q>
and then added, 'Is this conſiſtent with Mr. Edwards's doctrine? He ſays,
<q>There is not the leaſt need of ſuppoſing any evil quality <hi>infuſed, implanted</hi> or <hi>wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t into the nature</hi> of man, by any poſitive cauſe or influence whatever; or of ſuppoſing that man is conceived and born with a <hi>fountain of evil in his heart,</hi> ſuch as is any thing properly <hi>poſitive,</hi> in order to account for a ſinful corruption of nature.</q>
See the Dialogue, p 15. I did not add one word more. In what was my conſcience injured in this? Was it in aſking that wicked queſtion? or in quoting the words? Are the words, or the doctrine they contain, wicked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be tranſcribed? I believe, Doctor, all the fault lies in the direct oppoſition of Mr. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s doctrine, contained in theſe words, to yours, and this, you know, is not my fault, but yours, or his.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the perverſe Jews, you ſay,
<q>It was as difficult to perſuade them that they hated God, and were the children of Satan, as it is to perſuade Mr. H that carnal men naturally hate moral good, and <hi>perhaps for the ſame reaſon.</hi> When Chriſt told them they were the children of the devil, they in return, told him he had a devil; pretty much as Mr. H. has ſerved me for ſaying, <hi>man is turned devil.</hi>
               </q>
(p 25). 'Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you, Sir, that intimate concerning me, that I have a devil; I bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t no ſuch 'railing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation' againſt you. I mention this as one of the things by which you diſhonor yourſelf, both as a gentleman and a chriſtian, and of which you ought ſeriouſly to repent.</p>
            <p>You ſay, in your ſermon (p 40.41, 2d edit.)
<q>Sinners laugh at his (God's) counſels and deſpiſe all his reproof; and <hi>ſo they will do</hi> till the arm of God's power is revealed to make them willing [by creating them anew in Chriſt Jeſus]</q>
I compared this with another paſſage in your ſermon, viz
<q>No moral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>except</hi> the terrors of the Lord, are adapted to influence carnal ſinners to attend to their ſalvation,</q>
and obſerved the inconſiſtence. You now endeavor to reconcile yourſelf with yourſelf thus,
<q>Where is the inconſiſtency? In both I ſhew that no arguments of <hi>any hind</hi> are ſufficient to renew and reconcile carnal ſinners to God. Yet I ſay, the terrors of the Lord are adapted to influence them to ſeek deliverance from hell by working on their principle of ſelf love—Is this hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood?</q>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:012066_0003_0F899389334215E8"/>
No, Doctor, it is not. But it is hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how theſe terrors ſhould thus work on this principle, ſo long as the ſinner laughs at and deſpiſes them. You had better have ſaid nothing. You muſt give up one of the propoſitions: they will always quarrel.</p>
            <p>You ſay (p. 46 of your ſerm.)
<q>A realizing view and percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>moral</hi> beauty and glory of God is that which is the motive that firſt prevails with the [<hi>renewed</hi>] ſinner to <hi>return</hi> and be <hi>reconciled</hi> to him.</q>
In the note you ſay,
<q>I aſk Mr. H's pardon for leaving out the word [<hi>renewed</hi>] which I have now inſerted.</q>
You, Sir, had more need to aſk pardon for inſerting it now; which, had you done ſo, I could not have granted, but upon the condition of your throwing it out again. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as it ſtood before was true, and as ſuch I quoted it to your honor; but as it now ſtands, it is fooliſh and abſurd, and a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter which devours itſelf. The <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſcriptural</hi> idea of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>renewed,</hi> is one morally changed, and conformed to God in the holineſs of his heart or prevailing temper. And thus you ſometimes deſcribe this renewal; I don't mean exactly in theſe words, but to the ſame ſenſe. And yet you here repreſent this renewal as affecting <hi>no ſuch change.</hi> The renewed ſinner, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>ſimply as renewed,</hi> is not yet perſuaded
<q>to return and be reconciled to God.</q>
This is effected by a different, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the Spirit of God, giving the renewed ſinner 'a realizing view,' and ſo the ſinner is renewed, and not renewed at the ſame time: for ſuch a renewal of the ſpirit of the mind as does not reconcile the man to God is <hi>nothing.</hi> Why, Doctor, do you ſo trifle with, and abuſe ſcriptural terms &amp; phraſes? I don't mention this abſurdity as peculiar to you, it is common to all who teach a phyſical regeneration, without any influence from light and truth. But will numbers keep ſuch abſurdities in countenance?—Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, your ſermons need a third edition, with numerous additional corrections.</p>
            <p>Now, Doctor, let us a little examine your Appendix. In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we ſhall both have need of patience; I in ſuffering your unjuſt cenſures, you in ſuffering my juſt vindication and apology.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt thing I notice is your <hi>perverſe</hi> miſrepreſentation of my doctrine relating to the <hi>moral ſenſe</hi> or <hi>taſte</hi> natural and eſſential to man as a moral agent, and to <hi>all</hi> moral agents, <hi>as ſuch.</hi> You ſay 'Mr. Hart's—<hi>fundamental</hi> error, I take to be this,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012066_0004_0F89938ACF633580"/>
'viz. that all beings endowed with natural conſcience have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily a taſte for moral excellency, i. e. approve and LOVE <hi>that which appears to the underſtanding or conſcience to be morally good, and</hi> HATE <hi>what appears morally evil.</hi>' (p. 63, 64.) Here, Doctor, you repreſent that approbation which <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> or the <hi>moral ſenſe</hi> gives to actions and characters morally good, when preſented to the mind in a <hi>true</hi> light (which I ſpake of as <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> to moral agents, <hi>as ſuch</hi>) as the <hi>ſame</hi> with the <hi>love of the heart,</hi> or their being <hi>choſen</hi> and <hi>embraced by the will</hi> in <hi>prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to all that ſtands in competition with them.—I did not do ſo, but kept theſe clearly diſtinguiſhed. You might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it if your mind had not been <hi>biaſed</hi> by evil paſſions, unleſs your underſtanding is more defective than I have thought it.— This, Sir, is <hi>your fundamental error,</hi> or miſtake and blunder, and runs thro' all you have ſaid upon this ſubject, to my injury, and to your own diſhonor.</p>
            <p>Quoting a paſſage from my dialogue (p. 52) which concludes thus, 'On this,' i. e. on the moral faculty of diſcerning between moral good and evil, &amp;c.
<q>is founded the principle and power of natural conſcience,</q>
you paraphraſe or expound the words thus,
<q>On this ready perception of the <hi>beauty</hi> of morally good, and <hi>hatefulneſs</hi> of morally evil objects, <hi>i. e.</hi> on a LOVE <hi>for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and HATRED <hi>of ſin, is founded</hi> the principle and power of natural conſcience;</q>
by which you certainly mean a <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>holy love</hi> to ſpiritual things, and <hi>holy hatred</hi> of their contraries. (p. 65.) Doctor, if you thus eſſentially miſrepreſented the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſenſe of my words, thro' weakneſs, I pity you; if you did it wilfully, which you have given great reaſon to ſuſpect, the heavens frown upon you.</p>
            <p>You go on in your way, and draw many dreadful conſequences from your fundamental blunder, which you charge upon me, and injuriouſly lay them at my door; and by partial quotations, and perverſe conſtructions endeavor to faſten them on me: ſee your two firſt ſections.—You ſay in particular,
<q>Mr. H. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that unrenewed men <hi>ſee</hi> and LOVE virtue <hi>in its own light,</hi>
               </q>
(p. 70.)
<q>He largely <hi>inſiſts</hi> that moral beings <hi>neceſſarily</hi> LOVE God and objects morally good or holy <hi>as ſoon as they ſee them,</hi> and takes it for granted, again and again, that they can ſee them in a true light, as amiable and excellent, worthy of eſteem and honor, and are <hi>affected accordingly</hi>; that they <hi>cannot hate</hi> God, but when they view him as a <hi>morally evil</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> being.</q>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012066_0004_0F89938ACF633580"/>
(p. 163.) This, Doctor, is your ſhort ſummary of what you have been laboring to perſuade your readers I believe and teach, at the expence of almoſt an hundred pages, by a variety of partial quotations, arbitrary and artful miſrepreſentations, and fooliſh and perverſe reaſonings. But after all, you are only <hi>beering falſe witneſs againſt your neighbour,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew you preſently. But firſt, let us ſee what you tell your readers I believe, relating to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>enmity</hi> of vicious beings to God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I will repreſent the matter in your own words. You ſay,
<q>He (Mr. H.) ſhews his opinion to be this, that all men really <hi>love</hi> God's true character, and never <hi>hate</hi> him but when he is viewed by them in falſe and odious colours;—and therefore that their <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>right, holy</hi> and <hi>good,</hi>
               </q>
(p. 74.)
<q>Are there not many</q>
(beings)
<q>who are allowed by all, except Mr. H. to be totally deſtitute of true virtue or love to God, even all the devils? Mr. H. indeed ſuppoſes that they do not, cannot hate God, conſidered in himſelf, but <hi>only</hi> a <hi>falſe</hi> character of him, which is not God.—But whatever high opinion Mr. H. may have of the piety of devils,—I ſhall take it for granted that devils are very wicked beings,</q>
(p. 77.) They are indeed ſo, Doctor; they abode not in the truth, and they falſely accuſe thoſe that do. God forbid that we ſhould be like them.—You ſay you 'could fill whole pages to ſhew that Mr. Hart conſiders this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity 'to God as a <hi>very trifling</hi> evil, (93) No, Doctor, you can't produce one paſſage that intimates any ſuch thing; but might have quoted many which ſhew the contrary.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe to turn your eye on your 90, 91, 92 and 93 pag.— You will there ſee ſuch an inſtance of unjuſt and infamous miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and ill bred perverſeneſs as is ſcarcely to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the whole ſociety of Jeſuits. Doctor, is not this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph like the young prophet's ax? I have good reaſon to think it is, and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>Doctor, you repreſent this as my doctrine,
<q>It is not the <hi>true,</hi> but a <hi>falſe</hi> God, a <hi>morally evil</hi> or <hi>ſinful</hi> being, that they</q>
(wicked men)
<q>always, <hi>univerſally hate,</hi> and that <hi>becauſe</hi> he appears to them <hi>wicked,</hi> and as acting contrary to the moral law, which they naturally approve. And therefore it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for them to <hi>hate</hi> the <hi>true</hi> God.—By Mr. H's own account, there is no need that the ſpirit of enmity ſhould be mortified, and a better and holy temper introduced into the heart</q>
(of the carnal men)
<q>becauſe the temper is <hi>already holy,</hi> and needs nothing to remove
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012066_0005_0F89938B72E4ABD8"/>
its enmity to God, but juſt <hi>ſpeculative</hi> notions of his character. This is Mr. H's notion of enmity to God, in a ſhort view.</q>
(p. 97.98) I could quote much more to this purpoſe, but theſe are ſufficient to give the reader an idea of the doctrine you charge, and endeavor to faſten upon me.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Let us now ſearch the Dialogue that we may ſee whether theſe things are ſo, or are only <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>railing accuſations</hi> which you have bro't againſt your brother.—Doctor, I deſire you will attend with a good and honeſt heart, willing to ſee things as they really are.—I ſaid,
<q>There is in man a natural faculty whereby he is rendered capable of diſcerning and diſtinguiſhing between moral good and evil—and readily perceives the one to be <hi>right, amiable,</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> of <hi>eſteem</hi> and <hi>honor</hi>; the other <hi>wrong, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and <hi>blame-worthy</hi>—as ſoon as theſe objects are ſeen by the mind in their <hi>true</hi> light, or as being what they really are, without any further reaſoning about them,</q>
(D p 52)— This, Doctor, you have repreſented as implying a <hi>holy love</hi> to the one, and hatred to the other: but ſuffer me to aſk you a few queſtions. What are characters and actions morally good <hi>in themſelves?</hi> Are they not <hi>really</hi> right, amiable, worthy of eſteem and honor? Are not their contraries really wrong, hateful, blame-worthy? If the mind ſees theſe objects as 'being what they are,' does ſhe not perceive them to be ſo, i. e. to be what ſhe ſees them to be? And if the mind perceives the morally good to be right, &amp;c. and the morally evil to be wrong, &amp;c. does ſhe not, in this view of them, in her judgment and conſcience, approve the one as right, &amp;c. and becauſe it is ſo, and diſapprove the other as wrong, &amp;c. and becauſe it is ſo? Does not the natural ſenſe pronounce this right judgment concerning them? Can the mind, at the ſame time, approve a morally good action or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as being right and becauſe it is right, and diſapprove it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is right, or as being wrong? Or can ſhe approve that as right, which at the ſame time ſhe diſapproves as wrong? Or can ſhe both approve and diſapprove it becauſe ſhe ſees it to be wrong and blame-worthy?—If the heart hates and rejects that which the underſtanding and conſcience ſee and approve as right and worthy of eſteem, and loves and chuſes that which theſe ſee to be wrong, blame-worthy, and proper objects of moral ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and diſapprove as ſuch; (which is often the caſe) does the heart thus counteract the conſcience and moral ſenſe, from the <hi>ſame views</hi> of the objects, which determine the judgment of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012066_0005_0F89938B72E4ABD8"/>
the conſcience? Is it not becauſe the heart is <hi>intereſted</hi> and rendered partial and perverſe by her attachment to particular luſts, the indulgence whereof is inconſiſtent with moral truth and right, and for the ſake of which, as beſt beloved, ſhe hates and rejects the truth and right, embraces the evil and wrong? The mind approves the moral truth, viewing it as it is in itſelf, the heart rejects and hates it, <hi>relatively</hi> conſidered, or as oppoſing her luſts, from intereſted views. When this is the caſe, is not the man condemned of himſelf, in that which he allows in heart and practice? Does he not act inconſiſtently with himſelf, as well as with the rule of right, and do violence to the moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his nature? When Judas betrayed his Maſter, did he not act from the heart, under the influence of covetouſneſs and fooliſh reſentment, in oppoſition to his judgment or conſcience? And when he afterwards ſaid,
<q>I have ſinned in that I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed innocent blood,</q>
did he not ſpeak the language of the moral ſenſe? Do you think, Doctor, that he now diſcovered any thing of a ſpiritual taſte or holy temper of heart? Peter was an accurate divine. He ſays,
<q>Balaam loved the <hi>wages</hi> of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2.15.</note>
For the ſake of theſe he forſook the right way, knowing of it ſuch, and went aſtray in the ways of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And the apoſtle Jude ſpeaking of ſome chriſtian apoſtates, ſays,
<q>They have ran greedily after the error of Balaam <hi>for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jude 11.</note> This Balaam forſook the right way, and went aſtray in the way of error and unrighteouſneſs, with his eyes open. Was it becauſe the way of error and unrighteouſneſs appeared to him a more excellent, or amiable and pleaſant way, <hi>in itſelf, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſuch,</hi> than the contrary way? Was it becauſe he hated right and loved wrong for its own ſake? Your doctrine ſays it was: but you ſee Peter and Jude have decided the caſe againſt you. This wicked man <hi>loved</hi> the <hi>wages</hi> of unrighteouſneſs, and ran in that way as <hi>greedy</hi> of the <hi>reward</hi> of iniquity. Was not his hatred of the right way and love of the wrong, an <hi>intereſted</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, a <hi>ſecondary</hi> paſſion, a <hi>conſequence</hi> and <hi>reſult</hi> of his love and greedy deſire of the reward?</p>
            <p>Doctor, think enough to anſwer all theſe queſtions right; and then read over the ſecond part of my dialogue again, with perfect calmneſs, not in the ſpirit of a perverſe diſputer of this world, intereſted in miſrepreſenting its ſenſe, but as an impartial, upright judge, as under his eye who ſees all the artful windings of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012066_0006_0F89938C35CDAA98"/>
crooked ſerpent, and approves the way of the upright; and I truſt the miſt will vaniſh from before your eyes, and that you will ſee clearly that you have eſſentially miſrepreſented my doctrine, and greatly wronged your brother, and, as you ſay,
<q>havi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but only a doctrine I have palmed on him, and which he has not taught.</q>
(p. 157) This, Sir, is the very truth. I muſt help you a little more, that you may ſee it clearly.</p>
            <p>In my account of the moral ſenſe natural and eſſential to man as a moral agent, you think you find
<q>a good definition of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual taſte,</q>
or holy love to ſpiritual good: But in this you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. That approbation which reaſon and the moral ſenſe give to things morally good, which I ſpake of, as quoted above, is not the ſame thing with a ſupreme love and preferring choice of them by the heart; which is eſſential to true virtue. The firſt may exiſt while the other does not; which is often the caſe with men. You ſay to this purpoſe, that this approving perception of the mind implies true love of the heart, or at leaſt neceſſarily draws it. But you are miſtaken in this. The approbation of conſcience or of the moral ſenſe, and the ruling affection and choice of the heart, are frequently as far aſunder, in ſinful beings, as the city of God and the kingdom of Satan.— You alſo ſay to this purpoſe, that no natural man can ſee things morally good in a <hi>true</hi> light, or perceive their moral amlableneſs and excellence; and ſo ſays the writer of the notes in your appendix. I will allow you two things, Doctor; firſt, that men muſt have theſe things preſented to their view by God's teaching, before they can perceive their moral excellence. Secondly, that natural men can't ſee them in ſo clear and <hi>realizing</hi> a light as holy men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtent with theſe. This is enough to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify all I have ſaid upon this ſubject in the dialogue.</p>
            <p>Mr Edwards admits the diſtinction between the taſte and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of moral good or true virtue, by the conſcience or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, and that by a ſpiritual ſenſe. He freely owne that the mind of the unrenewed man, if duly inlightened, may ſee, and by the moral ſenſe approve a real beauty, excellence and amiableneſs in true virtue. This indeed he calls a <hi>ſecondary</hi> beauty, but ſays
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012066_0006_0F89938C35CDAA98"/>
it belongs to moral things. This is not the leſs a real and true moral beauty becauſe he calls it a ſecondary beauty. He was a great man, but not ſo great as to alter the nature of things by a daſh of his pen; nor ſo great as to be exempted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal infirmity. He could err as well as you and I. If you ſhould ever ſee my remarks on his piece upon true virtue, you will meet with ſome thoughts, which, perhaps, may do you no hurt.</p>
            <p>But I here preſent you with a ſhort paſſage or two from that piece. Mr. Edwards ſays,
<q>Natural conſcience, if well informed will approve of true virtue, and diſapprove the want of it and oppoſition to it — Yea if mens conſciences were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en—they would approve nothing but true virtue,<note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards on Virtue, p. 164, 165.</note> There is a <hi>moral taſte,</hi> or ſenſe of moral good and evil, <hi>natural to all</hi> which does not properly ariſe out of ſelf-love.<note n="†" place="bottom">ib. p. 166.</note> This moral ſenſe, If the underſtanding be well informed—approves the <hi>very ſame things,</hi> which a ſpiritual and divine ſenſe approves, and thoſe things only; tho' not on the ſame grounds, nor with the ſame kind of approbation.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">ib. 188.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the dialogue, p. 61, 62, you may find theſe words, viz.
<q>I obſerved above, that the enmity of ſinful ſouls againſt God's true character is directed againſt it, only <hi>relatively</hi> conſidered, and is a <hi>ſecondary</hi> paſſion, which ariſes in the heart in conſequence of men's indulgence of particular luſts, which firſt lead them into a practical oppoſition to the law and righteous will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the light of truth manifeſts their deeds to be evil and reproves them, and kindly calls them back into the right way, if they ſubmit to the reproof, and obey the merciful call, their oppoſition to God ceaſes, no <hi>higher</hi> enmity can riſe in their hearts; their enmity is turned againſt their own luſts: but if they refuſe to receive reproof, and perſiſt in their ſins againſt light, the light becomes offenſive, and they hate it as reproving them. <hi>The ſcorner hateth him that reproveth him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After having offered ſome things in confirmation of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>ſpring</hi> of this wicked enmity. I ſay (p. 64)
<q>
                  <hi>This</hi> doctrine concerning the enmity of carnal men againſt God, is further confirm'd by this obſervation, which holds univerſally true in fact, viz. That men who hate God, his ways, and righteous ſervants, always miſrepreſent their characters <hi>to themſelves,</hi> paint them in falſe and odious colours, and place them in ſuch a wrong view as to make them appear either contemptible or morally evil: <hi>This is the method they always take to juſtify to</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012066_0007_0F89938CF2D79448"/>
THEMSELVES, <hi>as well as to others their enmity to them: which they would not do if moral rectitude wiſdom, righteouſneſs and goodneſs, were, in themſelves objects of their natural hatred; but their hatred would point itſelf directly againſt them, as being what they really are; as in the caſe of natural averſions to ſome particular kinds of food.</hi> This hatred of wicked men againſt God is then an <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> affection, taken up in aid and ſupport of ſome carnal luſts and intereſts is they are devoted to.</q>
— Doctor, the ſenſe of this paragraph is <hi>fixed</hi> and very obvious. 'Tis manifeſt as the light, that I ſpeak of wicked men's miſrepreſenting God's character, &amp;c. to <hi>themſelves</hi> as the method they take to <hi>juſtify to themſelves</hi> their partial, unjuſt enmity to them.

—Poor creatures, they can enjoy no ſelf approbation and quiet but under the gloomy ſhade of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe miſrepreſentation.

            <p>Let us next obſerve, Doctor, how you have <hi>forced</hi> theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into your ſervice; for indeed you have conſtrained them to ſerve in a ſtate of cruel bondage, contrary to their nature, and wholly againſt their will. You often quote part of both of them, as in the pages referred to in the margin, <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 71, 72, 74, 90, 132.</note> but have never once, as I have obſerved, quoted any part of what I have now put in <hi>Italics,</hi> nor given your readers the leaſt hint of any ſuch clauſes, which fix the ſenſe of the whole, (tho' you muſt have obſerved them yourſelf) but keep them out of ſight: you could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them. I deſire you, and all who read this, will turn your eyes back on theſe extracts, and obſerve the parts printed in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, and then compare them with your quotations refer'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012066_0007_0F89938CF2D79448"/>
and obſerve the uſe you make of what you venture to ſhow your readers—it may give an edifying bluſh — The things you have quoted, you ſo artfully weave in with your own miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations as to make them look a little favorable to them, to a careleſs reader. But whoever will give himſelf the trouble to compare as I have requeſted, will very eaſily diſcover the impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is practiſed upon him. The ſenſe you conſtantly put upon theſe paſſages is this. That men and all moral beings, have naturally a holy love to Gods true character, and never do or can hate him, but as he is viewed by the mind in a falſe and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous character, either as a morally evil or contemptible being. It would be an affront to the reader's underſtanding to ſay any thing more to convince him that the paſſages given above fully condemn you; they ſpeak for themſelves. Doctor, in this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſrepreſentation of my doctrine, you have greatly injured me, abuſed and miſled your readers, and diſhonored yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Let us examine another paſſage which you have made great uſe of, and obſerve how you have perverted and abuſed it. After I had finiſhed what I deſigned upon the doctrine of the enmity of wicked men againſt God, in oppoſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you wrong notions of it, I juſt mentioned <hi>another kind</hi> of enmity, in properly called en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God's character or real works, which is ſometimes found in good men, who by the grace of God, are cured of that kind of enmity which riſes out of the perverſeneſs of a wicked heart, Theſe were my words.
<q>Since we are upon the melancholy ſubject of the enmity of poor ſinners againſt God, I will juſt mention one thing more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Many very honeſt and good people have often complained of the workings of a ſecret enmity and hard thoughts of God, and quarrellings againſt him; <hi>which does n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> like that we have been diſcourſing upon, ariſe out of the</hi> WICKEDNESS <hi>of the heart,</hi> but is wholly occaſioned by miſrepreſentations of the character and ways of God to the mind, and falſe and wrong views of him, which have unhappily gotten poſſeſſion of the mind, and are ſuppoſed thro' ignorance and wrong inſtruction, to be the true and genuine views of his character and works. In the light wherein they view them they appear morally evil, wrong, and objects of juſt hatred. The enmity which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind conceives againſt them, viewed in this wrong light, is, in a proper ſenſe, a natural enmity, i e it ariſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> he moral frame of the mind, and the innate ſenſe of the hatefulneſs of actions and characters morally evil and wrong: and if the heart is gracious this ſenſe is greatly heightened. This kind of enmity is, in no true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012066_0008_0F89938DB417D890"/>
a hatred of God's true character, which may he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily approv'd and lov'd at the ſame time; but only of a really bad character, falſely aſcribed to him, merely thro' ignorance, miſtake and miſinformation. This may be illuſtrated by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012066_0008_0F89938DB417D890"/>In general, Doctor, you have improved the quotations you make from the paragraph given above, to perſuade your readers that I admit no other kind or worſe ſort of enmity againſt God, in the wickedeſt men and even in devils themſelves, than that improper enmity there deſcribed; and that I hold that wicked men and devils have at bottom, a <hi>temper of heart diſpoſed to love God,</hi> and only want to have their ignorance removed, and their wrong ſpeculative notions concerning him rectified, in order to their love ſhewing itſelf in actual exerciſe.—You ſay in particular.
<q>It appears, according to Mr. H. that the <hi>only difference</hi> between the hatred of God which is in the righteous and wicked, lies in this, viz. the wicked miſrepreſent God's character to themſelves, and ſo are the cauſe of the miſrepreſentation (tho' on his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they do it without any hatred of God) while the righteous, or very good [<hi>ſort of</hi>] people</q>
(quoted again as my words, with a contemptuous ſneer—the contempt be to whom it belongs)
<q>have him miſrepreſented to them, by wrong inſtructions, and ſo are not the active cauſe of affixing this falſe character to God; but yet after the falſe repreſentation is made, <hi>they both</hi> have the <hi>ſame</hi> enmity to it, only the gracious heart will hate it in a higher degree And you ſay, 'this (kind of enmity) 'is ALL and the WORST that can be found in any man,</q>

<q>Mr. H. thinks he has fully proved that the worſt of men <hi>love</hi> the truth <hi>conſidered in itſelf,</hi> becauſe the phariſees condemned the conduct of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen who ſlew their lord's ſervants and ſon, till they ſaw their own face in the glaſs.</q>
No, Doctor, I did not ſay, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove, that they <hi>love</hi> truth or righteouſneſs, as you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand love to imply <hi>virtuous love.</hi> I ſaid, and bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And you, in attempting to invalidate this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, confirm it, and even make it prove more than I deſire it ſhould. Your words are theſe,
<q>Let us ſee what his witneſs proves. Why, it <hi>very plainly</hi> proves, (1) That the worſt of men have a conſcience capable of perceiving the truth. (2) That when they <hi>ſee themſelves concerned in it,</hi> they <hi>love</hi> or HATE it, <hi>according as it agrees</hi> or <hi>diſagrees</hi> with what is, in their view, <hi>their own intereſt</hi> and will treat it accordingly. (3) Therefore that <hi>mere ſelfiſhneſs</hi> will lead the worſt of men to love or <hi>hate</hi> the ſame truth, as it appears to favor or oppoſe them.</q>
—Don't you ſee, Doctor, that you have here conceded all that I brought this example to prove; that the <hi>hatred</hi> of vicious beings againſt moral truth is an <hi>intereſted partial</hi> thing, oppoſed to their moral ſenſe of what this truth deſerves? How glorious is your oppoſition to me, for ſaying the ſame thing that you do! But, Doctor, you err a little, even here.

Beſides, you had no warrant from this example of the malicious phariſees, to ſay any thing about this falſe love to moral truth. For the <hi>righteous</hi> judgment, upon the parabolical ſtory, which the Lord drew them in to give, did not ſpring from, was not dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by <hi>ſelf love,</hi> or any regard to private intereſt: their haſty reverſal of this judgment <hi>only,</hi> proceeded from thence. They did not apprehend themſelves at all intereſted or concern'd in the caſe till the Lord applied their judgment. This judgment was dictated by that moral diſcernment and moral ſenſe which is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to all moral beings and which no degree of wickedneſs can deſtroy. The judgment of this ſenſe is <hi>impartial</hi> and <hi>diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted.</hi> When the light flows in upon it, and it is allowed to ſpeak its own ſenſe freely, it judges impartially, in every ſoul, of his <hi>own</hi> actions, as of other men's, without fear or favor: it only regards the right of the caſe. Hence the endeavors of wicked minds to blind and deceive themſelves: hence their hatred and <hi>dread</hi> of the light.—I ſaid,

                  <p>Doctor, you ſay, p. 103. note,
<q>Thoſe who have never been convinced that, not only actual ſins, but even their <hi>very beſt tempers, in their beſt frames,</hi> while unregenerate, are <hi>nothing but oppoſition and enmity to God's true character</hi> have never had a juſt and ſcriptural view of God's character, but are ſtill ignorant of the true God and of themſelves —This is Mr. Hopkins's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, the height and perfection of it: by a lopting this doctrine, you are become anſwerable for it: let us examine it a little — Unregenerate men, in their beſt frames, under the influence of common grace, are ſometimes in ſuch tempers or diſpoſitions, or have ſuch motions and actings of ſoul as theſe, viz. They are greatly afraid of God's wrath; they with for his mercy to ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I don't ſuppoſe theſe are holly exerciſes— But how will you prove that there is <hi>nothing</hi> in theſe inward motions and frames of their hearts but oppoſition and enmity to God's true character?</q>
What is there in this character, which theſe are in oppoſition and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to? Do they oppoſe his truth, or juſtice, or goodneſs, or mercy? Does not the truth of their caſe juſtify their fear and ſhame? Is this truth oppoſite to the truth of God? Do they not <hi>juſtly</hi> blame themſelves? Is this <hi>enmity</hi> againſt God's juſtice or goodneſs? Is their deſire that God will have mercy upon them, in enmity to the merciful nature of God? If theſe are nothing but oppoſition to God's true character, he is in oppoſition to them, and hates and diſallows them, and they are forbid by ſome law of God. Can you ſhew any ſuch law? If God hates theſe, he can't hate their contraries, unleſs his character is made up of contradictions, like your ſcheme, which, I don't believe: But he does ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the ſcandalous hereſies you have charged me with, as you deſired your reader to do, if he found this the caſe, that you might have the honor of retracting your error, (p. 107.) And now, Doctor, I expect you will do yourſelf the honor, and me the juſtice publicly to retract theſe falſe and injurious charges. If you do ſo, I will forgive you this wrong, and deſire the churches to whom you dedicated your falſe accuſations will do ſo too.— But I have other matters to ſettle with you, Doctor.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I ſhall next attend to what you ſay upon that paragraph, wherein I mention the ſilencing the blaſphemy of reprobate ſouls, by the force of truth. Theſe are my words, viz.
<q>Any particular ſinful affection indulged in oppoſition to the will of God, is practical oppoſition or <hi>enmity</hi> to the law of God. Theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in <hi>againſt light, will draw after them</hi> a <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>more malignant</hi> kind of enmity againſt God, as ſtanding in the way of ſuch indulged luſts And in this caſe, if the ſenſe of God's righteouſneſs in oppoſing and condemning the ſinner in his evil ways is <hi>weak,</hi> and the ſenſe of his own faultineſs <hi>low</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> this enmity may flame out dreadfully, and work up to blaſphemy and curſing. This is the preſent ſtate of devils, and in a ſad degree the caſe of ſome men. But it is a <hi>great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> to ſuppoſe and teach that things will remain in this <hi>horrid confuſion</hi> in wicked minds, forever, as too many do.—When God comes near to judgment he will reveal his righteouſneſs from heaven, and impreſs upon all wicked ſouls, both of men and devils, ſuch a clear, convincing, ſtrong ſenſe of the equity, fairneſs, and <hi>real kindneſs</hi> of his diſpenſations towards them in their former ſtate of trial, of the heinouſneſs of their offences, and of the juſtice and moral neceſſity of his preſent ſentence of condemnation (which impreſſion will never be ſuffered to wear off, any more) as will ſo far overbalance their natural ſelf love, as to <hi>oblige</hi> them to <hi>juſtify</hi> God's character, conduct and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in <hi>word</hi> and <hi>mind;</hi> and <hi>forever ſilence all murmurings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious reflections</hi> and <hi>hard ſpeeches againſt him,</hi> and all <hi>blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>curſings</hi> of their maker; their rage will turn inward <hi>againſt themſelves,</hi> as the flame of a reverberating furnace falls with all its force upon the melting metal.</q>
(D. p. 60, 61.) You tell us, Doctor, that the thoughts in this long paſſage appear to you <hi>quite new,</hi> (p. 81) and you appear quite frighted, and ſee as many ſpectres riſing up before you, as a timorous girl ever does in the dark; and you endeavor to alarm your readers by your pokeriſh deſcriptions of the creatures of your imagination; ſuch as theſe,

            <p>But let us try, Doctor, if we can't lay theſe evil ſpirits, which ſo haunt and terrify you.—The tho' is which you own to be quite new to you, are not ſo to <hi>all the world.</hi> Mr. Edwards expreſſes himſelf much to the ſame purpoſe— He ſays,
<q>Chriſtians have the greateſt reaſon to believe, from the ſcriptures, that in the future day of the revelation of the <hi>righteous</hi> judgment of God, when ſinners ſhall be called to anſwer before their judge, and all their wickedneſs, in all its aggravations <hi>clearly manifeſted</hi> in the <hi>perfect light</hi> of <hi>that</hi> day, and God will reprove them, and ſet their ſins in order <hi>before them,</hi> their conſciences will be greatly awakened and <hi>convinced,</hi> their mouths will be STOPPED—their conſciences will <hi>approve</hi> the dreadful ſentence of their judge; and <hi>ſeeing</hi> that they have <hi>deſerved</hi> ſo great a puniſhment, will <hi>join with the judge in condemning them</hi>
               </q>
—He adds,
<q>Their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ will <hi>then</hi> be bro't to perfection.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards on Virtue, p. 166, 167.</note> Which is <hi>true.</hi> I did not imagine any one would have underſtood me as intimating that they will <hi>then</hi> be <hi>converted</hi> to the holy love of God. I only ſaid what is implied in Mr. Edwards's words, and that their rage and reproaches will then turn againſt themſelves: which is the natural reſult of a full conviction that God is perfectly good and perfectly juſt, and they themſelves the authors of their own ruin, in a ſtate of final condemnation and deſpair.</p>
            <p>The truths, Doctor, which are impreſſed upon the minds of the condemned, at the time of Judgment, are not fitted in their nature <hi>as they reſpect them,</hi> to <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>ſanctify</hi> their hearts, but to <hi>kill</hi> them; to juſtify God in his ways and judgment upon them, and to extort from them a permanent juſtification of him, a true confeſſion before him, of his faithfulneſs and equity, of their evil deſert, and a condemnation of themſelves, all which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily turn their wrath and their reproaches <hi>againſt themſelves</hi>; which inſtead of leſſening, Increaſes their torment —This conviction is not willingly admitted, but forced upon them, by the force of the <hi>two edged ſword which proceeds out of his mouth.</hi> If they could, they would throw it off, and return to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expedient of miſrepreſenting <hi>to themſelves,</hi> and reviling God's ways and judgments as <hi>unequal,</hi> as ſome poor relief from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012066_0012_0F899390B4123728"/>Self-love, Doctor, in wicked and rejected ſouls, ſtill works as a deſire of <hi>ſelf eſteem,</hi> and of eſteem from others, as a deſire of life and happineſs. And as the truth of their caſe obſtructs the way of theſe motions, this ſelf love ſprings rancorous hatred of this truth; and, as its only remaining reſource, falls to miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blaſpheming the truth and the God of truth, laying the blame of its diſappointment on God, or any where, rather than on ſelf. But the truth, as impreſs'd by God on the mind, is of power ſufficient to bear down this ſpring of blaſphemy, and carry away all reſiſtance before it, and will do this, when God comes near to judgment. This ſpirit, thus ſhut up from this opening, will neceſſarily fall upon the ſinner himſelf with the whole force of its diſappointed paſſions, as the true cauſe of his own undoing; and his remaining and eternal quarrel will be againſt himſelf, and the wicked helpers of his ruin. Self hatred, and killing ſorrow, and fruitleſs repentance, lamentation and woe, will be his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting portion; which our Lord deſcribes by <hi>weeping, wailing,</hi> and <hi>gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> How great this miſery!<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor, don't imagine again that I am giving the condemned holy tempers.

If theſe tho'ts ſeem ſtrange and wrong, it is from want of cloſe and juſt reflection on the ſubject, on the holy ſcriptures relating to this ſubject, and on moral nature.</p>
            <p>I juſt mention two of your obſervations on the paſſage above tranſcribed. Firſt, you ſay,
<q>The damned, if we may believe Mr. H. will not be in ſo <hi>horrid confuſion</hi> always as they now are No! the <hi>happy</hi> time is coming when their confuſion ſhall not be ſo <hi>horrible</hi> and dreadful; but if their minds ſhall be calmed, and every murmur ſilenced, their minds ſhall be ſuited to their ſtate—Happy aera!</q>
(p. 81.) Doctor, you can't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing that I ſay. The <hi>horrid confuſion</hi> which I ſaid ſhould not laſt forever, reſpects only the blaſphemous rage againſt God. I there uſed the word <hi>confuſion</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that God uſes it in the law, where ſpeaking of ſome unnatural, monſtrous ſins, he ſays, they are '<hi>confuſion,</hi>' i. e. totally confound the order of nature; juſt as a wicked wretch does, when inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning himſelf he condemns his maker. As to that confuſion of face and mind, which is the natural reſult of ſin, it will then be compleat, when this other kind of confuſion is <hi>ſilenced.</hi>— No, no, Doctor, the minds of the wicked will <hi>never be calmed,</hi> but the ſtorm dreadfully <hi>heightened,</hi> at the time of judgment; only the wind will then blow in a contrary direction: and whereas the raging waves before ſometimes broke <hi>againſt the heavens,</hi> now they break and diſcharge their whole force upon the miſerable criminal himſelf; for God now rules the ſtorm. There is order, in this confuſion; the order of the governing truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God: it anſwers to the true nature of things, and in its way is praiſe to him. But can blaſphemy ever be praiſe to God? Doctor, do think.</p>

(p. 81, 82.) <hi>Nor he neither.</hi> Doctor, you blunder perpetually, and <hi>ſtumble at noon day as in the night.</hi> Pleaſe to turn your eye back on the paſſage you here refer to I there aſſigned the ſinner's <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> in ſinning on againſt light, as the <hi>cauſe</hi> or ſource of his blaſphemous enmity againſt God; and his perceiving God's oppoſition to him in his evil way, as the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> of its flaming out. I only mention a <hi>weak</hi> ſenſe of &amp;c. and a <hi>low</hi> and dull ſenſe of, &amp;c. as <hi>inſufficient</hi> to reſtrain the flow of this curſed paſſion; inſufficient <hi>becauſe weak, low,</hi> and <hi>dull</hi> — Doctor, what I ſaid is almoſt in direct oppoſition to what you ſuggeſt. Don't you ſee that I conſider this ſenſe as having a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency to reſtrain the ſinner from blaſpheming God, and inſufficient to effect it, only from its being too weak and low? I am ſorry to ſee you continually expoſe yourſelf as you do: you leave your intelligent reader no other option but pity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>Almoſt all your reaſonings againſt me, are founded upon a miſapprehenſion and wrong repreſentation of my doctrines and ſentiments: For this reaſon I take little notice of them. So are thoſe of your friend in the notes in your appendix. I call them ſo becauſe I think you wrote few of them. Perhaps I am miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: if I am it is no great fault: you are not robbed of any glory.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Let us now, Doctor, open a new ſcene—You ſay (p 117) 'He that carefully reads and attends to what he' (Mr. H)
<q>ſays in his dialogue, eſpecially in p. 30,—36 muſt ſee that he has <hi>no conception</hi> of ſalvation <hi>by free grace alone,</hi> but makes <hi>works</hi> and the ſinners <hi>endeavors</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> GROUND or <hi>reaſon</hi> why God beſtows on him <hi>renewing</hi> and <hi>pardoning</hi> mercy.</q>
No, Doctor, ſuch an one will ſee no ſuch thing: no ſuch thing exiſts. Indeed they that read with your paſſion and prejudice may poſſibly imagine and <hi>ſay</hi> ſuch a thing. You add,
<q>I will point out a few things. Mr, H ſuppoſes that the awakened, unrenewed ſinner takes pains to become better,</q>
&amp;c. &amp;c. (p. 118) Here, Doctor, you quote a few ſcraps of ſentences, picked up here and there, and patch them together with your uſual art. Some you have given right, ſome wrong, and ſome you have made yourſelf, and given to your reader as mine, as you have done many other things; for which I neither thank not honor you: this is one,
<q>Mr. H. ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that the awakened, unrenewed ſinner, truly repents,</q>
(p. 118<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</p>
            <p>Doctor, you and Mr. Hopkins have greatly miſrepreſented my doctrine relating to the influence of common grace, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012066_0014_0F89939234020A88"/>
of awakened ſinners under it, and both much alike. Why did you not act like honeſt men, and ſtate my doctrine fairly, and if you had objections to it, offer them clearly? Another method pleaſed you better.—You, Doctor, miſrepreſent and aggravate things to the utmoſt. You ſay,
<q>Mr. H. ſuppoſes that the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, unrenewed ſinner grows <hi>better</hi> under conviction, and <hi>therefore</hi> is <hi>more likely</hi> to obtain mercy, and that there is <hi>no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement at all</hi> for ſinners to ſtrive or hope, if this is not the caſe. Thus, <hi>according to him,</hi> the ſinner's <hi>growing better</hi> is the ONLY GOSPEL GROUND <hi>of his hope.</hi>—Thrice admirable! No com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can illuſtrate the abſurdity of this</q>
(p. 118.) Doctor, you have made your comment already, and entirely perverted the text. Your boldneſs in <hi>falſely accuſing</hi> is very wonderful —But let us hear you further.
<q>Mr. H's reaſoning, p 30.—36, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, viz. That awakened ſinners ſhould be taught that they really <hi>grow better, really pleaſe God</hi> in their conduct, and are <hi>leſs guilty</hi> than when ſecure, and that this is a <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> why they ſhould partake of the divine favor rather than others,</q>
(p. 119)
<q>The only way to keep ſinners from diſcouragement, and prompt them to—conſtancy in ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſalvation, is to perſuade them that they <hi>really grow better,</hi> and may hope, <hi>by their further increaſe in goodneſs,</hi> to obtain the favor they need,</q>
(p. 120.) After much more to this purpoſe in the ſame ſpirit of falſe repreſentation, you become ſo inflamed with your own imaginations as to cry out in a tranſport of <hi>abſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Such is Mr. H's religion, ſuch his views of the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt,</q>
(p. 122.) Doctor, if you had ſpoken the language of truth in your exclamation, you would have ſaid Such is the religion
<q>I have palmed upon Mr. H. tho' he never taught it,</q>
ſuch are the views I give of his notions concerning the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, tho' he has not given the ſame himſelf, nor any thing like them: But I am wrathful mad with him for cenſuring ſome of my falſe doctrines, and ſee every thing he ſays, in a wrong light.—You proceed thus,

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012066_0014_0F89939234020A88"/>
I have not taught, nor believed the ſcandalous doctrines you curſe me for: you can't ſupport your charge: you greatly abuſe both me and your readers. The wine you here ſet before the churches, is <hi>the poiſon of dragons, and the cruel venom of aſps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have critically re examined the pages you refer to and find nothing that gives the leaſt hint of the wicked doctrines you charge me with. I verily believe, if you was to be proſecuted before the church for defamation, as you juſtly might be, you would be wholly at a loſs what paſſages in the dialogue to fix upon for your juſtification, and might as eaſily ſupport your charge by quoting theſe words of our Lord, <hi>Men ſhall revile you, and ſpeak all manner of evil againſt you, falſely,</hi> as by any thing I ſaid.</p>
            <p>I cenſured ſome of your's and Mr. Hopkin's corrupt doctrines, and now you have executed an unrighteous and <hi>unmanly</hi> revenge. The doctrines I oppoſed to your errors, rightly underſtood, are above juſt cenſure. You could make no figure in oppoſing them, as fairly ſtated. You have declined the combat on this ground, and thereby implicitly juſtified my doctrine. You have brought upon the ſtage a ſet of doctrines which are no more mine than thoſe of yours that I oppoſed, doctrines really very bad; and pretending you had found them in my dialogue, raiſe a loud cry againſt me as an abominable heretick, and moſt dangerous, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, and endeavor to alarm the churches. But they have no great cauſe of fear from this quarter: Your imaginary hereſies will do them no harm, unleſs they believe them real.—Doctor, has Caiaphas been in your counſel? Have you heard the outcry againſt Paul the <hi>great</hi> heretick?
<q>Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he ſhould live—They threw duſt into the air.</q>
—You have thrown duſt into your readers eyes.</p>
            <p>I obſerve, Doctor, you renew many of Mr. Hopkins's trifling complaints, as his <hi>echo.</hi> Among others, you ſpeak of my writing againſt one of his doctrines before I had ſeen his book, and his defence of it, not then publiſhed, and apply theſe words,
<q>He that anſwereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and ſhame unto him,</q>
(p. 129) Doctor, you knew I had ſeen all I remark'd upon, and more. And I underſtood, and fairly repreſented the doctrine. But you, after having my dialogue in your hands many months, have undertaken to anſwer it, and yet appear not to have underſtood it, and have eſſentially miſrepreſented my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and fooliſhly waſted your time, and diverted your readers,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012066_0015_0F899392F28C8958"/>
by attacking the creatures of your own imagination. This, Doctor, is anſwering a matter <hi>before it is heard,</hi> according to the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> of the proverb.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Doctor, I appear angry, in my letter to Mr. Hopkins. I was not angry, in the ſenſe you intend; nor am I with you. But I ſaw his great unfairneſs, perverſe miſrepreſentations, and want of honor in his writing; and ſee the ſame in yours, and in a higher degree. I reſent ſuch things, and have a ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">VI. Suffer me, Doctor, to turn your eye upon another object. You quote me as ſaying,
<q>Is the preſent frame of human nature ſuch, ſo totally <hi>inverted</hi> that God is ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are righteouſneſs, equity, goodneſs, kindneſs, &amp;c. <hi>hateful</hi> in <hi>our view</hi> of them, till we are new made? If ſo, doubtleſs we <hi>naturally approve</hi> the contrary vices; they are <hi>beautiful, excellent,</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> characters, in our view of them, (D. p 16) To this you anſwer, '<hi>Doubtleſs this is true.</hi> What abſurdity then is this? Do not unregenerate men <hi>view</hi> and <hi>taſte</hi> a <hi>beauty, amiableneſs</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in theſe contrary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Do they not roll iniquity as a ſweet morſel under their tongue? Do they not take pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs?</q>
(p 70) Yes Doctor, they ſometimes do, <hi>for the ſake of the profit</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> they make by it for the gratification of their luſts; as Balaam ran <hi>greedily</hi> after the <hi>wages</hi> of unrighteouſneſs. But they never take pleaſure in it for its own ſake, as what is, in its own nature, <hi>beautiful, amiable</hi> and <hi>ſweet,</hi> in their view and taſte of it. Vicious men's love of unrighteouſneſs, like their hatred to righteouſneſs, is an <hi>intereſted, partial</hi> affection, and directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their natural, <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe or taſte; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces theſe things evil, and worthy to be hated. Doctor, you diſcover very wrong notions of moral nature, and talk as one that has never made any obſervations on human nature, as diſcovered in life, but has taken up his notions of it only from imagination and arbitrary conjecture, juſt as the old philoſophers did their philoſophic doctrines. Doctor, I am deceived in you. I really thought my queſtions, and the inference from the affirmation of them, would have ſtumbled you: I am half diſcouraged about you, and ſhould be wholly, but that I conſider you wrote this in the heat of your ſpirit; ſo I hope now you are calm, you will give a wiſer anſwer.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:012066_0015_0F899392F28C8958"/>VII. Doctor, I obſerve you here and there touch upon the doctrine of total depravity, and ſay, that I ſometimes ſeem to own the doctrine, and at other times to deny it. The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy I had againſt you, in my dialogue, reſpected the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>ſource</hi> of the enmity of vicious beings againſt God, not the extent of moral corruption: ſo I ſaid nothing particularly upon this, as I remember. The ſubject did not lead me to it, or at leaſt, I did not apprehend that it did. In my letter to Mr. Hopkins p 5, 6, note, I ſtated what I apprehended to be the ſentiments of the moſt moderate Calviniſts relating to the general doctrine of total corruption and declared my agreement therein. I believe I have ſaid nothing, either in the dialogue or letter, ſo determinate rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my thoughts upon that ſubject. My words are theſe, viz.
<q>The moſt moderate believe that the grand principle of true piety, and heavenly virtue is <hi>dead,</hi> and its <hi>root</hi>
               </q>
(by which I mean the true knowlege and love of God)
<q>
                  <hi>periſhed</hi> in the hearts of fallen men, and that it cannot be <hi>revived,</hi> but by a new plantation of the <hi>ſacred ſeed</hi> ſent down from heaven, by Jeſus Chriſt, and planted <hi>in the heart</hi> by the <hi>gracious influences</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural</hi> grace of God, adminiſtred <hi>by the goſpel,</hi>
               </q>
(not <hi>without</hi> the <hi>word of truth.</hi> Doctor, as you teach; God forbid that I ſhould ſay ſo)
<q>and that there are certain <hi>ſeeds of ſin</hi> in the hearts of <hi>all men,</hi> or natural principles and ſprings of action, which, left to themſelves, uncontrouled and ungoverned <hi>by grace</hi> will <hi>infallibly</hi> produce actual ſin, and bring forth fruit unto death, and that ſome or other of the paſſions or luſts of ſin have, in fact the <hi>aſcendant</hi> in <hi>every heart</hi> of man till the heavenly ſeed of virtue or true holineſs is planted by the ſpirit of grace. <hi>All this is undoubtedly true.</hi>
               </q>
—This, Doctor, is my belief: you may receive it upon the teſtimony of an honeſt man. Whether you will call it a belief of total, or partial corruption, little concerns me.</p>
            <p>I obſerve you tell your readers that in my letter to Mr. Hopkins I diſcover a great concern to be thought a Calviniſt. Some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, Doctor, have tho't I ſhew'd a good deal of indifference what you call me. I ſhould chuſe indeed to have my ſentiments tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Doctor, you expreſs a deſire to know what I mean by <hi>moral</hi> corruption. I mean by it a diſorder o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> irregularity in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, direction and exerciſe of the moral faculties and paſſions,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012066_0016_0F8993949553E660"/>
which is <hi>juſtly chargeable on the agent as his fault,</hi> his miſuſe or abuſe of the moral powers and paſſions God has planted in his nature, or deviation from the moral law which is adapted to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature as the rule to which its motions and exerciſes ought of night to be conformed.—As you repreſent the matter, the fundamental fault or diſorder of human nature <hi>is not of the moral kind</hi> If a man, thro' ſome wrongneſs or defect in his natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, can't taſte any agreeable ſweetneſs in honey, but loaths it, this is no fault in him, and a law requiring him to be pleaſed with its taſte, would be a very unjuſt and immoral law. And if human nature is ſo framed that men have naturally no <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>ſeeing</hi> any moral excellence, or of <hi>taſting</hi> any thing amiable and worthy of eſteem and honor in God's character, and in moral truth, be the mind ever ſo much inlightened, but theſe objects appear ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>hateful in themſelves</hi>; this is not a moral corruption, for which the man is blameable, but a phyſical wrongneſs in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſtitution of human nature. Your doctrine ſays this is the character of human nature. You ſay,
<q>Unregenerate men <hi>can't</hi> ſee God's beauty and excellency—they do not ſee the beauty and excellency of God's perfections—unregenerate men can <hi>never</hi> ſee this, (i. e. as I ſuppoſe you mean, in any degree, thro' any inlightning they are capable of, till after they are new made by a phyſical operation upon them, without the word of truth.</q>
You add)
<q>They may, and often do <hi>ſee</hi> thoſe perfections that compoſe that character that is beautiful <hi>in itſelf,</hi> ſuch as his power, righteouſneſs, &amp;c.—They ſee the <hi>true character</hi> of God,</q>
(i. e. if I underſtand you, they ſee him to be moſt wiſe, righteous, true, faithful, good, merciful,) 'but they ſee no beauty in him,' (i. e. no moral excellence in theſe perfections of God)
<q>for that which renders him beautiful to all holy beings, even that is the object of their hatred; and if ſo, then the beauty of God's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is the thing they hate, (p. 69, note)</q>
That is, as you moſt be underſtood, they ſee the wiſdom, righteouſneſs, truth, goodneſs and compaſſionate good will of God to be what the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are; they ſee him to be moſt wiſe, equitable, true, good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and <hi>as ſuch</hi> they <hi>hate</hi> him, for theſe are <hi>hateful things</hi> in their view, and taſte bitter as gall, and are their abomination. If God appeared to them under the character of a fooliſh, falſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, cruel tyrant, they would love him and eſteem him very beautiful, and full of excellency, and adore him, and exalt his name with praiſe. Whence is this, Doctor? You ſay ſuch a falſe taſte and monſtrous hatred is interwove in the very frame of the heart of man, ever ſince the fall. Doctor, I muſt tell you again,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012066_0016_0F8993949553E660"/>
you make man look much worſe than a devil —But let us hear you further. You ſay, p. 70, note,
<q>No excellency, <hi>viewed as ſuch,</hi> ever was, or can be hated: but then <hi>I</hi> AFFIRM human nature is <hi>ſo totally inverted,</hi> that it can diſcern no moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in God,—till it is renewed; and if ever the unrenewed ſinner <hi>ſees</hi> any beauty in <hi>a God,</hi> it is in <hi>one formed</hi> to <hi>ſuit</hi> his own <hi>depraved taſte,</hi> and not in the true God.</q>
This is ſuch a total inverſion of human nature as <hi>wholly deſtroys</hi> its character <hi>as moral.</hi> If your account of human nature is true, its corruption is not of the moral kind; and men are under a <hi>natural, phyſical</hi> impoſſibility of loving God, or ceaſing to hate him, till their hearts are phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally changed, and endowed with a new moral faculty or taſte, which is now wanting. Theſe hints are more enlarged upon in my piece in anſwer to Mr. Edwards on the nature of virtue.— Doctor, I am ſorry to ſee your underſtanding ſo <hi>inverted,</hi> and your tho'ts ſo confounded as that you miſtake darkneſs for light. By your doctrine you ſubvert the foundation and obligation of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral religion, ſo far as natural men have any concern therein. And the kingdom of God, or goſpel diſpenſation, according to your doctrine, is as a man who made a great feaſt of ſugar'd and honey'd things, and ſent forth his ſervants to invite and bring in to his feaſt, all his vaſſals, who, thro' ſome fault in the natural conſtruction of their organs of taſte, known to him, and wholly incurable by them, hate and abhor theſe things, requiring them to taſte his proviſions with good reliſh and delight; and becauſe they nauſeate, and ſo refuſe to eat them, he ſends forth his army and deſtroys them all, as a company of ungrateful, rebellious miſcreants; except a few, whom he miraculouſly works a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical change upon, giving them a new guſt. You will ſay the caſes are not ſimilar, becauſe the ſinner's antipathy is of his heart or will. But remember, 'tis, according to you, a natural, inwro't, incurable antipathy to things morally good, <hi>as ſuch</hi>; a natural, eſſential wrongneſs &amp; inverſion of the moral taſte, incurable, but by God's phyſical power. There is no moral faultineſs in either: The caſes are ſimilar.—Doctor, I can't endure that abominable blaſphemy againſt the goſpel of God which is the neceſſary reſult of your doctrines. I wonder you don't ſee it: I hope you will by the time you have read, and thoroughly weighed all that I write to you, and make no delay to renounce them with juſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, and caſt them to the moles and to the bats.<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſaid, D. p. 45.
<q>Human nature is ſo weakened and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſince the fall, that men neither will nor can ſo believe and <hi>realize</hi> goſpel truth, as to be renewed by its influence, unleſs the Spirit of truth accompany the word and ſpeak it, as it were, to the heart, and impreſs it by his powerful energy.</q>
You ſay this doctrine is as liable to the charge of conſequential blaſphemy againſt God and the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, as yours; and that yours can be vindicated from this charge as eaſily and fully as mine, p 110, 111.—Doctor, you labour under a very great miſtake in this. The goſpel is a miniſtration of ſupernatural truth and grace, fitted in its nature to work in the mind as a vital ſeed, and ſacred leaven; and the mind of man is naturally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being influenced and changed or ſpiritualized by it, when firmly believed and realized. The holy Spirit of God accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies this miniſtration of the word of life, with ſome degree of his influence, <hi>as a common grace</hi> If ſinners improve this, and the outward helps they have by the goſpel, as far as they are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable by them I <hi>believe</hi> he will crown his common influence with ſpecial and effectual, leading them on to ſaving faith, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate them: If they do not, but continually reſiſt and rebel againſt the motions of the Spirit, and ſo provoke God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Spirit and give them up to final blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, the grace of the goſpel is vindicated, and they periſh as deſpiſers of it. This belief is conſiſtent with my doctrine above.</note> Don't

you remember the words of the apoſtle, (Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.) <hi>Thoſe who have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</hi> (i. e. of the goſpel diſpenſation) <hi>if they ſhall fall away,</hi> &amp;c. implying that a man may have an approving moral taſte of the truth and moral excellency of the goſpel, in ſome degree, though his heart is not thoroughly attached to it.—But I think you may be convinced out of your own mouth. You ſay (p. 75)
<q>Mr. H. and I agree in this, That there is in all moral beings <hi>as ſuch,</hi> a faculty of diſtinguiſhing between moral good and evil.</q>
— Surely you don't mean a faculty of diſcerning moral good to be right and righteous, and that <hi>for this very reaſon</hi> it appears to men an ugly and hateful object; and a faculty of diſcerning mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil to be wrong and unrighteous, and that, viewing it in this true light, men naturally eſteem it a beautiful, amiable object, and love it as ſuch. This is not a faculty of diſtinguiſhing, but of inverting and confounding moral good and evil. At this rate you make the faculty of diſtinguiſhing moral good and evil a perfect magic glaſs, which ſhews objects inverted and diſtorted; and repreſent the moral nature of man, as <hi>bewitched,</hi> as much as the children of the ſcarlet whore are, by her witchcrafts and ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

               </q>
(p 132.) I mean, Doctor, ſeeing them to be <hi>equitable</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> This is not what raiſes the ſinner's hatred to them, but his perceiving their oppoſition to his luſts, which he refuſes to give up; and becauſe he can't but approve them, as viewed in this light, he perverſely miſrepreſents them <hi>as unequal,</hi> that he may with ſome colour vent the malignity of his heart in ſpeaking evil of them —As to <hi>beauty</hi> the <hi>moral beauty</hi> or <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of equity conſiſts in its equitableneſs, the beauty of goodneſs in its goodneſs, the beauty of juſtice in its juſtneſs, of wiſdom in its prudence, ſo of all other moral perfections. Their moral excellency conſiſts in their being what they are. The beauty or moral excellency of God's character conſiſts in, or is the reſult of all moral and mental perfections, as united in him, and moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly exerciſed, <hi>all as one.</hi> This collection of moral and mental beauties, all in the higheſt perfection of their nature, forms a character, whoſe light and glory fill the univerſe, and is the wonder and joy of all the ſons of wiſdom, in all worlds. <hi>Honor and majeſty are before him: ſtrength and beauty are in his ſanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you. Doctor, give us no diſtinct Ideas of what you mean by moral beauty, and the moral excellency of God's character: perhaps you have none. You doubtleſs mean ſomething wholly of a different kind from that kind of beauty I mentioned above: for you ſay, men may ſee thoſe perfections that compoſe that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that is beautiful in itſelf, yea, ſee <hi>that very character</hi> of God which is the perfection of beauty, and yet not ſee its beauty, nor have the leaſt glimpſe or idea of its true moral excellency. And all your writers talk in the ſame ſtrain. This, Doctor, is a downright contradiction: and you have no way to eſcape but by eſſentially changing the idea of moral beauty, and introducing a new and imaginary notion of moral excellency, and placing vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue on a falſe foundation. This is what Mr. Edwards has done
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012066_0018_0F899395F6EC4998"/>
in his diſſertation on the nature of true virtue. Doubtleſs you have adopted his diſtinction between the <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>ſecondary</hi> beauty of moral things and characters. The beauty I ſpake of above, I ſuppoſe you would call after him,
<q>a <hi>ſecondary</hi> beauty, altogether of the ſame kind with the beauty of a cheſs board, or piece of beautifully ſlower'd chints or brocade,</q>
which, conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d ſimply in itſelf, has nothing of the nature of true virtue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beauty in it, any more than thoſe things have; and that you would ſay, all moral excellency, or true moral beauty conſiſts in what he calls the <hi>primary</hi> beauty of moral things, which is intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a different nature or kind, and which no unregenerate man can ſee, which the moral ſenſe can't taſte, and has no reliſh for.</p>
            <p>This I ſuppoſe to be your ſecret meaning; tho' for ſome reaſon or other, you don't clearly explain yourſelves. This is the key which explains your myſterious talk about ſeeing the perfections and character of God without diſcerning any thing of their moral beauty or excellency. But I don't enlarge here, having parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly examined theſe notions, and ſhewn them to be arbitrary and falſe, in my remarks on that piece of Mr. Edwards's.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Doctor,
<q>a perception of beauty is love, or <hi>neceſſarily</hi> engages it.</q>
No, it neceſſarily engages the mind to approve the object as amiable and <hi>worthy</hi> to be loved. Indeed the perception of the moral beauty of God's character may be ſo full, clear and realizing as to draw the heart off from all its adulterous loves, and fix it on God. He can give ſuch a ſenſe. But the views men generally have of God's moral excellency and glory, are ſo imperfect, obſcure and unrealizing, that they don't draw the heart to the choice of him, in preference to all other objects of deſire.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. In your ſeventh ſect. Doctor, I obſerve you endeavor to perſuade your readers that my ſcheme of doctrines agrees with Mr. Sandeman's. If I was to take the ſame liberty in altering your doctrines, as you do in reſpect to mine, I could make you appear to agree with the author of
<q>Chriſtianity not founded on argument.</q>
I need not pervert ſome of them half ſo much as you do mine, to give ſuch an appearance. 'Tis an avowed and leading principle in your ſcheme, that the moral change of the heart is not founded on argument, nor effected by any influence of goſpel light and truth upon either the underſtanding or will. But if I ſhould ſpend five or ſix pages in making out this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you would think it but an ungracious buſineſs. You ought to think your own ſo.—Your ſcheme nearly agrees with San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deman's, in many things, tho' you differ from him in ſome. For
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012066_0018_0F899395F6EC4998"/>
this reaſon I ſometimes looſely called your ſcheme <hi>Sandemanian,</hi> as it then had no diſtinguiſhing name. But as it has ſince gain'd the name of <hi>Hopkintonian,</hi> which is more proper, I am content that the other ſhould be no more applied.</p>

p. 124. I ſhould not have taken any notice of this, had you not hereby thrown infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous contempt on the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. Every reader will ſee at once, that you treat the ſentiments you offer as mine and Sandeman's with <hi>contempt.</hi> In this you have <hi>deſpiſed not man but God</hi> You might as well have cried out, The goſpel ſcheme to perfection. This tho't, The goſpel reconciles men to the <hi>juſt</hi> God, by ſhewing him to be a <hi>ſaviour,</hi> runs thro' the whole goſpel, and is its diſtinguiſhing glory, and that which merits and gives it the name of goſpel or good news. It was a manifeſtation and ſight of the <hi>juſt</hi> God as a SAVIOUR that revived the deſpairing hearts of your poor firſt parents, and reconciled them to God, and melted their hearts into filial repentance. But for this, you, if you had ever ſeen the light of life, would have been a <hi>poor, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, miſerable</hi> wretch It was by ſhewing the juſt God a ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that the apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt miniſterially reconciled the world.

But I am very far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving either your ſcheme or his; for both run wide of the line of truth. The father of error knows how to turn both to his advantage.</p>

(ibid. ch. 3 art. 1.) By repentance, here, he tells us he means to include regeneration, or the renewal of the heart after the image of God, as well as the conſequent change of life. After diſcourſing upon this ſome time, he ſays, in the 9th article of this chap
<q>In one word, I expound repentance to be <hi>regeneration,</hi> which hath no other mark whereunto it is directed, but that the image of God, which was, by Adam's offence, <hi>foully defaced,</hi> and <hi>in a manner wholly blotted out,</hi> may be <hi>renewed</hi> in us.

<q>This ſpiritual life, which he calls the <hi>immediate effect</hi> of the generating act, animates the whole man, and all the ſeveral parts and faculties of him. — As it takes place in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> it is called—ſpiritual <hi>light,</hi> and the beſtowment of it <hi>by regeneration,</hi> is called <hi>illumination</hi>;— which light begets in them the <hi>ſaving</hi> knowlege of God and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</q>

            <p>You Gentlemen, by the many quotations you have heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, from former writers, have gained two things; firſt, a proof that ſome great and good men before you have tho't obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and talked inconſiſtently, as you alſo do. Secondly, That thoſe who approached neareſt to you in doctrine, retained ſo much truth as clearly to condemn your leading doctrines, and themſelves too, wherein they ſeem to favor you.—So that, upon the whole, I think, Doctor, you muſt be content to bear the glory of having

            <p n="11">XI. Doctor, I obſerve that tho' you ſometimes tell your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders what I muſt mean by the <hi>moral power of the Spirit, moral</hi> force, energy, influence, yet at other times you profeſs yourſelf at a loſs, and demand of me what I mean by theſe and ſuch like phraſes. Some others, I perceive, have been in doubt here.— To ſatisfy you and them, I will tell you in a few words By moral power, force, &amp;c. I intend that kind of influence upon the mind, which is <hi>fitted, in its nature,</hi> to produce the deſigned <hi>moral</hi> effects or changes, motions or actions in the mind, as a moral agent. This, you will ſay, is too general: I will explain, only take the ideas already ſuggeſted, right.—There is a <hi>power</hi> in <hi>ſtrong</hi> deluſions, an <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>energy</hi> in the ſpirit of error upon minds prepared to receive it: but it is not of the <hi>phyſical</hi> kind.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2.9—11.</note> And there is a divine <hi>power</hi> in ſacred truth, and a <hi>mighty</hi> acting <hi>force</hi> and <hi>energy</hi> in divine beauty and love, as applying themſelves to, or exerting their power upon the mind.

            <p>I will now conſider the <hi>moral</hi> power and energy of the holy Spirit, exerted in morally changing and turning the heart of the ſinner from his ſin unto God, or regenerating him. He applies himſelf to him, for this purpoſe, in a manner ſuited to his nature as a <hi>moral</hi> being: He preſents the quickning truth

            <p>Doctor, to talk of a moral change, wro't by a phyſical operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>preceeding</hi> all this, and preparing the heart to be influenced by the truth and preſence of God in the mind, as you gentlemen do, is to tell of a moral change <hi>preceeding itſelf,</hi> or of a moral change which leaves the <hi>underſtanding, will</hi> and <hi>moral paſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, unaffected</hi> not <hi>touched</hi> or <hi>moved</hi> at all; which is no <hi>moral</hi> change.

<q>power may be diſtinguiſhed into two kinds, <hi>phyſical</hi> and <hi>moral,</hi> that the Spirit of God is poſſeſſed of both, and exerts the one or the other, as he wills to produce a change of the moral or phyſical kind</q>
Upon this you ſay,
<q>Did ever any one beſides Mr. H. <hi>imagine that the ſame almighty power could not produce effects of entirely different natures?</hi>

(No, Doctor, nor he neither.
<q>Did not the ſame power produce fire and water, the ſouls and bodies of men?</q>
(p. 135) Yes, Doctor, it did. But what is all this to the purpoſe? Theſe are, none of them, effects of the moral kind, in the ſenſe of the phraſe as I uſed it. And beſides, you miſtake about the diſtinction of power, into moral and phyſical. The diſtinction don't lie in the degrees of ſtrength. Both are almighty, as in God; and have, when he pleaſes to exert them fully, an irreſiſtable force.

            <p>By <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> I ſuppoſe, Doctor, you mean more than ſelf-love, or a general deſire of our own good and happineſs.

<q>do and may very conſiſtently deny <hi>your</hi> doctrine concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of the enmity. There is an eſſential difference between your doctrine concerning the nature of the enmity, and their doctrine of the corruption.</q>
—On this you ſay,
<q>But it ſeems that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects us to believe this on his <hi>naked aſſertion</hi>; for he has been <hi>very careful not to ſhew wherein</hi> the diſtinction lies, unleſs we may gather it from theſe words;</q>

                  <hi>They</hi> (i e. all ſound Calviniſts) <hi>believe the corruption is of the moral kind.</hi> But this ſhews no difference; becauſe—we believe the enmity we hold to be of the moral kind</q>
(p. 160) Here, Doctor, you have played <hi>foul</hi> in a very <hi>ſcandalous</hi> manner You have deſignedly concealed from your reader the chief difference I mentioned between your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of the enmity and their doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the corruption, and told him I mentioned no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence but what you quoted, knowing you did not ſpeak true in this I here give the paſſage as it ſtands in my Letter, p. 7, and put the words you concealed, in Italics. Let the reader compare and judge for himſelf. 'Men who admit this doctrine' (of total depravity)
<q>do, and may very conſiſtently deny your doctrine concerning the nature of the enmity: <hi>for</hi> they believe the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is of the moral kind; <hi>and</hi> CURABLE <hi>by an application of that ſupernatural doctrine of truth and grace which came by Jeſus Chriſt, in ſuch a manner as the Spirit of God knows how to apply it.</hi> There is an eſſential difference between your doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enmity—and their doctrine of the corruption.</q>
— You know, Doctor, this difference, which you bid under a <hi>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> —is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>eſſential.</hi> You and Mr. Hopkins aſſert the direct contrary concerning the nature of your enmity, viz that <hi>it is not curable</hi> by any poſſible application of goſpel truth to the mind. By concealing this mentioned difference, and telling your readers

I have 'been very careful not to ſhew wherein the difference lies, 'except only by ſaying,

You have given them juſt cauſe to complain of you and ſay, 'thou haſt unworthily deceived us.'</p>
            <p>In my letter to Mr. Hopkins, I told him he had put the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy on a wrong foot in ſaying that total depravity is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

— This doctrine I oppoſed in my dialogue, and did ſo effectually overthrow, that you and Mr Hopkins both have tho't it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhift the controverſy, and tell your readers the diſpute is about the doctrine of total corruption. And you have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to prove that you have ſtated the controverſy right, and that I ſhamefully denied the truth of fact in telling Mr. Hopkins he had ſtated it wrong. Let us ſee how you do this.</p>
            <p>Having quoted two paſſages from the dialogue, and made an impertinent remark, miſrepreſenting their ſenſe, you add,
<q>I could fill whole pages with quotations of this kind</q>
(i e with quotations not at all to your purpoſe)
<q>but ſhall only mention one more, where he <hi>expreſly</hi> puts the controverſy <hi>upon the foot of total depravity.</hi> Having quoted from my ſermon the following words, viz. The minds of men are <hi>too full</hi> of enmity to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to love or be reconciled to God, by any, tho' the moſt powerful arguments; therefore I do not think that regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is effected by light,—but in order to this the power of God muſt be exerted, and by this alone men are created anew; he adds, <hi>if the premiſes are true, the inference is undoubtedly juſt.</hi> And yet in the face of all this—he te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(p. 159) More <hi>ſoul play,</hi> Doctor, <hi>exceeding ſoul.</hi> What I called the <hi>premiſes,</hi> in the paſſage you refer to, you have concealed from your readers, and took the inference, your

own inference, and tore it into two pieces and ſet up one for the <hi>premiſe,</hi> and call the other the inference from it. By this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful contrivance you endeavor to deceive your readers, into a belief that I did really have the controverſy as you and Mr. Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins ſay, and that I was guilty of palpable falſhood in denying it to him.</p>
            <p>I don't expect the reader to believe this charge without evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its truth; and therefore muſt tranſcribe that paſſage in the dialogue you refer to. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(Ser. p 52 1ſt edit) This, Doctor, is the inference you draw from the doctrine concerning the <hi>nature</hi> and power of the enmity againſt God, which you had before laid down in the <hi>doctrinal part</hi> of your diſcourſe. It is the <hi>head</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in your ſecond remark, by way of inference from your doctrine concerning the enmity; a ſummary whereof I gave you juſt now.—The <hi>Gent.</hi> quoted ſome others of your words, in your diſcourſe under this head, in which you expreſt this inference more ſtrongly:
<q>The minds of men are too full of enmity to God, to be perſuaded to love and be reconciled to him by any, tho' the moſt powerful arguments, addreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(p 53. 1ſt edit.) Your inference from your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine concerning the <hi>nature</hi> and power of in wro't enmity, before laid down in the body of your ſermon, being now fairly given in your own words, the <hi>Clerg</hi> rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have alſo obſerved your efforts to clear your ſcheme of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine from the bad conſequences I charged upon it But they juſtly lie at the door, and always will: I could eaſily ſhew the utter inſufficiency of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I don't mean here to intimate any thing diſhonorable to your underſtanding, Doctor The weakneſs lies in the cauſe you have eſpouſed. Error can't be defended with real ſtrength, no, not by an angel. Good angels will never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake its defence. I wiſh you would give it up, and leave the doctrine of errors to be defended by thoſe to whom they properly belong. What have we to do with them?

            <p n="14">XIV. The criticiſms, Doctor, by which you endeavour to evade the force of the texts I mentioned as inconſiſtent with your doctrine, are ſo manifeſtly impertinent as not to need a particular anſwer. I only mention two, as a ſpecimen of your ſkill, and the liberty you take in evading the teſtimony of the truth itſelf. But I muſt obſerve one thing you ſay juſt before you come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on them.</p>
            <p>'He' (Mr. H)
<q>
                  <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that <hi>becauſe</hi> the word is called <hi>the ſword of the Spirit, it has power to regenerate</hi> But has a ſword any power at all?—The written word has no power but what ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the <hi>energy of the Spirit</hi> or the teſtimony of conſcience.</q>
(p 125.) Doctor, you know very well that I did not ſuppoſe what you here ſuggeſt, but ſpake repeatedly of the holy Spirit acting upon the mind with the word, in producing this change, and expreſſed my ſentiments very fully that the outward teaching of the written word, without his concurring influence, can't ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this holy change. In the place you refer to, where I call the word of God the ſword of the Spirit, I ſpake of the Spirit as the agent uſing this ſword. See the pages refered to below <note n="*" place="bottom">D. p 42, 45, 46, 58.</note> This very phraſe, '<hi>the energy of the Spirit</hi>' accompanying the word, which you here uſe in a pretended oppoſition to me, you found in my dialogue. You repeatedly own what I here repreſent as my doctrine, to be indeed ſo. You ſay, p. 111, 'He' (Mr. H)
<q>owns that men neither will nor can be influenced to believe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, by the moſt powerful goſpel motives, without the powerful energy of the Spirit.</q>
And in p. 113, you ſay,
<q>We agree that the motives have no power till the Spirit exerts ſome kind of energy, ſo that their efficacy is only with, and never without it.—We agree in this</q>
Thus. Doctor you have borne witneſs againſt yourſelf, that you teſtified a known falſhood in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage now under cenſure. Why will you kill yourſelf in order to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012066_0025_0F89939BF4895358"/>
throw falſe reproach upon me? Inſtances of the ſame kind are numerous. You have given full evidence that you are worthy of <hi>no credit</hi> as a witneſs againſt me.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to obſerve how you evade two of the texts I mentioned as evidence that God uſes and applies the goſpel truth to the mind in renewing or regenerating men.—I mentioned this text for this purpoſe, <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,</hi> (Jam. 1.18) On this you ſay,
<q>But in order to make this ſerve his turn, he muſt prove that the word <hi>begat</hi> means regeneration properly taken for the implanting or creating a divine principle in the heart, as diſtinguiſhed from active con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or the exerciſe of the new principle when given: till this is proved the text can't help his cauſe,</q>
(p. 126) When it is, you hereby own that it will. I ſhould have thought this needed no proof. For what you call
<q>active converſion, or the exerciſe of the new principle,</q>
is the act of the man, not of God as a generator, a conſequence or fruit of the work of God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting or forming him a new creature: and ſo I think you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways repreſent it except here to avoid the force of this text.— Doctor, when you ſee a child exerciſing the life and power he is endowed with, you don't ſay his father begat theſe exerciſes, but that he begat the child, and the child does the actions.— The holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh expreſly, and in a very determinate manner, as foreſeeing and guarding againſt this perverſion of his words in favor of your corrupt doctrines.
<q>Of his own will <hi>begat</hi> he <hi>us</hi> with the word of truth, that <hi>we</hi> ſhould be a kind of <hi>firſt fruits of his creatures,</hi>
               </q>
i. e. in the new creation: Behold, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I create all things new</hi> The ſouls of men are created anew, renewed in knowlege, after God's image. He hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>us;</hi> not our actions of the new and holy kind, but <hi>ourſelves. We</hi> are new begotten by God, and ſo new born and his children: can the ſenſe of words be more obvious and fixed? So it is ſaid, God's people ſhall be <hi>trees of righteouſneſs of the Lord's plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> and our Saviour ſays, <hi>make the tree good that his fruit may be good.</hi> God makes the tree good, a tree of righteouſneſs; which reſpects the moral change of the mind and heart in regeneration or converſion; in conſequence of which the tree bears good fruit.</p>
            <p>But you ſay,
<q>The Greek word <hi>(apekueſe)</hi> rendered <hi>begat,</hi> may—be rendered <hi>impregnated</hi>; and ſo Dr Doddridge renders it—and this is the moſt natural meaning of the word in the 15th ver. Sin when it is finiſhed or <hi>perpetrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> bringeth forth, or rather is <hi>impregnated</hi> with death.</q>
Doctor, ſin is here figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively repreſented as a mother, and death as her on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pring.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012066_0026_0F89939CB86A3AF0"/>
Now a mother conceives feed, is impregnated, is pregnant, and brings forth her children. But where did you ever hear it ſaid that the father in the act of begetting impregnates the child? This word as reſpecting the father's act as a generator is rightly rendered <hi>beget,</hi> and can't be rendered <hi>impregnated,</hi> in reſpect to the child begotten, without the greateſt abſurdity. In this text we ourſelves are repreſented, not as a mother impregnated, but as the creatures or children <hi>begotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I only mention one thing more. You ſeem to think our Lord's parable of the ſower affords prooff that regeneration, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the heart good and honeſt, is wro't by a mere phyſical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or operation, without any influence of goſpel truth in the heart. (p. 127) Your reaſoning on this parable is not good: it does not favor your cauſe Our Lord's manifeſt deſign in this parable, is to point out the cauſes of the goſpel's not producing the fruit of a holy and good life in ſo many who hear it, viz. the luſts of their hearts which they will not part with; and to ſhew that if men are of a good and honeſt heart, they will, by the miniſtration of the goſpel to them, be rendered fruitful in the righteous fruits of a good and chriſtian life. He ſays nothing here how the heart is made good. Parables will not endure to be ſtrained beyond their manifeſt deſign, in ſupport of doctrines they are not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach or explain. Our Lord does not here ſay, the heart is made good by the influence of goſpel truth upon the mind, neither does he ſay the contrary, but only ſays the goſpel prevails to make the life truly good only in thoſe whoſe hearts are good. From hence you argue that the heart is made good without any influence of the word of God.—Doctor, by taking the ſame liberty in wandering from the deſign of the parable that you do, I can prove that the hearts of good men are <hi>naturally</hi> good, and reaſon full as well as you do; thus, the Lord ſays nothing about making the heart good, but rather intimates that when the ſower ſows his ſeed he finds ſome pieces of ground, ſome hearts, already good; and we know ſome parts of literal ground are naturally good. If you don't like my reaſoning and inference, you ought to diſlike your own, for it is leſs plauſible than mine. Doctor, if you would know how the hearts of men are made good and honeſt, you muſt look for an account of it in thoſe texts that ſpeak of this, not in thoſe that ſay nothing about it.</p>
            <p>Another text I oppoſed to this doctrine of yours, you thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce and remark upon.
<q>His ſecond evidence he introduces thus, Jeſus ſays to the <hi>unconverted</hi> Jews, if ye continue in my word—ye ſhall <hi>know</hi> the truth, And <hi>the truth</hi> ſhall make you
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012066_0026_0F89939CB86A3AF0"/>
free.</q>
(John 8.31, 32.)
<q>N. B. Mr. H. ſays theſe Jews were <hi>unconverted</hi>: but let us hear the text; Then Jeſus ſaid to thoſe Jews which <hi>believed on him,</hi> If ye continue in my word, &amp;c.</q>
(p. 126) This is all you ſay in the text of your diſcourſe</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, Doctor, after you had wrote this, you reflected that it is moſt evident, <hi>from the context,</hi> that theſe Jews were <hi>really unconverted,</hi> and unregenerate too; that their faith was far from being ſaving, was nothing more than a momentary, light perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Jeſus was their expected Meſſiah; which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to admit from an imagination that he was come to enrich them with worldly good things, and which they laid down again upon the ſpot, as ſoon as they perceived that he was like to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint theſe carnal hopes; and ſo, that I was right in calling them <hi>unconverted.</hi> Doctor, you know very well that <hi>ſuch</hi> was their faith, and <hi>ſuch</hi> their character; I preſume you do. You perceiv'd that what you ſaid, carried an intimation that you tho't theſe Jews were true believers, and that this would not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying: and therefore you added in a note,
<q>Whether theſe Jews were <hi>really</hi> converts or not, <hi>I will not determine.</hi>
               </q>
You can't but know that the context clearly determines they <hi>were not.</hi> You dare not ſay <hi>they were,</hi> in the face of ſuch deciſive evidence; and you would not ſay they <hi>were not,</hi> becauſe if you admitted this, you could not avoid the evidence the text gives in that your notions concerning regeneration, are falſe. So you gave much ſuch a prudent anſwer as the parents of the blind man gave,— 'Who hath opened his eyes, <hi>we know not.</hi>'—You think to get rid of this troubleſome text, by ſaying (and this is all you further ſay)
<q>However, this is certain, that Chriſt ſpeaks to them <hi>as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on him</hi>: and therefore theſe words are nothing to Mr. H's purpoſe.</q>
In this, Doctor, you implicitly acknowlege that if he had ſpoken to them <hi>as unconverted,</hi> they would have been much to my purpoſe. Well, but he did ſpeak to them as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and under the preſent dominion of vicious luſts, and points out to them the way and means by which they might be delivered from them, be regenerated.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Doctor, you tell us you
<q>maintain the neceſſity of a conſtant, diligent, careful attendance on all the means of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or</hi> of grace which God has appointed; and that the neglect of them is a grievous ſin, highly provoking to God, <hi>hazardous</hi> to the ſoul—and therefore preſs people to the diligent uſe of them,</q>
p. 129. I don't blame you for this.—I preſume you call them 'means of <hi>knowlege or</hi> of grace' <hi>upon deſign.</hi> For, upon your principles, they are not means of <hi>grace,</hi> if by grace is meant any
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012066_0027_0F89939D7627F3E0"/>
more than <hi>knowlege</hi>: and when knowlege is gained by the uſe of theſe means even the moſt that can be gained by the unregenerate, this is <hi>no means</hi> of <hi>further grace,</hi> and can have no poſſible influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as a means or inſtrument, in renewing and morally chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart; but it neceſſarily acts as a <hi>means</hi> of <hi>increaſing</hi> the <hi>enmity</hi> of the heart againſt God, and making it more like a devil. You, and all in your ſcheme, had better drop the word <hi>grace,</hi> and only call them means of increaſing ſuch knowlege as is a means of increaſing enmity, and making men worſe. You tell us you 'hold that the motives,' (i. e. by which God in the goſpel urges and draws men to be reconciled to him)
<q>are made <hi>effectual</hi> by a <hi>preceeding phyſical</hi> energy, new creating the heart or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the will in <hi>order</hi> that the motives may have a <hi>proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi>
               </q>
p. 113 Before this imagined phyſical change, in which knowlege or faith has no place as an inſtrument or means, you ſay,
<q>The clearer the light ſhines, the more ſenſibly will the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed ſinner's enmity exert itſelf</q>
p. 124. I told you in the dialogue that if this is the caſe, 'tis to no purpoſe to addreſs men in the apoſtle's words, <hi>We beſeech you to be reconciled to God; for,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. with a view to perſuade them to be reconciled. In your anſwer you implicitly allow the conſequence to be juſt, and ſay, the goſpel may anſwer that dreadful purpoſe mentïoned in Iſaiah, <hi>Hear ye indeed but underſtand not, ſee ye indeed, but perceive not.</hi> p. 125. i. e in plain language, it is adapted to make ſuch creatures as unrenewed men are, more wicked and miſerable, but not to make them better. Accordingly you reject, with ſcorn, the tho't of a man's being at all prepared or prediſpoſed to receive the kingdom of God, or to become a new creature, till the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he is made ſo, by <hi>phyſical</hi> power, by any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the goſpel &amp; Spirit of Chriſt upon him; but, on the contrary, teach that under the higheſt illuminations and influences of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace he remains wholly indiſpoſed to it, and is more at enmity to it than he was in his uninlightened ſtate, p. 114. Do you think, Doctor, Elias was ſent to prepare the way of the Lord, and make the people ready to receive him, by blowing up their enmity into a flame? Agreeably to your own doctrine you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the moſt enlightened and earneſt ſeekers of God's ſpecial grace, under the higheſt influences of common grace, as '<hi>devout phariſees</hi>;' and intimate that a Mary Magdalen, with all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in her, or publicans and harlots in the midſt of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, are as near to the kingdom of God, or as well diſpoſed to receive the renewing influence of the Spirit as theſe. See your 130th page. The phariſees, Doctor, were diſtinguiſhed from
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012066_0027_0F89939D7627F3E0"/>
harlots, and common, open, ignorant ſinners in theſe things, (1) They had more knowlege. (2) Greater enmity to God and his truth. (3) They were more devout in outward ſhew, and were more hypocritical. And your awakened, inlightened, earneſt, reforming ſeekers of God's mercy and grace, are, according to your doctrines and notion of them, like the phariſees in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects for which reaſon. I preſume, you, after Sandeman, give them the reſpectful &amp; encouraging title of <hi>devout phariſees.</hi> If this is their true character, you ought to place them in the rear, behind har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and open ſinners, who don't trouble themſelves about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for they are really worſe men, as the old phariſees were, (and ſo your doctrine ſays) and to tell them plainly, as our Lord does their predeceſſors, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before them, becauſe they are more eaſily bro't to repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ance. And when by your teachings and their diligent, earneſt endeavors in the uſe of means, in compliance with your exhortations, you have compleatly formed them <hi>devout phariſees,</hi> you ſhould ſay to them.
<q>Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</q>
Can you bear the application of your own doctrines?</p>
            <p>You ſay, Doctor, 'tis hazardous for men to neglect the means of grace. 'Tis indeed ſo: but according to your doctrine, 'tis in one view more hazardous to uſe than to neglect them. Your doctrines defeat your exhortations, and render them vain and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. If the people underſtood them clearly, and believed them fully, they would ſoon be reduced to abhor the offerings of the Lord, and take up the reſolution of the Jewiſh deſperadoes, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us, Doctor, that you 'preſs people to uſe the means of grace —becauſe this is the way in which God is pſeaſed to work, and out of which there is no reaſon to expect he ever will work this bleſſed change,' <hi>regeneration.</hi> This is the way: but if your doctrines were true, it could not be ſo. Have you ſo corrupted in yourſelf the right ſenſe of God as to imagine that he puts men upon a courſe of means and endeavors, which can have no better effect than to make them <hi>devout phariſees,</hi> and render them <hi>two fold more the children of hell</hi> than they were before, as an ordinarily neceſſary preliminary to his regenerating them? Do you think the beauty and moral excellency of God's character ſhines gloriouſly in ſuch a method of procedure? I preſume you and others have been lead to talk in ſuch an unworthy manner of the way of God with men, as conſequentially imputes folly and moral abſurdity to him, without reflecting ſeriouſly on the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012066_0028_0F89939E365FF3D0"/>
of your doctrines. I hope you will now reflect, and lay your hand on your mouth.</p>
            <p>I only add, that if you write again, I hope you will write with fairneſs, equity and honor. If in the ſame ſpirit as before, you may anſwer yourſelf; for you will be wholly unworthy the notice of any one elſe.—As I have pointed out to you ſome of your great offences againſt your brother, I preſume you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of them: and I now expect you will publicly retract the many falſe and injurious things you have teſtified againſt me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the churches and world. I expect this as what you <hi>owe</hi> to me <hi>by the will of God</hi>; as what you owe to the churches to whom you dedicated your injurious charges; as what you owe to the honor of your own character, which you have ſorely wounded while throwing dirt upon me; as what you owe to the honor of the goſpel.—If you do this in a chriſtian manner, I will as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily give you the due honor of it as the beſt friend you have in the world: who am,</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>DOCTOR, one thing which merits notice I have reſerved for this place. You mention this text as favoring your doctrine, and ſeem to triumph in it, as all in your ſcheme do, viz <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor 11.14, 15. On this you ſay,
<q>By <hi>natural man</hi> is evidently meant the unregenerate man. Now it is here affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this natural man, that he <hi>diſcerneth</hi> not the things of the Spirit of God.</q>
(No, Doctor, the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>receiveth</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In your quotation of the text you alſo threw out the apoſtle's word, <hi>receiveth,</hi> and took in the word <hi>diſcerneth,</hi> which ſounds more favorably for you. I hope, Doctor, you did it in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly.</note>)
<q>Whatever knowlege he may have, he <hi>diſcerns</hi> nothing of the <hi>ſpiritual glory</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of divine objects, i. e. he has <hi>no taſte for moral excellency.</hi> And the reaſon is given, viz. They are fooliſhneſs to him, i. e. in his view of them: and if ſo, they muſt be <hi>abhorred</hi>; for what appears <hi>fooliſh</hi>— muſt be hateful, in <hi>this view of it.</hi> Here then is a full proof that the natural man ſees no beauty in, but really loaths the things of God, and therefore has no taſte for moral excellency. q. e. p.</q>
(p. 88.) q. e. p. which was to be proved. Doctor, you have proved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that you don't underſtand the text at all. I obſerve two or three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The apoſtle ſays the natural man <hi>receiveth not,</hi> and <hi>cannot know</hi> the things of the Spirit of God. You allow he may know them, but ſay he can't diſcern their ſpiritual glory and beauty; i. e. has no taſte for moral excellency. Your propoſition is not the ſame in ſenſe with the apoſtle's, but a very different one. Yours may be falſe, and yet his be true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the <hi>things of the Spirit</hi> the apoſtle means thoſe things which belong to the <hi>goſpel,</hi> as its <hi>peculiars.</hi> You extend the ſenſe ſo as to comprehend all things of a moral nature; and ſo infer that
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012066_0029_0F89939EF652F798"/>
natural men have no taſte for moral excellency. But you put much more into your premiſes than the apoſtle will ſupport you in. Theſe are moral rules of God's moral government, viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf,</hi> and <hi>do to him whatſoever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>With what meaſure you meet it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> Do you think this text warrants you in ſaying, No unregenerate man can diſcern or taſte any moral fitneſs, beauty, or excellency in theſe moral rules? If you do, you are ſunk below the ſtandard of common ſenſe: if you do not, you muſt ſee your demonſtration fails, and ſo your q. e. p. remains yet to be proved: it will be your wiſdom never to attempt it again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In endeavoring to prove that natural men have no taſte for moral beauty and excellence, you have proved the contrary. You ſay,
<q>What appears <hi>foolliſh, muſt</hi> be <hi>hateful</hi> to the <hi>natural man,</hi> in this view of it.</q>
Why ſo, Doctor? You muſt anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moral fooliſhneſs is, in its own nature, hateful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, as moral wiſdom is of an amiable nature. Very true: and ſo men have a natural ſenſe or taſte for moral worth or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. If they ſaw the object in a true light they would love it: all that is wanting, according to this poſition of yours, is only to give the mind a juſt view of the object. This proves too much. A ſinful man may poſſibly ſee a particular diſpenſation of divine government to be <hi>wiſe,</hi> and yet hate and oppoſe it, from intereſted views, or thro' partial regard to his luſts, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with it.</p>
            <p>If we would gain a right underſtanding of this text, we ſhould carefully examine what the apoſtle here means, (1) by <hi>the things of the Spirit.</hi> (2) What by <hi>receiving</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> them. (3) What by their being <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> (4) What by the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man.</hi> When we have got all his ideas right in reſpect to theſe particulars, we ſhall ſee how, and whence it is that the natural man receiveth not, &amp;c. I preſume when you wrote your comment, you had none of them right. If we enquire wiſely concerning theſe things, I preſume we ſhall ſee clearly, (1) That by <hi>the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> the apoſtle intends the doctrines concerning Jeſus Chriſt, the grace of God towards man by him, and the ſalvation of thoſe that believe, thro the merit of his croſs: which doctrine concerning the croſs, he ſays, is a <hi>ſtumbling block to the</hi> (unbelieving) <hi>Jews, and fooliſhneſs to the</hi> (infidel) <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tho' it is ſeen to be the <hi>wiſdom and power of God,</hi> by thoſe that <hi>believe,</hi> and avails to their <hi>ſalvation.</hi> (See 1 Cor. 1.23, 24.) He ſtiles theſe things, <hi>The things that are freely given to us of God,</hi> context, ver. 12 He elſewhere calls theſe <hi>ſpiritual things.</hi> And the reaſon
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012066_0029_0F89939EF652F798"/>
of his calling them ſo, and, <hi>The things of the Spirit of God,</hi> is that this Spirit is the revealer and teacher of them, and a witneſs from God, and for Jeſus Chriſt, to the truth of them; without which ſupernatural teaching and witneſs, men could not have conceived any idea of theſe things, and have known them to be true and from God.
<q>As it is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things God hath prepared for them that love him.</q>
(i. e. any idea or knowlege of them, till God revealed them)
<q>But God hath revealed them unto us <hi>by his Spirit.</hi>—Now we have received—the Spirit that is of God, that we might <hi>know</hi> the things that are freely given to us of God,</q>
cont. ver. 9, 10, 12. See and compare the texts referred to below.<note n="*" place="bottom">John 16.13—15. Rev. 2.7. Rom. 15.27. 1 Cor. 9.11.—12.1.—14.37. Col. 1.9.—Spiritual underſtanding, i. e. a true underſtanding of thoſe things which are freely given to us of God, and revealed by his Spirit, and now written in his word.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> theſe things of the Spirit of God the apoſtle intends, knowing them to be true &amp; divine, knowing them to be from God and worthy of him, a divine method of ſaving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, full of wiſdom and grace; and receiving them <hi>as ſuch in faith,</hi> and thereupon embracing the chriſtian religion. To receive theſe things is the ſame in ſubſtance as to receive Jeſus Chriſt, and become diſciples to him. Obſerve the following texts, John 8.19. ch. 14. 7, 9, 10, 11. ch. 15.15, 21. ch. 17.7, 8, 25. Col. 1.25—27. 1 Joh. 4.16. Joh 7.17. ch. 8.32. Mat. 10.14, 41. Joh. 3.11. ch. 5.43. ch. 14.17. Acts 22.18. 1 Joh. 5.9. Joh. 1.11, 12. Acts 2.41. ch. 11.1. Col. 2.6. 1 Theſ. 2.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe ſpiritual things are <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> By diſcerning them the apoſtle means, ſo examining them as to diſcern them to be true and divine, from God, and worthy of him, ſo as to ſettle down in the belief of them. The Greek word <hi>anakrino</hi> ſignifies to examine and ſearch out a thing, in order to know what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is, and to judge. The apoſtle uſeth the word, 1 Cor. 4.4. where it is rendered <hi>judgeth,</hi> (as it is cont. ver. 15) <hi>I know nothing by myſelf,</hi> (i. e. whereby I am ſelf-condemned) <hi>but he that judgeth me</hi> (i. e. examineth and diſcerneth what I really am, and judgeth me according to the truth of my character) <hi>is the Lord.</hi> So the word <hi>diſcern</hi> is frequently uſed by our tranſlators, as in Gen. 27.23. <hi>He diſcerned him not.</hi> Iſaac, tho' he examined Jacob, yet did not diſtinguiſh him, but judged him to be Eſau. So in this text, to diſcern the things of the Spirit of God, is by examining to
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012066_0030_0F89939FB6766200"/>
diſcern them to be of God, true, divine and excellent, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them with judgment from the things of men, their cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deviſed fables.—Now the apoſtle ſays they are <hi>ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi> i. e. thus diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed only by the light, teaching, and teſtimony of the Spirit of God. This is evidently his meaning; and this is moſt true. For theſe ſupernatural doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines concerning our ſalvation by the croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, owe their very exiſtence, <hi>as truths,</hi> to the ſovereign good pleaſure of God's will; which could never be known to be ſuch as it is, but by his free revelation of it to men. This revelation he has made by his Spirit; and by his Spirit they are atteſted as truths of God: and men diſcern them to be ſuch, only in his light, through his teaching, and by admitting his teſtimony to their truth, as good and ſufficient evidence. On this teſtimony goſpel faith is founded. <hi>It is the Spirit that beareth witneſs—If we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater—He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf—He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son,</hi> 1 John 5.6, 9, 10.—Examine and compare the following texts, in which the ſame Greek word is uſed which is here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>diſcerned,</hi> viz. Luke 23.14. Acts 4.9. ch. 17.11. 1 Cor. 10.25, 27. ch 14.24. Acts 25.26. <hi>anakriſis,</hi> examination 1 Cor. 9.3. Acts 12.19. Acts 28.18.</p>
            <p>Let us next examine what the apoſtle here means by the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man.</hi> The Greek word here rendered <hi>natural,</hi> is <hi>pſuchikos,</hi> which is derived from <hi>pſuke,</hi> which ſignifies the ſoul natural to man as a living man: ſo the apoſtle ſays, <hi>Adam was made a living ſoul. Pſukeen Zoſan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leigh. in his <hi>Critica Saena,</hi> thus renders the word,
<q>pſuchikos animalis. Animalis ab anima, non ab animali.</q>
In the margin he quotes Beza thus,
<q>
                  <hi>pſuchikos anthropos,</hi> i e. homo non alta quam naturali animi luce preditus. A man that hath only <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> abilities and perfections.</q>
The apoſtle ſpeake of a <hi>natural</hi> body and a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> body, and oppoſes them to each other, juſt as be here does the natural and ſpiritual man.
<q>It is ſown <hi>ſoma pſuchikon,</hi> a <hi>natural</hi> body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body,</q>
1 Cor. 15.44. i. e The body is ſown in the ground ſuch as we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it by natural generation, without any ſupernatural improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or change, but it is raiſed a ſpiritual body, gloriouſly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the ſupernatural operation of the Spirit of God. So he ſays, the firſt man was made a living ſoul. When God breathed into him the breath of life, and endowed him with a living ſoul, furniſhed with its proper, natural faculties, capacities and paſſions,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012066_0030_0F89939FB6766200"/>
he was hereby conſtituted a compleat man. The work of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting man thus finiſhed, God <hi>immediately</hi> communicated his Spirit to him, and thereby breathed into his new form'd ſoul the breath of a ſpiritual life, ſuperadded to the natural; or in other words, by his ſupernatural illumination and influence, communicated the true knowlege of God, and awakened the new-c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eated ſoul <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly</hi> into filial and holy diſpoſitions and exerciſes towards his maker and father. Thus he was formed a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> man — But in the hour of temptation he rebelled againſt the light, and grieved the Spirit, and he forſook his defiled habitation; and ſo he became a mere <hi>natural man,</hi> dead to the ſpiritual life, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit. This he ſhewed ſufficiently by his fooliſhly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to hide himſelf among the trees from the preſence of the Lord, when he perceived him approaching.—This forfeited and loſt gift of the Spirit, was reſtored, and could be reſtored, only on the foot of a new diſpenſation of ſovereign grace, freely given thro' a reſpect to the ſacrifice and mediation of the Son of God, the deſtin'd Redeemer. This grace was now revealed to Adam, and given on this new foundation, to teach him this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural doctrine, and revive ſpiritual life in him, thro' faith of this new and ſurprizing diſcovery; and doubtleſs was thankfully received, and wro't in our firſt parents immediate repentance, while they ſtood before their <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>ſaviour</hi> And thus they once more became ſpiritual perſons, having received the Spirit of God, as given from the Father, by the Redeemer.—This reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red gift could not conſiſtently be conveyed to Adam's children, together with thoſe natural gifts which conſtitute them men, in the channel of natural generation; or, in other words, could not be connected with the gift of a living ſoul to his poſterity: For he is not the covenant head, from whom this ſupernatural gift of grace flows, but received it himſelf from Chriſt as <hi>his</hi> covenant head, as all his children muſt, if they ever partake of it.— Therefore the apoſtle, conſidering Adam, now fallen, in relation to his ſeed, repreſents him only as a <hi>natural man,</hi> deſtitute of the Spirit: for he can now convey no more to his natural ſeed, but the gifts which belong to human nature as ſuch, by which they are formed natural men. <hi>The firſt man Adam was made a living ſoul: the laſt Adam was made a quickning ſpirit</hi>—Made ſo to his ſeed, by the conſtitution of the new covenant. He quickens both ſoul and body; but firſt the ſoul, by giving his Spirit; by receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying of which, they are rendered ſpiritual men; are ſpiritual ſo far as they receive, believe and walk in his light, and no farther.—Theſe obſervations will lead us to a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012066_0031_0F8993A074461098"/>
of many other texts, particularly that John 3.3, 5, 6, and that we are examining.—By the <hi>ſpiritual man,</hi> the apoſtle here intends ſuch as have received the Spirit of God, given by Jeſus Chriſt, as a teacher; have received his revelation of the things of Chriſt, and believed them on the credit of his witneſs, and ſo ſet to their ſeal that God is true in what he has ſpoken and teſtified concerning his Son by his Spirit. He ſays, <hi>God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit</hi>—and <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God</hi>—and ſo <hi>We have the mind of Chriſt</hi>—and <hi>he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things.</hi> i e. ſo far as he has received the light which the Spirit gives, examining, he diſcerns and clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the truth and wiſdom of God from the fables and folly of men: As our Lord ſays, <hi>My ſheep hear my voice and follow me: but a ſtranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of ſtrangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think we can't now be in doubt what the apoſtle means by the <hi>natural man</hi>—He evidently intends ſuch as have not received the Spirit of God, as their teacher, in his revelation of the hidden things of God to men, and do not give credit to his ſupernatural witneſs to their truth; but are led and influenced in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning theſe things, <hi>by the ſpirit that is of the world,</hi> i e. act under the blaſing and blinding influence of the ſpirit of error and worldly luſts. Such do not receive theſe things as true and divine, neither can they know them to be ſo, ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the light and witneſs of the Spirit of God; for they are <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned,</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from falſe and fooliſh things, and perceived to be from God, only by that ſupernatural light which is communicated by the Spirit—Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith to the churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Jeſus Chriſt came to the Jewiſh people, as a teacher ſent from God to reveal the myſteries of his will, the Spirit of God ſpake to the people by him, and witneſſed to the truth of his miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and doctrine: but many received him not, but diſbelieved and rejected the witneſs of the Spirit. Theſe were natural men, who were led by the ſpirit of this world, and inſtead of receiving the Spirit of God, offering himſelf as their guide and teacher, they perverſely reſiſted him, as being ſtiffnecked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears. So the Spirit departed from them, and God gave them over to blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart. But ſome that heard did believe, and received Jeſus Chriſt; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him received his Spirit, and ſo became ſpiritual men. Such as were too ſtrongly attached to their luſts to be perſuaded
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012066_0031_0F8993A074461098"/>
to renounce them by the light and teaching of Jeſus Chriſt, and the given drawing influence and witneſs of his Spirit, and to come out of the world, after Chriſt, were, after proper trials to gain them, abandoned, and confirmed as children of this world. And ſo it muſt be; for ſuch cannot receive the Spirit of God— And to what purpoſe is it for the Lord to ſtand always knocking at their door, when they will not know his voice and open the door unto him? Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>The world cannot receive the Spirit of Truth, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi> John 14.17. They may, in ſome meaſure, ſee what his doctrine is, and ſee his works and witneſs by the goſpel revelation; but they don't ſee the Spirit of God in them, don't know that 'tis he that ſpeaks to them by the goſpel revelation, and bears witneſs to its truths, by theſe works; but fatally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in taking him for a falſe and deceiving ſpirit. Thus the perverſe Jews, who were wholly of this world, covetous, ambitious and ſenſual, ſaw the doctrine of Chriſt, and to what it tended, viz. to confound the luſts of this world, and deſtroy the works of the devil; and they ſaw the ſupernatural works by which the Spirit of God witneſſed to their truth, as from God; but they did not <hi>ſee him</hi> in all this. They plainly ſaw and acknowleged that a ſupernatural ſpirit attended upon Jeſus Chriſt, miniſtring to him, and witneſſing to what he ſaid: but they did not know that this was the Spirit of God, but imagined he was a deceiving ſpirit, and ſaid, 'He caſteth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils.' Thus they evaded the evidence, and could not receive the light and teſtimony of the Spirit of God witneſſing to his Son Jeſus.—But why could they not ſee and know this Spirit, in diſtinction from that of the devil? They ſaw the doctrine he witneſſed to, militated againſt their luſts, and condemned their indulgence of them, and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them with deſtruction, unleſs they gave them up: this they were obſtinately determined not to do: they therefore ſhut their eyes againſt the light, and wilfully ſet themſelves to oppoſe it; and becauſe they could evade the witneſs of the Spirit to its truth no other way, they ſaid, 'It is not the Spirit of God that bears witneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All obſtinately wicked men, who ſin on perverſely againſt the light and teſtimony of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt are in the ſame ſpirit of this world: all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it in the degree of its ſtrength and malignity—This, Doctor, and not want of natural capacity to ſee moral excellence, and a natural, inwro't, incurable hatred to it, is the true cauſe why ſuch men receive not the things of the Spirit of God, and cannot know and approve them as of God, but eſteem them as fooliſhneſs.</p>

               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:012066_0032_0F8993A13397FA30"/>The concluſion of the whole matter is this; Paul ſays to this purpoſe, Men can't know the goſpel or doctrine concerning Jeſus Chriſt to be of God and worthy of God, unleſs they receive the Spirit of God as the revealer of theſe things, and admit his witneſs to them as being of God, not of men, as a true and divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; that if they, as biaſſed by laſts, refuſe and reject him, there is no other way of diſcerning them to be of God; but they, as led by the ſpirit of the world, will account them fabulous and fooliſh: (This has been verified throughout the whole world, from that day to this) He ſays, on the other hand, That if men receive the Spirit, by which God revealed theſe things to men, as of God, and credit his teſtimony, they may, by his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, know them to be of God, and, in his light, diſtinguiſh them from the things of men, and diſcern their divine excellence and glory.—You, on the contrary, ſay to this purpoſe, That no ilumination, teaching and teſtimony of the Spirit which he can give to men, can enable them to diſcern any moral or ſpiritual excellency and glory in theſe things, and at all diſpoſe them to receive the truth in faith and love, unleſs the Spirit firſt creates a new guſt or faculty of taſte in them, by a phyſical operation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light.—Doctor you are very unlucky in the choice of this text: it clearly condemns your doctrine.
