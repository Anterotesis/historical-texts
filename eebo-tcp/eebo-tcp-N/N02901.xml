            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

left their firſt Love; though there are good things ſtill among them, theſe will not attone or excuſe for the want of Love, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſignifies to the Phariſees. <hi>Luk</hi> 11.42. <hi>But we unto you Phariſees, for ye tithe, mint and rue, and all manner of herbs, and paſs over judgment &amp; the love of God.

            <p>There are ſeveral Reaſons why GOD or JESUS CHRIST is Offended with Churches when it is ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe 'tis very diſhonouring to God, when Churches do leave their firſt or former Love to him, or decay in it.</hi> GOD is the only ſuitable Object of ſupream Love, He only being an abſolute &amp; an infinite Good, <hi>There is none good but one, that is God,</hi> Mat 19.17. And to love the Lord our God with all the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the proper and commanded Acknowlegement of his Excellency &amp; Goodneſs. Such a love to God puts the Crown on his head (if we may, ſo ſpeak.) It proclaims him the beſt good, Exalteth him above all. And tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there cannot be in a Creature, love to God, proportioned &amp; adequate to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Worthineſs of the Object; yet if it be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003473_0010_0FF8491CB26DB6B8"/>
proportioned to the Powers &amp; Capacities of the Agent, it gives great glory to him. And there are the ſame Reaſons always remaining and binding perſons thus to Praiſe the Lord. What reaſon there ever was for any perſon to love God with all their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is to continue their love to him, in the ſame degree from day to day and for ever. He is immutably good, his Excellencies do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay his Beauties do not wither. And when perſons leave their love to him or decay in it, they treat him, as tho' either it was through Miſtake they ſet their love upon him, and that he was not a Being of ſuch Worth as they did expect he had been; or that if he was ſo, yet now thoſe Excellencies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed or loſt; Either of which is diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and ſo offenſive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe they who do ſo, give God's glory to ſome other.</hi> They who do not ſet their chief Love upon God, place it on ſomething elſe. All have their Treaſure their chief good. Some are lovers of Pleaſures more than lovers of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. Some beſtow that love which is God's due, on their Wealth, and therein are guilty of Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. The god of Epicures is their belly, <abbr>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi>
               </abbr> 3.19. And this is offenſive to God, who will not endure his glory ſhould be given to another, nor his praiſe to any creature.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:003473_0010_0FF8491CB26DB6B8"/>
3. <hi>Becauſe it is a tranſgreſſion of his Command and Law.</hi> God's Law extends to the inner man; And God who is a Spirit and ſeeth the actions of the Soul as well as thoſe of the Body, doth eſpecially inſiſt upon the inner man's being in ſubjection to him. Prov. 23.26. <hi>My Son, give me thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. That they who leave their love to God, or decay in it, they tranſgreſs the Law; and this being in a main point, yea the very ſum of all it is a virtual tranſgreſſion of the whole Law, &amp; juſtly &amp; greatly offenſive to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Becauſe in withdrawing their Affections from God, they deal Perfidiously with him.</hi> He Requireth and Commandeth that men love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they cleave to him. He doth not offer himſelf to any to be their God, nor doth he offer to take any to be his People upon any other Terms, than that, They love him with all their heart, &amp;c. and be his, wholly his, and his for ever. Deut. 11.22. <hi>For if ye ſhall diligently keep all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments which I command you to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him.</hi> And hence they who take God to be their God, they do Engage this, if they take him as he offereth himſelf: And when they do leave or decay in their love to God, they deal deceitfully &amp; falſly in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003473_0011_0FF8491E4143D270"/>
his Covenant. This is the Male in the Flock, which when perſons have Vowed, it is perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to withold, and turn God off with that which compared therewith, is but mean; yea, without this is bat a corrupt thing. One faith, <q>External Worſhip without the Internal, is little better than Mockery and a ſolemn Affronting the Divine Majeſty.</q>

The ſetting up of theſe Churches, was the day of the Eſpouſal of this Land. And the firſt Miniſters &amp; Members of theſe Churches, were many of them, ſuch as had paſſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And they were perſons full of Zeal and Warmth in Religion and Concern for God's Glory; and gave great Evidence of it, in leaving a pleaſant &amp; plentiful Land, (where ſome of them had fair Eſtates and good Friends, and might have lived in Eaſe and Fulneſs, and have hoped for Honour &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, could they have complied with the Times,) and many worldly Advantages, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelves to the Dangers of a vaſt Ocean, the hardſhips &amp; miſeries of a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, very deſtitute then of the Comforts of Life, and full of bloody &amp; deceitful Heathen; Principally to enjoy the Goſpel in the purity of its inſtitutions. And our falling from the Zeal &amp; Love that was in the firſt Founders of theſe Churches, may be juſtly Charged upon us as leaving our firſt Love. Though
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003473_0012_0FF84921492F8C18"/>
there may be good things among us, they will not attone for the decay of Love. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaketh to <hi>theſe Churches,</hi> as well as to Epheſus in this Epiſtle, and letteth us know, that the decay of Love is offenſive to God.</p>
            <p>USE, II. Of EXAMINATION.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us Examine and Enquire, Whether it be not ſo with us, that our Love is decayed, and the tokens of it apparent?</hi> Don't the generality of Profeſſors among us favour of Vanity, Worldlineſs, Pride, and diſcover great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtfulneſs of God? How little of that Seriouſneſs, Humility and Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that was in ſome of our Predeceſſors? They favoured the things that be of God, were full of Religion in their Diſcourſes, whereby they Edified one another. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves as Strangers &amp; Pilgrims on the Earth, hat were ſeeking a better Country, that is an Heavenly. Their Solicitude was not ſo much where they might get moſt and beſt Land, but to enjoy the Worſhip and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God and an Edifying Miniſtry. But, alas now! Is not the gold become dim? Do not the generality of Profeſſors favour of Earth? Their Diſcourſes are Vain &amp; Worldly, ſeldom any thing of Religion in them, or any thing tending to Edifie them as Chriſtians.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003473_0012_0FF84921492F8C18"/>
Do they not diſcover that their main Thoughtfulneſs is about this World? what they ſhall Eat and Drink and how they ſhall get Eſtates; and that they are but little thoughtful of Eternity, or concerned about Securing the Kingdom of Heaven, which ſhould be the firſt ſought, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. Is not the Word of God ſet light by? Is there not a great prevailing of Ignorance in ſpiritual things? Is not the Bible grown into much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, and but little profit to ſome that they have it in their own Languange? Are there not many of good Natural Abilities, that are groſly Ignorant, even in the great &amp; neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Things of Religion? The Country im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth in Knowlege and Skill in Worldly buſineſs, but in Religious Knowlege, doth it not manifeſtly decay? How little ambition doth there ſeem to be or pairs, to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Religion? Do not many ſeem to be for ſo much Religion only as will anſwer their Carnal ends? They will do ſomething in it that they may not loſe their intereſt with the Religious; but will not be Strict, Thorough &amp; Zealous, left they ſhould break with the Carnal ſort. Are there not many that Neglect the Worſhip of God, or are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady in it, in Publick in Families, in Secret, and more that perform it in a formal heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs manner? Don't many purſue and poſſeſs

the World as the main thing, and attend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as tho' they attended it not; having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power of it? 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. Do not many diſcover a very light regard to Religion and the Worſhip &amp; Ordinances of God, in the ſetling their abodes? The Concern is not as heretofore to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves as to the Worſhip of God, &amp; get under an Edifying Miniſtry; but where they can have moſt Land, and be under beſt advantages to get Money; tho' it lay them under never ſo great diſadvantages as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the good of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Is there not much Iniquity prevailing and are not the generality of Profeſſors eaſie under it? They can hear men Curſe and Swear, take the Name of God in vain, uſe filthy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, can ſee Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is no burden or grief to them, as it was to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.21. Such filthy Converſation from day to day, is no exerciſe or vexation to their Souls, as 'twas to his, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.8. They have no horror takes hold of them becauſe of the wicked that forſake Gods Law. But <hi>Gallio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> they care for none of theſe things. They pretend, it may be, that each one muſt look to themſelves, 'tis none of their buſineſs, or that they be not Grand-jury-men: They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard the perſonal good of their Nei'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, tho' there be a plain Command for it.

Lev. 19 17 <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy hear: thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Nei'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him.</hi> (How many will Backbite, and tell others Faults, &amp; Blaſt their Names, but a faithful dealing out of Love, to do them good, how little of it?) Nor are they concerned for the Publick, leſt that ſhould ſuffer thro' Sins being tolerated. And if any are Conſcientious to deal with Sinners, and teſtify againſt Sin; are not they who are dealt with and others alſo, apt to Reproach 'em as Medling, Preciſe, Malicious? Do they not hate him that Rebuketh in the Gate? <hi>Amos.</hi> 5.10. Are there not ſome Profeſſors who will reſent it, if any ſpeak ſlightly of themſelves, or families, that can hear the Churches they belong to, and the Religion they Profeſs, Reproached &amp; Reviled, and the God they own Diſhonoured, and his Name taken in Vain, and not be offended at it, yea Careſs them that do it?</p>

Yea are there not many full of Objections againſt and murmurings at, the neceſſary Annual Expence for the Support of Publick and Religious things? And doth not Prophaneſs and Immorality, increaſe among us? Doth not Iniquity abound? which is an evidence of Love is waxing Cold and alſo a cauſe of it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12. For evil Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is Contagious, one Sinner deſtroyeth much good. Do not Drunkenneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, thoſe two Vices which are ſaid to take away the heart, greatly prevail?

            </p>
            <p>And is there not abundance of Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Unmercifulneſs among us? Injuſtice in Prices, delays and diſhoneſty in Payments, Deceit, Falſeneſs, and Unfaithfulneſs in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, Contracts and Betruſtments, griping Uſary, Evading and Baffling the Laws made for the Security of men form that Oppreſſion?

a multitude of Law Suits, Men ready to take one another by the Throat, ſaying, Pay me what thou Oweſt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.

            <p>And doth not Pride greatly prevail, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf many ways among us?

And how ſad is it that there is ſo much Contention about things that concern Religion, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly about Setting of Meeting Houſes, and Setling of Miniſters?

If you go on to withdraw your hearts &amp; love from him, he will remove your Candleſticks; he will take away the Privileges &amp; Being of a Church from you. There needs no other Epiſtle from heaven to aſſure you of this, than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Text is, <hi>He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works; or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, &amp; will remove thy candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi>

The Lord your God is a Holy God &amp; a Jealous God, He will not forgive you if you perſiſt in this Sin; He will not bear to be ſlighted, He will give a Bid of Divorce to ſuch a People, as he did to backſliding <hi>Iſrael.

            <p>It was foretold, there would be in the laſt days Scoffers, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.
