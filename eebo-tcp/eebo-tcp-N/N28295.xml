            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is a very Å¿olemn and affecting Å¿cene, which is preÅ¿ented to our view, in this portion of Å¿acred hiÅ¿tory. Though a long Å¿eries of ages has paÅ¿Å¿ed away Å¿ince it took place, it cannot, yet, be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively reviewed, without exciting in the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind, and feeling heart, many Å¿erious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tender emotions. With every other part of Å¿cripture, it was doubtleÅ¿s recorded "for our learning," for our inÅ¿truction and improvement. It Å¿hews, particularly, in a Å¿triking point of light, how important to a community, are the life and Å¿ervices of a great and good prince; or of a perÅ¿on holding a primary place in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his countryâ€”and in that elevated Å¿tation, diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by his Å¿uperior talents, integrity, and public Å¿pirit: and how heavy, and afflictive, is the loÅ¿s Å¿uÅ¿tained by a nation, when Å¿uch a ruler and benefactor is "taken from its head," by the awful Å¿troke of death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037715_0003_100ED3F18DC75FD0"/>
To theÅ¿e intereÅ¿ting reflections, we are unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably led by the conÅ¿ideration of the paÅ¿Å¿age before usâ€”while we here behold the whole JewiÅ¿h nation, with one conÅ¿ent, and as by one inÅ¿tantaneous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulÅ¿e, aÅ¿Å¿uming the aÅ¿pect, and exhibiting the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the deepeÅ¿t affliction and mourning, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the death of their late king JoÅ¿iah; who was one of the worthieÅ¿t and beÅ¿t, that ever reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them; and whoÅ¿e life, from his earlieÅ¿t years, had been employed, under the influence of the pureÅ¿t and nobleÅ¿t principles, in promoting the temporal and religious intereÅ¿ts of his people.</p>
            <p>This good king was yet in the midÅ¿t of his days, or in the vigor of his age, when it was his lot to receive a fatal wound, in a battle, to which he was probably led, by the terms of his alliance with the king of IÅ¿rael, who was then tributary to the king of Babylon; and therefore bound to engage on the Å¿ide of that monarch, in the war which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced againÅ¿t him by the king of Egypt. Of this wound JoÅ¿iah died, immediately after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to JeruÅ¿alem: and thus the flattering, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently well founded hopes of his people, for a much longer continuance of his reign, and of the multiplied bleÅ¿Å¿ings which they derived from it, were Å¿uddenly terminated in the moÅ¿t gloomy and painful diÅ¿appointment.</p>
            <p>An event, Å¿o calamitous, might well be expected to diffuÅ¿e the moÅ¿t afflicting Å¿enÅ¿ations through the body of the nation; for whoÅ¿e welfare he had Å¿hewn Å¿o early, Å¿o zealous, and Å¿o conÅ¿tant a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Accordingly, the Å¿acred hiÅ¿torian here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms usâ€”that "All Judah and JeruÅ¿alem mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for JoÅ¿iah:" The inhabitants of every part of the country, concurring with thoÅ¿e of the capital

city, the place of the royal reÅ¿idence, in every be coming affecting demonÅ¿tration of Å¿orrow, under this heavy national calamity.</p>
            <p>It is added, that Jeremiah the prophet, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly lamented for JoÅ¿iah. This venerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as it became a Å¿ervant of God, under that peculiar Å¿acred character which he Å¿uÅ¿tained, was penetrated with the deepeÅ¿t grief for the loÅ¿s of a prince, whoÅ¿e pious cares, and indefatigable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were eÅ¿pecially directed to the advancement of the cauÅ¿e of religion and virtue: a cauÅ¿e with which the peace and proÅ¿perity, and all the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿ts of every community, as well as of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, are eÅ¿Å¿entially and inÅ¿eparably connected. And it is alÅ¿o mentioned, as another memorable circumÅ¿tance of this national mourning for JoÅ¿iah, that it was long perpetuated, by the inÅ¿titution of certain Å¿olemn Å¿ervices, including, particularly, Å¿ome elegiac compoÅ¿itions Å¿et to plaintive muÅ¿ic, in commemoration of an event, Å¿o mournful in its nature, and Å¿o afflicting in its conÅ¿equences.</p>
            <p>In the hiÅ¿tory of mankind we Å¿hall often find a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Å¿imilarity of events and circumÅ¿tances, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing in the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tant countries &amp; periods of time.</p>
            <p>With this memorable mourning of the JewiÅ¿h nation, for the loÅ¿s of their eminently worthy and amiable JoÅ¿iah;â€”how Å¿triking is the reÅ¿emblance, that appears in the univerÅ¿al, unfeigned mourning, now exhibited by the American people, for the loÅ¿s of their great, and excellent, and beloved WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON; whoÅ¿e life was one of the moÅ¿t va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable bleÅ¿Å¿ings of a beneficent Providence to his country, and whoÅ¿e death is juÅ¿tly lamented, as a great national affliction.</p>
            <p>When the man, whom God in his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

not heÅ¿itate, with the aid of Å¿uch inÅ¿truments of their will, to invade the rights, to Å¿eize the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, to Å¿acrifice the lives of their fellow-men, in any extent which they might think expedient, or find practicable, to the accompliÅ¿hment of their own baÅ¿e and criminal purpoÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>But as the great Ruler of the univerÅ¿e, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned and formed mankind for the Å¿ocial Å¿tate; and has made their common mutual Å¿afety and welfare depend, in a great meaÅ¿ure, upon that union and order which conÅ¿titute the Å¿trength and beauty of Å¿ociety;â€”Å¿o he conÅ¿tantly exerciÅ¿es a Å¿ecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol over all human inclinations, projects, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes:â€”And having the hearts of all men in his hands, he holds all their tumultuous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, raging appetites, and furious paÅ¿Å¿ions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Å¿ubject to that irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible authority and power, by which, when he pleaÅ¿es, he commands the Å¿tormy winds into a calm; and Å¿ays to the Å¿wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling boiÅ¿terous Å¿ea, "Hitherto Å¿halt thou come, but no farther; and here Å¿hall thy proud waves be Å¿tayed." In his government of mankind, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and for the accompliÅ¿hment of his wiÅ¿e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns, relating to them, he generally uÅ¿es Å¿ome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible means and Å¿ubordinate agency, which have a natural fitneÅ¿s to bring about the worthy ends that he has propoÅ¿ed. In this view, he employs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently the inÅ¿titutions of religion, and the miniÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his word, among the people, to whom he has been pleaÅ¿ed to grant the diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and benefits of Divine Revelation.

            <p>Thusâ€”while the Supreme Governor of Nations, Å¿ometimes elevates men of Å¿trong natural abilities, connected with the moÅ¿t vile, and profligate moral principles, to great power,â€”and then uÅ¿es them as the Å¿word in his hand, for chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ing any wicked and rebellious people, whom he determines to puniÅ¿h;â€”he alÅ¿o, at his pleaÅ¿ure, calls forth, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to exalted Å¿tations of authority and truÅ¿t, men of Å¿uperior talents and worthy character; and by their inÅ¿trumentality Å¿hields or delivers a people, whom he chuÅ¿es to favour, from thoÅ¿e violences or grievances, with which they may be menaced or oppreÅ¿Å¿ed.â€”By their friendly and Å¿ucceÅ¿sful agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the nation, or community, with the care of whoÅ¿e intereÅ¿ts they are entruÅ¿ted, whether in the capacity of military commanders, or civil magiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, is reÅ¿cued from the galling yoke of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageâ€”from the dreadful Å¿tate of anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion: or from the final diÅ¿Å¿olution and utter ruin, to which it might otherwiÅ¿e be reduced, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedneÅ¿s of many of its own members; or by the all graÅ¿ping ambition, and inÅ¿atiable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of foreign hoÅ¿tile nations and potentates.</p>
            <p>Such are the men, whom "the Lord MoÅ¿t Highâ€”Who is the great King over all the earth," often "gives to a people, according to his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercies, to be" under himÅ¿elf, "their Å¿avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;" to be "the miniÅ¿ters of God, for" eminent "good," to them in a Å¿tate of peace; and his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en

So far as any Å¿yÅ¿tem of government is adapted to unite a people in a Å¿tate of order and peaceâ€”to enforce the principles and rules of juÅ¿tice among themâ€”and to Å¿ecure them from the miÅ¿chievous deÅ¿igns of their enemies, it is Å¿anctioned by the approbation of Heaven; and its eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment is to be regarded, as

But for directing well, and applying efficaciouÅ¿ly, the powers of the beÅ¿t conÅ¿titution of government, it is obvious, that none are properly qualified, but thoÅ¿e who poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s peculiar abilities for the management of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs: And it is equally certain, that on the moral principles, which direct their conduct, the welfare of the community very much depends. Whether they are charged with the adminiÅ¿tration of the civil, or military affairs of their country; having its great intereÅ¿ts committed to their care, and its reÅ¿ources placed in their hands; they are at once laid under peculiar obligations, and enjoy peculiar advantages, for Å¿tudying and promoting the public good; and when poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of thoÅ¿e uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted qualities of the head and the heart, which diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiÅ¿h great and worthy rulers and commandersâ€”the public good will be the favorite object of their regard and purÅ¿uitâ€”and in the ordinary courÅ¿e of things, will be greatly advanced by their agency.

            <p>The deÅ¿irable ends, which their high qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and patriotic labours are thus adapted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿h, are further promoted by the powerful engaging influence of their great example. For "as the going forth of the Å¿un, is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof;" Å¿o the examples of great and good men, moving in exalted Å¿pheres of public Å¿ervice, and uÅ¿efulneÅ¿s, diffuÅ¿e their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening and enlivening beams, through the wide extent of the land in which they bear rule; and have an happy tendency to Å¿timulate and allure the other members of the community, in Å¿ubordinate Å¿tations, to imitate their conduct, in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of a public Å¿pirit, and in the practice of whatÅ¿oever things are pious and juÅ¿tâ€”generous

            <p>Highly favored indeed, are the people to whom the Lord gives Å¿uch rulers and commanders, as his choÅ¿en agents, for communicating and Å¿ecuring to them Å¿o many precious bleÅ¿Å¿ings of his favorâ€”and Å¿o rich a portion of national honor and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s!</p>

            <p>The obÅ¿ervations which have been Å¿uggeÅ¿ted, will, it is believed, admit of a juÅ¿t and forcible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the preÅ¿ent caÅ¿e of our own nation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that very afflicting diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which has bereaved us, of a general and Å¿tateÅ¿man, who, in the expreÅ¿Å¿ive and emphatical language of our HouÅ¿e of RepreÅ¿entatives in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s,â€”"was the firÅ¿t in warâ€”the firÅ¿t in peace, and the firÅ¿t in the affections of his country."</p>

            <p>Our lately univerÅ¿ally eÅ¿teemed, and now univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ally lamented WASHINGTON, in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of all his excellencies and honors, was but a mortal man. Thanks be to God for the great qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which he was diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hedâ€”for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant public Å¿ervicesâ€”and for the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his eminently valuable and uÅ¿eful life!â€”And now, bleÅ¿Å¿ed be God, that the hopes of our country are not buried in the Å¿ame tomb with his venerable duÅ¿t; but that to HimÅ¿elf, who is "the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿or of all that is in the heaven and in the earthâ€”whoÅ¿e is the greatneÅ¿s, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majeÅ¿ty, who reigns over all, and who is the Å¿ame, yeÅ¿terday, to day, and for ever"â€”we may Å¿till look up as "our light and our Å¿alvation," "for leaders and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people," for the preÅ¿ervation of our independence and liberties, government and laws, order and peace, and the perpetuity and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our national, as well as perÅ¿onal Å¿afety, proÅ¿perity, and happineÅ¿s!</p>

chriÅ¿tian duty. For our fellow-men, in every nation of the earth, in every branch of the great family of mankind, we Å¿hould conÅ¿tantly pray; that they may enjoy the advantages of wiÅ¿e and good governments and lawsâ€”and the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of the goÅ¿pel of the great Redeemer of fallen men, in its unclouded light, uncorrupted purity, and Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power;â€”"that the people who delight in war may be Å¿catteredâ€”that the wickedneÅ¿s of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may come to an endâ€”that the juÅ¿t may be eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed,"â€”and that the cauÅ¿e of truth and righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and of genuine liberty, civil and religious, involving all the great intereÅ¿ts of communities and individuals, may prevail and triumph, univerÅ¿ally, through the world.</p>
            <p>For our country, eÅ¿pecially, we Å¿hould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually prayâ€”that the great Governor of nations, our guardian God, and the God of Å¿alvation, may be pleaÅ¿ed to forgive our multiplied follies and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, by which we are daily forfeiting his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and provoking his judgments;â€”"to turn away every token of his anger from us, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us with the favor which he bears to his choÅ¿en and peculiar people"â€”to Å¿ecure to us the full and uninterrupted poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of our perÅ¿onal and national rights and privileges; in the enjoyment of order, harmony, and tranquillity at home, and of peace and honor abroadâ€”to proÅ¿per all ranks and claÅ¿Å¿es of the inhabitants of our land, in their Å¿everal Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and lawful, worldly purÅ¿uitsâ€”and "to viÅ¿it us with" the infinitely more precious bleÅ¿Å¿ings of "his Å¿piritual and everlaÅ¿ting Å¿alvation."</p>
            <p>"For all in authority over us," and entruÅ¿ted with the care of our national intereÅ¿ts, in public Å¿tations, we ought more particularly to pray, that they may
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037715_0022_100EF24B10D6C698"/>
be "wiÅ¿e and able men, Å¿uch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouÅ¿neÅ¿s," and zealous, active, reÅ¿olute, and Å¿tedfaÅ¿t in their concern for, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uit of the public good. ConÅ¿idering how mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, arduous, and perplexing, are the cares of governmentâ€”how peculiarly Å¿trong and preÅ¿Å¿ing are the temptations, with which men, in exalted Å¿tations of truÅ¿t and power, are continually Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded; and how many, and great, are the evils or benefits, which may reÅ¿ult to the community from their ill or good conduct, in the important places which they occupyâ€”in the elevated Å¿pheres wherein they moveâ€”we Å¿hould, from a tender Å¿ympathy for them, and a prudent regard to our own intereÅ¿ts, pray continually for our rulersâ€”"that the Lord may give them a wiÅ¿e and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding heart, to diÅ¿cern between good and evil, and to go out and in before a great people," with diÅ¿cretion and fidelity, with unÅ¿ullied honor and good Å¿ucceÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>And thus are we, by a Å¿pecial, Å¿olemn voice of Divine Providence, called to pray for our country, at the preÅ¿ent juncture, while mourning the recent death,â€”of our late illuÅ¿trious General and PreÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and to pray, more particularly, for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and venerable Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿or in the preÅ¿idency of the Unionâ€”that he may be divinely aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted, in Å¿uÅ¿taining the increaÅ¿ed weight of anxious care, which is devolved upon him, by the loÅ¿s of Å¿o early, able, and experienced an aÅ¿Å¿ociate, in the great cauÅ¿e of Americaâ€”and that he may Å¿teadily and firmly, proceed to tread in the Å¿ame Å¿teps of wiÅ¿dom, virtue, and honor, by which the great and excellent WASHINGTON conducted his country;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037715_0023_100EF24D8A00CE68"/>
to the preÅ¿ent dignified and enviable rank, which it holds among the nations of the earth.â€”</p>
            <p>Finally;â€”</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let the conÅ¿ideration of this very affecting inÅ¿tance of mortality, which has filled the heart of our nation with Å¿orrow and mourning, be improved to awaken and engage us all, to a faithful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent diÅ¿charge of the duties of our reÅ¿pective Å¿tations; and to a Å¿eaÅ¿onable preparation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant watchfulneÅ¿s for the order of God, which Å¿hall diÅ¿miÅ¿s us from all our employments here, to a Å¿tate of righteous and everlaÅ¿ting retribution in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world.</p>
            <p>To act, as if we thought that we were bound by no obligations, to extend our views or regards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ourÅ¿elves; but had a right to employ our time and powers, merely to Å¿erve our own Å¿elfiÅ¿h purpoÅ¿es, would be very diÅ¿graceful to our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as men and citizens. Much more reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then, muÅ¿t Å¿uch conduct appear to be, in thoÅ¿e who bear the name of ChriÅ¿tiansâ€”when it is view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the light of the goÅ¿pelâ€”when it is conÅ¿idered as in direct contradiction to thoÅ¿e benevolent and refined principles of the religion of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us, which require us "to love our neighbour as ourÅ¿elves"â€”"to rejoice with them that rejoiceâ€”to weep with them that weep"â€”"to bear one another's burthens"â€”"and as we have ability and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to do good to all around us."</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, reflect and conÅ¿ider what the Lord our God and Saviour requires of us, in our Å¿everal Å¿tationsâ€”and endeavour to occupy, with the talents which he has committed to us, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by which his great name may be moÅ¿t glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037715_0024_100EF24F1230E410"/>
and the beÅ¿t intereÅ¿ts of our fellow men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our own, moÅ¿t effectually advanced.</p>
            <p>FATHERSâ€”Let not the reÅ¿idue of your Å¿trength be wholly Å¿pent in that caÅ¿e and inactivity, which, to declining years, uÅ¿ually appear moÅ¿t inviting.â€”If you are yet living to yourÅ¿elves, and for this world<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>â€”Å¿urely it is high time that you begin to live to the Lord, and for eternity.</p>
            <p>If, in the courÅ¿e of a life of chriÅ¿tian faith, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and virtue,â€”you are Å¿erving and honoring the adorable Author of your being and redemption, and purÅ¿uing the great ends of your rational exiÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,â€”"Be not weary in well doing, but hold on your way, and hold out to the end,â€”and Å¿till go from Å¿trength to Å¿trength, till you enter into that everlaÅ¿ting reÅ¿t, which remaineth for the people of God." And remember, that it particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you, to teach the riÅ¿ing generation their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, to their neighbour, and themÅ¿elvesâ€”to admoniÅ¿h them of the viciÅ¿Å¿itudes, the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the dangers, to which they may be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in the untried journey of lifeâ€”and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the counÅ¿els of matured wiÅ¿dom, and long experience, by the engaging influence of the good example, which you will exhibit, while you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to walk with Å¿teady Å¿teps, and cheerful hopes, in "the path of the juÅ¿t; which is as the Å¿hining light" of the morning, "Å¿hining more and more unto the perfect day."</p>
            <p>YOUNG MENâ€”Let not the flower of your ageâ€”the vigour of your faculties, be diÅ¿honored and waÅ¿ted in the indulgence of unmanly Å¿lothâ€”of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, diÅ¿Å¿ipating amuÅ¿ementsâ€”or of for did, criminal, and deÅ¿tructive pleaÅ¿ures: But Å¿tudy to furniÅ¿h your minds with uÅ¿eful knowledge, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

and Å¿trengthen the diÅ¿poÅ¿itions and habits of purity and temperance,â€”of regularity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genceâ€”of generoÅ¿ity and economy. "Remember your Creator and Redeemer in the days of your youth:" ChooÅ¿e and purÅ¿ue "the ways of wiÅ¿dom, which are the only ways of pleaÅ¿antneÅ¿s, and peace: Fulfil the obligations of every relation, which you Å¿uÅ¿tain, with reÅ¿pectful attention and affectionâ€”with Å¿trict fidelity and becoming cheerfulneÅ¿s; and let your breaÅ¿ts glow with a laudable, ardent am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to act a worthy partâ€”and become the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and bleÅ¿Å¿ings of Å¿ociety, in your day.</p>
            <p>Let it be the concern of every one of us, in Å¿hort, that we may feel the power, and manifeÅ¿t the influence of thoÅ¿e Å¿acred, heavenly principles of the goÅ¿pel, which will bear down every Å¿elfiÅ¿h, contracted diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of our degenerate nature, and elevate and enlarge our hearts, in the moÅ¿t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent deÅ¿iresâ€”and prompt us to correÅ¿pondent, worthy efforts, to be as uÅ¿eful as poÅ¿Å¿ible, in our reÅ¿pective Å¿pheresâ€”to contribute Å¿omething to the welfare of the civil community, with which we are connected, and to the extenÅ¿ion of the bounds, and the advancement of the glory of the Redeemer's kingdom of grace in the world.</p>
            <p>And by the great example of the diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed friend and benefactor of his country, whoÅ¿e loÅ¿s we now deploreâ€”let us all be taught and animated to cheriÅ¿h that public Å¿pirit, which Å¿hone Å¿o conÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouÅ¿ly in himâ€”and which will determine us to maintain for ourÅ¿elves, and to tranÅ¿mit to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, that Å¿hall come after us, the national in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and the precious liberties involved in it, for which he Å¿o nobly foughtâ€”and which he guarded with Å¿o vigilant an eye, and faithful a hand,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037715_0026_100EF25301F77E88"/>
â€”and to exert our influence, as far as it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, for preÅ¿erving and Å¿upporting religion and morality, order and peace, in our land,â€”for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the proÅ¿perity of church and Å¿tate, and for aiding our fellow-citizens, and fellow chriÅ¿tians, and our brethren of mankind, generally, whom we may be able to Å¿erve, in reÅ¿pect to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Å¿acred, their temporal and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>The father of his country no longer lives, to unite, animate, and guide its citizens, and its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in its defenceâ€”to watch for its welfareâ€”to plan and labour for its proÅ¿perity and its glory.â€”How far its Å¿afety, or its intereÅ¿ts may be affected by his lamented death, we yet know not. But when we reflect upon the exiÅ¿ting circumÅ¿tances of our nation, deprived, as it now is, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence, the talents, the counÅ¿els, the cares, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the influence of its moÅ¿t revered and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored citizen, its moÅ¿t Å¿trenuous defender, and moÅ¿t vigilant and faithful guardian;â€”we muÅ¿t Å¿ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be aware, that it now demands, from all, whoÅ¿e intereÅ¿ts are embarked in its cauÅ¿e, a more Å¿olicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention to its neceÅ¿Å¿itiesâ€”and a redoubled zeal in every patriotic effort, by which it may be defended and benefited.â€”And let thoÅ¿e, who may be ready to apprehend, that they can do little or nothing for the public good, be reminded, that they can, at leaÅ¿t, pray for it;â€”and that "the Lord is a God hearing prayer;" and "having already done great things for us," may be ready to do Å¿till greater things for us,â€”"but will yet be enquired of by us, that he may do them for us."</p>
            <p>Recollecting, alÅ¿o, that our opportunities in this world for Å¿erving God, and our generation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to the will of God, and for Å¿ecuring the Å¿alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and everlaÅ¿ting happineÅ¿s of our own Å¿ouls, are very Å¿hort and precariousâ€”let us be admoniÅ¿hed to undertake and "to do with our might, whatever our hand findeth to do."</p>
            <p>Every inÅ¿tance of mortality, which we witneÅ¿s, or of which we hear, is adapted, impreÅ¿Å¿ively, to enforce the word of God, by which we are warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "that the time is Å¿hort." But from the tomb of the great WASHINGTON, for whom his country now mourns, through all its bordersâ€”the voice of death Å¿peaks to us with more than ordinary Å¿olem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and emphaÅ¿isâ€”"Be ye alÅ¿o readyâ€”for in Å¿uch an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh." "In Å¿uch an hour as we think not," or may be leaÅ¿t aware of his approach, the Son of Man, "who hath the keys of death, and of the inviÅ¿ible world," may come, by his dread Å¿ummons, to call us from time to eternityâ€”from a temporary Å¿tate of Å¿ervice and trial, to an everlaÅ¿ting Å¿tate of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unchangeable retribution.</p>
            <p>How Å¿oon did the humane and amiable hero, yield to the violence of unrelenting diÅ¿eaÅ¿e!â€”How quickly did the mighty and renowned conqueror fall, with all his mortal honors blooming upon himâ€”"in that war in which there is no diÅ¿charge!"</p>
            <p>And muÅ¿t not we as certainly die? And may we not, in like manner, die with as little previous warning of our impending diÅ¿Å¿olutionâ€”or by a Å¿troke from the laÅ¿t enemy, Å¿till more Å¿udden and unexpected? O let us haÅ¿ten then, in our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the cloÅ¿ing Å¿cene of lifeâ€”for that all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant change of worlds to which we are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as faÅ¿t as the rapid flight of time can bear us forward!</p>

Let us look well to ourÅ¿elves, and Å¿ee that our Å¿ouls are committed in the exerciÅ¿e of that unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith, "which is the gift of God, and the work of his holy Å¿pirit," into the hands of that Divine, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and moÅ¿t gracious Redeemer, "whoÅ¿e is the only name under Heaven, given among men, by which any can be Å¿aved;" and on whoÅ¿e atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and interceÅ¿Å¿ion, the moÅ¿t il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luÅ¿trious Å¿aviours of their country, equally with the meaneÅ¿t and moÅ¿t abject of the children of men, muÅ¿t entirely depend, for the forgiveneÅ¿s of their Å¿insâ€”for reconciliation and peace with God; and for the attainment of that everlaÅ¿ting life, which God has promiÅ¿ed to believers, and which is to be found only in his Son. Let us, alÅ¿o, be active and diligent, "stedfaÅ¿t and immovable, and more and more abounding, in all the work and Å¿ervice of the Lord," to which we are called, as the followers of the great Captain of our Å¿alvation; and let it be our moÅ¿t Å¿erious concern, and care, that we may be found ever watching for the coming of our Lordâ€”and waiting with a Å¿tedfaÅ¿t faith, with a lively hope, and with an earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ire, for his Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign order to lay down our fleÅ¿h in its native earth; and to enter, diÅ¿incumbered of all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of mortality; and completely delivered and purified, from the power and pollution of Å¿in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we now groan, into the full and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿ting "joy of our Lord."</p>
            <p>Then will the courÅ¿e of our pilgrimage, through this vale of tears, cloÅ¿e in peace:â€”and "having fought the good fight, and finiÅ¿hed the work," which our Lord has appointed to be accompliÅ¿hed by us, on earthâ€”and having thus approved our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves "faithful" in his cauÅ¿e and Å¿ervice, "unto

death, we Å¿hall receive the crown of immortal life, which he hath promiÅ¿ed, and which he will give to all who believe in, and obey him, and who love his appearing." And then, in his heavenly kingdomâ€”"waÅ¿hed from our Å¿ins in his blood, who loved us, and gave himÅ¿elf for us; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the dignity of kings and prieÅ¿ts unto God and his father,"â€”we Å¿hall mourn no more for the awful deÅ¿olations of death, or under any of the lamentable effects of Å¿in; but Å¿hall find "all tears wiped away from our eyes," by the kind hand of our gracious God and Redeemer; and "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his face in righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and Å¿atisfied with his likeneÅ¿s, we Å¿hall triumph in his praiÅ¿e, and in that fulneÅ¿s of joy which is in his preÅ¿ence," through all the ages of a bleÅ¿Å¿ed eternity!</p>
