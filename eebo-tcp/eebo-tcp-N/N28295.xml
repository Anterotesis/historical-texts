            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is a very ſolemn and affecting ſcene, which is preſented to our view, in this portion of ſacred hiſtory. Though a long ſeries of ages has paſſed away ſince it took place, it cannot, yet, be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively reviewed, without exciting in the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind, and feeling heart, many ſerious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tender emotions. With every other part of ſcripture, it was doubtleſs recorded "for our learning," for our inſtruction and improvement. It ſhews, particularly, in a ſtriking point of light, how important to a community, are the life and ſervices of a great and good prince; or of a perſon holding a primary place in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his country—and in that elevated ſtation, diſtinguiſhed by his ſuperior talents, integrity, and public ſpirit: and how heavy, and afflictive, is the loſs ſuſtained by a nation, when ſuch a ruler and benefactor is "taken from its head," by the awful ſtroke of death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037715_0003_100ED3F18DC75FD0"/>
To theſe intereſting reflections, we are unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably led by the conſideration of the paſſage before us—while we here behold the whole Jewiſh nation, with one conſent, and as by one inſtantaneous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, aſſuming the aſpect, and exhibiting the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the deepeſt affliction and mourning, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the death of their late king Joſiah; who was one of the worthieſt and beſt, that ever reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them; and whoſe life, from his earlieſt years, had been employed, under the influence of the pureſt and nobleſt principles, in promoting the temporal and religious intereſts of his people.</p>
            <p>This good king was yet in the midſt of his days, or in the vigor of his age, when it was his lot to receive a fatal wound, in a battle, to which he was probably led, by the terms of his alliance with the king of Iſrael, who was then tributary to the king of Babylon; and therefore bound to engage on the ſide of that monarch, in the war which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced againſt him by the king of Egypt. Of this wound Joſiah died, immediately after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Jeruſalem: and thus the flattering, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently well founded hopes of his people, for a much longer continuance of his reign, and of the multiplied bleſſings which they derived from it, were ſuddenly terminated in the moſt gloomy and painful diſappointment.</p>
            <p>An event, ſo calamitous, might well be expected to diffuſe the moſt afflicting ſenſations through the body of the nation; for whoſe welfare he had ſhewn ſo early, ſo zealous, and ſo conſtant a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Accordingly, the ſacred hiſtorian here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us—that "All Judah and Jeruſalem mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Joſiah:" The inhabitants of every part of the country, concurring with thoſe of the capital
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037715_0004_100EF226D386FE30"/>
city, the place of the royal reſidence, in every be coming affecting demonſtration of ſorrow, under this heavy national calamity.</p>
            <p>It is added, that Jeremiah the prophet, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly lamented for Joſiah. This venerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as it became a ſervant of God, under that peculiar ſacred character which he ſuſtained, was penetrated with the deepeſt grief for the loſs of a prince, whoſe pious cares, and indefatigable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were eſpecially directed to the advancement of the cauſe of religion and virtue: a cauſe with which the peace and proſperity, and all the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of every community, as well as of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, are eſſentially and inſeparably connected. And it is alſo mentioned, as another memorable circumſtance of this national mourning for Joſiah, that it was long perpetuated, by the inſtitution of certain ſolemn ſervices, including, particularly, ſome elegiac compoſitions ſet to plaintive muſic, in commemoration of an event, ſo mournful in its nature, and ſo afflicting in its conſequences.</p>
            <p>In the hiſtory of mankind we ſhall often find a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſimilarity of events and circumſtances, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing in the moſt diſtant countries &amp; periods of time.</p>
            <p>With this memorable mourning of the Jewiſh nation, for the loſs of their eminently worthy and amiable Joſiah;—how ſtriking is the reſemblance, that appears in the univerſal, unfeigned mourning, now exhibited by the American people, for the loſs of their great, and excellent, and beloved WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON; whoſe life was one of the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable bleſſings of a beneficent Providence to his country, and whoſe death is juſtly lamented, as a great national affliction.</p>
            <p>When the man, whom God in his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037715_0005_100EF228F98A4538"/>
was pleaſed to honor, as the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed inſtrument in his hand, for ſecuring to the people of America, the liberty civil and religious—the independence—the peace, and the proſperity, in the enjoyment of which, they are at this day, apparently, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> moſt favored, and happy nation in the world. When he, who, obedient to the voice of his country, repeatedly, and with magnanimous ſelf-denial, exchanged his beloved domeſtic pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and enjoyments, for the moſt arduous ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of public truſt and ſervice: And in thoſe ſtations victoriouſly led our armies through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of a moſt difficult and perilous revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary war; and ably, and ſucceſsfully preſided in the executive department of our national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, during many of the moſt eventful years of an unexampled, and awfully portentous criſis in Europe, in which our political and commercial intereſts were deeply involved. When he, who in the favorite ſcenes of private life, in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to paſs his tranquil days, whenever the ſafety and glory of his country permitted, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beauty and lovelineſs of thoſe finer feelings, and accompliſhments, which dignify and adorn the gentleman, the philoſopher, the friend, and the domeſtic character. When he, in a word, who firſt vindicated our rights, as men and chriſtians, with his ſword; and then ſhielded them from the envious, hoſtile deſigns of powerful foreign nations, and the turbulence of reſtleſs inteſtine factions, by the wiſdom of his counſels the equity, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and firmneſs of his meaſures; and who uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly ſhone pre-eminent in great talents, in diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted patriotiſm, and in the luſtre of his public and private virtues and uſefulneſs:—
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037715_0006_100EF22AF990D8D0"/>
When ſuch a man is removed by the ſupreme, righteous Diſpoſer of all things, from every ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honorable truſt, and important ſervice among his fellow-mortals—and from all the ſcenes of mortality;—ſurely, it well becomes the nation, of which he was one of the brighteſt ornaments, and greateſt benefactors, to mourn with the feelings of undiſſembled, deep, and laſting ſorrow!</p>
            <p>In ſuch a ſorrow all the citizens of the United-States, who really love their country—with many in other nations, who poſſeſs the ſenſibilities of a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, and the genuine ſpirit of philanthropy, will bear a tender ſympathetic part; and ſincerely mourn the father of his country, the patron of liberty, the friend of humanity—fallen under that ſtroke of death, to which the greateſt, and moſt illuſtrious, equally with the fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bleſt, and moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure of the human race, muſt finally bow.—</p>
            <p>Of the general mourning, which the death of a man, ſo eminently and honorably diſtinguiſhed in life, might well be expected to produce—the moſt unequivocal tokens are exibited, wherever the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy tidings of it have been ſpread abroad. The cuſtomary badges of grief, which indicate a near and valued friend departed; together with the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, more public and ſolemn expreſſions of a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's ſorrows, proclaim, in the moſt affecting, and impreſſive language, that our illuſtrious and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved WASHINGTON is numbered with the dead; and that his country ſenſibly feels, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely mourns, the deeply intereſting, and afflicting event!—</p>
            <p>That the ſorrows, which we ſhare in common with our fellow-citizens, throughout the union, and with the friends of liberty and humanity generally,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037715_0007_100EF22CD537A018"/>
under this bereaving diſpenſation of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may be brought under the guidance of ſober reflection and true wiſdom, and directed to ſome uſeful ends.—</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour, in the proceſs of this diſcourſe, to ſhew,
<list>
                  <item>I. Why the death of great and worthy men, who have been eminently uſeful in their day, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in exalted ſtations of public truſt and ſervice, ought to be lamented; and,</item>

            <p>I. Why the death of great and worthy men, who have been eminently uſeful in their day, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in exalted ſtations of public truſt and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ought to be lamented.—</p>
            <p>Now the death of ſuch men may well be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On account of the many and great evils which they are inſtrumental in averting from a people.—</p>
            <p>In the preſent fallen ſtate of human nature, the paſſions of men, their pride, their ambition—their avarice, their love of criminal pleaſure; in a word, their ſelfiſhneſs, ſtrongly impel them to deeds of injuſtice, oppreſſion,—and violence.—By theſe vicious diſpoſitions, individuals are often ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bitter and deadly contentions;—and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and nations, are plunged into all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and calamities of public, and long protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wars. If left to follow the impulſe of theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt propenſities of their fallen nature, without reſtraint or oppoſition, a few of the ſtrongeſt and moſt unprincipled, bringing others, by force or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, into a ſubſerviency to their views, would
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037715_0008_100EF22EFA324CD8"/>
not heſitate, with the aid of ſuch inſtruments of their will, to invade the rights, to ſeize the poſſeſſions, to ſacrifice the lives of their fellow-men, in any extent which they might think expedient, or find practicable, to the accompliſhment of their own baſe and criminal purpoſes.</p>
            <p>But as the great Ruler of the univerſe, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and formed mankind for the ſocial ſtate; and has made their common mutual ſafety and welfare depend, in a great meaſure, upon that union and order which conſtitute the ſtrength and beauty of ſociety;—ſo he conſtantly exerciſes a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol over all human inclinations, projects, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes:—And having the hearts of all men in his hands, he holds all their tumultuous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, raging appetites, and furious paſſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſubject to that irreſiſtible authority and power, by which, when he pleaſes, he commands the ſtormy winds into a calm; and ſays to the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling boiſterous ſea, "Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no farther; and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed." In his government of mankind, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and for the accompliſhment of his wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, relating to them, he generally uſes ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means and ſubordinate agency, which have a natural fitneſs to bring about the worthy ends that he has propoſed. In this view, he employs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently the inſtitutions of religion, and the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his word, among the people, to whom he has been pleaſed to grant the diſtinguiſhing privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and benefits of Divine Revelation. And in the nations generally, he raiſes up from time to time, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, endued with ſome peculiar talents and diſpoſitions; by which they are qualified to rule over their fellow men,—and prompted to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

their power and influence, in providing for the common welfare of the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in reſtraining and quieting the turbulent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the community; and in diſconcerting the ſchemes, and repelling the aſſaults of their various enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus—while the Supreme Governor of Nations, ſometimes elevates men of ſtrong natural abilities, connected with the moſt vile, and profligate moral principles, to great power,—and then uſes them as the ſword in his hand, for chaſtiſing any wicked and rebellious people, whom he determines to puniſh;—he alſo, at his pleaſure, calls forth, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to exalted ſtations of authority and truſt, men of ſuperior talents and worthy character; and by their inſtrumentality ſhields or delivers a people, whom he chuſes to favour, from thoſe violences or grievances, with which they may be menaced or oppreſſed.—By their friendly and ſucceſsful agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the nation, or community, with the care of whoſe intereſts they are entruſted, whether in the capacity of military commanders, or civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, is reſcued from the galling yoke of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age—from the dreadful ſtate of anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: or from the final diſſolution and utter ruin, to which it might otherwiſe be reduced, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedneſs of many of its own members; or by the all graſping ambition, and inſatiable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of foreign hoſtile nations and potentates.</p>
            <p>Such are the men, whom "the Lord Moſt High—Who is the great King over all the earth," often "gives to a people, according to his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercies, to be" under himſelf, "their ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;" to be "the miniſters of God, for" eminent "good," to them in a ſtate of peace; and his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen

When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, men thus ſpecially qualified, and called to fill the moſt exalted and important ſtations, in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their country; and thus employed, under the direction of Divine Providence, in averting from it the moſt formidable and deſtructive evils, are removed by death; the afflictive event is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to be regarded, as juſtly demanding the tears of a bereaved people—as worthy of being lamented with every dignified expreſſion of unfeigned na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſorrow.</p>
            <p>I proceed to obſerve, on the other hand, that the death of ſuch valuable defenders, and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of a people, is to be thus lamented.</p>

            <p>The neceſſity of the inſtitution and ſupport of government, among mankind, is univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; and its utility has been recommended by the experience of all nations, in all ages. So far as any ſyſtem of government is adapted to unite a people in a ſtate of order and peace—to enforce the principles and rules of juſtice among them—and to ſecure them from the miſchievous deſigns of their enemies, it is ſanctioned by the approbation of Heaven; and its eſtabliſhment is to be regarded, as
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037715_0011_100EF234765AA470"/>
an important public bleſſing, by the people who enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Between different ſyſtems of human government, there is indeed as wide a difference, as between the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

But for directing well, and applying efficaciouſly, the powers of the beſt conſtitution of government, it is obvious, that none are properly qualified, but thoſe who poſſeſs peculiar abilities for the management of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs: And it is equally certain, that on the moral principles, which direct their conduct, the welfare of the community very much depends. Whether they are charged with the adminiſtration of the civil, or military affairs of their country; having its great intereſts committed to their care, and its reſources placed in their hands; they are at once laid under peculiar obligations, and enjoy peculiar advantages, for ſtudying and promoting the public good; and when poſſeſſed of thoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted qualities of the head and the heart, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh great and worthy rulers and commanders—the public good will be the favorite object of their regard and purſuit—and in the ordinary courſe of things, will be greatly advanced by their agency. In their ſuperior ſtation, diſtinguiſhed by their great talents and virtues—by their knowledge of human nature, of its powers and weakneſſes—of its paſſions and its wants—and of the ſtate of their

own nation, conſidered in an abſtract point of view, and in its relations to other countries—by their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, accurate judgment, and enlarged, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive view of things—by the wiſdom of their counſels, and the rectitude of their meaſures—by the purity and ardor of their patriotiſm; and by their active courage, and unyielding reſolution, in meeting and ſurmounting the various and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dangers, difficulties and trials, which they may have to encounter in their country's cauſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—they are eminently qualified, to teach the great body of the people, for whom they act, the nature and value of their civil and ſacred rights, and privileges, and to guide and animate their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions in the purſuit and defence of their true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts;—and under the ſmiles of a favoring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, their inſtrumentality has a great effect, in ſecuring and improving the moſt important nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al advantages.</p>
            <p>The deſirable ends, which their high qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and patriotic labours are thus adapted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, are further promoted by the powerful engaging influence of their great example. For "as the going forth of the ſun, is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof;" ſo the examples of great and good men, moving in exalted ſpheres of public ſervice, and uſefulneſs, diffuſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening and enlivening beams, through the wide extent of the land in which they bear rule; and have an happy tendency to ſtimulate and allure the other members of the community, in ſubordinate ſtations, to imitate their conduct, in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of a public ſpirit, and in the practice of whatſoever things are pious and juſt—generous

and honorable—lovely and praiſe-worthy:—and, in ſhort, in the purſuit of that courſe of well doing, which conducts individuals, and communities, to a ſtate of the moſt deſirable proſperity in this world; while it leads thoſe, who walk in it, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a truly chriſtian faith, to glory, honour, and immortality in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Highly favored indeed, are the people to whom the Lord gives ſuch rulers and commanders, as his choſen agents, for communicating and ſecuring to them ſo many precious bleſſings of his favor—and ſo rich a portion of national honor and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs!</p>
            <p>When, therefore, a people are bereaved of ſuch valuable benefactors, they ſuſtain an unſpeakable loſs; and are ſolemnly called by the Providence of God to mourn—feelingly and deeply to mourn under the heavy and diſtreſſing ſtroke of his holy hand.</p>
            <p>The obſervations which have been ſuggeſted, will, it is believed, admit of a juſt and forcible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the preſent caſe of our own nation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that very afflicting diſpenſation of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which has bereaved us, of a general and ſtateſman, who, in the expreſſive and emphatical language of our Houſe of Repreſentatives in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,—"was the firſt in war—the firſt in peace, and the firſt in the affections of his country."</p>

of the widely diſperſed millions of his fellow-citizens—to repreſent him in the ſublime attitude in which he appeared, when delivering the laſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn advice, which he directly addreſſed, under a public character, to the American people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> advice which was the fruit of ſuperior wiſdom, matured by long experience, and of the pureſt and moſt diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted patriotiſm, that had ſtood the teſt of the ſevereſt trials; while at the ſame time he announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his decided reſolution to decline ſtanding a candidate for a re-election to the preſidency, on which he had reaſon to calculate with the greateſt confidence;—and conformably to his declared pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, immediately retired, from all the flattering diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions connected with the ſupreme magiſtracy of the Union, to the ardently deſired calm retreat of private life, in which he deſigned, and hoped to paſs the reſidue of his days in undiſturbed tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and peace—to pourtray the glory of the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public act of his exalted, and unabated patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, when he once more yielded to the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate call of his country, and conſented to reſume the command of the forces, which it was preparing for its defence againſt the injuſtice and violence of a rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ambitious, and unprincipled foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;—to contemplate him here in the cloſing ſcene, when thus determined and prepared, to relinquiſh the repoſe which was ſo agreeable and deſirable to his advanced age, after the long continued preſſing labours of a moſt active public life, for the toils and dangers of an apparently inevitable and arduous war;—receiving the ſolemn mandate of Heaven, which ſummoned his great ſoul to the world of ſpirits;—and with that calm and unſhaken firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, for which he was ever remarkable,

finiſhing his honorable, earthly career in death—to ſpeak now particularly of the ineſtimable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which he rendered to his country, and to the cauſe of religion, liberty, and humanity:—or to attempt a delineation of the particular features of his great character:—All this would form an undertaking, to which I feel myſelf wholly incompetent! and which could not be well executed by the beſt abilities, within the limits preſcribed to this diſcourſe. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly comes not within my preſent deſign; but is left as the proper work of the biographer and hiſtorian:—and in the faithful, well-written memoirs of his life,—and hiſtory of his country,—the ſublime character,—and the illuſtrious deeds of our WASHINGTON, will doubtleſs ſhine with pre-eminent glory,—through a long ſeries of ages, and diffuſe an increaſing ſplendor over many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations.</p>

            <p n="1">1. It becomes us to cheriſh the remembrance of the excellent character and eminent ſervices of our country's moſt illuſtrious citizen and diſtinguiſhed benefactor, whoſe death we now lament, with a grateful ſenſe of our obligations to the beneficent Providence of God, who qualified and employed him, as a leading inſtrument, in ſecuring to us
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037715_0017_100ED3EC7A4EE140"/>
ſo many, and ſuch ineſtimably valuable national bleſſings.</p>
            <p>The memory of the man, whom God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſt remarkably to honor, as the inſtrument in his hand, for the communication of ſo much good to our highly favoured nation, ſhould be peculiarly dear to all our citizens;—and it ſhould be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with every appropriate, impreſſive mark of diſtinguiſhing eſteem and regard, to poſterity—as a ſplendid example for the imitation of future pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, generals, and ſtateſmen—and of our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens generally, in every department of public and private life.—In the records of nations, excepting only thoſe of God's antient, choſen and peculiar people, we would probably ſearch in vain for the example of an union of great talents and virtues, of worthy conduct, and important uſefulneſs; ſuperior, if we could even find one equal, to that which has been exhibited by our admired and beloved WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, in thoſe high military and civil employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which he was called to defend and ſerve his country.</p>
            <p>But remembering that "every good gift," eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valuable poſſeſſion, privilege, or benefit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a private or public nature, or through whatever channel, or medium, conveyed to us, "comes down from the Great Father of lights and mercies;"—let us ſtudy to be thankful to HIM, who graciouſly provided ſuch a general and ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to conduct our military operations, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter our civil and political affairs, during a long period, the moſt critical and intereſting to our nation—who crowned his wiſe councils, his virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meaſures, his heroic efforts, with ſuch happy ſucceſs—and who prolonged his life, with his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037715_0018_100EF243DF6BD2C0"/>
and his zeal unimpaired, for the ſervice of his country—till it was ſafely conducted through a long ſeries of the moſt perplexing difficulties, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable dangers, and at length ſecurely eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we truſt, in the enjoyment of a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſtitution of government, and a moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate of peace and proſperity. Moſt kind and indulgent, indeed, has been the Providence of the God of our mercies, in firſt beſtowing upon us, and then forbearing to remove from us, the man, who was one of the moſt impregnable bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of our country in war, and one of its ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pillars in peace—till it was ſettled and confirmed in its preſent eligible ſituation; in which it does not probably ſo immediately depend, as at ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer periods, on the ſervices or influence of any individual: and ſeems not likely to be ſo eaſily ſhaken, as it might have ſometimes heretofore been, by the reſtleſs ſpirit of internal faction; or by the dark intrigues, or open violence of foreign, jealous, and unfriendly nations!</p>
            <p>Let us then, at once, honor the memory of our departed illuſtrious General and Preſident; and praiſe the divine and moſt bountiful Author of all the various bleſſings of a civil and a ſacred nature, which through his diſtinguiſhed agency, we have experienced, and now enjoy, as an independent, a free, a great, and an happy nation!</p>

Let the conſideration of this very affecting inſtance of mortality, which has filled the heart of our nation with ſorrow and mourning, be improved to awaken and engage us all, to a faithful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent diſcharge of the duties of our reſpective ſtations; and to a ſeaſonable preparation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant watchfulneſs for the order of God, which ſhall diſmiſs us from all our employments here, to a ſtate of righteous and everlaſting retribution in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world.</p>
            <p>To act, as if we thought that we were bound by no obligations, to extend our views or regards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ourſelves; but had a right to employ our time and powers, merely to ſerve our own ſelfiſh purpoſes, would be very diſgraceful to our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as men and citizens. Much more reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then, muſt ſuch conduct appear to be, in thoſe who bear the name of Chriſtians—when it is view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the light of the goſpel—when it is conſidered as in direct contradiction to thoſe benevolent and refined principles of the religion of the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which require us "to love our neighbour as ourſelves"—"to rejoice with them that rejoice—to weep with them that weep"—"to bear one another's burthens"—"and as we have ability and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to do good to all around us."</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, reflect and conſider what the Lord our God and Saviour requires of us, in our ſeveral ſtations—and endeavour to occupy, with the talents which he has committed to us, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by which his great name may be moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037715_0024_100EF24F1230E410"/>
and the beſt intereſts of our fellow men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our own, moſt effectually advanced.</p>
            <p>FATHERS—Let not the reſidue of your ſtrength be wholly ſpent in that caſe and inactivity, which, to declining years, uſually appear moſt inviting.—If you are yet living to yourſelves, and for this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—ſurely it is high time that you begin to live to the Lord, and for eternity.</p>
            <p>If, in the courſe of a life of chriſtian faith, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and virtue,—you are ſerving and honoring the adorable Author of your being and redemption, and purſuing the great ends of your rational exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,—"Be not weary in well doing, but hold on your way, and hold out to the end,—and ſtill go from ſtrength to ſtrength, till you enter into that everlaſting reſt, which remaineth for the people of God." And remember, that it particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you, to teach the riſing generation their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, to their neighbour, and themſelves—to admoniſh them of the viciſſitudes, the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the dangers, to which they may be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the untried journey of life—and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the counſels of matured wiſdom, and long experience, by the engaging influence of the good example, which you will exhibit, while you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to walk with ſteady ſteps, and cheerful hopes, in "the path of the juſt; which is as the ſhining light" of the morning, "ſhining more and more unto the perfect day."</p>
            <p>YOUNG MEN—Let not the flower of your age—the vigour of your faculties, be diſhonored and waſted in the indulgence of unmanly ſloth—of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, diſſipating amuſements—or of for did, criminal, and deſtructive pleaſures: But ſtudy to furniſh your minds with uſeful knowledge, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037715_0025_100EF250A65FF598"/>
and ſtrengthen the diſpoſitions and habits of purity and temperance,—of regularity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence—of generoſity and economy. "Remember your Creator and Redeemer in the days of your youth:" Chooſe and purſue "the ways of wiſdom, which are the only ways of pleaſantneſs, and peace: Fulfil the obligations of every relation, which you ſuſtain, with reſpectful attention and affection—with ſtrict fidelity and becoming cheerfulneſs; and let your breaſts glow with a laudable, ardent am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to act a worthy part—and become the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and bleſſings of ſociety, in your day.</p>
            <p>Let it be the concern of every one of us, in ſhort, that we may feel the power, and manifeſt the influence of thoſe ſacred, heavenly principles of the goſpel, which will bear down every ſelfiſh, contracted diſpoſition of our degenerate nature, and elevate and enlarge our hearts, in the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent deſires—and prompt us to correſpondent, worthy efforts, to be as uſeful as poſſible, in our reſpective ſpheres—to contribute ſomething to the welfare of the civil community, with which we are connected, and to the extenſion of the bounds, and the advancement of the glory of the Redeemer's kingdom of grace in the world.</p>
            <p>And by the great example of the diſtinguiſhed friend and benefactor of his country, whoſe loſs we now deplore—let us all be taught and animated to cheriſh that public ſpirit, which ſhone ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly in him—and which will determine us to maintain for ourſelves, and to tranſmit to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, that ſhall come after us, the national in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and the precious liberties involved in it, for which he ſo nobly fought—and which he guarded with ſo vigilant an eye, and faithful a hand,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037715_0026_100EF25301F77E88"/>
—and to exert our influence, as far as it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, for preſerving and ſupporting religion and morality, order and peace, in our land,—for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the proſperity of church and ſtate, and for aiding our fellow-citizens, and fellow chriſtians, and our brethren of mankind, generally, whom we may be able to ſerve, in reſpect to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſacred, their temporal and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>The father of his country no longer lives, to unite, animate, and guide its citizens, and its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in its defence—to watch for its welfare—to plan and labour for its proſperity and its glory.—How far its ſafety, or its intereſts may be affected by his lamented death, we yet know not. But when we reflect upon the exiſting circumſtances of our nation, deprived, as it now is, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the talents, the counſels, the cares, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the influence of its moſt revered and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored citizen, its moſt ſtrenuous defender, and moſt vigilant and faithful guardian;—we muſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be aware, that it now demands, from all, whoſe intereſts are embarked in its cauſe, a more ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention to its neceſſities—and a redoubled zeal in every patriotic effort, by which it may be defended and benefited.—And let thoſe, who may be ready to apprehend, that they can do little or nothing for the public good, be reminded, that they can, at leaſt, pray for it;—and that "the Lord is a God hearing prayer;" and "having already done great things for us," may be ready to do ſtill greater things for us,—"but will yet be enquired of by us, that he may do them for us."</p>
            <p>Recollecting, alſo, that our opportunities in this world for ſerving God, and our generation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037715_0027_100EF2553085F388"/>
to the will of God, and for ſecuring the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and everlaſting happineſs of our own ſouls, are very ſhort and precarious—let us be admoniſhed to undertake and "to do with our might, whatever our hand findeth to do."</p>
            <p>Every inſtance of mortality, which we witneſs, or of which we hear, is adapted, impreſſively, to enforce the word of God, by which we are warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "that the time is ſhort." But from the tomb of the great WASHINGTON, for whom his country now mourns, through all its borders—the voice of death ſpeaks to us with more than ordinary ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and emphaſis—"Be ye alſo ready—for in ſuch an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh." "In ſuch an hour as we think not," or may be leaſt aware of his approach, the Son of Man, "who hath the keys of death, and of the inviſible world," may come, by his dread ſummons, to call us from time to eternity—from a temporary ſtate of ſervice and trial, to an everlaſting ſtate of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unchangeable retribution.</p>
            <p>How ſoon did the humane and amiable hero, yield to the violence of unrelenting diſeaſe!—How quickly did the mighty and renowned conqueror fall, with all his mortal honors blooming upon him—"in that war in which there is no diſcharge!"</p>
            <p>And muſt not we as certainly die? And may we not, in like manner, die with as little previous warning of our impending diſſolution—or by a ſtroke from the laſt enemy, ſtill more ſudden and unexpected? O let us haſten then, in our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the cloſing ſcene of life—for that all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant change of worlds to which we are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as faſt as the rapid flight of time can bear us forward!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:037715_0028_100EF256B8A10A30"/>
Let us look well to ourſelves, and ſee that our ſouls are committed in the exerciſe of that unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith, "which is the gift of God, and the work of his holy ſpirit," into the hands of that Divine, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and moſt gracious Redeemer, "whoſe is the only name under Heaven, given among men, by which any can be ſaved;" and on whoſe atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, righteouſneſs, and interceſſion, the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious ſaviours of their country, equally with the meaneſt and moſt abject of the children of men, muſt entirely depend, for the forgiveneſs of their ſins—for reconciliation and peace with God; and for the attainment of that everlaſting life, which God has promiſed to believers, and which is to be found only in his Son. Let us, alſo, be active and diligent, "stedfaſt and immovable, and more and more abounding, in all the work and ſervice of the Lord," to which we are called, as the followers of the great Captain of our ſalvation; and let it be our moſt ſerious concern, and care, that we may be found ever watching for the coming of our Lord—and waiting with a ſtedfaſt faith, with a lively hope, and with an earneſt deſire, for his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign order to lay down our fleſh in its native earth; and to enter, diſincumbered of all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of mortality; and completely delivered and purified, from the power and pollution of ſin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we now groan, into the full and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting "joy of our Lord."</p>
            <p>Then will the courſe of our pilgrimage, through this vale of tears, cloſe in peace:—and "having fought the good fight, and finiſhed the work," which our Lord has appointed to be accompliſhed by us, on earth—and having thus approved our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves "faithful" in his cauſe and ſervice, "unto
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037715_0029_100EF2584BE3F5E8"/>
death, we ſhall receive the crown of immortal life, which he hath promiſed, and which he will give to all who believe in, and obey him, and who love his appearing." And then, in his heavenly kingdom—"waſhed from our ſins in his blood, who loved us, and gave himſelf for us; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the dignity of kings and prieſts unto God and his father,"—we ſhall mourn no more for the awful deſolations of death, or under any of the lamentable effects of ſin; but ſhall find "all tears wiped away from our eyes," by the kind hand of our gracious God and Redeemer; and "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his face in righteouſneſs, and ſatisfied with his likeneſs, we ſhall triumph in his praiſe, and in that fulneſs of joy which is in his preſence," through all the ages of a bleſſed eternity!</p>
            <p>"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the only wiſe God and our Saviour, be honor and glory, for ever and ever." AMEN!</p>
