            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Church Univerſal</hi> is to be firſt of all conſidered, as thus <hi>Married</hi> unto the Son of GOD.

The <hi>method of Grace,</hi> which the <hi>Covenant of Redemption</hi> has laid out, for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a Glorious CHRIST, is brought unto us, in the <hi>Goſpel of our Salvation,</hi> as a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which we are to come into. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God; it brings to us a <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> By being made willing to have our Saviour do for us, what He has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed His Father to do for His People, and be concerned for us, as our <hi>Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> our <hi>Inſtructor,</hi> and our <hi>Governour;</hi> we come into His <hi>Covenant.</hi> The People brought into this Covenant is the Church of God.

The <hi>Emblem</hi> thus proſecuted by <hi>Solomon,</hi> is but an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon what he had learn'd from the <hi>Forty fifth Pſalm,</hi> which his Father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had compoſed for him.

Of that <hi>marriage,</hi> our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking, preſently adds; Eph. V. 32. <hi>This is a great Myſtery; but I ſpeak of Chriſt and the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Inchoation</hi> of this <hi>Marriage,</hi> is in <hi>this World.</hi> The <hi>Elect</hi> of God coming to ſay, <hi>I am the Lords,</hi> and <hi>Avouching</hi> a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST for their God and Saviour, the Grand Affair of the <hi>Marriage</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.

            <p>But as an <hi>Appendix,</hi> to this Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it is to be added; That a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church,</hi> is alſo to be conſidered, as <hi>Married</hi> unto the SON of GOD.

            </p>
            <p>O <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord; Remember thy <hi>Marriage</hi> unto thy Saviour. Do nothing to grieve Him; Do not Incur His Frowns; Do not provoke Him to withdraw from thee. Be faithful in His <hi>Covenant.</hi> Obſerve His <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> with a due

Loyalty and Purity; preſerve them from Violations. Be mindful of that Charge; Pſal.

And every <hi>Individual Believer</hi> is alſo a <hi>Living Temple;</hi> An <hi>Habitation of GOD thro' the Spirit.</hi> It is the ſame in the Metaphor of a <hi>Marriage.</hi> Our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR does <hi>Marry</hi> Himſelf unto the <hi>Church</hi> in general.

IV. 8, 9. <hi>Come with me, my Spouſe. Thou haſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed my Heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe.</hi> O Sollicited Soul, When thou comeſt into the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD, and heartily ſayſt, <hi>I am willing to be Liſted among the People who look for Bleſſedneſs under the Conduct

of the LORD, who is to break the Head of the Serpent;</hi> From this Moment thy SAVIOUR <hi>Marries</hi> Himſelf unto thee.

It may now be ſaid, Iſai. LIV. 5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now directed and arrived unto the Management of the moſt Important Action, that it is poſſible for any among the Children of Men to be concerned in.</p>
            <p>A Miniſter of the Goſpel is called; Joh. III. 29. <hi>A Friend of the Bridegroom.</hi> The chief Scope, the main Work of our Miniſtry is, To <hi>Wooe,</hi> Oh! may we have the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Succeſs,</hi> to <hi>Win,</hi> the Souls of our People, for an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> to our only SAVIOUR. The <hi>Motion</hi> is to be now made; And, O our Dear People.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002040_0014_0FBA8566E6A8D1F0"/>
you</hi> another Day. Yea, <hi>Hearken, O Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in a fair way to be made a <hi>Daughter of GOD,</hi> and <hi>Conſider, and Incline thine Ear; Forget alſo</hi> the Amuſements of a vain World, which have kept thee at a Diſtance from Him who is to be thy <hi>Lord,</hi> forever to be <hi>Adored.</hi> We read of a famous Tranſaction; The Steward comes, and, Gen. XXIV. 35, 49, 58. <hi>He ſaid, The Lord hath bleſſed my Maſter greatly, and he is become great; and unto his ſon he hath given all that he hath:—And now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my Maſter, Tell me.—And they called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckah, and ſaid unto her, Wilt thou go with this Man? And ſhe ſaid, I will go.</hi> Let us now in like manner go on with our proceedings. I bring you this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; <q>The Bleſſed GOD has a SON, unto whom He <hi>hath given all that He hath:</hi> He is <hi>Lord of all.</hi> It is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto Thee, O Poor Soul, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art <hi>Willing</hi> to give thy ſelf unto Him; <hi>Willing</hi> to have Him take Poſſeſſion of thee; <hi>Willing</hi> that He ſhould <hi>Supply</hi> thee, <hi>Inſtruct</hi> thee, <hi>Govern</hi> thee; &amp; render thee <hi>Fruitful</hi> unto GOD. And now, wilt thou treat thy SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002040_0015_0FBA856B4F3B1410"/>
well; or <hi>Deal kindly and truly</hi> with thy ſelf? Say, <hi>Wilt thou go,</hi> and <hi>Live with</hi> thy SAVIOUR, and Live <hi>upon</hi> Him, and Live <hi>unto</hi> Him?</q> Upon thy Hearty ſpeaking of this One Word, <hi>I will go;</hi> or, <hi>I will be the Lords!</hi>—the Point is gain'd; and thy Triumphant Song may be that; Cant. II. 16. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am His.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there muſt be more particularity uſed, that we may have a diſtinct view of the <hi>Myſtical Marriage,</hi> which is now <hi>Proſecuting;</hi> I hope, I may ſay, <hi>Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and that you may come into it.</p>
            <p>O Our Evangelized People, Your Great SAVIOUR does make to every Soul among you, the <hi>Propoſal,</hi> O Gracious and Marvellous <hi>Propoſal!</hi> of an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him. Your SAVIOUR is this Day fulfilling that Word; Hoſ. II. 16. <hi>At that Day, ſaith the Lord, thou ſhalt call me, Iſhi;</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>My Husband.</hi> That ONE WORD heartily ſpoken, will aſſure you of His being ſo.</p>
            <p>There is to be a <hi>Regular Proceedure</hi> in the <hi>Marriage.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Firſt; There is the <hi>Fathers Conſent</hi> in the Matter. GOD the FATHER has
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002040_0016_0FBA856C938EC278"/>
given His <hi>Conſent</hi> unto it, that Thy SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR ſhould <hi>Marry</hi> Himſelf unto thee. It is a <hi>Match</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> making. We read, Mat. XXII. 2. <hi>A King made a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for His Son.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Marriage</hi> of thy SAVIOUR, unto Thee, O thou Soul now under Invitations unto thy SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR. Of our SAVIOUR we find it ſaid, <hi>Unto us a Son is given; His Name ſhall be called, Wonderful.</hi> GOD the <hi>Father</hi> has given His own <hi>Son,</hi> to be <hi>Married</hi> unto thee; A Thing that is <hi>Wonderful!</hi> He is Thy <hi>Father</hi> too; Tho' thou haſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt Him; wandred from Him. Return, O Prodigal, Return unto thy <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Then does He alſo give thee unto thy SAVIOUR. Thou wilt be found One of thoſe, of whom thy SAVIOUR ſays, Joh. XVII. 9. <hi>Thoſe whom Thou haſt given me.</hi> And that thou mayſt be <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi> unto thy SAVIOUR, 'tis a Thing which our <hi>Heavenly Father</hi> does <hi>deviſe means</hi> to bring it about. The GOD who retains the Right of a <hi>Father</hi> over thee, and has thee at His Diſpoſal, does Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, Encourage, Command, thy <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> unto thy SAVIOUR. <hi>None come unto the Son, except the Father draw them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002040_0017_0FBA856DDBE94380"/>
Secondly, Thy SAVIOUR does <hi>Offer</hi> to be unto Thee, all that the <hi>Beſt Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> in the World can be; All that can be expected from a SAVIOVR <hi>Eſpous'd</hi> unto thee. What thy SAVIOUR does in the <hi>Glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed GOD</hi> ſpeak unto thee, is This; <hi>I would Marry my ſelf unto thee.</hi> How amply 'tis Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed! Hoſ. II. 19, 20. <hi>I will Eſpouſe thee unto me for ever, yea, I will Eſpouſe thee unto me, in Juſtice and in Judgment, and in Kindneſs, and in Mercies. I will even Eſpouſe thee unto me in Faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wilt thou more Particularly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the Heart-breaking Tenders of thy SAVIOUR, who is now <hi>Eſpouſing</hi> of thee! Oh! Hearken to them; And at the very Moment when thy SAVIOUR Tenders Himſelf with His Bleſſings to thee, reply unto Him; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, I Accept thee; Be thou unto me, ſuch a SAVIOUR.</hi> The Thing admits of no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>
            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it: <q>Shall I make thee <hi>One with me;</hi> ſo much <hi>One</hi> with me, that in my <hi>Fulfilling of all Righteouſneſs,</hi> and in my <hi>Riſing from the

            </p>
            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I bring thee to have <hi>my Father</hi> for <hi>thy Father?</hi>
               </q> This is according to what He ſpeaks to the Believer; Joh. XX. 17. <hi>I aſcend unto my Father and your Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I inveſt thee with my <hi>Unſearchable Riches?</hi> Bring thee to be a <hi>Joynt-Heir</hi> with me, and <hi>Inherit all things!</hi>
               </q> This is according to what He ſpeaks to the Believer; Prov. VIII. 18. <hi>With me are durable Riches.</hi>

            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I <hi>Feed</hi> thee?

            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I <hi>Cloath</hi> thee with the <hi>Garments of Praiſe?</hi> Defend thee with a <hi>Durable Cloathing,</hi>

and Adorn thee with a <hi>Covering of ſpangled Robes,</hi> which <hi>are inlaid with Golds</hi>
               </q> This is according to what we read of the Believer; Rev. XIX. 8. <hi>Granted, to be array'd in fine Linnen, clean &amp; white; the fine Linnen of the Righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I <hi>Inſtruct</hi> thee, <hi>Direct</hi> thee, <hi>Adviſe</hi> thee, and help thee always to <hi>know the Things of thy Peace?</hi>
               </q> This is according to what He ſpeaks to the Believer; Pſal. XXXII. 8. <hi>I will inſtruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou ſhalt go; I will guide thee with mine Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I be a <hi>Shield</hi> unto thee, and ſhelter thee from every thing that may threaten to injure thee?</q> This is according to what He ſpeaks to the Believer; Zech. II. 8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of mine Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I <hi>dwell with</hi> thee, and make thee ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I am near unto thee; and by the influences of my Grace render thee <hi>Fruitful</hi> unto GOD; <hi>Zealous of Good Works,</hi> and <hi>Fruitful</hi> in them?</q> This is according to what He ſpeaks to the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;

Hoſ. XIV. 8. <hi>From me is thy fruit found.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Once more; Thy SAVIOUR <hi>Offers</hi> it; <q>Shall I bring thee into my <hi>Fathers Houſe,</hi> and the <hi>King bring thee into His Chambers,</hi> and then fill thee with <hi>Joy Unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> from wondrous, endleſs, inconceivable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of my <hi>Love</hi> unto thee; and ſhall I give thee to enjoy all the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings of the Heavenly Places?</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002040_0021_0FBA8573A36E1568"/>
Vicious, How Obdurate muſt be the Heart, which will not hearken to it! The Heart which will not comply, like an <hi>Abigail,</hi> when an Eſpouſal unto a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was propoſed unto her; <hi>Let me be Received among the Servants of my Lord!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings on the Finiſhing Stroke.</p>

Thy SAVIOUR ſaying, <hi>I would Marry my ſelf unto thee;</hi> Let thy Heart now ſpeak that ONE WORD unto Him, <hi>Do it, O my SAVIOUR!</hi> 'Tis done imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.

            <p>That ONE WORD, the <hi>Hearty</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, will <hi>Eſpouſe</hi> thee to thy SAVIOUR, and ſecure thy Eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; I will ſet before my Hearers the Diſpoſitions which it is to be ſpoke withal.</p>
            <p>And, Firſt; Shall not thy Mind be ſtruck and fill'd with Admiration at the <hi>Grace</hi> of thy SAVIOUR; That ever ſuch an One ſhould ſay, <hi>I would Marry my ſelf unto thee!</hi> The Handmaid of the Lord ſaid; Luk.

A LORD, who is <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> and <hi>Lord of all!</hi> The <hi>LORD of Hoſts;</hi> and One who has <hi>All Power in Heaven and Earth given unto Him!</hi> A LORD, who is <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and the <hi>King of Glory!</hi> A LORD, who is <hi>Worſhipped by all the

Angels,</hi> and who <hi>Humbles Himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Things in the Heavens;</hi> What then, to <hi>Eſpouſe</hi> Himſelf unto ſorry things upon <hi>Earth?</hi> Yea, a LORD who is <hi>Equal with GOD,</hi> and very GOD; No leſs than the <hi>Being</hi> who is <hi>Over all, GOD Bleſſed forever.</hi> For ſuch an One to ſay unto us, <hi>I would Marry my ſelf unto thee!</hi> O Peerleſs Goodneſs!

But, then, who art Thou, O Deſpicable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who art Thou, That ever this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious LORD ſhould <hi>Eſpouſe</hi> thee unto Him? A ſorry, ſilly, ſinful Creature! For ſuch a <hi>Monarch</hi> to <hi>Marry</hi> ſuch a <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;</hi> One ſo <hi>wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked!</hi> For One ſo Beautiful in all <hi>Perfections,</hi> to <hi>Marry</hi> one full of ſuch loathſome <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and ſhocking <hi>Deformities!</hi> For Him to ſee thee caſt out unto the <hi>Loathing of thy Perſon,</hi> and yet now be the <hi>Time of His Love</hi> unto thee! Oh! When and where can we find a Parallel! Soul, Admire the <hi>Grace</hi> of thy SAVIOUR. With the Tranſports of an Admiring Soul, Cry out, <hi>O my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, That ever Thou ſhouldeſt Eſpouſe unto thy ſelf, a fooliſh and a filthy Creature,

worthy of nothing but the utmoſt Abhorrence, and a Condemnation to a Devouring Fire, to Everlaſting Burnings! I am amazed! I am amazed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; Tho' the Hearty ſpeaking of ONE WORD, will <hi>Eſpouſe</hi> thee to thy SAVIOUR, yet ſenſibly feel, yet ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly own, thy ſelf unable to ſpeak that <hi>One Word,</hi> until thy SAVIOUR ſhall pleaſe to enable thee. The <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we come into an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> to our SAVIOVR, has this very truly affirmed of it, <hi>It is the Gift of GOD.</hi> Soul, If thou wouldſt have it <hi>given</hi> thee, the way is to count it ſo. Wouldſt thou be <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> unto thy SAVIOUR? Thy SAVIOUR muſt then hear that cry from thee, Cant.

            <p>I have done.</p>
            <p>And now, a Soul come into an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> with a Lovely SAVIOUR, moſt certainly will above all things deſire &amp; ſtudy to <hi>Pleaſe</hi> Him. O Soul <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> unto the SON of GOD, By this Mark, Thou ſhalt know that thou art ſo; <hi>Know that thou art paſſed from Death to Life.</hi> There will nothing in this World ſo powerfully deter thee from every thing that the Light of GOD in thee ſhall condemn as an <hi>Evil thing,</hi> as this, <hi>My SAVIOUR will be offended at it!</hi> Nothing will be unto thee ſuch a powerful incentive &amp; perſwaſive to <hi>Patient continuance in all well-doing,</hi> as this, <hi>My SAVIOUR will be gratify'd with it!</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And indeed, the Crime of <hi>Adultery [I have ſeen an Horrible Thing,</hi> ſaith the Lord!] has in this thing a very ſingular Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. As it is the blackeſt and vileſt <hi>Injuſtice</hi> that can be committed, and a moſt Flagrant <hi>Perjury</hi> violating a moſt ſolemn <hi>Oath</hi> of GOD; So it is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Breach upon that Conformity to the <hi>Union</hi> between our SAVIOUR and His People, where of <hi>Marriage</hi> is Ordained for an Exhibition. <hi>Shall not I viſit for ſuch Things, ſaith the Lord, &amp; ſhall not my Soul he avenged on the Married, who do ſuch Things?</hi> Indeed, tho' ſome Countries make it <hi>Capital,</hi> yet for the moſt part, <hi>An Evil &amp; Adulterous Generation</hi> ſo prevails, that the Crime rarely meets with any due Puniſhment among the Children of Men, But GOD will not let this <hi>wickedneſs</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Principal Direction</hi> for a Good Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the <hi>Married State</hi> is that; Eph.

               <p>A <hi>Marriage</hi> carried on, with ſuch a Regard unto the <hi>Second Adam</hi> in it; what a Rare Courſe is herein taken, to abate, and prevent, much of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> which every <hi>Marriage</hi> in <hi>this World,</hi> is likely to be more or leſs Encumbred &amp; Embittered withal!

               </p>
