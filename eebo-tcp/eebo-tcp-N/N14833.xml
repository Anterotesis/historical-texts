            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FREQUENTLY obſerving the doctrine of repentance treated of in ſuch a manner as is difficult to underſtand, in conſiſtency with the goſpel of divine grace; it has often exerciſed my mind to enquire from the ſcriptures, after a ſatisfactory view of it; and finding that after our Lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when that event took place which explained the ſcriptures, he opened the underſtanding of the diſciples that they might underſtand them, and ſaid unto them,—<hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer and to riſe again the third day;</hi> as in Luke xxiv. 40.46. It is added in Verſe 47, <hi>and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In inquiring into the nature or meaning of repentance, it may aſſiſt me to view every part of this paſſage. As,</p>
            <p>What may I underſtand by repentance: What by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins: What by its being preached in his name: How it concerns all nations; and, Why it was to begin at Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What may be underſtood by repentance.</p>
            <p>Repentance is here brought in as that which the death and reſurrection of Chriſt prepared a way for the proclamation of:—He ſaid, <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer and to riſe from the dead the third day</hi>; and that repentance &amp;c. here is a connexion between the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018809_0003_0FA8234B96827F38"/>
ſufferings and reſurrection of Chriſt, and the proclamation of repentance, as an act of grace founded thereupon, and iſſued for the encouragement of the rebel to return; who other ways could look for nothing but deſtruction. In this view it is the gracious call of the offended Sovereign to his revolted creatures, to return to him as their rightful owner and Lord.—Iſaiah xxxi. 6. <hi>Turn ye unto him, from whom the children of Iſrael have deeply revolted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. What may be underſtood by remiſſion of ſins.</p>
            <p>Sins or treſpaſſes are called debts, <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 12.15. When a perſon is in debt, it is plain that law and juſtice demand remittance until full payment is made; the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the debt is its remiſſion, and this remiſſion ſatisfies the demands of law and juſtice, which were againſt the debtor: Here then remiſſion is full ſatisfaction to that law, of which ſin is a tranſgreſſion, and to that juſtice which demands penalty of the tranſgreſſor; for unleſs law and juſtice be compleatly ſatisfied, there is no remiſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What by its being preached in his name.</p>
            <p>Why, ſurely there is no other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved, either from the deluſion, ignorance and darkneſs, whereby we have forſaken the right way, or whereby we may be returned to our rightful owner, or whereby law and juſtice are ſatisfied. So then he himſelf is eminently the way in all theſe reſpects. <hi>Gallations</hi> iv. 4, 5. <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law</hi>: The law had a demand of perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon them that were under it, which to them was impoſſible in their own perſons; he as their head, and in their ſtead, is brought in; in the volume of the book, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lo! I come to do thy will</hi>: So that whatever the law required, was perfectly obeyed by him who did always the thing that pleaſed the father, who delighted to do his will, and could not be convinced of ſin, but could ſay, <hi>I was upright before him, I have glorified thee on earth, and finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do</hi>; ſo that he perfectly obeyed the law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:018809_0004_0FA8234E5B9AF0B8"/>They that were under the law were under the curſe, he as the Redeemer of them that were under the law, was made a curſe for us, ſo ſatisfied the penalty of the law, which is manifeſt in his reſurrection from the dead; for when law and juſtice took hold of him as head of the human nature, (as if he were the only tranſgreſſor) all being conſidered in him; he became our ſurety, and the Lord laid the iniquities of us all upon him. Now unleſs law and juſtice have full ſatisfaction, the ſurety is not diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but law and juſtice being fully ſatisfied, he <hi>having made peace by the blood of his croſs; it was not poſſible he ſhould be holden of death.—Death hath no more domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him.</hi>—Therefore the ſurety is legally diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Thus his reſurrection from the dead evidences his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of what he was made under the law for, <hi>i. e.</hi> To redeem them that were under the law; ſo then the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt proves him <hi>our Redeemer.</hi>— Whoſe Redeemer?—Them that were under the law. Then we belong to him by right of redemption, and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him as our rightful owner, repenting of our eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and alienation from him: But is there any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement hereunto: May we be received into favour? Yes!—Repentance and remiſſion of ſins. Repentance with remiſſion of ſins is preached in his name, and becauſe there is full remiſſion, there is the fulleſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to repentance. There is no other name that repentance will do to be preached in; call a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the name of law and juſtice: Repent for the curſes of the law, the wrath of God, the demands of juſtice are againſt you, and will ſurely and ſuddenly overtake you, except you repent; and it may drive him to endeavour to hide himſelf as Adam among the trees of the garden, and when he finds he cannot, it may drive him to deſpair; for repentance cannot ſatisfy law or juſtice, or appeaſe the divine anger: Neither is it in them to produce repentance, they may ſtir up enmity, and drive to deſpair, while the goſpel is out of ſight.—It is the prerogative of our Redeemer that has fully remitted our ſins.— <hi>He is exalted to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018809_0005_0FA8234E89781280"/>Among all nations this is to be preached, Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>for God hath ſhewed me</hi> (ſaith Peter) <hi>that I ſhould call no man common or unclean; what God hath ſanctified, that call thou not common.</hi> There is neither Jew nor Greek, Barbarian, Cythian, bond or free, male or female that is excluded. Repentance and remiſſion of ſins is to be preached among all nations: If there were not full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, how could it be preached, or how could they be called to repentance? But there is. He that is truth has ordered it to be preached as a truth among all nations; but as he was rejected at Jeruſalem, are not they excluded? <hi>No, Verily: It is to be preached among all nations,</hi> BEGIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING AT JERUSALEM. What though they like fiſhes, do all they can to eſcape the goſpel net, will not he that made his Apoſtles fiſhers of men, ſo direct that net, as finally to take them in, with the fullneſs of the Gentiles, ſo that all Iſrael may be ſaved, as it written: It is written, therefore it ſhall be accompliſhed: Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 25, to 32, with the parallel paſſages in the prophet.</p>
            <p>But we may enquire if this view of repentance be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſcriptures of the old and new teſtament.—</p>
            <p>We find when <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1ſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> viii. 47, praying for the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> carried captive for their ſins, ſays, if they ſhall bethink themſelves, and repent, and make ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and return with all their heart, &amp;c. then hear their prayer, &amp;c. Verſe 51 ſhews the ground of this prayer, <hi>for they are thy people, and thine inheritance.</hi>—The idea of their being his people, and his inheritance, appears neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſhew the aggravations of their folly in ſinning againſt him and the neceſſity of repenting and returning to their rightful owner.—<hi>They are thine inheritance which thou had redeemed,</hi> Pſalm lxxiv 2. And when they are called to repentence in the prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> chap. ii. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is <hi>turn to the Lord</hi> YOUR GOD. In <hi>Jeremiah</hi> xxvi. 13. (though a time of the greateſt degeneracy) they are thus called upon <hi>now amend your ways and doings, and obey the voice of the Lord</hi> YOUR GOD: And in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lv. 7, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the unrighteous his own imaginations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018809_0006_0FA8234FB4BDFFB8"/>
unto the Lord, and he will have mercy, and to</hi> OUR GOD <hi>he will abundantly pardon:</hi> And in <hi>Hoſea</hi> xiv. 1, <hi>O Iſrael, return to the Lord</hi> THY GOD. When God by the prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his 3d chapter, calls <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> to repentance, verſe 1, 7, 12, <hi>Return again to me, ſaith the Lord. Turn thou unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Return thou backſliding Iſrael ſaith the Lord.</hi> In verſes 14 and 22, their obligation thereto, and the ground of their encouragement is mentioned:—Verſe 14, <hi>Return for I am married unto</hi> YOU:—Verſe 22, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ye backſliding children, I will heal your backſlidings,</hi> not <hi>and</hi> I will, as a condition (the <hi>and</hi> is there ſupplied by the tranſlators) but I will heal your backſlidings.—On this encouragement, which is the only all-ſufficient one, they are brought in ſaying <hi>behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord</hi> OUR GOD. And in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xliv, 22, it is fully expreſſed in a ſimilar manner to the paſſage in <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. now before us.</p>

ſuppoſed the Meſſiah would raiſe their nation to great world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, and ſet them above other nations, and that the moſt eſteemed among them ſhould be moſt promoted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: He calls them to repent of their worldly notions of Chriſt's kingdom: It was a kingdom of Heaven that was at hand, where every one was admitted and promoted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of the King in virtue of his own righteouſneſs, not according to their own ſuppoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal characters: So thoſe that were exalted in their own and others apprehenſions as mountains and hills, were brought low; and thoſe depreſſed with a ſenſe of their own vileneſs and unworthineſs, and who were juſtly eſteemed ſo by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, low as vallies, without any encouragement in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are exalted, agreeable to <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s propheſy, chap. xl. 4, <hi>Every valley ſhall be exalted, and every mountain and hill ſhall be brought low, the crooked ſhall be made ſtrait, and the rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee together, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have a view of a perfect plain, where one ſhould not obſtruct or overtop another, in viewing the object to be revealed.—<hi>The glory of the Lord:</hi> And as they all expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed benefit in that kingdom from their own characters; ſome expected to be foremoſt on account of their own ſuppoſed good characters, and others depreſſed and deſpairing for want of ſuch worthineſs, they are called to repent of their error and miſtake,—it was a kingdom of Heaven that was at hand, where none were admitted or excluded on account of their own perſonal character, but every one admitted on account of the perfect character of the Meſſiah.—<hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed</hi>—the glory of divine wiſdom, juſtice, grace and mercy—the glory of all the divine attributes and perfections, harmonizing in the method of ſalvation, by Jeſus Chriſt, according to <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxxv. 10, 11, <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace have kiſſed: Truth ſhall ſpring out of the earth, and righteouſneſs ſhall look down from Heaven.</hi> Thus the glory of the Lord is revealed in him who is the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018809_0008_0FA82350D26A2068"/>
of his glory, the light of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord is in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom dwells the fullneſs of the God-head: In him, the glory of the Lord is revealed, and in his time and way all fleſh ſhall ſee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken.</p>
            <p>If what has been ſaid of <hi>John's</hi> preaching <hi>"for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is at hand,'</hi> be agreeable to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then we are to underſtand the preaching of Jeſus in <hi>Mathew</hi> iv. 17. <hi>"Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> i. 15, <hi>"The time is fulfilled: The kingdom of Heaven is at hand: Repent ye and believe the goſpel, (The glad tidings, the good news of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt"</hi>) and the preaching of the twelve that Jeſus ſent out two by two, <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 12, who <hi>went out and preached that men ſhould repent,</hi>—in the ſame view.</p>
            <p>When Jeſus aroſe from the dead, evidencing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his character, obedience and ſacrifice; evidencing that juſtice was fully ſatisfied; then repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins are preached in his name: There can be no encouragement to repentance without remiſſion of ſins, if there be not full remiſſion in the perfect work of Chriſt, all is terror, deſpair, alienation and enmity. <hi>I ſaid there is no hope, no, for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them, will go, Jeremiah</hi> ii. 25. Let this truth, the doctrine of remiſſion of ſins, be clear, and there are the higheſt motives, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragmets and obligations to repentance; there is room for it to be preached in the name of Jeſus among all nations, even beginning at Jeruſalem: If we need any further, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 20. <hi>Though the times of ignorance God winked at, but now he hath commanded all men every where to repent.</hi> Now ſince his reſurrection hath he commanded. Conſider the dignity of the commander, and the authority of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Pſalm</hi> xxxiii. 9. <hi>He ſpake and it was: He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and it ſtood.</hi> The Apoſtle purſues the thought from his reſurrection to his exaltation, as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> v. 30, 31. <hi>The God of our fathers raiſed up Jeſus whom ye ſlew and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand, a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018809_0009_0FA823519ABD0050"/>
forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> xi. 18. we have a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men actually taking place: <hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles granted repentance unto life.</hi> How is this evidenced? Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they received or believed the Apoſtles teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the way of acceptance with God in every nation. It was according to <hi>the word which God ſent to the children of Iſrael, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt who is Lord of all,</hi> his being anointed with the Holy Ghoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> going about doing good, his death and reſurrection, and the evidences of it, together with the teſtimony of the Prophets concerning him, as we ſee in <hi>Acts</hi> x. 34 to 44. This preaching being accompanied with the Holy Ghoſt, gained full credit on the minds of the Gentiles, which when the church heard, they held their peace, and glorified God, ſaying, then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life: So that as ſoon as they believed the report of the Goſpel concerning the life, death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, —by the firſt of which the precepts of the law are perfectly oboyed; by the next the penalty of it is ſuffered, or the debt to it remitted; and by the third, viz his reſurrection we have the full evidence thereof. As ſoon as this is believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſaid, then hath God alſo granted repentance unto life, the immediate inſeparable effect of believing the remiſſion of ſins in his name</p>
            <p>This is illuſtrated in the <hi>Theſſelonians,</hi> when they believed the Apoſtles teſtimony, in the 17th of <hi>Acts,</hi> he ſays, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 1.9. <hi>What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to ſerve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he had raiſed from the dead.</hi> To turn to God from idols is repentance. This was in conſequence of the entrance of the Apoſtles among them, or of the <hi>Theſelonians</hi> believing their report. What was their report among them? See <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 2.3. <hi>Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered and riſen again from the dead, and that Jeſus whom I preach unto you, is Chriſt,</hi> verſe 4. <hi>Some of them believed.</hi> Thoſe believers compoſed

the church of the <hi>Theſſelonians,</hi> of whom it is ſhewn, how they turned to God from idols.</p>
            <p>So in the 20th of <hi>Acts</hi> 21, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back nothing that was profitable, but, <hi>teſtifing both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks repentance towards God, and (or</hi>

               <hi>even) faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> His preaching the faith as has been above ſhewn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was virtually preaching repentance, as it immediately called and led therto. Thus the old and new Teſtament jointly evidences the ſame truth, that <hi>repentance and remiſſion of ſins is preached in the name of Jeſus among all nations, beginning at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can repentance be preached otherwiſe. If there be not remiſſion in the perfect work of Chriſt, he is not our Redeemer, and WE cannot be called upon, when he ſays, <hi>return, for I have redeemed thee; but be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners.</hi> He IS riſen from the dead, he IS our Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we belong to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be his name we are called to return, for he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us.

            <p>Objection.—But there are two paſſages in the new teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament that ſeem at firſt view to mention repentance as a condition — The firſt is <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 38. <hi>Then Peter ſaid unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But if it be ſafe to underſtand this <hi>for</hi> &amp;c. as the reaſon or ground of the call to repentance, <hi>Repent, becauſe of the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> the difficulty will diſappear, and the paſſage appear fully conſiſtent with the other paſſages that have been brought to view; and this view I think may be fairly gathered from what the Apoſtle had before been
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018809_0011_0FA82353528D5808"/>
preaching of the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, in which there is remiſſion, and the evidence of it. But if it be ſtill urged as a condition, it can be no other ways, than as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe take place in our minds, for though there is remiſſion in the one ſacrifice,—and ſo no more offering for ſin as the Apoſtle expreſſed it, <hi>Hebrews</hi> x. 18, yet it connot take place in the minds of any while they remain in unbelief and impenitence: Yet their unbelief cannot make the truth of God of none effect. While perſons remain in unbelief they muſt remain in impenitence; for how can any repent of being in a wrong way until they know Jeſus who is <hi>the way</hi>; of their being in error, until they know Jeſus, who is <hi>the truth</hi>; and of their being in a ſtate of death, and all their works, dead works, until they know Jeſus, who is <hi>the life.</hi> Or how can any repent of their alienation and enmity until they know God in Chriſt, the juſt God and the Saviour—their rightful owner—their Lord Redeemer.</p>
            <p>It may be what is above ſaid may help to illuſtrate the other paſſage in <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 19, <hi>Repent ye therefore and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come, from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repent ye therefore.—Therefore</hi> refers to what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;—what the Apoſtle had been preaching concerning the holy one, and the juſt—the prince of life, his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, in which, as before, there was remiſſion, and the evidence of it;—in which there was enough to furniſh even thoſe that were charged with killing the prince of life with hope,—with the "Apprehenſion of the mercy of God in Chriſt," as even the Aſſembly's Catechiſm expreſſes it—ſo as to give them ground of encouragement to repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted</hi>;—be turned from your error, alienation and enmity, to allegiance to the prince of life, that your ſins may be blotted out:—For as infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and impenitence are inſeparable; ſo is faith, repentance and allegiance:—While the former continues, guilt, diſtreſs, fear, horror and perplexity, remain on the mind.</p>
            <p>When the knowledge of Chriſt, or faith, or the belief of

               <head>I. TO THE AUTHOR OF THE PAMPHLET.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS your pamphlet was probably the occaſion of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going reflections. I have taken the freedom to addreſs you on the ſubject. When I read your work, if I recollect the idea the doctrine there advanced gave me, it was this, That Chriſt died for all, to bring them into a ſalvable ſtate, yet all would not be ſaved, though they might, if they repented, conſequently God's glory would finally illuſtriouſly appear in the everlaſting condemnation of the finally impenitent.</p>
               <p>And as the ear trieth words, as the mouth taſteth meats, I found it did not ſound like the report of the goſpel, and on enquiring into the doctrine of repentance, I have collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the thoughts which are preſented to you, I hope in love and faithfulneſs. The idea I received from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the old teſtament is, that he ſhould finiſh the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion—make an end of ſin—make reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity—and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs. The new teſtament witneſſes that he did.—The teſtator appeals to the father—<hi>I have glorified thee on earth: I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> and cries out on the croſs, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and ſeals it with his blood, and witneſſes it in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when he ſhews himſelf alive to his choſen wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who teſtified to the ſame truth.—One paſſage may ſuffice: In <hi>Hebrews</hi> x, 11th the apoſtle ſpeaking of the prieſthood under the law, ſays, and every prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtering, and offering oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices, which can never take away ſin, but this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, forever ſat down on the right hand of God. They ſtood as thoſe that had not done—could not accompliſh: But the High Prieſt Jeſus after he had offered one ſacrifice <hi>ſat down</hi> as having finiſhed his work, <hi>finiſhed tranſgreſſion—made an end of ſin—made reconciliation for iniquity—and brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs.</hi> Verſe 18th ſays, <hi>Where remiſſion of thoſe is, there is no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the ſcripture leads to full remiſſion, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, to a finiſhed work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:018809_0014_0FA823555B895100"/>But your doctrine appears to me to lead to an unfiniſhed work, dependent on the exerciſes, the exertions, in ſhort, the will of the creature, and becauſe they will not come, that they might have life, he muſt glorify himſelf in the deſtruction of multitudes for whom he died.</p>
               <p>Let me aſk you, Sir, How? Is his mercy glorified?—Is his juſtice ſatisfied? Is his power made manifeſt? Is he mighty to ſave? He will have all men to be ſaved, not he <hi>would,</hi> but he will. Who hath reſiſted his will? Is it the will of the creature?<note n="*" place="bottom">Two Clergy men, converting together of the doctring of the final uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation of all men, very much wondered at each other;— one held that all for whom Chriſt died ſhould certainly be ſaved, but that he did not die for all;—The other that he died for all, but all would not be ſaved, becauſe they would not come to him. Said the latter to the former, I'm very much aſtoniſhed at you, that you do not embrace that doctrine—For if I believed as you, I ſhould, for nothing is more clear from ſcripture, than that Chriſt died for all:—The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anſwered, I as much wonder at you, that you do not embrace it. I am ſure I ſhould, if I believed as you, for if he died for all there is no power on earth or hell can hinder their ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—He cannot be diſappointed.</note> Cannot he make them willing in the day of his power? His people ſhall be— And are not all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for whom he died? But I forbear; wiſhing to ſay no more than is ſufficient to diſcharge my conſcience in love and faithfulneſs to you. But I cannot paſs over your eſſay without taking notice of the title, to compare it with the ſcriptures.</p>

               <q>Divine Glory brought to view, in the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ungodly.</q>
               <p>On enquiry, How can this be in conſiſtence with thoſe ſcriptures? I anſwer, it can be no other ways in a conſiſtence with them, than in the fulfilment of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s prophecy, chap. liii. 4, 5.6, <hi>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our ſorrows: Yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, bruiſed for our iniquities: The chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018809_0015_0FA8235827848FD8"/>
are healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray; we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all</hi>:—So dying for the ungodly, he juſtifies the ungodly, and the divine glory is brought to view illuſtriouſly to eternity herein. For mercy is glorified— juſtice is ſatisfied—and he ſpeaks in righteouſneſs, when he manifeſts himſelf mighty to ſave.</p>
               <p>But view the title page as it appears intended, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation is their for a poor, deſtitute, ungodly creature? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him on a death bed, agonizing with anguiſh of ſoul, nothing ſhort of perſuaſion that there was an all-ſufficient remedy for his deplorable condition, could afford him the leaſt comfort or relief. Were you conſtrained in this ſad hour to adminiſter them from thoſe texts, in the belief of your title, would he not ſay, I am mocked? But perhaps you might not offer them on ſuch an occaſion. Why? Are they not ſcripture truths? Did not Chriſt die for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and in proof, his dying for our ſins was accepted; he roſe again for our juſtification, and is not the knowledge of this truth all-ſufficient to quiet the moſt guilty conſcience, and give hope towards God? Would it be ſafe to tell him the law of God ſtands in full force againſt him, when Jeſus came to redeem them that were under the law? Would it not amount to denying that Jeſus is come in the fleſh? Would it be ſafe to tell ſuch a man to exert himſelf in any way, however deſcribed, as if this was the laſt opportunity, and his all depended on it? It would indeed be to mock him! when his all depends on what Jeſus Chriſt finiſhed, and the relief of his mind on the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Suffer me a little further, if in looking over this dreadful title, I expreſs my ſurpriſe that to it ſhould be added in the title page, <hi>Search the ſcriptures</hi>; when you attempt to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate it by reaſoning, without producing one text to ſhew that the Ever-bleſſed ſpeaks of condemnation as his glory. When the ſcriptures ſpeak of the divine glory as manifeſt in his grace, mercy and forgiveneſs—when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in <hi>Exodus</hi> xxxiii. 18, <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory,</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, <hi>I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018809_0016_0FA8235855BEDD30"/>
will be gacious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy</hi>: Here goodneſs, grace and mercy is his glory. In <hi>Proverbs</hi> xix. 11, we read, <hi>the diſcretion of a man deferreth his anger, and</hi> HIS GLORY <hi>to paſs over a tranſgreſſion.</hi>—If we underſtand the proverb, and it, interpretation, it doubtleſs refers to the man Chriſt Jeſus, in whom we have the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pſalm</hi> cii. 16, it is ſaid, <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Zion, he ſhall appear in</hi> HIS GLORY.—How is this made manifeſt?—In regarding the prayer of the deſtitute; in hearing the groaning of the priſoner,—and ſaving the ſons of death, <hi>To declare his name in Zion, and his praiſe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>:—That is his name, <hi>Forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſins,</hi> through the ſurety whom he would <hi>by no means clear,</hi> for <hi>the Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all, and ſpared not his own ſon, but delivered him up for us all, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, according to the riches of his grace</hi>: Riches of his grace; is not this his glory? Yes, verily; the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us through Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The angel of the Lord came upon the ſhepherds, in <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 9, <hi>And the glory of the Lord ſhone round about them:</hi> How is this made manifeſt? <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays the angel, <hi>I bring you good tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which is Chriſt the Lord: Glory to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have briefly preſented theſe few paſſages, wiſhing you to turn to the ſcriptures, to view the divine glory, and if theſe texts, with what has been brought to view (in page 8,) of the glory of the Lord being revealed, was rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by thoſe that ſearch the ſcriptures, I doubt not it would lead into the underſtanding of many paſſages in the old teſtament, where the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud,—filled the tabernacle, filled the houſe, and the appearance of the likeneſs of the glory of the Lord, ſpoken of by Ezekiel, and many other paſſages, that ſpeak of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018809_0017_0FA82359923AD308"/>
Divine Glory, as they centre in Jeſus the antitype, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of glory; in whom the riches of his glory is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, who came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them; not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved. Indeed, Sir, if you think a few minutes, you cannot depiſe an invitation to this contemplation, for it is the final happineſs of thoſe given to Jeſus Chriſt, to be with him—to behold his glory.</p>
               <p>I would juſt take notice of what you ſay in page 50. <hi>"I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive therefore that every honch man that diſbelieves the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be free to declare it, and this plainly. I take liberty to add, that ſuch a declaration will come with peculiar propriety and weight from the pulpit Watchman, what of the night, it is the language of the Almighty to goſpel miniſters."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"With particular weight from the pulpit."</hi> I conceive the weight of any doctrine conſiſts in the evidence of its truth and divinity, not in the place where, or from whence it is delivered. Suppoſe a pulpit ornamented to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant degree, that the firſt ſight of it would ſtrike ii. of <hi>Chronicles</hi> xxxiii. 7, immediately into the mind: Or ſuppoſe the preacher ſo diſtinguiſhed in habit as immediately to bring to view the warning of Jeſus Chriſt to his diſciples in <hi>Mark</hi> xii. 38, and <hi>Luke</hi> xx. 46,—would it not tend to a greater caution of mind about the doctrines they deliver, ſo that all hope of weight and importance muſt come from the clear evidence of the truth, that it is indeed the word of God which worketh effectually in them that believe, which is the ſword of the ſpirit, yea, quick and powerful—ſharper than any two-edged ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Watchman, what of the night, it is the language of the Almighty to goſpel miniſters."</hi> However that may be, I am not able to ſay, but if it be ſo, goſpel miniſters are meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of peace,—good news—glad tidings: The founder of the goſpel was ſo. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lxi. 1, <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 18, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <hi>to preach the goſpel to the poor;</hi> and <hi>how beautiful upon the mountains, are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publiſheth peace; that bringeth good tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of good; that publiſheth ſalvation, that ſaith to Zion, thy God reigneth</hi>—not thy perverſe will, nor thy adverſary. The firſt preachers preached peace by Jeſus Chriſt; he is

Lord of all; and goſpel miniſters have now nothing elſe to bring to view but the preaching of Jeſus and his apoſtles — If that was to publiſh peace and glad tidings of ſalvation, your doctrine of eternal condemnation is its oppoſite, and cannot poſſibly bring peace or glad tidings of ſalvation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſubjects of it: But ſeeing <hi>God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, may WE be reconciled unto God.</hi>

               <head>II. TO ALL FOR WHOM CHRIST DIED,</head>
               <p>And bleſſed be God he taſted death for every man. For if there be any for whom he did not die, it would be mocking them to preach the goſpel to them, to tell them that the law is anſwered, that juſtice is ſatisfied, and mercy flows freely in a full conſiſtency therewith, that the only living and true God is the juſt God, and the ſaviour, and there is none elſe, to tell them of remiſſion of ſins, or call them to repentence, for certainly there could be no hope, if their ſins were not remitted they never can be, for Chriſt dieth no more, there is no more ſacrifice for ſin; but ſeeing the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith, is unto all, as well as upon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all may be called to repentance. FIRST, Such as appear in a ſtate of reſolved infidelity and impenitence, and choſe to live in prophaneſs and immorality, to ſuch repentence and remiſſion of ſins, in the name of Jeſus is preached: What though they deride the meſſengers, and the meſſage, they ſhall be brought hereto, for <hi>Firſt,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to call ſinners to repentence. The ſeveral paſſages where this is mentioned, viz. <hi>Matthew</hi> ix. 13, <hi>Mark</hi> ii 7, and <hi>Luke</hi> v. 32, have all referrence to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners — the phraſe for abandoned characters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews at that day: And were not they, and are not the ſame characters now, though differently deſcribed, wrong; are they not alienated from their rightful owner, are they not loſt;—if ſo, Chriſt came to ſave them; are they not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,—if ſo, he came to call them to repentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Jeſus ſent his diſciples to preach it in his name. <hi>And as the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from Heaven, and returneth not thither again, but watereth the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhall my word be,</hi> ſaith the Lord, by the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

chap. lv. 10, 11. <hi>That goeth out of my mouth, it ſhall not return unto me void, but it ſhall accompliſh what I pleaſe, and proſper in the thing whereto I ſent it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Now he hath commanded all men every where to repent;</hi> and his commands ſhall be obeyed, for <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxlviii. <hi>he commanded, and angels, ſun, moon and ſtars, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the waters above them were created.</hi> 2 of <hi>Corinth.</hi> iv 6 — <hi>He commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs. Pſalm</hi> cvii. 25, <hi>He commandeth and raiſeth the ſtormy wind. Luke</hi> viii. 2, <hi>He commandeth even the winds and the waters, and they obey him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He is exalted, a prince and a ſaviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Propheſied of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxx. 18, <hi>Therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy.</hi> But it was to give repentence <hi>to Iſrael.</hi> It was not then fully manifeſted that they were to go to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: But from the time of <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s viſion, he was taught to call no man common, or unclean; and the Gentiles appeared to be fellow heirs, and of the ſame body; and that they were to preach among them the unſearchable riches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The long ſuffering patience of God is extended for this end 2. of <hi>Peter,</hi> iii. 9, the Lord is long ſuffering to us ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that all ſhould come to repentence, agreeable to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxx. 18. and therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious. Now put theſe things together, and ſhall the ſtout-heartedneſs and obſtinacy of the unbelieving impenitent and prophane children of men, diſappoint him. What will they do? He is wiſe in heart and mighty in ſtrength: None ever hardened himſelf againſt him and proſpered; there is no wiſdom, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord, who would ſet the briars and thorns againſt him in battle, he would go through them, and burn them together.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they would fain flee out of his hand; but where will they flee from his preſence? What the Lord ſaith by the prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> may be here brought to view, <hi>Amos</hi> ix. 2. <hi>He that fleeth of them hall not flee away, and he that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeth of them ſhall not be delivered; though they dig into hell, thence ſhall mine hand take them; though they climb up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, thence will I being them <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and though they
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018809_0020_0FA8235B8C693348"/>
hide themſelves in the top of Carmel, I will ſearch and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my ſight in the bottom of the ſea, thence will I command the ſerpent and he ſhall bite them.</hi> From hence it appears weak, fruitleſs and contemptible to ſet the obſtinacy of man againſt the end of the coming, the call, the command, the deſign of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, and the long-ſuffering patience of Jeſus Chriſt; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if we conſider <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xlv. 22, 23, where we have the divine oath that every knee ſhall bow; it may be added,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is the deſign of the ſecond coming of Jeſus Chriſt to convince all that are ungodly, of all their ungodly deeds, and of all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him, <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. Then every eye ſhall ſee him, and they that pierced him and all kindred of the earth ſhall wail becauſe of him, as we read <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 7. Compare this with <hi>Zech.</hi> xii. 10, and they ſhall look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only ſon, and be in bitterneſs for him as one is in bitterneſs for his firſt born Here is wailing, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bitterneſs at the ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, in the moſt expreſſive language we can imagine. See <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ix. 10, 18, 19, which perhaps none can form an adequate idea of, but ſuch as have been called <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto the deſcribed circumſtances; which yet cannot be viewed as the language of deſpair, for how then can we underſtand the following words, <hi>even ſo amen.</hi> But if we may underſtand <hi>John</hi> as ſpeaking of thoſe who pierced him being brought every knee of them to bow to him, with the wailing of repentence, then the <hi>even ſo amen</hi> appears agreeable to the ſpirit of the goſpel. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly then every mouth will be ſtopped, and all the world guilty before God, which when the apoſtle mentions, in <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 19, he adds, in verſe 21, <hi>But now the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God without the law is manifeſt, being witneſſed by the law, and the prophets, even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all that believe; For there is no difference,</hi> reſpecting the purchaſe of Chriſt, who died for all; and reſpecting the divine will, <hi>who will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth,</hi> which agree<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with <hi>Romans</hi> xi. 32. <hi>he hath
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018809_0021_0FA8235CB8BEE6B8"/>
concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy on all.</hi> This doctrine muſt be ſhocking to tradition, and no wonder, for <hi>O! the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God, how unſearchable his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out.</hi> It appears to agree with the end and deſign of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s prayer, for his own immediate diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and for them that ſhall believe through their word, as expreſſed <hi>John</hi> xvii. 21, 23. <hi>That they all may be one as thou father in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me. I in them and thou in me, that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> The very circumſtance that the diſciples were in, (verſe 8) and have known ſurely, that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me. The manifeſtation of this oneneſs I conceive to be what is called the manifeſtation of the ſons of God, which the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt expectation of the creature waiteth for. Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both believers and unbelievers, are in ſome way groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and traveling together for this, as we ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> viii 32. <hi>For we know that the whole creation</hi> (in the Bible margin it is every creature. I am informed it is the ſame word uſed in <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

Verſe 23, <hi>And not only they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ourſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, even we ourſelves groan within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body</hi> —the whole body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which Chriſt is the head.—This agrees with the deſign of Jeſus being made under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Thoſe of oppoſite character, that thank God they are not as other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but pride themſelves in their own religious characters, to the deſpiſing thoſe above mentioned. To ſuch repentence and remiſſion of ſins are preached in the name of Jeſus. Alas, if they look for remiſſion in their own name, or on account of any diſtinction in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will diſappoint them; for, ſays the prophet, all our righteouſneſs is as filthy rags: And <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of his, ſays, what things I counted

gain thoſe I count loſs for Chriſt. But what has been already ſaid on <hi>John</hi>'s preaching may ſuffice on this head.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Such as are diſtreſſed and perplexed for want of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, wiſhing for ſome inherent qualifications or to perform many external duties, to recommend them to the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or are ready to wiſh they were as ſuch and ſuch, who they apprehend to have high attainments, and great charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for piety, diſtreſſed with the anxious inquiry, wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhall I come before the Lord? Will he be pleaſed with coſtly ſacrifices—thouſands of rams, or ten thouſand rivers of oil, or my firſt born for my tranſgreſſion;—the ſuit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?—He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what good is the only all-ſufficient one, to recommend thee to to the divine favour, in the finiſhed work of Jeſus Chriſt, in which is full remiſſion of ſins, and a call to repent of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it any other where. <hi>God is love, and in this was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten ſon, that we might live through him. God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>How unſuitable is it for Chriſts diſciples to practice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that old Pharaſaick tradition, <hi>thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and hate thine enemy</hi>; when Jeſus reconciled them when they were enemies, and taught them to love their enemies.</p>

               <p>How unſuitable to the above-mentioned ground of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the finiſhed work of Chriſt, is every branch of conduct and converſation unbecoming the goſpel, when it lays the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of it under the moſt indiſpenſible, eternal obligations to look upon themſelves, their time, talents, intereſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, as not their own, but belonging to their redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to be ever employed to his glory. If theſe things be duly conſidered, with the various thoughts they lead to, they will open up reaſons for daily repentance to the believers of the goſpel, with a full conviction they can have no confidence in the fleſh, but their rejoicing muſt be in Chriſt Jeſus alone, to whom be glory forever.</p>
