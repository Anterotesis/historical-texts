            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>BOUT three Weeks ago, <hi>three</hi> young <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Girls, whoſe Names were <hi>Sprintz, Guttel,</hi> and <hi>Eſther,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Iſaac Veits</hi> and <hi>Sophia Mos;es,</hi> Jews, came to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Kahman</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Miniſter of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Church in <hi>Berlin.</hi> The eldeſt of 'em was Twelve Years old; (tho' the Mother gives out ſhe is but Nine:) The youngeſt was Eight, or, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretends, but Six.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001974_0004_0FBA3CF8E7EFE468"/>Theſe Children deſir'd to ſpeak with the Miniſter: As ſoon as he appeared, the eldeſt addreſs'd her ſelf to him firſt, and ſaid: She with her two <hi>Siſters were come to request his Protection and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that they had a great Deſire to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Chriſtian Religion, whereby they likewiſe might have Part in</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>the true God, who dyed for them, as well as for the rest of Mankind</hi>; adding, <hi>That the ſincere and unfeigned Love to this crucified God, conſtrained them hereto; and that they could not poſſibly live any longer with their Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr· <hi>Kahman,</hi> the Miniſter, was much ſurprized at what he heard, and began to think they had, perhaps, met with ſome ſevere Uſage at Home, which occaſioned their ſpeaking to him in this Manner: Wherefore he advis'd them to Return home again, and be hereafter more Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their Parents. But all three flung themſelves down at his Feet, begging and intreating him, in the Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> whom they loved and adored, to receive them; declaring withal, That nothing in this World had moved them to forſake
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001974_0005_0FBA3CFE40664F68"/>
their Parents Houſe, but the ſole View of becoming <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s choſen Ones, and to belong to Him alone; and that, Let Things go how they would with them, they were fully reſolv'd <hi>rather to dye, than to leave their Jeſus.</hi> Whereupon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter took them into his Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Parents having ſearched up and down for their Children a conſiderable Time in vain, came to hear at laſt they were at Mr. <hi>Kahman</hi>'s; to whom they went, and demanded their Children of him: He reply'd, he had ſent already an Account of the Caſe of theſe Children to his Majeſty the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>; and that it did not lie in his Power to deliver up the Children to them againſt their own Inclinations: However, he promiſed to ſay nothing to the Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders from his Majeſty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the King had received the Account, he appointed certain Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſioners, two of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> and two of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Perſwaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>Jablonski,</hi> Mr. <hi>Achenbach, Poſſard</hi> and <hi>Thering,</hi> with ſtrict Orders, to make
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001974_0006_0FBA3CFFA1056268"/>
an exact Enquiry into this Matter; and particularly to conſider, whether theſe Children might be taken into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Protection, in order to be brought up in the Chriſtian Religion, againſt their Parents Conſent, without infringing the Power that Parents have over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, grounded on divine and humane Right.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Commiſſioners ordered the Children to be brought before them, and appointed the Parents, in the mean while, to go into another Room adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where they might hear the whole Examination. Then they took the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and examined them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who all, as with one Voice decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>They would not return to their Parents again, but would be made Chriſtians, and Children of Eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appear'd, they could already ſay the <hi>Lord's-Prayer</hi> by Heart, as alſo ſeveral Texts out of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> with ſeveral Hymns: The youngeſt could alſo repeat the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi>: All which, they ſaid, they had learnt whilſt they were at Play with Chriſtian
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001974_0007_0FBA3D012D8B2630"/>
Children. Theſe they rehearſed with a wonderful Devotion; moſt ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, that they would never live nor die otherwiſe than Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>In order to try their Sincerity, the Reverend Perſons entruſted with this Matter, omitted nothing to repreſent the Life of a Chriſtian as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſy</hi> and <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome</hi> as poſſibly they could: However, after having done this, and layed before them, on the one Side, how they would be deſpiſed and forſaken, even among the Chriſtians themſelves, and be forced to work hard for their Livelihood: They replied, That they would work <hi>till the very Blood ſpurted out from their Nails,</hi> provided they might be made Children of Eternal Salvation; [and that] though they ſhould not be happy in this World, they hoped to be ſo in the next. And when it was repreſented to them, on the other Side, how eaſily and comfortably they might live among the <hi>Jews</hi>; and that their Father had made fine Cloaths for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they reply'd, <hi>They did not value that at all; the Cloaths muſt remain in the World; they would be Children of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001974_0008_0FBA3D02AB556240"/>
and not return to their Parents again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the Parents were call'd in, and the Children being placed before them, they began to ſpeak to them with abundance of Tenderneſs and Compaſſion; they fell upon their Necks, kiſs'd their very Hands and Feet, and melted away into Tears.</p>
            <p>The Children, not a little amazed hereat, declar'd with many Tears, they would become <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and not return to their Parents. The middlemoſt, in particular, as ſhe was very much preſſed by her Mother to go Home with her, anſwer'd: <hi>No! But you, Mother, ought rather to become a Chriſtian alſo.</hi> They ſought then to hide themſelves behind the Miniſters, who feigned to turn them off, ſaying:
<q>They did very ill to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Parents, who had ſuch a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Love for them, who would make them many fine Preſents, and had brought ſome along with them: That, on the contrary, they were to expect among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> nothing but <hi>Croſſes</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi>; they would hardly get enough to ſatisfy their Hunger; but,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001974_0009_0FBA3D041933D010"/>
in a Word, would be very Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parents being retir'd, and the Children once more earneſtly entreated to return Home with them, but to no purpoſe; it was at laſt propoſed, to them, That provided their Parents would alſo turn <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whether then they would be content to go along with them? To which they, with an uncommon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Satisfaction, immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd: That if their Parents would but become <hi>Chriſtians</hi> too, they ſhould be their Parents ſtill, and then they would go back with them, and endure with them any Hardſhip or Tribulation; otherwiſe they would never return; for that they loved <hi>Jeſus</hi> above all other Views, and would, with the higheſt Joy imaginable, take his Croſs upon them, and follow him; ſaying, They might if they pleaſed, put them into a <hi>Spin-Houſe,</hi> where they would be heartily willing to Labour: To which the youngeſt further added: If you will give me nothing, let me die of Hunger, or cut off my very Head; for I had rather loſe my Life, than be ſeparated from my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001974_0010_0FBA3D15CB638ED0"/>
               <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who dy'd for me; and if you refuſe to take me, he is always ready to receive me into his Arms. I will live and die with Him.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that no Perſon preſent could forbear Weeping at the Firmneſs of theſe Children, whoſe Speech was as ſound, as it was artleſs; particularly Dr. <hi>Jablonski,</hi> who has a deeper Knowledge in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion than moſt others.</p>
            <p>At laſt, their Parents were permitted to diſcourſe with 'em alone, which they did for ſeveral Hours together; but the Children expreſſing all along the ſame Reſolution, and proſtrating themſelves at laſt at the Feet of the Commiſſioners, they bid farewel to their Parents, that they might remain to <hi>Jeſus</hi> alone, and ſaid: <hi>That nothing had brought them thither but the Love of Jeſus, and no manner of Reaſon ſhould be powerful enough ever to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them from Him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>An Account of all this has been ſent to his <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Majeſty, whoſe Anſwer is daily expected. In the mean Time, the Commiſſioners have propoſed, that theſe Children might be inſtructed publickly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001974_0011_0FBA3D1AEAC91060"/>
in the Church; and when they were thoroughly grounded in the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that Leave ſhould be given, not only to their Parents, but to any <hi>Jew</hi> that would come and hear them, to make what Objections they could, which ſhould be anſwered by the Children ſo inſtructed.</p>
            <p>The Baptizing of theſe Children will be deferr'd till they are more advanced in Age, that none may deny this to be the Work of God; and 'tis hoped, that this Affair, carried on after this Manner, will tend to the Edification of many other <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Children have ſuch a tender Love for the very Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> that though they cannot as yet Read, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, knowing this Word, when they meet with it, they bow down upon it, and kiſs it with a thouſand Tears: And they will turn over whole Books to find this Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They aſſured us, that ſeveral other Children were of the ſame Mind with themſelves; but their Parents kept them cloſe at Home; notwithſtanding
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001974_0012_0FBA3D1DA5F2EB88"/>
they did not doubt but they would find Means to eſcape: For the Love of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> knew how to Counſel in all ſuch Caſes; and tho' the Parents ſhould watch them never ſo narrowly, it would in the End ſignify nothing at all, which they three knew by their own Experience.</p>

               <p>What Sweet and Heavenly Motions there have been particularly ſeen among many Children, in theſe Latter Years, doth appear from the ſeveaal Treatiſes publiſhed on that Account.— Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, whole Numbers of Children in <hi>Sileſia.</hi>— All theſe Motions are but ſo many <hi>Glimpſes,</hi> that Glance indeed at a Larger Power of Spiritual Gifts and Graces.

They are the <hi>Firſt-Fruits</hi> of the Spirit, and an <hi>Earneſt</hi> of a more Glorious Diſpenſation which ſhall follow in the Fulneſs of Time.

            <p>If but one Soul of all that <hi>Beloved Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> ſhould be found, and reach'd, and touch'd, by the Things to be now laid before them, it will be well worth all the Pains of theſe Expoſtulations.

Joſeph</hi> was not known to his Brethren, at the <hi>firſt</hi> Interview: Anon there came a <hi>Second,</hi> at which he made himſelf known unto them.

It was foretold by your Prophets, [Iſa. LIII. 2, 3.

You find all this, and much more, in the <hi>Fifty-third</hi> Chapter of your <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecies: A <hi>Chapter</hi> which has been bleſſed of God, for the Converſion of many in your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and indeed, it is to be wondred at, how any of you can ſhut your Eyes againſt the Light of ſo Bright a <hi>Chapter</hi>!

For an <hi>Holy One</hi> to come, with Maxims all evidently Calculated for the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I am the Son of God Incarnate, and my Sacrifice to God is the only Atonement that can be made for your Sins, and if you put your ſelves under my Conduct, I will bring you to everlaſting Life. To prove all this, I will Dye, you ſhall put me to Death; and on the Third Day I will Riſe from the Dead.</hi> This being accompliſhed in our JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, Oh! what can you reaſonably deſire more, to make you fall down, and cry out, <hi>Lord, we Believe and are Sure, that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the Living God</hi>? You your ſelves do in your moſt Celebrated Writings confeſs, That if JESUS be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Riſen from the Dead,</hi> He is One, whom you ought all to hearken to, and that He may claim a Power to ſuperſede any of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Inſtitutions. Indeed the Men of <hi>Ninive,</hi> who hearkened unto a <hi>Jonah,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had come alive out of the Belly of the Fiſh, will condemn thoſe who have not hearkened unto a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who comes up alive out of the Belly of the Earth, on the Third Day after he had been buried there. Now, that our JESUS is <hi>Riſen from the

Dead,</hi> is a <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> which has been Atteſted with as <hi>infallible Proofs,</hi> as ever any Matter that was in the World. After His <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> He appeared no leſs than <hi>Ten Times,</hi> and unto no leſs than <hi>five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> at one Time. Theſe <hi>choſen Witneſſes,</hi> converſed with Him, and ſatisfied all their Senſes, that they were not impoſed upon. They gave their Teſtimony in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo Conſiſtently, ſo Coherently, with ſuch a Conduct, as to ſhew, that they were no <hi>Senſeleſs Idiots.</hi> They willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to ſuch cruel Sufferings for their Teſtimony, as to ſhew, that it was not a <hi>Cunningly deviſed Fable,</hi> which they now put upon the World. One of His Diſciples, who <hi>Denied</hi> Him juſt before His Death, preſently appeared, as one of the moſt famous Witneſſes to His <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Dead.</hi> Had it not really happened, you may be ſure this Man would have gone on, as you do, (But now, Oh! do it no more!) in the Denial of Him. Their <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Righteous,</hi> and <hi>Blameleſs</hi> Converſation, ſhewed, that they were no <hi>Impoſtors.</hi> Yea, God from Heaven teſtified for them, and wondrouſly confirmed their

Teſtimony, by the <hi>Miraculous Gifts</hi> He beſtowed upon them. You Affirm it, and very truly, That your <hi>Elijah</hi> was carried up into the Heavens. There was <hi>but One</hi> to Witneſs it: But you ſay, and this very truly too, That this <hi>One</hi> was a very Good Man, a Prophet of God, and a Worker of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and One owned of God, as he would not have been, if he had been a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Lies.</hi> We affirm, That our JESUS Aſcended up into the Heavens. There was a conſiderable Number of Men to Witneſs this. And theſe were all good Men, and Prophets of God, and Workers of <hi>Miracles.</hi> There is no Truth in any Hiſtory upon Earth, if they did not often Speak the <hi>Great Things of God,</hi> with the <hi>Tongues of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>; in <hi>Tongues</hi> which they never had Learnt, but now had them under Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſpiration; and if they did not Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly Heal the <hi>Sick,</hi> the <hi>Blind,</hi> and the <hi>Lame,</hi> and <hi>Raiſe the Dead.</hi> God would never have done ſuch Things for the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a Lye.</hi> And then, utterly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm your <hi>Infidelity,</hi> by caſting a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Mountain upon it: The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God gave a marvellous Bleſſing to the

               <hi>Faith</hi> of a Riſen JESUS: He ſo Bleſſes it, where it is cordially Entertained, that it fills the Souls of Men, with unſpeakable <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> It cauſes them to Love God, &amp; Live unto Him, in all the moſt ſhining Inſtances of Lovely Piety. It cauſes them to treat their Neighbours with a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Love, &amp; a very Charming Benignity. It cauſes them to ſleight this World, and hate and ſhun every vitious Thing in the World: Fills them with <hi>Heaven,</hi> and fits them for it. The People are actually <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> who are made partakers of theſe things. 'Tis the <hi>Faith</hi> of a <hi>Riſen JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> which is attended with ſuch a <hi>Saving Efficacy.</hi> Our JESUS has herein already proved a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> unto Multitudes, whom He has made the <hi>Excellent in the Earth.</hi> It follows, that He is THE <hi>Saviour.</hi> Oh! That you would at laſt make the happy Experiment! <hi>Come and ſee</hi>; ſee, ſee, whether you do not find Him ſo! Do not go on under the <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that has happened</hi> unto you, to treat Him as your <hi>Enemy,</hi> who is your only <hi>Saviour. Oh! That they were Wiſe, and would conſider their Latter End.</hi>
