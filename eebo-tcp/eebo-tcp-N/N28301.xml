            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE very affectionate and obliging manner, in which you, as the representatives of the town, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed your approbation of the performance on the 22d inst. has afforded, on this occasion, the most grateful satisfaction.

Not to comply, is implicitly refusing to perpetuate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all classes of the rising generation in this place, the memory of those sublime virtues, and that pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent worth, which deserve to be immortal.

            <head>A DISCOURSE.</head>
            <p>THIS day, my afflicted friends, gave birth to the greatest of our national blessings. Its annual return has hitherto been welcomed as the jubilee of Americans, and celebrated as the birth-day of their country's glory. A nation once hailed it, as the day of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing; but, alas! too soon, she is summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to observe it, as the day of mourning. "The joy of her heart has ceased." The heralds of festivity have become the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of woe. The voice of merriment has yielded to the sigh of affliction. The pensive breeze wafts through the continent the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knell. <hi>The oil of</hi> Columbia's <hi>joy</hi> has turned into <hi>mourning, and the garment of her praise</hi> to the cypress shade, and <hi>the spirit of heaviness.</hi> Instead of the birth of the illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Living, we commemorate the virtues, but lament the loss, of the illustrious Dead!
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037722_0005_100EF71A06044880"/>
Of America it may truly be said, that to day she is gone "to the house of mourning." Her hero sleeps in dust! The arm, that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her is fallen! The tongue, that counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is silent! The countenance, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, is changed! And the godlike spirit, that patronized a world, has returned to the place of its rest! Well, then may we adopt, as the theme of mutual condolence on this mournful occasion, the plaintive prayer of the Psalmist:—
<q>"Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS passage, recorded in the first verse of the twelfth Psalm, naturally brings to our recollection the character of that illustrious Personage, whose death a Nation mourns—whose virtues a world admires. The design of the present occasion is to recognise the eminent worth of this "godly man;"—to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the afflicting loss sustained by the community in his death;—and to direct us for consolation to a Being, "in whom alone is our help found."</p>
            <p>To commemorate the virtues of the great and good is not <hi>adulation;</hi> nor is due respect and reverence for "the memory of the just" <hi>idolatry.</hi> It is proper, however, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between divine and human excellence; to make the former the standard by which to judge the latter; and, in proportion to the resemblance, which the image bears to the original, we may safely admire and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the copy, while we give the honor and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037722_0006_100EF71C40649218"/>
the glory to the Great Archetype of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and excellence.</p>
            <p>IT is also manly and generous to weep at the loss of a valuable and pious friend. In a world, like this, it is <hi>christian</hi> to mourn the death of the righteous. Every tributary tear helps to embalm his memory. Every mournful sigh follows the ascending spirit with the prayer of the prophet—"My Father, my Father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof."</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH godliness primarily expresses piety to GOD; yet, as this is the sum of all the virtues, it implies also resemblance of the moral perfections of Deity, and general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of all the duties of religion. It is not confined to the closet, nor the sanctuary; but is manifest in every circumstance and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life. Godliness is the companion of benevolence and charity—the guardian of patriotism and humanity. It supports the highest station, and adorns the most resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent character. To the best of citizens and the wisest of statesmen "her ways were ways of pleasantness, and all her paths were peace" to the most renowned of warriors.</p>
            <p>IT is too true, that eminent piety has rarely been allied, with what the world calls greatness. A man may have distinguished himself by the accumulation of wealth, and merely by the splendor of his riches acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the character of great. He may have rendered himself great in the eyes of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037722_0007_100EF71E294DAF48"/>
world by deep researches into the laws of nature, and uncommon advances in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man science. And some have waded through the blood of their fellow creatures, shed by their own sword, and risen to greatness on the ruins, which their lust and ambition have wantonly spread. But there is no godliness in this.</p>
            <p>AND are we never disappointed even in the humbler walks of life? Here we are taught to look for meekness, temperance, and devotion. But true piety has not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poſſeſſed the hearts of those, who have made pretensions to it. How often has the specious "form of godliness" sanctioned the neglect of half the duties of christianity, and atoned for the repeated violation of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine commands? The vilest hypocrisy has sometimes assumed the dress of piety; and the murderer's heart been concealed beneath the cloak of religion. This, however, proves nothing more, than the corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and the universal respect, which is always paid to genuine goodness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted piety.</p>
            <p>BUT the Man, whose life was the joy of America—whose death is the grief of the world—was a stranger to malevolence and deceit; an enemy to pride and unrestrained ambition; a conqueror of every passion, that tended to endanger his integrity, or threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to usurp in his heart the empire of virtue and religion. From the moment, he entered
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037722_0008_100EF7200AD75848"/>
the public theatre of life, till the grand dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma was finished, the resolution of <hi>a perfect man</hi> was the motto of every act? "Till I die, I will not remove my integrity from me. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live."</p>
            <p>HIS character is without a parallel. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance and opportunity have contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his superior elevation. If the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and prophets of old rose in any degree above him, it was the immediate inspiration of the Almighty, that gave them the pre-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inence. Separate from this, where shall we find a man, even among these antient saints, more exemplary in meekness, benevolence and piety; more inflexible in integrity; more impartial in the distribution of justice; more disinterested in patriotism; more wise and timely in counsel; more dignified and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable as a statesman; or more prudent, val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant, and humane, as a general?</p>
            <p>GREAT and good men have been raised up in every age, who have adorned human nature, and blessed the world. But profane history has not furnished a personage, to be compared throughout with the great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before us. No age, nor nation, can reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up so many, and such sublime virtues, united in an individual. Can any country boast a character equally conspicuous, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contaminated by the vices of the world? Can any point us to a man, so rarely led as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037722_0009_100EF721EFC8A2B0"/>
from conscious virtue, either by the power of habit, or the violence of passion? Where among the children of men shall we look for a greater instrument of good? An instrument, which, in the hands of a benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Providence, has contributed more to the advancement of national perfection and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to maintaining and defending the rights and liberties of mankind; to the dignity and honor of human nature, or the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of human happiness? In whatever point of light we view his character, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as a hero, or a statesman; as a citizen, or (what gave stability and lustre to all his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) as a christian; we find the same god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like spirit manifested in every station, and regulating every action.</p>
            <p>WHAT shall we say of the unequalled General? It requires a mind, great as this illustrious Chief's, to form an adequate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the toils and hardships, the anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and distresses, to which a military life exposed him. In this capacity he commenced his public career; and, by his bravery and skill in saving the remnant of the haughty, though unfortunate, <hi>Braddock's</hi> slaughtered army, he gave indications of that unrivalled military glory, to which he afterwards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by a series of hazardous enterprizes and heroic exploits, united with more than <hi>Fabian</hi> wisdom and prudence. At the early age of twenty-one he drew his sword in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Country and its rights. Not,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037722_0010_100EF7242C19EEA8"/>
like the heroes of antient times, to extend his dominions by violence, and riot in the spoils of victory. Not, like the <hi>conqueror</hi> of modern times, to slaughter the innocent for a victor's fame, and spread the havoc of war for a tyrant's power. But, like the matchless WASHINGTON, to rescue his brethren from the unjust encroachments of an enemy, and to preserve to posterity a land of freedom and independence, of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and peace.</p>
            <p>IN the memorable war between Britain and her colonies, all eyes were fixed upon WASHINGTON. It was a time for more than mortal counsel. Convinced that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's rights were the gift of heaven—that freedom was hers as much as life—with that noble elevation of mind, which is inspired by virtuous patriotism struggling for liberty, he boldly dared to espouse the cause of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the cause of God. The united call of his afflicted Israel, like <hi>the voice from the burning bush,</hi> urged the American Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch to be their leader. Looking to heaven for its auspicious smiles upon his exertions, he stood forth the brave advocate for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, broke the yoke of the oppressor, and freed a world from slavery. When the liberties of his country were threatened, <hi>his sword leaped from its scabbard.</hi> While they were invaded, <hi>his uplifted hand was stayed, till</hi> America <hi>prevailed.</hi> But the moment the tempest of war subsided, and the olive

branch of peace was extended, with the same greatness of soul <hi>he beat his sword into a ploughshare, and his spear into a pruning book;</hi> and, determining to <hi>learn war no more,</hi> exchanged the hardships and dangers of a camp, for the domestic sweets, and the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful shades, of his beloved Vernon.</p>
            <p>JUSTLY to delineate his character, as a statesman, would be to transcribe the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ords of his administration. His acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the secret springs of human action, and the various and complicated working of human passion, together with an ardent and increasing love for his country, gave him the fairest claim to her suffrages; and were a sure pledge of his proving the wisest of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticians and the first of statesmen. He had already conciliated the affection, and secured the confidence, of his fellow-citizens, by his eminent and disinterested services in the rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olutionary war. He had already manifested his wisdom and prudence as a politician, while presiding over that venerable body of sages, who framed our excellent and justly admired constitution. Being thus designat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Providence as the man, who would unite all hearts, he was twice hailed, "by the spontaneous and unanimous suffrage of three millions of freemen," as President of these United States. The modest manner, with which he accepted the highest honor his country could confer, his extreme diffidence of personal qualifications for discharging the duties of this important trust, and his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037722_0012_100EF72798917590"/>
dependence on "that Almighty Being, who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential aids can supply every human defect," shew the godliness of his heart; and evinced, that he was actuated solely from a conviction of duty, and lived but for the service of his country. In his answer to a farewel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress from the inhabitants of Alexandria, on his "again relinquishing the bliss of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," we behold the disinterested patriot. "Those who know me best, said he, (and you, my fellow citizens, are, from your situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in that number) know better than any others, my love of retirement is so great, that no earthly consideration, short of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of duty, could have prevailed upon me to depart from my resolution 'never more to take any share in transactions of a public nature.' For, at my age, and in my circumstances, what possible advantage could I propose to myself, from embarking again in the tempestuous and uncertain ocean of public life." But he had not been accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn a deaf ear to the voice of his country. In the alarm of war, it was to him the voice of thunder. In peace, it was <hi>a still small voice;</hi> but God was in it.</p>
            <p>HIS unceasing fidelity in discharging the duties of his elevated station, his integrity in maintaining the honor of his country, his vigilance in guarding its rights, and his patriotism in promoting and securing its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, demonstrated that the confidence of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037722_0013_100EF729DFA228E8"/>
his fellow-citizens had not been misplaced, nor their highly raised expectations disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. During eight years arduous, but successful, administration, having collected and consolidated the crude materials of a newly confederated republic—reconciled and calmed the seemingly opposite and jarring interests of a widely extended continent—and removed, in a considerable degree, local prejudices and attachments—he fixed our national character, and stamped America with the image of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>BUT "the increasing weight of years at length admonished him, that the shade of retirement was as necessary to him as it would be welcome." He could not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, lay aside his high responsibility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving new proof, that he was the fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his country. This he did by bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her sons an incorruptible inheritance. Of all human productions this invaluable Legacy claims the highest regard of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican people. Its maxims are the result of sage experience, and its precepts founded in truth. Would America, in a political view, adopt it as "the man of her counsel," it would prove to her "a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night." It would guard her against <hi>

WHEN the highest honors of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and her warmest attachment, could no longer detain him from the tranquil joys of private life, he descended from his elevated height to set the world the too novel exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the greatest and most influential of rulers becoming the first and best of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. But for him, who had been accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to govern from principle, it was easy to obey from duty. He knew how to serve in every sphere of life. Do the just, though disputed, claims of an individual require his verdict as a juryman? He, who had been <hi>foreman</hi> of a nation, in the cause of justice, was ready to guide the <hi>empannelled band</hi> in defence of the rights of an injured citizen. Are the liberties of his country again endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered from the insidious arts of an encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemy? And has a desire of peace "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted to the last drop the cup of reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iation?"—How suddenly does the alarm drown the remonstrance of supplicating age; and the cry of persecuted justice nerve his trembling arm, and rekindle the fire of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roism in his <hi>patriot breast!</hi> There was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the conduct of this illustrious chief, but what fills us with admiration. Every act of his life is marked with greatness. But his acceptance of the last commission of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of the American armies is an instance of disinterested patriotism, that cannot be equalled, if we consider his former services, his advanced age, and his love of retirement. The united suffrage of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037722_0015_100EF72DB8D339D8"/>
joined with ardent affection for their President, could not persuade him, that it was any longer his duty to preside over the nation in a time of peace. "But," said the aged and venerable citizen, "When every thing we hold dear and sacred is so serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatened," "I am ready," in obedience to my government, to appear as second in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and "to go again to the field of battle in defence of the liberties, the independence, and the religion of my country." This was the last and greatest action of his life. It is beyond the power of language to give it a comment. We can only say, that this raised him so far above the world, that it lost its power to hold, and he <hi>passed into the heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the private and domestic walks of life he displayed all the virtues, that dignify the man, or adorn the christian. Free from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry species of pride and ostentation, he possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a native gracefulness and dignity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that commanded universal respect. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that meanness of spirit, which debas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the man, while it affects the christian, he was amiable and dignified in his humility. With an exquisite sense and just resentment of injury, he united the meekness of one Saint and the patience of another. His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common fortitude and magnanimity were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways regulated by the most consummate prudence and discretion. In his daily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with his fellow-citizens the law of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and kindness was his guide. He was
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037722_0016_100EF72F95DCEC80"/>
just and upright in all his dealings; courteous and gentle in his society; candid to the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others, because conscious of frailty himself; grateful to his country for its hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and to his friends for their attachment and affection; kind and compassionate to the needy and afflicted; humane and sympathet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic even to the meanest servant. Here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but notice, with what parental care and attention he has provided in his last will for the comfort, the freedom, and the happiness of the slaves, employed in his service. With the most pointed prohibition has he guarded against the traffic of human souls. Even the decrepid African, rendered useless by age and infirmity, was not unworthy the regard of the best of Masters. With a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's tenderness he heard the infant orphan's cry; and, as he saw the tawny cheek glisten with the falling tear, he records with the pencil of humanity, <hi>"It is well with the child"</hi>—<q>It has a claim to my compassion, and shall live from mine inheritance.</q> An instance of godliness worthy to "be had in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remembrance."</p>
            <p>BUT his whole character, public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, derived its splendour from religion. Strike from his system of virtues his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his elevated piety, and the lustre of all the rest would have been lost in oblivion. This was the governing principle of his heart, and regulated every action of his life. In all his ways he acknowledged God, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037722_0017_100EF73134A47890"/>
of his character demonstrates, that He directed his paths. It is not in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to maintain so uniform, so perfect a character, through a long life, placed, as he was, in the most elevated stations—surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by numerous and strong temptations—without the agency and influence of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Grace. As no man had greater reason to believe and notice the Providence of GOD in the affairs of men, so none has been more frequent and explicit in declaring his belief, nor more humble in acknowledging his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and absolute dependence upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential aids. <q>When I contemplate, says this eminently pious Magistrate, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Providence, as it was visibly manifested in guiding us through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, in preparing us for the reception of a general government, and in conciliating the good will of the people of America to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another after its adoption; I feel myself oppressed and almost overwhelmed with a sense of the divine munificence. I feel that nothing is due to my personal ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency iu all these complicated and wonderful events, except what can simply be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the exertions of an honest zeal for the good of my country.</q>

            <p>
               <q>IF I have distressing apprehensions, that I shall not be able to justify the too exalted expectations of my countrymen, I am sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported under the pressure of such uneasy reflections by a confidence, that the most

gracious Being, who hath hitherto watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the interests and averted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ils of the United States, will never suffer so fair an inheritance to become a prey to anarchy, despotism, or any species of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</q>

"With his lamp trimmed and burning" he is not afraid to pass "the dark valley of the shadow of death!" Shielded by the hope of the gospel he sees no terrors in the grave! Nature, pressed down with leaden weight, beckons for her dissolution! The immortal spirit, pinioned by the slender thread of life, pants for celestial flight!

            </p>
            <p>SUCH, my mourning friends, was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life, such the godly death, of the man, whose memory will be forever blessed. His loss, though gain to himself, to America is incalculable. Who can tell how much the sublime virtues of this righteous Man, his constant and fervent supplications at the throne of grace for his beloved Country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to avert the judgment of heaven, and to bring down its blessings upon our land? If the prayers of the righteous were ever needed—if the death of the godly was ever to be lamented—it is in a day like the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; "for spoiling and violence are before us; and there are, that raise up strife and contention." The very Name of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, even at his advanced age, was a host to the Nation, and his life "a wall of fire" against her enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT let us not despair; nor mourn as those, who have no hope. <hi>The Lord reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, let the earth rejoice.</hi> It becomes us as a church, as a society, and as a nation, to look to God, in humble fervent prayer, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037722_0021_10116FD042BE6480"/>
him, in pity to a <hi>land,</hi> that <hi>mourneth,</hi> in mercy to a people too apt to murmer—too prone to rebel—to raise up to us other WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTONS in his stead: For Jehovah <hi>is our strength and our refuge,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> him <hi>alone is</hi> our <hi>help found. He killeth and he maketh alive; he woundeth, and he healeth again. The Lord gave</hi> to America, <hi>and the Lord hath taken</hi> from her, <hi>and bleſſed be his Name.</hi> While we suitably notice this severe chastisement, let us not forget to be grateful for his mercies. Let us thank Him for raising up this illustrious Personage in the infancy of our country; for making him an instrument of so great good in peace and in war; for blessing us for nearly fifty years with his eminent and disinterested services; for prolonging his life to a good old age; for continuing his strength of body, and the power and vigor of his mind to the very point of life; and, finally, after giving him strength and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to close his own eyes <hi>with his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken hand,</hi> for taking him to Himself. For, like <hi>Enoch,</hi> he <hi>walked with God, and was not, for God took him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE we humble ourselves for the sins, which have thus brought down the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven in causing the godly to cease, and the faithful to fail from among us, let our gratitude ascend for the numerous blessings, with which we are still favored as a Nation. Let us learn to praise God for continuing to us many wise and virtuous ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037722_0022_10116FD580F6AC70"/>
and, especially, for sparing the inval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable life of the President of these United States—who, like his best beloved and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamented Brother, deserves the highest esteem and most implicit confidence of his fellow citizens for his long tried integrity and eminent piety. When we think how frail is man;—when we are thus solemnly admonished of our dependence upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for the life and services of the best of men;—when we behold the aged, the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable, the illustrious ADAMS, with a Nation upon his shoulders, walking on the edge of the grave;—let us humbly and fervently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the care of that gracious Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, without whose <hi>notice not a sparrow falls;</hi> earnestly praying, that he would <hi>keep him</hi> from accident <hi>as the apple of his eye</hi>—that he would <hi>hide him</hi> from pestilence <hi>under the shadow of his wings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE we close this solemn occasion, let us unitedly resolve to imitate the virtues of our deceased WASHINGTON. In him the aged will find their ornament; the youth their model; the citizen his counsellor, the soldier the standard of his patriotism; the magistrate the guide of his administration; and the weeping daughters of Columbia eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue and grace, that can improve the heart or adorn the sex. As members of the community let us follow the excellent advice, contained in his parting address. Thus shall we mourn aright our revered and beloved

hero. <hi>Hear this, ye Fathers, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever! Give ear all ye inhabitants of the land! Tell ye your children of it, and let your children, tell their children, and their children another generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FINALLY, by this melancholy death let us be awakened to a sense of our own mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to a preparation for an event which none can escape. If the highest earthly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence could not save its possessor from the grave, surely <hi>there is no discharge in this war.</hi> Convinced of the insufficiency of man, let us seek <hi>the eternal God</hi> for <hi>refuge,</hi> and lean upon <hi>the everlasting arm.</hi> Knowing that he will bring us also unto death, and to the house appointed for all living, let us, thro' infinite mercy in Christ Jesus, secure an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in his <hi>favor, which is life,</hi> that we may enjoy his <hi>loving kindness, which is better than life.</hi> Thus shall we be prepared to die <hi>the death of the righteous,</hi> and our <hi>last end</hi> will <hi>be like his.</hi>
