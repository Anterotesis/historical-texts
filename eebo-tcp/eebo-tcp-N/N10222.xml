            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF JOHN ROBERTS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE had it on my mind, for ſome years paſt, to commit to writing ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable paſſages, the chief of which were tranſacted in my time, together with ſome ſhort account of our family.</p>
            <p>My grandfather's name was JOHN ROBERTS, alias HAYWARD. He liv'd at a village called Siddington, within a mile of Cirenceſter, in Glouceſterſhire. I have heard he lived reputably on a little eſtate of his own, which he occupied. He married MARY SOLLISS, ſiſter to ANDREW SOLISS, Eſq who was in the commiſſion of the peace, and ſuſtain'd great ſpoil in the time of the civil war between king CHARLES I. and the parliament. I have heard a colonel and his men and horſes quartered themſelves upon him a conſiderable time together, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their horſes to the corn and hay mows.</p>
            <p>My father and his next neighbour went into the army under Oliver Cromwel, and continued till they heard Cirenceſter was taken by the king's party; when they thought proper to return home, to ſee how it fared with their parents and relations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:012986_0003_0F903DCFCF8315A8"/>As they were paſſing by Cirenceſter, they were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and purſued by two ſoldiers of the king's party (then in poſſeſſion of the town.) Seeing themſelves pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, they quitted their horſes, and took to their heels: but by reaſon of their accoutrements could make little ſpeed. They came up with my father firſt; and tho' he begged for quarter, none would they give him; but laid on him with their ſwords, cutting and ſlaſhing his hands and arms, which he held up to ſave his head; as the marks upon them did long after teſtify. At length it pleaſed the Almighty to put it into his mind to fall down on his face; which he did. Hereupon the ſoldiers being on horſeback, cry'd to each other, <hi>alight, and cut his throat!</hi> But neither of them did; yet continued to ſtrike and prick him about the jaws, 'til they thought him dead. Then they left him, and purſued his neighbour, whom they preſently overtook and kill'd. Soon after they had left my father, it was ſaid in his heart, <hi>Riſe, and flee for thy life</hi>; which call he obeyed; and ſtarting upon his feet, his enemies eſpy'd him in motion, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him again. He ran down a ſteep hill, and through a river, which ran at the bottom of it; tho' with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding difficulty, his boots filling with water, and his wounds bleeding very much. They followed him to the top of the hill; but, ſeeing he had got over, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him no further. He was at a loſs which way to take in this wounded and diſconſolate condition, being ſurrounded with enemies on every hand. At length he determined to go to his uncle Solliſs's; from whence he ſent a ſervant to a widow at Cirenceſter (at whoſe houſe the chief officers lay) with whom he was acquainted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring her to come to him; which ſhe readily did, and offered him all the ſervice in her power He deſired her, as the principal officers lay at her houſe, to uſe her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with them to give command that none of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers might offer him any abuſe. Which ſhe effected; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in good-will to her they likewiſe ſent their ableſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to him. He was a man of great ſkill, but of a ſour diſpoſition; for he told my father, <hi>if he had met him in the field, he would have kill'd him himſelf; but now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I'll
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012986_0004_0F903DD0B6E31620"/>
cure you</hi>; which he did. When my father found himſelf able, he went to his father's houſe, and found him very ill in bed. They greeted each other with many tears, and a great intermixture of joy and ſorrow. After ſome time my father perceived him to tremble to ſuch a degree, that the bed ſhook under him. Upon which my father aſked him how it was with him? He replied,
<q>I am well. I feel no pain. 'Tis the mighty power of God that ſhakes me.</q>
After lying ſtill ſome time, he broke out in a ſweet melody of ſpirit, ſaying, "In the Lord only have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength! In God have I ſalvation!" I don't remember to have heard he ſaid any thing more before his departure.</p>
            <p>The civil war continuing, my father found he could not be ſafe at home; and therefore he went again, and continued till near the concluſion of that dreadful erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: when he returned again to his ſorrowful family at Siddington. After ſome time he took to wife Lydia Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, daughter of Thomas Tindal of Slincomb, near Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley, a religious family, and one of thoſe under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Puritans. Matthew Hale (afterwards lord chief juſtice of England) was her kinſman, and drew her marriage-ſettlement. It pleaſed God to give them ſix children, viz. John, Joſeph, Lydia, Thomas, Nathani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and Daniel. Joſeph and Lydia died young; Thomas was kill'd at the age of fourteen, by a kick from a mare; the reſt lived to man's eſtate.</p>
            <p>In the year 1665, it pleaſed the Lord to ſend two women friends out of the North to Cirenceſter, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after ſuch as feared God, were directed to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the likelieſt perſon to entertain them. They came to his houſe, and deſired a meeting. He granted it, and invited ſeveral of his acquaintance to ſit with them. After ſome time of ſilence, the friends ſpake a few words, which had a good effect. After the meeting, my father endeavoured to engage them in diſcourſe: but they ſaid little, only recommended him to Richard Farnſworth, then a priſoner for the teſtimony of Truth in Banbury jail, to whom they were going. Upon this recommendation my father went ſhortly after to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012986_0005_0F903DD1588B95A8"/>
in order to converſe with Richard; where he met with the two women who had been at his houſe. The turnkey was denying them entrance, and telling them he had an order not to let any of thoſe <hi>giddy-headed people</hi> in; and therefore if they did go in, he would keep them there: But upon my father's deſire they were admitted in along with him, and conducted through ſeveral rooms to a dungeon, where Richard Farnſworth was preaching through a grate to the people in the ſtreet; but ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they came in, he deſiſted; and, after a little time of ſilence, turning to them, he ſpake to this purpoſe:
<q>That Zacheus, being a man of low ſtature, and having a mind to ſee Chriſt, ran before, and climb'd up into a ſycamore tree: and our Saviour, knowing his good deſires, call'd to him, <hi>Zacheus, come down. This day is ſalvation come to thy houſe.</hi> Thus, Zacheus was like ſome in our day, who are climbing up into the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, thinking to find Chriſt there. But the word now is, <hi>Zacheus come down, come down; for that which is to be known of God, is manifeſted</hi> within.</q>
This, with more to the ſame purpoſe, was ſpoken in ſuch authority, that, when my father came home, he told my mother he had ſeen Richard Farnſworth, who had ſpoke to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as if he had known him from his youth. From this time he patiently bore the croſs; afterwards, when it pleaſed God to communicate to him a portion of the knowledge of his bleſſed Truth, a neceſſity was laid upon him one firſt-day morning to go to the public worſhip-houſe in Cirenceſter in the time of worſhip, not knowing what might be required of him there. He went, and, ſtanding with his hat on, the prieſt was ſilent for ſome time: but being aſked why he did not go on? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he <hi>could not, while that man ſtood with his hat on.</hi> Upon this ſome took him by the arm, and led him into the ſtreet, ſtaying at the door to keep him out: but after waiting a little in ſtillneſs, he ſound himſelf clear, and paſſed away. As he paſſed the market-place, the tie of his ſhoe ſlacken'd; and while he ſtooped down to faſten it, a man came behind him, and ſtruck him on the back a hard blow with a ſtone, ſaying, <hi>There, take that for</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012986_0006_0F903DD228123D60"/>
Chriſt's <hi>ſake.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>ſo I do</hi>; not looking back to ſee who it was, but quietly going his way. A few days after a man came and aſked him forgiveneſs; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him he was the unhappy man that gave him the blow on his back, and he could have no reſt ſince he had done it.</p>
            <p>Not long after, three Friends came that way, who found the like concern, viz. Robert Silveſter, Philip Grey, and Thomas Onyon Theſe ſtanding in the ſteeple-houſe with their hats on, tho' they ſaid nothing, the prieſt was ſilent: And being aſked if he was not well? he anſwered, he <hi>could not go forward whilſt thoſe dumb dogs ſtood there.</hi> Wherefore the people dragged them out: and the prieſt afterwards informing a juſtice that they had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him in divine ſervice, they were bound over to the quarter-ſeſſions. My father, at their deſire, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed them to the ſeſſions: and when they were called and the prieſt had accuſed them, the bench, in a rage, without aſking them any queſtions, ordered their mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus's to be made. This unjuſt and illegal proceeding kindled my father's zeal, inſomuch that he ſtepping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, called to the juſtices, ſaying, <hi>Are not thoſe who ſit on the bench ſworn to do juſtice? Is there not a man among you that will do the thing that is right?</hi> Whereupon John Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, of Lipeat (then chairman) cry'd out, <hi>Who are you ſirrah? What is your name?</hi> My father telling him his name, he ſaid, <hi>I am glad I have you here: I have heard of you: you deſerve a ſtone doublet: there's many an honeſter man than you hang'd. It may be ſo,</hi> anſwered my father: but what do'ſt thou think becomes of thoſe who hang honeſt men? <hi>The juſtice reply'd,</hi> I'll ſend you to priſon; and if any inſurrection or tumult be in the land, I'll come and cut your throat firſt with my own ſword; for I fear to ſleep in my bed, leſt ſuch fanatics ſhould come and cut my throat: and, ſnatching up a ball of wax, he violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threw it at my father; who avoided the blow by ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping aſide. Their mittimus's were then made, and they were all ſent to priſon.</p>
            <p>The ſame evening my uncle Solliſs, who was one of the juſtices on the bench, came to the priſon, and calling for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012986_0007_0F903DD36EAA3A60"/>
my father, aſked him if he was willing to have his liberty to go home to his wife and family? <hi>Upon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi> ſaid my father.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Upon ſuch terms, that the jailor open the door, and let you out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>What! without entering into any recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>Then I accept of my liberty. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, uncle, how thou and ſeveral others could ſit upon the bench as with your thumbs in your mouths, when you ſhould ſpeak a word in behalf of the innocent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt learn to live under a law, couſin. And if you will accept of your liberty till next ſeſſions, you may have it: if not, ſtay where you are.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>So they parted; and on the morrow my father went home, having alſo the jailor's leave.</p>
            <p>In the night a concern came upon him, with ſuch weight, that it made him tremble till the bed ſhook under him. My mother aſking the reaſon of it, he anſwered: <hi>The Lord requires hard things of me: if it would pleaſe him, I had rather lay down my life than obey him in what he requires at my hands.</hi> To which my mother reply'd:
<q>If thou art fully perſuaded the Lord requires it of thee, I would not have thee diſobey him; for he will require nothing of us but what he will enable us to go through: Therefore we have good cauſe to truſt in him.</q>
               <hi>On which he ſaid,</hi> I muſt go to this John Stephens, who is my great enemy, and ſent me to priſon, where he ſaid he would ſecure me; and as my uncle Solliſs in kindneſs has given me leave to come home, I can expect no ſavour from him, if I now go and run myſelf into the mouth of my adverſary. But I muſt go whatever I ſuffer. He aroſe, and prepared for his journey; but durſt eat or drink nothing. When he mounted his horſe, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord was unto him, Remember Lot's wife: <hi>look not back.</hi> So on he rode very chearfully 8 or 9 miles, till he came within ſight of the juſtice's houſe, and then he let in the reaſoner, who reaſoned him out of all his courage, preſenting to his mind, that his uncle Solliſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012986_0008_0F903DD39B6DF518"/>
and his neighbours would ſay he had no regard for his wife and family, thus to puſh himſelf into the hands of his greateſt enemy. This brought ſuch a cloud over his mind, that he alighted off his horſe, and ſat down upon the ground, to ſpread his cauſe before the Lord. After he had waited ſometime in ſilence, the Lord appeared, and diſſipated the cloud, and his word was to him, <hi>Go, and I will go with thee, and will give thee a threſhing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thou ſhalt threſh the mountains.</hi> Now he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly overcome with the love of God: and I have often heard him ſay, he was filled like a veſſel that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vent, and ſaid in his heart, <hi>Thy preſence is enough,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the houſe with great ſatisfaction. It being pretty early in the morning, and ſeeing the ſtable door open, he went to the groom, and deſired him to put up his horſe. While this was doing, the juſtice's ſon and his clerk came up, the latter roughly ſaid "I thought you had been in Glouceſter caſtle."</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>So I was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>And how came you out?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>When thou haſt authority to demand it, I can give thee an anſwer. But my buſineſs is with thy maſter, if I may ſpeak with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>You may, if you'll promiſe to be civil.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>If thou ſeeſt me uncivil, I deſire thee to tell me of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>They went in; and my father following them, they bid him take a turn in the hall, and they would acquaint the juſtice of his being there. He was ſoon called in; and my father no ſooner ſaw him, but he believed the Lord had been at work upon him: for, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved to him with the fierceneſs of a lion before, he now appeared like a lamb, meeting him with a pleaſant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and, taking him by the hand, ſaid, "Friend Haywood, how do you do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" My father anſwered, <hi>pretty well;</hi> and then proceeded thus; <hi>I am come in the fear and dread of heaven, to warn thee to repent of thy wickedneſs with ſpeed, leſt the Lord cut the thread of thy life, and ſend thee to the pit that is bottomleſs. I am come to warn thee, in great love, whether thou wilt hear or forbear, and to preach the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012986_0009_0F903DD448343840"/>
Goſpel to thee.</hi> The juſtice reply'd,
<q>You are a welcome meſſenger to me, that is what I have long deſired to hear.</q>
               <hi>The everlaſting Goſpel</hi> (returned my father) <hi>is the ſame that God ſent his ſervant</hi> John <hi>to declare, when he ſaw an angel flying through the midſt of heaven, ſaying with a loud voice,</hi>
               <q>Fear God, and give glory to his name, and worſhip him who made heaven and earth, the ſea, and the fountains of water.</q>
The juſtice then cauſed my father to ſit down by him on a couch; and ſaid,
<q>I believe your meſſage is of God, and I receive it as ſuch. I am ſorry I have done you wrong: and I will never wrong you more. I would pray you to forgive me, and to pray to God to forgive me.</q>
After much more diſcourſe, he offered my father the beſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his houſe afforded; but my father excuſed himſelf from eating or drinking with him at that time, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his kind acceptance of his love; and ſo in much love they parted.</p>
            <p>The ſame day William Dewſberry had appointed a meeting at Tedbury; whither my mother went. But ſhe was ſo concerned on account of my father's exerciſe, that ſhe could receive little benefit from the meeting. After the meeting was ended, William Dewſberry walk'd to and fro in a long paſſage, groaning in ſpirit; and by and by came up to my mother, and, tho' ſhe was a ſtranger to him, he laid his hand upon her head, and ſaid. "Woman thy ſorrow is great: I ſorrow with thee." Then walking a little to and fro, as before, he came to her again, and ſaid,
<q>Now the time is come, <hi>that theſe who marry, muſt be as tho' they married not, and thoſe who have huſbands, as though they had none;</hi> for the Lord calls for all to be offered up.</q>
By this ſhe ſaw the Lord had given him a ſenſe of her great burthen; for ſhe had not diſcovered her exerciſe to any: And it gave her ſuch eaſe in her mind, that ſhe went home rejoicing in the Lord. She no ſooner got home, but ſhe found my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returned from Lypeat, where his meſſage was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſuch love, as was far from their expectation; the ſenſe of which brake them into tears, in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012986_0010_0F903DD507875A58"/>
of the great goodneſs of God, in ſo eminently mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way for, and helping them that day.</p>
            <p>At the next ſeſſions my father and the three Friends appeared in court; where, as ſoon as juſtice Stephens eſpy'd them, he called to my father, and ſaid,
<q>John, I accept of your appearance, and diſcharge you, and the court diſcharges. You may go about your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
But my father thinking his work not done, did not haſten out of court. Upon which the clerk demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fees. <hi>What! doſt mean money?</hi> ſays my father. "Yes: what do you think I mean?" ſays the clerk. My father reply'd, <hi>I don't know that I owe any man here any thing but love, and muſt I now purchaſe my liberty with money? I don't accept it on ſuch terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk (to the chairman.)</speaker>
               <p>An't pleaſe your worſhip, John won't pay the fees of the court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I don't accept my liberty on ſuch terms.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then he was ordered to priſon with the three friends. But in the evening the clerk diſcharged them, and ever after carried himſelf very kindly to my father.</p>
            <p>He was afterwards caſt into priſon at Cirenceſter, by George Bull, vicar of Upper-Siddington, for tythes. Where was confined at the ſame time, upon the ſame account, Elizabeth Hewlings, a widow of Amney, near Cirenceſter. She was a good chriſtian, and ſo good a midwife that her confinement was a loſs to that ſide of the country; inſomuch, that lady Dunch, of Down-Amney, thought it would be an act of charity to the neighbourhood to purchaſe her liberty, by paying the prieſt's demand; which ſhe did. She likewiſe came to Cirenceſter in a coach, and ſent her footman Alexander Cornwall, to the priſon to bring Elizabeth to her. And while Elizabeth was making ready to go with the man, my father and he fell into a little diſcourſe. He aſked my father his name, and where his home was; which when my father had told him.
<q>What! (ſaid he) are you that John Haywood of Siddington, who keeps great conventicles at your houſe?</q>
My father anſwered, <hi>The church of Chriſt often meets at my houſe. I ſuppoſe I am the man thou meaneſt.</hi>
               <q>I have often (replyed Cornwall)
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012986_0011_0F903DD62E7A21E0"/>
heard my lady ſpeak of you, and I am ſure ſhe would gladly be acquainted with you.</q>
When he returned to his lady, he told her he had met with ſuch a man in the priſon as he believed ſhe would not ſuffer to lie in priſon for conſcience-ſake; informing her withal who he was. She immediately bid him to go back and fetch him to her. Accordingly he came to the jail, and told my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his lady wanted to ſpeak with him. My father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>If any body would ſpeak with me, they muſt come where I am; for I am a priſoner.</hi>
               <q>Oh (ſaid Cornwall) I'll get leave of the jailor for you to go.</q>
Which he did. And when they came before the lady, ſhe put on a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic air, to ſee how the Quaker would greet her. He went up towards her, and bluntly ſaid, <hi>Woman, wouldſt thou ſpeak with me.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe, for conſcience-ſake, I cant't pay an hireling prieſt what he demands of me; therefore he, like the falſe prophets of old, prepares war againſt me, becauſe I can't put into his mouth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>By what I have heard of you, I took you to be a wiſe man, and if you could not pay him yourſelf, you might let ſomebody elſe pay him for you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>That would be underhand dealing, and I had rather pay him myſelf, than be ſuch a hypocrite.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>Then ſuppoſe ſome neighbour or friend ſhould pay him for you, unknown to you, you would chooſe not to lie in priſon when you might have your liberty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I am very well content where I am, till it ſhall pleaſe God to make way for my freedom.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>Then, ſpeaking to her man, ſhe bid him go to the prieſt's attorney, and tell him ſhe would ſatisfy him, and then pay the jailor his fees and get a horſe for my father to go to Down-Amney with her.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>If thou art a charitable woman, as I take thee to be, there are abroad in the world many real objects of charity on whom to beſtow thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but to feed ſuch devourers as theſe, I don't think to be charity.

            <p>According to his appointment, my father went; and found her very inquiſitive about the things of God, and very attentive to the truths he delivered. She engaged him likewiſe a ſecond time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and treated him with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of regard. A third time ſhe bid her man Cornwall to go to him and deſire him to appoint a day when he would pay her another viſit: and then ordered him to go to the prieſt Careleſs, of Cirenceſter, and deſire him to come and take a dinner with her at the ſame time; and not let either of them know the other

was to be there. On the day appointed my father went; and when he had got within ſight of her houſe, he heard a horſe behind him, and looking back, he ſaw the prieſt following him which made him conclude the lady had projected to bring them together. When the prieſt came up to him, "Well overtaken, John (ſaid he) how far are you going this way?" My father anſwered
<q>
                  <hi>I believe we are both going to the ſame places</hi> What! (ſaid Careleſs) are you going to the great houſe?</q>
Yes, ſaid my father. "Come on then John," ſaid he. So then they went in together. And the lady being ill in bed, a ſervant went up and informed her they were come. "What! (ſaid ſhe) did they come together?" Yes anſwered the ſervant.
<q>I admire at that (ſaid ſhe). But do you beckon John out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring him to me firſt up the back ſtairs.</q>
When my father came up, ſhe told him ſhe had been very ill in a fit of the ſtone, and ſaid, "I have heard you have done good in many diſtempers.</p>

               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs I have; but to this of the ſtone I am a ſtranger. Indeed I once knew a man, who lived at eaſe, and fared delicately, as thou may'ſt do, and whilſt he continued in that practice he was much afflicted with that diſtemper. But it pleaſed the Lord to viſit him with the knowledge of his bleſſed truth, which brought him to a more regular and temperate life, and this preſerved him more free from it.</p>

               <p>Oh! I know what you aim at. You want to have me a Quaker. And I confeſs, if I could be ſuch an one as you are, I would be a Quaker tomorrow.— But I underſtand Mr Careleſs is below; and tho' you are men of different perſuaſions, I account you both wiſe and godly men, and ſome moderate diſcourſe of the things of God between you, I believe would do me good.</p>

               <p>I find thou art ſetting us out in very black characters, with deſign to affright me; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou wilt be miſtaken.

               <p>The Quakers hold that damnable doctrine, and dangerous tenet, of perfection in this life; and ſo do the Papiſts. If you go about to deny it John, I can prove you hold it.</p>

               <p>I doubt thou art now going about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Papiſts behind their backs, as thou haſt heretofore done by us. For, by what I have learnt of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they do not believe a ſtate of freedom from ſin and acceptance with God poſſible on this ſide the grave; and therefore they have imagined to themſelves a place of purgation after death. But whether they believe ſuch a ſtate attainable or no, I do.</p>

               <p>An't pleaſe your ladyſhip, John has confeſſed enough out of his own mouth; for that is a damnable doctrine, and dangerous tenet.</p>

               <p>I would aſk thee one queſtion: doſt thou own a purgatory?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Papiſts, in this caſe, are wiſer than thee. They own the ſaying of Chriſt, who told the unbelieving <hi>Jews, If'ye die in your ſins, whither I go ye cannot come.</hi> But, by thy diſcourſe, thou and thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers muſt needs go headlong to deſtruction; ſince thou neither owneſt a place of purgation after death, nor ſuch a preparation for heaven to be poſſible in this life, as is abſolutely neceſſary. The Scripture thou knoweſt tells us, <hi>Where death leaves us, judgment will find us. If a tree falls towards the north or ſouth, there it ſhall lie.</hi> And ſince <hi>no unclean thing can enter the kingdom of heaven,</hi> pray tell this poor woman, whom, thou haſt been preaching to for thy belly, whether ever, or never, ſhe muſt expect to be freed from her ſins, and made fit for the kingdom of heaven; or whether the blind muſt lead the blind till both fall into the ditch.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>And my father car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to a month or two; and ſo gradually till he brought it to ſeven years, the prieſt confeſſing he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame. On which my father thus proceeded:
<q>How could'ſt thou accuſe me of popery, in holding this doctrine, which thou thyſelf haſt confeſſed too? If I am like a Papiſt, thou art, by thy own confeſſion, as like a Papiſt as I am. And if it be a damnable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and dangerous tenet in the Quakers, is it not the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012986_0016_0F903DDEE85A17E8"/>
ſame in thyſelf? Thou told'ſt me I miſtook thee; but haſt not thou miſtaken thyſelf in condemning thine own acknowledged opinion when uttered by me? But notwithſtanding thou haſt ſail'd in making me out to be a Papiſt in this particular, can'ſt thou do it in any thing elſe?</q>
Upon this the prieſt being mute, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus proceeded:
<q>Well! tho' thou haſt fail'd in proving me like them, it need not hinder me from ſhewing thee to be ſo in many things. For inſtance, you build houſes and conſecrate them, calling them churches; as do the Papiſts. You hang bells in 'em, and conſecrate 'em, calling them by the names of ſaints; ſo do they. The Pope and the prieſts of the Roman church wear ſurplices, gowns, caſſocks, &amp;c. calling them their ornaments; here thou haſt the like; and do'ſt thou not ſtile them thy ornaments? You conſecrate the ground where you inter your dead, calling it holy ground; ſo do they. In ſhort, thou art like a Papiſt in ſo many things, he need be a wiſe man to diſtinguiſh betwixt them and thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At this the prieſt appeared uneaſy; and ſaid to the lady,
<q>Madam, I muſt beg your excuſe; for there's to be a lecture this afternoon, and I muſt be there.</q>
She preſt him to ſtay to dinner, but he earneſtly deſired to be excuſed. So a ſlice or two being cut off of the ſpit, he eat, and took his leave.</p>
            <p>The lady then ſaid to my father, had ſhe not ſeen it, ſhe could not have believed Mr. Careleſs could have been ſo foil'd in diſcourſe by any man; for, ſaid ſhe, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him as ſound and orthodox a divine as any was; but now I muſt tell you, I am ſo far of your opinion, that if you'll let me know when you have a meeting at your houſe, and ſomebody to preach, (not a ſilent meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I'll come and hear 'em myſelf. My father anſwered, he expected ſhe would be as good as her word. Not long after came two friends to my father's houſe, and tho' the weather was very ſevere, he found he could not be eaſy without acquainting her with it. So he went to her houſe, but ſhe ſeem'd a little ſurpriz'd ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "What's your will now, John?" He informed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012986_0017_0F903DDF8D233090"/>
her of the two friends, and their intention of having a meeting at his houſe.
<q>How can you expect (ſaid ſhe) I ſhould go out ſuch weather as this? You know I ſeldom ſtir out of my chamber, and to go ſo far may endanger my health.</q>
My father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
<q>I would not have thee make excuſes, as ſome of old did, and were not found worthy. Thou knoweſt time is none of ours, and we know not whether we may have the like opportunity again. The ſnow need not much incommode thee: thou mayſt be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy coach, and, putting up the glaſſes, may'ſt be pretty warm; and when thou comeſt to my houſe, I know my wife will do her beſt for thee.</q>
So ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her coach and fix to be got ready (for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was ſeven miles) ſaying, "John's like death, he'll not be deny'd." My father came along with her; and during the time of ſilence in the meeting, ſhe appear'd ſomething reſtleſs; but was very attentive whilſt either of the friends were ſpeaking. She was very well pleaſed after the meeting, and ſat at table with the friends. While the reſt ſat ſilent, ſhe would be frequently whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering to my mother, till one of them ſpake a few words before meat. She was aſham'd, and told my mother, when ſhe was among the great, ſhe was accounted a wiſe woman; but now (ſaid ſhe) I am among you Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, I am a very fool. Preſently after dinner ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home, and came ſeveral times to the meeting afterwards; and I am fully perſuaded ſhe was convinced of the truth; but going up to London, ſhe was there taken ill, and died.</p>
            <p>Her man Alexander Cornwall, was convinced of the truth, and was afterwards a priſoner with my father in Glouceſter caſtle; where the jailor was very cruel to them, ſometimes putting them into the common jail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſelons, and other times he would hire a tinker (who lay for his fees) to trouble them in the night by playing on his hautboy. One time in particular my father being concerned to ſpeak to him in the dread and power of God, it ſtruck him to ſuch a degree, that he dropt the inſtrument out of his hand, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012986_0018_0F903DE04FE7CED0"/>
take it into hand upon that occaſion any more. When the jailor aſk'd him why he diſcontinued it, he anſwered,
<q>They are the ſervants of the living God, and I'll ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver play more to diſturb them, if you hang me up at the door for it,</q>
               <q>What! (ſaid the jailor) are you bewitch'd too. I'll turn you out of the caſtle.</q>
Which he did; and the friends who were there priſoners rais'd him ſome money, cloath'd him, and away he went.</p>
            <p>Some time after my father had three conferences with — Nicholſon, biſhop of Glouceſter, introduced in the following manner. An apparitor came to cite my father to appear at the biſhop's court: but he told my father he could not encourage him to come, leſt they ſhould enſnare him, and ſend him to priſon. At the ſame time they cited a ſervant of my father's named John Overall. My father went at the time appointed, without his ſervant: and when his name was call'd over, he anſwered to it. The diſcourſe that occurr'd was in ſubſtance as follows: —</p>

               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>

And when I ſay the church comes to me, I mean the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of ſuch worſhippers, who frequently meet at my houſe. I do not call that a church which you do, which is made of wood and ſtone, that is but the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of men's hands, whereas the true church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of living ſtones, and is built up by Chriſt a ſpiritual houſe to God.</p>

            <p>Then a Baptiſt preacher was called, who ſeeing the biſhop's civility to my father, in ſuffering him to keep on his hat, thought to take the ſame liberty. At whom the biſhop put on a ſtern countenance, and ſaid,
<q>Don't you know this is the king's court, and that I ſit here to repreſent his majeſty's perſon? And do you come here in an uncivil and irreverent manner, in contempt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012986_0022_0F903DE34CD022D8"/>
of his majeſty and his court, with your hat on? I confeſs there are ſome men in the world who make a conſcience of putting off their hats, to whom we ought to have ſome regard. But for you, who can put it off to every mechanic you meet, to come here, in contempt of authority, with it on, I'll aſſure you, friend, you ſhall ſpeed never the better for it.</q>
— I heard my father ſay, theſe words came ſo honeſtly from the biſhop, that it did him good to hear him.—The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt then taking off his hat, ſaid,
<q>An't pleaſe you, my lord, I han't been well in my head.</q>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you have got a cap on; nay you have two caps on. (He had a black one over a white one.) What is your reaſon for denying your children that holy ordinance of baptiſm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Baptiſt.</speaker>
               <p>An't pleaſe you, my lord, I am not well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>What's the ground of your diſſatisfaction? did you ever ſee a book I publiſh'd, entituled, <hi>The order of Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Baptiſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, my lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>I thought ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then telling how and where he might get it, he gave him a ſpace of time to peruſe it; and told him if that would not ſatisfy him, to come to him, and he would give him full ſatisfaction.—Some time after the biſhop ſent his bailiff to take my father: but he was then gone to Briſtol with George Fox. The officers came ſeveral times and ſearched the houſe for him, pretending they only wanted him for a ſmall treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, which would ſoon be made up, if they could ſee him. My mother anſwered ſhe didn't believe any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour he had would trouble him upon ſuch an account; for if by chance any of his cattle treſpaſs'd upon any, he would readily make 'em ſatisfaction, without further trouble. Which they very well knew. However, ſhe always treated them civilly, and frequently ſet meat and drink before 'em. My father ſtaying away longer than was expected, they imagin'd he abſconded for fear of 'em; and therefore offered my mother, if ſhe would give them twenty ſhillings, to let him come home for a month.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012986_0023_0F903DE407688F88"/>
But ſhe told them ſhe knew of no wrong he had done to any man, and therefore would give 'em no money; for that would imply a conſciouſneſs of guilt.
<q>But (ſaid ſhe) if my enemy hunger, I can feed him; and if he thirſt. I can give him drink.</q>
Upon this they flew into a rage, and ſaid, they would have him if he were above ground; for none could pardon him but the king. My father returning home thro' Tedbury, was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the bailiffs had been about his houſe almoſt ever ſince he went from home. He therefore contrived to come home after day-light; when he came into his own grounds, the moon ſhining bright, he ſpy'd the ſhadow of a man, and aſk'd, who's there? "It is I," ſays the man.</p>

               <speaker>Sam. Stubbs.</speaker>
               <p>No, maſter: I might; but I would not meddle: I have wrong'd you enough already: God forgive me. But thoſe who now lie in wait for you are the Paytons, my lord biſhop's bailiffs. I would not have you fall into their hands, for they are mercileſs rogues I would have you, maſter, take my counſel: ever while you live pleaſe a knave, for an honeſt man won't hurt you.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>My father came home, and deſired us not to let the bailiffs in upon him that night, that he might have an opportunity of taking counſel on his pillow. In the morning he told my mother what he had ſeen that night in a viſion.
<q>I thought (ſaid he) I was walking a fine pleaſant green way; but it was narrow, and had a wall an each ſide of it. In my way lay ſomething like a bear, but more dreadful. The ſight of him put me to a ſtand. A man ſeeing me ſurprized, came to me with a ſmiling countenance, and ſaid, <hi>Why art tho afraid, friend? he is chain'd, and can't hurt thee.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

will, and thought his face ſhone like the face of an angel. Upon which I took courage, and ſtepping forward, laid my hand upon his head.</q>
The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction he made of this to my mother was: <hi>Truth is a narrow way; and this biſhop lies in my way; I muſt go to him, whatever I ſuffer.</hi> So he aroſe, and ſet forward, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Amariah Drewett, a friend of Cirenceſter, to accompany him. When they came to the biſhop's houſe at Cleve, near Glouceſter, they found a butcher's wife of Cirenceſter, who was come to intercede for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was put into the biſhop's court for killing meat on firſt-days. Two young ſparks of the biſhop's attendance, were aſking her if ſhe knew John Haywood? She anſwered, "Yes, very well." <q>What is he for a man?</q>
ſaid they. <hi>A very good man,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>ſetting aſide his religion: but I have nothing to ſay to that.</hi> One of them ſaid he'd give five ſhillings to ſee him; the other offer'd eight. Upon which my father ſtepp'd up to them; but they ſaid not one word to him. One of them preſently informed the biſhop he was come. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the biſhop diſmiſs'd his company, and had him up ſtairs. My father found him ſeated in his chair, with his hat under his arm, aſſuming a majeſtic air. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtood ſilent a while; and ſeeing the biſhop didn't begin with him, he approached nearer, and thus accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: "Old man my buſineſs is with thee."</p>

               <p>I have heard thou haſt ſent out thy bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs to take me: but I rather choſe to come myſelf, to know what wrong I have done thee.

               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>Our ſubjection to laws is either active or paſſive. So that if a man can't, for conſcience-ſake, do the thing the law requires, but paſſively ſuffers what the law inflicts, the law, I conceive, is as fully anſwered as if he had actually obeyed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>You are wrong in that too: for ſuppoſe a man ſteal an ox, and then be taken, and hang'd for the fact; what reſtitution is that to the owner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>None at all. But tho' it is no reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the owner, yet the law is ſatisfied. Tho' the owner be a loſer, the criminal has ſuffered the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the law inflicts, as an equivalent for the crime committed. But thou may'ſt ſee the corruptneſs of ſuch laws, which put the life of a man upon a level with the life of a beaſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>What! do ſuch men as you find fault with the laws?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; and I'll tell thee plainly, 'tis high time wiſer men were choſen, to make better laws. For if this thief was taken and ſold for a proper term, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of Moſes, and the owner had four oxen for his ox, and four ſheep for his ſheep, he would be ſatisfied, and the man's life preſerved, that he might repent, and amend his ways.—But! hope thou doſt not accuſe me of having ſtole any man's ox or aſs.</p>

               <p>There liv'd in days paſt Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, king of Babylon, who ſet up an image, and made a decree, that all who would not bow to it ſhould be caſt the ſame hour into a burning fiery furnace.

               <p>Then firſt I would aſk thee, where was thy religion in Oliver's days? The common-prayer-book was then become (even among the clergy) like an old al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, very few regarding it in our country.

               <p>Do you ſay that drunken old man was better than Mr. Bull? I tell you, I account Mr. Bull as ſound, able, and orthodox a divine as any we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſorry for that; for if he is one of the beſt of you, I believe the Lord will not ſuffer you long: for he is a proud, ambitious, ungodly man; he has often ſued me at law, and brought his ſervants to ſwear againſt me wrongfully. His ſervants themſelves have confeſs'd to my ſervants, that I might have their ears; for their maſter made 'em drunk, and then told them they were ſet down in the liſt as witneſſes againſt me, and they muſt ſwear to it: and ſo they did, and brought treble damages. They likewiſe owned they took tythes from my ſervant, threſhed 'em out, and ſold 'em for their maſter. They have alſo ſeveral times took my cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle out of my grounds, drove 'em to fairs and markets, and ſold them without giving me any account.</p>

               <p>Our religion, as thou may'ſt read in the ſcripture (John iv.) was ſet up by Chriſt himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſixteen and ſeventeen hundred years ago: and he had full power to eſtabliſh the true religion in his church, when he told the woman of Samaria, that neither at that mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem, was the place of true worſhip. They worſhip they knew not what. For, ſaid he, God is a Spirit, <hi>and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in truth.</hi> This is our religion, and hath ever been the religion of all thoſe who have worſhipped God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably thro' the ſeveral ages ſince down to this time; and will be the religion of the true ſpiritual worſhippers
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012986_0029_0F903DEDD32736A8"/>
of God to the world's end; a religion perform'd by the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God, becauſe God is a ſpirit; a religion eſtabliſh'd by Chriſt himſelf before the maſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, ſervice-book, or directory, or any of thoſe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and traditions of men, which in the night of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy were ſet up.</p>

               <p>Yours is the ſtrangeſt of all perſuaſions: For tho' there are many ſects (which he named) and tho' they and we differ in ſome circumſtances, yet in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals we agree as one.

               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad of that; for the root is the rottenneſs, and truth ſtrikes at the very foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That little ſtone which Daniel ſaw cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without hands will overturn all in God's due time, when you have done all you can to ſupport it But, as to thoſe others thou mention'ſt, there is ſo little difference between you, that wiſe men wonder why you differ at all; only we read, <hi>the beaſt had many heads and many horns, which puſh againſt each other.</hi> And yet I am fully perſwaded, there are many in this day true ſpiritual worſhippers in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions.</p>

               <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you will give a carpenter leave to call his gimblet a gimblet, and his gouge a gouge; but you call our church a maſs-houſe.</p>

               <p>I would not upbraid you; but I'll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew thee wherein you fall ſhort of carpenters. Suppoſe I had a ſon intended to learn the trade of a carpenter; I indent with an honeſt man of that calling, in conſideration of ſo much money, to teach my ſon his trade in ſuch a term of years; at the end of which term my ſon may be as good, or perhaps a better workman than his maſter, and he ſhall be at liberty from him to follow the buſineſs for himſelf. Now will you be ſo honeſt as this carpenter? You are men who pretend to know more of light, life, and ſalvation, and things pertaining to the kingdom of heaven, than we do: I would aſk in how long a time you would undertake to teach us as much as you know? and what ſhall we give you, that we may be once free from our maſters? But here you keep us always learning, that he may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways paying you. Plainly 'tis a very cheat. What! always, learning and never able to come to the knowledge of God! miſerable ſinners you found us, and miſerable ſinners you leave us.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>After ſome more diſcourſe, my father told him time was far ſpent; and ſaid, "It nothing will ſerve thee but my body in a priſon, here it is in thy power, and if thou commandeſt me to deliver myſelf up either to the ſheriff, or to the jailor of Glouceſter caſtle, as thy priſoner, I will go, and ſeek no other judge, advocate, or attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to plead my cauſe, but the great judge of heaven and earth, who knows I have nothing but love and good-will in my heart to thee and all mankind."</p>

               <p>The Biſhop then call'd for ſomething to drink; but my father acknowledg'd his kindneſs, and excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from drinking.

humour, ſaid to my father, "My lord and theſe gentlemen have been to ſee your burying-ground, and and we think you keep it very decent."

            <p>My father then offering the cup to the prieſt Bull, he refuſed it, ſaying, <hi>It is full of hops and hereſy.</hi> To which my father reply'd, As for hops, I cannot ſay much, not being at the brewing of it; but as for hereſy, I do aſſure thee neighbour Bull, there's none in my beer; and if thou pleaſeſt to drink, thou art welcome; but if not, I deſire thee to take notice, as good as thee will; and thoſe are as well able to judge of hereſy.

But thou know'ſt God is the higher power; and you mortal men, however advanced in this world, are but the lower power; and it is only becauſe I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be obedient to the will of the higher powers, that the lower powers are angry with me.

When they came to the foot of the ſtairs which led up to the biſhop's chamber, they were eſpy'd by George Evans, who ſaid, come up, John; my lord thought you long. When they came up, the Biſhop was juſt ſetting down to dinner, with a number of clergymen; and offering to make room for my father, he excuſed himſelf, and retired with his friend till dinner was over.

               <p>I can promiſe no ſuch thing. The laſt time I was there, I was moved and required of the Lord, whom I ſerve, to bear teſtimony againſt a hireling prieſt, who was preaching for hire and divining for money; and he was angry with me, and cauſed the people to turn me out. And I don't intend to trouble him again till he learn more civility, except the Lord requires it of me.</p>

But it is thoſe who ſet thee on miſchief. I would not have thee hearken to 'em but bid 'em take up ſome honeſt vocation, and rob their honeſt neighbours no longer. They are like a company of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars who deſtroy the fruit of the earth, and live on the fruit of other mens labour.</p>

               <p>The woman of the houſe underſtanding the conſtable was to be ſent for, diſpatch'd a meſſenger to him to bid him get out of the way. But the meſſenger miſſing him, he came to the houſe by accident. To whom the landlady ſaid. "What do you do here, when honeſt John Haywood

               <p>I had a poor neighbour, who had a wife and ſix children, and whom the chief men about us permitted to keep ſix or ſeven cows upon the waſte, which were the principal ſupport of his family, and preſerv'd 'em from becoming chargeable to the pariſh. One very ſtormy night the cattle were left in the yard, as uſual; but could not be found in the morning. The man and his ſons had ſought 'em to no purpoſe: and after they had been loſt four days, his wife came to me, and in a great deal of grief, cry'd, O Lord! maſter Haywood, we are undone! my huſband and I muſt go a begging in our old age! we have loſt all our cows! my huſband and the boys have been round the country, and can hear nothing of them, I'll down on my bare knees if you'll ſtand our friend? I deſired ſhe would not be in ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, and told her ſhe ſhould not down on her knees to me; but I would gladly help them in what I could. I know, ſaid ſhe, you are a good man, and God will

hear your prayers. I deſire thee (ſaid I) to be ſtill and quiet in thy mind; perhaps thy huſband or ſon may hear of 'em to day; if not, let thy huſband get a horſe and come to me to morrow morning as ſoon as he will and I think, if it pleaſe God, to go with him to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Her faith being ſo ſtrong, brought the greater exerciſe upon me, with ſtrong cries unto the Lord, that he would be pleaſed to make me inſtrumental in his hand, for the help of the poor family. In the morning early comes the old man, <hi>In the name of God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which way ſhall we go and ſeek them</hi>? I being deeply concerned in my mind, did not anſwer him till he had thrice repeated it; and then I anſwered, "In the name of God we will go to ſeek them (and ſaid before I was aware) we will go to Malmsbury, and at the horſe-fair we ſhall find them" When I had ſpoken the words I was much troubled leſt they ſhould not prove true. It was very early, and the firſt man we ſaw, I aſked him if he had ſeen any ſtray milch cows there abouts? <hi>What manner of cattle are they</hi>? ſaid he. And the old man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of their marks and number, he told us there were ſome ſtood chewing their cuds in their horſe-fair: but thinking they belonged to ſome of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he did not take particular notice of them. When we came to the place, the old man found 'em to be his; but ſuffered his tranſports of joy to riſe ſo high, that I was aſhamed of his behaviour; for he fell a hollowing, and threw up his mountier cap in the air ſeveral times, 'till he raiſed the neighbours out of their beds to ſee what was matter. <hi>O</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I had loſt my cows four or five days ago, and thought I ſhould never ſee them again; and this honeſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of mine, told me this morning by his own fire ſide, nine miles off, that here I ſhould them find, and here I have them</hi>! Then up goes his cap again. I begged of the poor man to be quiet, and take his cows home, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as indeed I was, being reverently bowed in my ſpirit before the Lord, in that he was pleaſed to put the words of truth into my mouth.

               <p>That jailor had been very cruel to me, and the reſt of our friends, who were then priſoners. He had kept us in priſon from the ſeſſion to the aſſize, and from the aſſize to the ſeſſion, omitting to put our names in the Kalender, that we might have had a hearing. At length I found means, at aſſize time, to acquaint the judge (by letter) of his illegal proceedings. In conſequence of which we were ordered to be put on the Kalender, had a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were acquitted. The judge ſeverely repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the jailor, ſaying, "Sirrah! if ever I hear that you do the like for the future, I'll take care that you ſhall be jailor here no longer. Shall I come here to hear and determine cauſes, and ſhall you keep men in priſon during your pleaſure, and not put their names in the Kalender"? The jailor coming out of the caſtle was heard by the turnkey to ſay, "It was about Haywood that I was ſo ſeverely reprimanded by the judge; and if ever he comes into the caſtle again, he ſhall never come out alive." Upon which the turnkey took an opportunity to find me out, and informing me of it, ſaid, "I would not have you by any means come
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012986_0044_0F903DFF07B71518"/>
back to the caſtle to night, to fetch any of your things; for if you do, he'll certainly detain you for his ſees. I'll take care of your thing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> if yourſelf were preſent to do it." I acknowledged his kindneſs, and went home. When the jailor return'd to the caſtle, he aſk'd the turnkey where the Quakers were? He anſwer'd, he thought it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take care of the felons, and to leave the Quakers to him. Not long after, being conſtable, I ſecur'd a felon who broke out of the caſtle, and ſent the turnkey notice of it. He coming over to fetch him back, begg'd if by any means I could prevent it, that I would not come any more a priſoner to the caſtle whilſt his maſter was jailor. "For (ſays he) if you do, he ſwears you ſhall never go out alive; and that hour you come in I leave the caſtle; for I can't ſtay there to ſee you abuſed." Does he ſtill ſay ſo? ſaid I. Yes, he does, ſaid he, "Then remember me to him (ſaid I) and tell him from me I ſhall never ſee his face any more! Soon after it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to take him away by death; and in a little time I was had priſoner there again.</p>

               <p>Some time ago, ſeveral of my friends being met, together with me in a peaceable manner, to worſhip God, at Stoke Orchard, thy father came in with a file of muſquetiers at his heels, and beat and abus'd us very much. I then warn'd him in abundance of love. Yet he did not ſeem to regard it, but ſent about twelve of us to Glouceſter caſtle. I then told him God would plead our cauſe with him. And I was credibly inform'd that, not the very night, but the next night after, he went to bed as well in appearance as uſual; but in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he not ringing a certain bell, which he had by him for that purpoſe, at the time he us'd to do, his houſekeeper went up ſeveral times, and thought he was aſleep. But at length, ſuſpecting ſomething more than ordinary, ſhe made a cloſer inſpection; and, perceiving his countenance chang'd, ſhe threw open the curtains in a great ſurpriſe. On which, he juſt flaſh'd open his eyes, but ſaid not a word. She aſk'd him how he did? but he made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Which made her cry out more earneſtly; "Pray ſir, how do you do? How is it with you? For God's ſake tell me." And all he ſaid to her was Oh theſe Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers! Oh theſe Quakers! Would to God I never had a hand againſt the Quakers! I did not hear that ever he ſpoke more</p>
               <p>Sir John ſeem'd ſurpriſed at this relation, and did not contradict it in the leaſt; which, it is very reaſonable to think, he would, and with reſentement too, had it not been true. Yet not withſtanding this fair warning, he continued his practice of granting warrants againſt us.

But the officers were generally ſo civil as to acquaint us with it in time. Some time after this, Sir J. Guiſe and Sir Robert Atkins, being at Perrot's Brook, two miles from Cirenceſter, quarrell'd as they were gaming. Sir John drew his Sword, and demanded ſatisfaction: But thoſe in the houſe ſtepped between and parted them. They ſeeming to appear pacified, ſat down again. But afterwards, taking a walk together in the bowling-green, the breaſt of Sir John being filled with reſentment, he ſaid, Sir Robert, you gave me the lye; and I will have ſatisfaction.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
               <p>If I have ſaid any thing more than what is common for gentlemen to ſay to each other in their play, betwixt you and I, I aſk your pardon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
               <p>If you'll go in, and aſk it before the people of the houſe, I will put it up; otherwiſe I will not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir John; that's beneath me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
               <p>Then draw, or you ſhall die like a dog.— They both drew; and Sir Robert gave him a gentle prick in the arm, and ſaid, I deſire you, Sir John, to take that for ſatisfaction. I could have had you elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; but was unwilling to do you further miſchief.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
               <p>I'll kill or be killed.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
               <p>If that be your mind, look to yourſelf as well as you can; for I ſhall have you at the next paſs.— And ſo he had; for he ran him through, in at the belly and out at the back; on which he fell. Sir Robert ſtepped up to him, unbuttoned his cloaths, tore his ſhirt down, and gently drew out his ſword; and then, after he had well ſucked the wound, taking his handkerchief, he rolled up the corners of it hard, and thruſt it into the orifice: then buttoning of his cloaths, he lifted him up, and deſired him while he was able, that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qaint the people of the houſe that his death was owing to his own ſeeking. And when they were come about him, he was ſo generous as to ſay, "If I die, Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert is clear; for if he had not killed me, I would have killed him." Sir Robert procured him ſurgeons; and, after a while, when great pain came upon him, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented himſelf much, and ſaid, "It was the juſt hand
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012986_0049_0F903E085FAD15C8"/>
of God upon me for meddling with the Quakers. But, if he will be pleaſed to ſpare me, and try me again, I'll never have a hand againſt them any more. For Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood told me, if I went on perſecuting, the ſame hand that overtook my father would overtake me, before I was aware. He further told me, I was ſet on by ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious prieſts; and I might have time to repent it. And ſo I do with all my heart. And 'tis true; I could never come into company with Mr. Careleſs or Mr. Freame, but they would be ſtirring me up to put the laws in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt Diſſenters." The ſword having miſſed his entrails, he recovered, ſtood candidate for the county after, and never more diſturbed our meetings.</p>
               <p>The next thing I ſhall take notice of, is the proceeding of juſtice James George, againſt my father, my brother Nathaniel and myſelf. He came to the Ram in Ciren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and ſent for my brother and me. My father went with us. And when we came thither, he ſaid:—"'Tis very well, John, that you are come too, I ſent for your ſons, to let them know it is his Majeſty's pleaſure to have the laws put in execution: and now I take this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to let them and you know, that we muſt all be of one church."</p>

            <p>A little time after this, he ſent to the officers, to bid them go to the Quakers meeting-houſe on ſunday next, and bring their names to him. The officers were very unwilling to obey his commands; and ſome of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with their orders, deſiring we would not meet at the uſual time, or otherwiſe that we would meet at another place. I told them, we did not dare ſo far to deny the worſhip of our God: For, ſaid I, we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the ſame God that Daniel did: and he, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſevere decree of the King, failed not openly to own God, by praying to him, with his window open as uſual. And our God is the ſame he was in Daniel's days, as able to ſtop the mouths of lions as he was then. And we are not afraid to truſt him, having had experience of many deliverances he hath wrought for us. The next firſt day we met at the time and place we uſed to meet; and a good meeting we had, the living pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord being ſenſibly felt amongſt us. One of the conſtables came in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and delivered a warrant to my brother John, deſiring him to read it. But my brother put it in his pocket, telling him he deſigned to read it when the meeting was over. "That will not do, ſaid he for if you will not read it now, I deſire you to give it to me again." Which he did. And then they took a liſt of ſeveral of our names, and carried it to juſtice George. On which he ſent out his warrants to diſtrain our goods. They ſeized my father's corn in his barns, and locked up the barn-doors. And at that ſame time the murrain had ſeized the juſtice's cattle, and they died apace. His ſteward told him, he muſt ſend for John
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012986_0051_0F903E0998DFAD00"/>
Haywood, or he would loſe all his cattle.
<q>No, ſaid the juſtice, don't ſend for him now; becauſe I have warrants out againſt him and his ſons. Send for any body elſe.</q> So the ſteward ſent for another; who did what he could for 'em, but to very little purpoſe, for the cattle continued to ſicken and die as before. The ſteward then told him, "Pleaſe your worſhip, if you don't ſend for John Haywood, I believe you will loſe all your cattle; for now the bull is ſick, and off his meat; and I don't find this man does them any good. But if you'll pleaſe to ſend for John, I don't queſtion but he would be of ſervice to them." Send for him then, ſaid the juſtice; but don't bring him in as you uſed to do. When he has done what he can, pay him, and diſmiſs him. So my father was ſent for, and went (having learned that great chriſtian leſſon to return good for evil) and did his beſt for 'em. When he had done, as he was wiping his hands in the entry, the juſtice unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly came by him; and, ſeeing he could not avoid his notice, ſaid, So, John, you have done ſomething for my cattle, I ſuppoſe. Yes, ſaid my father, and I hope it will do them good. Well, (ſaid the juſtice to the ſteward) pay John.</p>

Which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my father's readineſs to ſerve him, ſo wrought on him, that I don't remember any of his corn was taken from him at that time. But my brother Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel and myſelf, being partners in trade in Ciren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, were fined by this juſtice George, for ourſelves, and unable perſons preſent with us at the meeting, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty pounds.</p>
            <p>Some time after came to our houſe Sir Thomas Cutter, with other juſtices, the ſheriff of the county, his men, and two conſtables. Our neighbours, in good-will to us, ſhut our doors, and the maid faſtened them on the inſide. But the juſtices gave orders they ſhould be broke open. A young woman being in the ſhop when it was done, ran out at the back door in a fright. Which Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas ſeeing, ſaid, "There is one gone! There might as well be five hundred gone; I'll take my oath here was a conventicle." I, being near him, bid him take care what he ſaid or ſwore, becauſe he muſt give account, and he knew not how ſoon. A ſervant belonging to one of them took off my hat, and laid it on the table.

The jailor's name was John Landborne; and for a piece of ſervice I did him gratis in his abſence (<hi>i. e.</hi> officiating as key-turner, and preventing two notorious robbers from breaking out) I could prevail with him to let ſeveral of our friends go home, when occaſion particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, for ſome time together. We being a large number of us in priſon, had often large meetings on the firſt-days in the caſtle.

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012986_0054_0F903E0C547244A8"/>
came to our morning meeting, accompanyed with ſeveral others. My father was preſent with us, and Henry Panton, (who had formerly been a fencing-maſter) was preaching, when they came in, concerning the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome, who perpetually ſay they are doing what they ought not, and leaving undone what they ought to do: which words Parſons (who was a prieſt, a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and a juſtice) took hold of, telling him he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of others for what he was doing himſelf; for (ſaid he) you are now doing what you ought not, and leaving undone what you ought to do; catching hold of his grey locks to pull him down. But Henry being a tall man, ſtrong and active, though in years, he ſtood his ground, and ſpoke over his head. Parſons then ſtrove to ſtop his mouth; but he avoided it, by turning his head on one ſide. When he had done ſpeaking, a friend ſtood up, and ſaid, "'Tis a ſign the devil's hard put to it to have his drudgery done, that prieſts muſt leave their pulpits and pariſhioners, to take up the buſineſs of informers againſt poor priſoners in the priſon." After prieſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had been ſome time endeavouring to get the names of ſome preſent, and no body would give him information, he thus broke out: "If you are thereabouts, I ſhall be even with you another way." For he had got a liſt of ſeveral of the priſoners names; and taking for granted that they were all preſent at the time, he ſent out his warrants for diſtraining their goods. However, herein he was miſtaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſeveral were then abſent; among whom was Lettice Guſh, a widow, who lived about twenty miles diſtant. Some officers being ſent to her houſe to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> her goods, for being at this meeting, when ſhe was twenty miles from the place; when the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers came, ſhe told them ſhe was not at the meeting: and to convince them, perſuaded them to go with her to her landlord, who was alſo a juſtice of the peace, and knew what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be true. When they came before him, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him the warrant, "What a raſcal (ſaid he) <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Parſons! Here, he ſays, he will take his oath that my tenant was convicted by him of being a

conventicle in Glouceſter caſtle ſuch a day of the month; and I'll take my oath ſhe was at home, at the ſame time, which is twenty miles off. If you touch any of her goods by virtue of this warrant, be it at your peril. I will aſſure you if you do, I will ſtick cloſe to your ſkirts."</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Officer.</speaker>
               <p>What can be done in this caſe? How can we make a legal return of the warrant without executing it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Landlord.</speaker>
               <p>Carry it back to Mr. Parſons, and tell him to wipe his breech with it; and I will bear you out in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>So they returned, without giving her any further trouble. Another warrant was iſſued out againſt Francis Boy, phyſician, on the ſame account, and of the ſame value, who was likewiſe abſent at the time of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended conviction. When the officers came to diſtrain his goods, he was not at home. So his cattle were taken away to the value of between twenty and thirty pounds. He afterwards, on inſpection, found by his books, that he was attending a gentleman the time he was ſaid to be convicted. To this gentleman he went, and enquired of him if he could remember the day he attended him? The gentleman anſwered, "He had good reaſon to remember it; for (ſaid he) if you had not done what you did for me that day, I believe I ſhould have been now in my grave." He then informed the gentleman of the reaſon that induced him to give him that trouble. "Well (replied he) I adviſe you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the next quarter ſeſſions for redreſs and you may aſſure yourſelf I will endeavour to ſerve you what lies in my power; for I will take my oath before any judge or bench of juſtices in England that you was with me that day." But it ſo fell out that he had no occaſion to appeal. For it ſoon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that he had ſuch a ſubſtantial evidence in his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and his cattle were returned before the ſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Not long after it pleaſed God to viſit my dear father with ſickneſs that proved mortal. I had have to attend him the major part of the time he was ſick: and the Lord was pleaſed to favour him with his living preſence in his laſt moments: and having honourably finiſhed his
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012986_0056_0F903E0D4B131D10"/>
days work, he departed this life in the year 1683, and was interred in the piece of ground he had long before given to friends for a burying-place, ſituate at the lower end of his orchard, at Siddington, near Cirenceſter.</p>
            <p>Some days after his interment, I had the news that my brother and myſelf, with four friends more, were diſcharged by the judge; but that the other four were detained for the fees I therefore went down to uſe my intereſt for their diſcharge. I found him ill in bed; and he told me he was very willing to remit the fees belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf; but there was ſome due to the under-ſheriff, and thoſe were not in his power. But ſoon after providence ſo ordered that we all had our liberty; and I came and ſettled at my preſent habitation at Cheſham, in Buckinghamſhire, where I have now dwelt about forty years.</p>
            <p>Thus, conſidering that it were great pity thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular providences of the Almighty ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, for the benefit of poſterity, I was willing for my own peruſal and that of my family, and ſome few particular friends, to commit them to writing. In the doing of which, reſpecting the ſeveral conferences my father had with the biſhops, and others, before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I have been careful to pen them down in the ſame words they were then expreſſed in, as near as I could recollect, or at leaſt to retain the genuine ſenſe and purport of them. Which, reader, if they tend to thy confirmation and encouragement in a courſe of true chriſtian piety, I have my end; who am</p>
