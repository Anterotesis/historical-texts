            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE inducements to the publication of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter at this diſtant period, from the date of it, proceed from a hope entertained by ſome devout perſons, who have been edified by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual experiences it contains, that it may prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and comforting to others alike piouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and to obviate the inconveniences to which manuſcripts are liable, through the negligence and inattention of tranſcribers, incorrect copies having been handed about;—it has therefore been reviſed, and is now recommended to the ſerious peruſal of thoſe who having entered on a religious life, may find encouragement and inſtruction to preſs forward with ſtability and humble reſignation, through the various probations and conflicts attending them in their chriſtian progreſs, that they may obtain under their ſpiritual leader, the grace of God, the end of their faith, the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be ſatisfactory to the readers, to have ſome account given of the writer, and the perſon to whom the letter was wrote, they are therefore briefly informed that Elizabeth Webb was an acknowledged miniſter among the people called Quakers, who from an apprehenſion of religious duty, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of goſpel love, went from Pennſylvania to Great Britain, to viſit her friends there about the year 1712, and in London contracted ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Anthony William Boehm, chaplain to prince George of Denmark, the conſort of Ann, queen of England; he was by birth a <hi>German,</hi> but well acquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> language, and died in the year 1722; the divers writings on religious ſubjects he has left, ſhew him to be a man of a truly pious and catholic diſpoſition, which is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the teſtimonials given of him by men of character in that time, who from their perſonal knowledge, mention him with great reſpect for his piety to God, and benevolence to mankind.</p>

               <salute>Worthy Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE kind reſpect thou ſhewed me, when at London, hath laid me under an obligation wherein I find my mind drawn to communicate to thee in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of divine love, on which I muſt deſire thy favourable conſtruction; as I am almoſt a ſtranger to thee. What I have to write, hath been on my mind theſe ſeveral weeks, in that pure innocent love, in which is the communion of ſaints. I have no learned method to deliver my religious experience ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or writing, but plainly and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as the ſpirit of truth directs, and I being the weaker veſſel too, have the more need to beg to be excuſed. I ſhall not write from notions or ſpeculations; as at a diſtance, I look on ſuch things as unſafe, and I know
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017424_0004_0FA11A1F22009700"/>they are many times unſound, but I ſhall write a ſmall part of what I have gone through, and what my ſoul hath taſted of the good word of life, which is near, that we may have fellowſhip together in God the father of our ſpirits, and in his ſon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, whom my ſoul hath known, both in mercy and in judgment, to the mortifying, in a good degree, the fallen and corrupt nature, and to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of my heart, ſo far, that I can ſay to his praiſe, I do not ſee HIM through particular forms, ſects, party-impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or any ſuch thing; no, my dear friend, I never ſought after the Lord in theſe ways, nor for any of theſe ends, but I ſought after him in my young years for ſalvation, and I ſtill ſeek to him for the perfect reſtoration of my ſoul in him. I have nothing of my own to boaſt of, unleſs it be weakneſs and infirmities; but deſire to rejoice in the croſs of Chriſt, by which I am crucified to the world, in a good degree, and the world to me, ſo that I can ſay I die daily.</p>
            <p>And as touching the fondneſs for educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, religious profeſſion and converſation, theſe things have caſt no miſt before my eyes.</p>
            <p>I can ſee, own and love the image of my Lord and Saviour in any ſort of profeſſion,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017424_0005_0FA11A2131CC1F88"/>if the ſoul hath been educated in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly univerſity or ſchool of Chriſt, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we cannot ſee God in or have fellowſhip with all ſorts of converſations, that of the wicked is as <q>if there was no God, God is not in all their thoughts:</q> and ſuch as deſpiſe the image of the meek, humble Jeſus, and will follow none of his precepts, nor his ſelf-denying example, whilſt they are here; the Lord will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after deſpiſe their image; for they ſhall have an image according to the feed or ſpirit, in which they lay down their body; every ſeed ſhall have its own body in the reſurrection of the juſt and the unjuſt, and every one ſhall receive his own ſentence: Thou well obſerveſt that ſin, ſelf-love, ſelf-will, &amp;c. contract the ſoul into a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compreſs, but the love of God, breaks down all thoſe walls of ſelfiſhneſs by which the ſoul is hedged in and reſtrained from univerſal love and benignity. This is very true, but, there are thoſe who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our love as it is in Jeſus, nevertheleſs ſome have felt the flowings of the love and compaſſion of him, "that would not the death of a ſinner, but rather that all would return to him, repent and live;" I am a witneſs for the Lord, that the ſhedding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of his love over the inhabitants of this nation, hath been like ſhowers of rain
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017424_0006_0FA11A21DA3B2A08"/>in the ſpring time, I well remember that I told a friend in <hi>London,</hi> I felt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine extendings of the love of God, ſo to ſlow to the people, as I walked in the ſtreets of the city, that I could have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed the ſalvation of God, which is near, and his righteouſneſs which is ready to be revealed, in the publick places of concoarſe; the friend ſaid he hoped it would not be required of me, this I mention to convince thee that univerſal love prevails in the hearts of ſome who are unknown to the world, and hardly known to their own brethren, and this is not to be wondered at, Eli did not know the inward exerciſe of Hannah, and the prophet Elijah thought he had been left alone, until the Lord told him he had ſeven thouſand in Iſrael who had not bowed to Baal; the prophet Samuel, alſo when he looked out with an eye of reaſon on the goodneſs of the ſtature of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab ſaid, ſurely the Lords anointed is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; ſo now unleſs the Lord be pleaſed to reveal things to us, we are liable to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. But bleſſed be the name of our moſt gracious God, who is the ſame that ever he was, he ſees not as man ſees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.</p>
            <p>I received thy ſecond letter juſt as I was going out of London, of which I have ſent
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017424_0007_0FA11A2696352670"/>thee a copy, with ſome annotations, my view therein is that if thou thinks it it may be of benefit to any, thou may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it; if not let it lie by thee.</p>
            <p>I take great notice of thy chriſtian love and good advice in thy ſecond letter, and do accept of it very heartily, and can aſſure thee, that my labour is not to gather people into a formality, but I labour according as the Lord enables me to gather ſouls to Chriſt, who is able to make the deceitful hearts of the children of men, plain, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, upright and clean, and "when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide is clean, the outſide will be clean alſo," but I freely acknowledge that the glory of the true church or myſtical body, or bride of Chriſt, which is made up of ſouls, who have entered into covenant with the Lord, to love and ſerve him forever, is within, her cloathing is of wrought gold, and the curious needlework of virgin wiſdom is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, for ſhe having been ſtripped of all her old rags or garments of righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs, and having been waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in pure water, her bridegroom hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed her with holy oil, the holy unction of his ſpirit, and he is cloathing her with the beautiful garment of his ſalvation, the robe of his righteouſneſs; ſhe is depending on him for her daily bread: So that ſhe is not eating her own bread, nor wearing her
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017424_0008_0FA11A26C25F7BA0"/>own apparel; ſhe cannot be content only with bearing his name, but longs to be made more and more a partaker of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and the love of her Lord hath been and ſtill is ſo largely extended to her, with her love ſo to him, that ſhe is wholly ſubject to him, he ruleth in love, and ſhe obeys in love, and this makes all things ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; ſhe hath no will of her own, but the will of her Lord is her will in all things, all his commands are pleaſant to her, becauſe ſhe delights to wait on him, and to ſerve in his preſence, and had rather be deprived of all outward enjoyments, than of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and the enjoyment of his favour, her converſation is adorned with humility and meekneſs, her ſteps are comely in the eyes of her beloved, "all her children are taught of the Lord, eſtabliſhed in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and great is their peace." And my foul may ſay to the praiſe and glory of God, that no greater comfort can be enjoyed on this ſide of the grave, than to be a child or member of this church.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear friend, I will give thee a ſhort account of the dealings of the Lord with me in my young years, how he brought my ſoul through fire and water, for what end this hath lived in my mind I know not, except it be for our ſpiritual communion; but when my ſoul is loweſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017424_0009_0FA11A2777F38838"/>and neareſt to the Lord in the ſimplicity of truth, then is my heart opened and my mind filled with divine love reſpecting this matter deſire thee to peruſe it inwardly, when thou art retired, and not to judge of it before thou haſt gone through it, and then judge as freely as thou pleaſeſt: I was baptized and educated in the way of the church of England, I went to ſchool to a miniſter thereof, and loved and honoured him greatly, he ſhewed great kindneſs and tenderneſs to me, and in thoſe days I looked on the miniſters to be like angels, that brought glad tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the children of men; but when I was about fourteen years of age, I went to live at a knight's houſe who kept a chaplain; I obſerved his converſation and ſaw it was vain, and I thought it ought not to be ſo, and was troubled in my mind, for I then began to think on my latter end, and alſo on eternity, and I had no aſſurance of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a ſtate of happineſs, if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to ſend the meſſenger of death to call me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>way, ſo the fear of the Lord laid hold on my mind, and I began to ſearch the ſcriptures, and found they teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that the wicked ſhould be turned into hell, and all thoſe that forgot God; and I ſaw that both prieſts and people did too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally forget God, as ſoon as they came off their knees or from their devotion, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017424_0010_0FA11A2837BB9400"/>I was much afraid of hell, and wanted an aſſurance of a place in the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; then I began to think on the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes that were made for me in my baptiſm, as they called it, whereby they ſaid I was made a member of Chriſt, a child of God &amp;c. and that I ſhould renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh, and ſhould keep God's holy will and commandments. I thought indeed this was the way to obtain a place in the kingdom of heaven, but I had no power to do what I ought to do, nor to forſake what I ought to forſake, for I was very proud, vain and airy, but as I was thus inwardly exerciſed, and outwardly ſearching the ſcriptures, my underſtanding was more and more opened, I read and took notice that the miniſters of Chriſt, which he qualified and ſent forth to preach were to do it freely, for Chriſt ſaid, "freely ye have received freely give," and that thoſe "who run when the Lord never ſent them, ſhould not profit the people at all," and many ſuch things open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my mind and I uſed to ponder them in my heart, and the promiſes to the flock in the 34th of Ezekiel, where the Lord promiſed to bind up that which was brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and to ſtrengthen that which was ſick. Thoſe and ſuch like portions of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017424_0011_0FA11A290873F4A8"/>were very comfortable to me, for I was ſick of my ſins, and my heart was broken many times before the Lord, and I thought, Oh that I had lived in the days of Chriſt, I would ſurely have been one of thoſe that followed him, and I grieved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Jews crucified him, ſo that I loved Chriſt in the outward appearance, and could have ſaid (as Peter ſaid) far be it from thee Lord to ſuffer: Yet I did not know he was ſo near me by his holy ſpirit; but I was convinced that the hireling ſhepherds who teach for hire and divine for money<note n="*" place="bottom">Micah 3, 11.</note> were not the miniſters of Chriſt, by the teſtimony of the prophets and of Chriſt himſelf, who ſaid "by their fruits ye ſhall know them," ſo I left going to hear them; and walked alone, for I went ſo long till a fear followed me into the worſhip houſe, and I thought it would be juſt upon me, if I was made an example for my inattention, to the ſpirit of truth. And when I was about fifteen years old, it pleaſed God to ſend the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, into my heart, by which I prayed fervently unto the Lord; there was a divine breathing in my ſoul, I had no life in my forms of prayer, except that one which Chriſt taught his diſciples, for which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a reverent eſteem, but when I was in a ſtate to pray, I found that the ſpirit made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017424_0012_0FA11A2A118B64E0"/>in me and for me, according to the preſent want and neceſſity of my ſoul, I remember the expreſſions that uſed to run through my mind were Oh Lord! preſerve me in thy fear and in thy truth. Oh Lord! ſhew me thy way, and make known thy mind and will unto me;—and I thought I was ready to obey it, and much deſired to know the people of God, for my ſoul cried, Oh Lord where doſt thou feed thy flock, why ſhould I be as one that is turned aſide from the flocks of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Oh the drawing cords of thy divine love. Oh thou didſt draw my ſoul with longings and breathings after the knowledge of the only true God, and of Jeſus Chriſt. There was then no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſins of ignorance which the Lord winked at, but he called me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and forſake my pride and vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which was a great croſs to the will of the fleſh, and I took it up for ſeveral months, and while I did ſo, my ſoul had great peace and divine comfort, ſo that many times the enjoyment of divine love was more to me than my natural food, or any outward thing. I remember when the family uſed to aſk me why I did not come to meat, I uſed to think I had meat to eat, they knew nothing of, and in thoſe times of retirement, I had manifeſtations of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017424_0013_0FA11A2BD725C030"/>that I ſhould go through, and a ſight of ſeveral things which I met with ſince, and in thoſe times I walked alone; I was convinced that the Quakers held the principles of truth, and that their miniſtry was the true miniſtry, but I dwelt then far from any of them, only thus it had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When I was about twelve years old, I was at a meeting or two of theirs, and the doctrine of one man that preached there, proved to me (as the wiſe man terms it) "like bread caſt upon the waters, for it was found after many days," the ſound of his voice ſeemed to be in my mind, when I was alone, and ſome of his words came freſh into my remembrance, and the voice and the words ſuited with the exerciſe of my mind, and at that time I met alſo with a little book of theirs, which as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it contained agreed with the doctrine of the apoſtles, I was confirmed in my judgment, that their profeſſion agreed with the truth, but did not join with them, for by that time fleſh and blood began to be very uneaſy, under the yoke of retirement, and to groan for liberty. I was about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, and the ſubtle enemy lay near, and did not want inſtruments; ſo I was perſuaded by reaſoning with fleſh and blood, that I was young and might take a little more pleaſure, and might
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017424_0014_0FA11A2C518C66B0"/>ſerve God when I was older; ſo I let go my exerciſe of watching and praying, left off retirement, and let my love out to viſible objects, pride and vanity grew up again, the divine, ſweet, meek, loving ſpirit withdrew, and I could not find it again when I pleaſed, altho' I did ſeek it ſometimes; for I could have been pleased with the ſweet comforts of his love, yet I did not like to bear the daily croſs, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that was the Quakers princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and believing they did enjoy the ſweetneſs of divine love in their meetings, I went ſometimes a great way to a meeting to ſeek for divine refreſhment there, but to no purpoſe, for I was like ſome dry ſtick that had no ſap nor virtue, unto which rain or ſun ſhine, ſummer or winter are all alike; thus it was with me for about three years. Oh the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that miſpent time! Oh the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that came on me for my diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is never to be forgotten by me: But when I was about nineteen years of age, it pleaſed the Almighty to ſend his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit again into my heart, and his light ſhined into my mind, all my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions were ſet in order before me, and I was made deeply ſenſible of my great loſs; and then, Oh! then the vials of the wrath
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017424_0015_0FA11A2FA3650900"/>of an angry father, were poured out on the tranſgreſſing nature, Oh! then I cried, woe is me, woe is me, I am undone, I have ſlain the babe of grace, I have crucified the Lord of life and glory to myſelf afreſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have not put him to open ſhame, for I had been preſerved in moral honeſty in all reſpects, to that degree, that I durſt not tell a lye, or ſpeak an evil word, and could be truſted in any place, and in any thing, for this would be in my mind many times, that if I was not faithful in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous mammon, I ſhould not be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the heavenly treaſure, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my righteouſneſs, he whoſe eye penetrates all hearts found me ſo guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I thought there was no mercy for me, Oh! that teſtimony of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, I found to be true (viz.) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſs exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, there is no admittance into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or favour of God. But after many days and nights of ſorrow and great anguiſh, having no ſoul to ſpeak to, it came into my mind to give myſelf up into the hands of God, and I ſaid, Oh Lord! if I periſh, it ſhall be at the gate of thy mercy, for if thou caſt me into hell, I cannot help myſelf, therefore I will give up my ſoul, my life, and all into thy holy hand, do thy pleaſure
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017424_0016_0FA11A30E13E8F20"/>by me, thy judgements are juſt, for I have ſlighted thy ſweet love, and have ſlain the babe of grace. And as I ſunk down into death, and owned and ſubmitted to the judgments of God, my heart was broken, which before was hard, and it pleaſed my merciful father to cauſe his divine ſweet love, to ſpring again in my hard, dry and barren ſoul, as a ſpring of living water, and the fire of the wrath of God was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily abated, and the compaſſionate bowels of a tender ſaviour my ſoul felt, I had living hope raiſed in my mind, yet greater afflictions came afterwards, ſo that I may ſay by experience, "ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way indeed, that leads to life;" and I have cauſe to believe, none but ſuch as are made willing to be ſtript of all that belongs to ſelf, or the old man, and do become as a little child, can rightly or truly enter in at the ſtrait gate. And I do find by experience, that no vulture's eye, no venemous beaſt, nor lofty lion's whelp, can look into or tread in this holy narrow way, altho' it is our king's high way: Oh! the longing that there is in my ſoul, that all might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it. But to proceed, I thought all was well, the worſt is now over, and I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain taken into the favour of God, and ſo I was led into an elevation of joy, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017424_0017_0FA11A313544FA68"/>in ſilence; but in a few days my ſoul was led into a wilderneſs, where there was no way, no guide, no light, that I could ſee, but darkneſs ſuch as might be felt indeed, for the horrors of it were ſuch, that when it was night I wiſhed for morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when it was morning I wiſhed for evening, the Lord was near but I knew it not, he had brought my ſoul into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and there he pleaded with me by his fiery law, and righteous judgments; the day of the Lord came upon me, which burnt as an oven in my boſom, till all pride and vanity were burnt up, my former delights were gone, my old heavens were paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way within me, as with fire, and I had as much exerciſe in my mind of anguiſh and ſorrow as I could bear, day and night, for ſeveral months, and not a drop of divine comfort, I could compare my heart to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs it were a coal of fire, or an hot iron, no brokenneſs of heart or tenderneſs of ſpirit, although I cried to God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the deep diſtreſs of my ſoul, yet not one tear could iſſue from my eyes, Oh! the days of ſorrow and nights of anguiſh, that I went through, no tongue can utter or heart conceive, which hath not gone through the like; I could have wiſhed I had been ſome other creature, that I might not have known ſuch anguiſh and ſorrow, for I
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017424_0018_0FA11B66F5C1AC48"/>thought all other creatures were in their proper places, but my troubles were aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the ſtrong oppreſſion and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satan, who was very unwilling to loſe his ſubject, ſo he raiſed all his forces, and made uſe of all his armour, which he had in the houſe, and I found him to be like a ſtrong man armed indeed, for he would not ſuffer me to enter into reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but would have me look into myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that appertain to ſalvation, with an eye of carnal reaſon, and becauſe I could not ſo comprehend, he cauſed me to queſtion the truth of all things that are left upon record in the holy ſcriptures, and would have perſuaded me into the Jews opinion concerning Chriſt, and many other baits and reſting places he laid before me, but my ſoul hungred after the true bread, the bread of life, which came from God out of heaven, which Chriſt teſtified of (ſee John 6th, beginning at 27th verſe to the end) which I had felt near, and my ſoul had taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, although the devil prompted me with his temptations, my ſoul could not feed on them, but cried continually, thy preſence Oh Lord! or elſe I die. Oh! let me feel thy ſaving arm or elſe I periſh. Oh Lord! Give me faith. Thus was my ſoul exerciſed in earneſt ſupplications unto God night and day, and yet I went about my
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017424_0019_0FA11B67F21F5C20"/>outward occaſions, and made my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to none but God only, and I have often ſince conſidered that any ſoul that can be content to feed on any thing below the enjoyment of God, the ſubtle ſerpent finds ſuitable baits for them; ſo having known the terrors of God and the ſubtle wiles of ſatan, I am concerned ſometimes to perſuade people to repent, and to warn them to flee from the wrath to come. Now all my faith which I had before, whilſt in diſobedience, proved like building on a ſandy foundation &amp;c. All the comfort I uſed to have in reading the ſcriptures, was taken away, and I durſt not read for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, becauſe it added to my condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo I was left to depend upon God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who cauſed me to feel a little hope at times, like a little glimmering of light underneath my troubles, which was ſome ſtay to my mind, and if it had not been ſo, I had fallen into deſpair, but I much deſired to be brought through my troubles the right way, and not to ſhake off or get over them in my own time; I had not freedom to make known my condition to any perſon, for I uſed to think if the Lord did not help me, in vain was the help of man, and I have ſince ſeen it was well I did not upon ſeveral accounts, for I might have come to a loſs if I had done ſo; as it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017424_0020_0FA11B6B22F883C0"/>was the will of the Lord to humble me, and to turn up and throw down, all that which might be imputed to man or ſelf, that I might know the work or building of the Lord to be raiſed from the foundation of his own power, where there is none of man's building, that all the glory might be given to him alone, for we are very apt to ſay in effect, I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas and I of Chriſt, as if Chriſt was divided; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, nor his praiſe to graven images; for as thou my friend well obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the chief that we ought to labour for is to make people ſenſible of their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to direct them to the word nigh, and to be good examples to them; ſo in the Lord's due and appointed time, when he had ſeen my ſuffering of that fiery kind to be ſufficient, he was pleaſed to cauſe his divine love to flow in my boſom, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, and the holy ſpirit of divine light and life, did overcome my ſoul; then a divine ſenſe and underſtanding was given me to know the power, and alſo the love of God in ſending his only ſon, out of his boſom into the world, to take upon him, a body of fleſh, wherein he did go through the whole progreſs of ſuffering, for the ſalvation of mankind, and ſo did break through, and break open the gates of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017424_0021_0FA11B6C68E690D8"/>death, and repaired the breach that old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had made between God and man, and reſtored the path for ſouls to come to God.</p>
            <p>And the Almighty was pleaſed at that time to make my ſimple ſoul ſenſible, that he did ſend the ſpirit of his ſon again into my heart, in order to lead me through the progreſs of his ſuffering, that as he died for ſin, ſo I might die to ſin, by bearing the daily croſs, and living in ſelf denial, humility and obedience to God my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father, in all things he ſhould require of me, and then the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, compared to water, as well as fire, my ſoul came to witneſs, and the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment and condemnation, I ſaw had a glory in it, which made way for the miniſtration of life, and the ax of God's word was laid to the evil root of the tree &amp;c. and the voice of him that preached re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance my ſoul heard, that called for the mountains to be laid low, and the valleys to be raiſed, viz. the mountains of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temper, that a plain way might be made for the ranſomed ſoul to walk in, and the Lord ſhewed me, how John the baptiſt came to be counted the greateſt prophet that was born of a woman, viz. becauſe he was the forerunner of Jeſus Chriſt, and is rightly termed the mourner, and how the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017424_0022_0FA11B6E36BB98C0"/>leaſt in the kingdom of heaven was greater than he that is under his miniſtration only, which was to decreaſe, but the miniſtration of Jeſus was to encreaſe, whoſe baptiſm is with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire, and he will thoroughly purge his floor ; then I came to witneſs that it is indeed the work of God to believe rightly and truly on him whom God hath ſent, that this purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaving faith is the gift of God, and the very ſpring or vital principle of it, (divine love) then I mourned over him whom I had pierced with my unbelief and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and I did eat my bread with weeping and mingled my drink with tears, I was between 19 and 20 years of age, when theſe great conflicts were on my mind, by which I was brought very humble, and I had entered into ſolemn covenants with God Almighty, that I would anſwer his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings, if it were to the laying down my natural life; but when it was ſhewed me that I ought to take up the croſs in a little thing, I had like to have hearkened to the reaſoner again, and been diſobedient in the day of ſmall things; for altho' I had gone through ſo much inward exerciſe, yet I was afraid of diſpleaſing my ſuperiors, being then a ſervant to great perſons. It was ſhewed me, that I ſhould not give flattering titles to man, and I was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017424_0023_0FA11B6E88EB3FB8"/>inwardly that if I would not be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Lord's requirings, he would take away his good ſpirit from me again, ſo I was in a ſtrait, I was afraid of diſpleaſing God, and afraid of diſpleaſing man, till at laſt I was charged by the ſpirit, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of man more than God, for in my addreſs to God, I did uſe the plain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but when I ſpoke to man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I muſt ſpeak otherwiſe, or elſe they would be offended, and ſome would argue that God Almighty being that only one, that therefore the ſingle language was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him alone, and man being made up of compound matter, the plural language was more proper to him, &amp;c. Oh the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle twiſtings of proud Lucifer that I have ſeen, would be too large to inſert, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God Almighty is that only one, yet he is that being of all beings, for in him we live, move and have our being; but let the cover be what it would, I had ſcripture on my ſide, which they called their rule, and I knew proud man diſdained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that language from an inferior, which he gave to the Almighty: So it became a great croſs to me, but it was certainly a letting thing in the way of the progreſs of my ſoul, until I gave up to the Lord's requirings in this ſmall thing; theſe things I ſignify to thee, dear friend, in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017424_0024_0FA11B6F34278448"/>great ſimplicity, that thou mayſt ſee, how the Lord leads out of the vain cuſtoms that are in the world, not only in what I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but alſo in many other things, and hath led in that humble ſelf-denying way, which Chriſt both taught and practiſed, when he was viſible among men. Chriſt is the true chriſtians pattern, and his ſpirit their leader, and now I ſhew thee this in truth and ſincerity, becauſe I would not be miſunderſtood by thee, viz. I am a ſingle ſoul, wholly devoted to the Lord, and ſo do not plead for a form, for forms ſake, neither do I plead for a people as a people, for we are grown to be a mixed multitude, much like the children of Iſrael when they were in the wilderneſs, but this I may ſay to the praiſe and glory of God, that the principle that we make profeſſion of, is the very truth (viz.) Chriſt in the male and in the female, the hope of glory, and Chriſt thou knoweſt is the way, the truth and the life, and none comes to God but by him, ſo there is a remnant which like Joſhua and Caleb of old are true to the Lord, who is their ſpiritual leader, and follow him faithfully, and they ſtand clear in their teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies againſt all dead formalities, which are but as images, when the vital principle (viz.) the divine love is withdrawn, and yet as the ſpirit of Jeſus leads out of all
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017424_0025_0FA11B6FF39732F8"/>vain cuſtoms and traditions, which are in the world, and leads us in the plain, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meek, ſelf-denying life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Chriſt walked in while he was viſible among men; I could heartily wiſh all to follow the leadings of his ſpirit herein, that thereby they may confeſs Chriſt before men; but if it pleaſe the almighty to accept of ſouls, without leading them through ſuch fiery trials, as he brought me through, or without requiring ſuch things of them as he required of me, far be it from me to judge, that ſuch have not known the Lord, or the indwellings of his love, if the fruits of the ſpirit of Jeſus be plain upon them; for every tree is known by its fruits, and to our own maſter we muſt ſtand or fall. But dear friend, as thou well obſerved, that purification is a gradual work, I may ſay ſo by experience, for when the old ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary could no longer draw me out into vain talking, and fooliſh jeſting, then he perplexed me with vain thoughts, ſome of which were according to my natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ſome of them quite contrary, and Oh! I cried mightily unto the Lord for power over vain thoughts, for they were a great trouble to me, and I ſtood in great fear leſt one day or other, I ſhould fall by the hand of the enemy, but the Lord ſpake comfortably to my ſoul, in his
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017424_0026_0FA11B70BA1A9E58"/>own words left upon record, "fear not little flock it is your father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom," and the Lord gave me an evidence along with it, that my ſoul was one of that little flock; another time when I was very low in my mind, theſe words ſprang with life and virtue, (viz.) "although thou haſt lain amongſt the pots, yet I will give thee the wings of a dove, covered with ſilver, and her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of yellow gold." Oh! it was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully comfortable to me, when the Holy Ghoſt did bring a promiſe to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> gave me an evidence that it was my portion, ſo I pondered on this, concerning the wings of a dove, and I thought it muſt needs be the wing of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, whereby my ſoul might aſcend unto God by prayer, meditation and divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and ſo I took delight to pray in ſecret and faſt in ſecret, from the ſecret outgoings of my mind as well as I could, and my heavenly father which ſeeth and heareth in ſecret, himſelf did reward me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, for then, when I went to meetings, I did not ſet in darkneſs, dryneſs and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, as I uſed to do in the times of my diſobedience, but I did reap the benefit of the end of the coming of Chriſt, who ſaid "the thief cometh not but to kill, to ſteal and to deſtroy, but I am come that ye
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017424_0027_0FA11B71734C1868"/>might have life, and that you might have it more abundantly." So, the thief had in the time of my diſobedience ſtole my ſoul from Jeſus, who ſaith, "whoſo loveth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or mother &amp;c. or his own life more than me is not worthy of me," and ſo it had been with me, and I miſſed the benefit of reaping the end of his coming, for ſeveral years, but he in mercy being returned, afforded my bowed down ſoul the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his divine preſence, and was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cauſe his love, which is the true life of the ſoul, to abound in my boſom in meetings, that my cup did overflow, and I was conſtrained, under a ſenſe of duty, to kneel down in the congregation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to the goodneſs of God, and pray to him for the continuation of it, and to pray for power whereby I might be enabled to walk, worthy of ſo great a favour, benefit and mercy, that I had received at his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful hand; and I remember after I had made publick confeſſion to the goodneſs of God, my ſoul was as if it had been in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, it was enlightned and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the divine love, that I was in love with the whole creation of God, and I ſaw every thing to be good in its place, and I was ſhewed things ought to be kept in their proper places, the ſwine ought not to come into the garden, nor the clean beaſts
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017424_0028_0FA11B7283173E98"/>ought not to be taken into the bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and as it was in the outward, ſo it ought to be in the inward and new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo every thing began to preach to me, the very fragrant herbs, and beautiful innocent flowers had a ſpeaking voice in them to my ſoul, and things ſeemed to have another reliſh with them than before: The judgments of God were ſweet to my ſoul, and I was made to call to others ſometimes, to come and taſte and ſee, how good the Lord is, and to exhort them to prove the Lord, by an obedient, humble, innocent walking before him, and then they would ſee, that he would pour out of his ſpiritual bleſſings in ſo plentiful a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there would not be room enough to contain them, but the overflowings would return to him, who is the fountain, with thankſgivings &amp;c. And I was made to warn people, that they ſhould not provoke the Lord by diſobedience, for although he bears and ſuffers long, as he did with the rebellious Iſraelites in the wilderneſs, yet ſuch ſhall know him to be a God of juſtice and judgment, and ſhall be made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs one day.</p>
            <p>And, thus dear friend, I have given thee a plain but a true account of my qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and call to the ſervice of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but it was ſeveral years, before I came
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017424_0029_0FA11B730051C1B0"/>to a freed ſtate or even temper of mind, for ſometimes clouds would ariſe and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between my ſoul and the riſing ſun, and I was brought down into the furnace often, and found by experience that every time my ſoul was brought down as into the furnace of affliction, that it did ſtill come up more clean and bright, and altho' the cloud did interpoſe between me and the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun, yet when the ſun of righteouſneſs did appear again, he brought healing as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wings, and was nearer than before. Thus dear friend, I expreſs things in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as they were repreſented to me, in the manifeſtation of them in the morning of my days. So I came to love to dwell with judgment, and uſed often to pray, ſaying Oh Lord! Search me and try me, for thou knoweſt my heart better than I know it, and I pray thee let no deceitfulneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs lodge therein, but let thy judgments paſs upon every thing that is contrary to thy pure divine nature: thus my ſoul uſed to breathe to the Lord conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and hunger and thirſt after a more full enjoyment of his preſence, although he is a conſuming fire to the corrupt nature of the old man, yet my ſoul loved to dwell with him, or elſe I found many ſorts of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions would be endeavouring to ſpring up again, and ſo I reſigned up my mind
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017424_0030_0FA11B764E4D6468"/>to the Lord, with deſires that he would feed me with food convenient for me; and this I can ſay by experience, that the ſoul that is born of God, doth breathe to him, as conſtantly by prayer as the ſucking child, when it is born into the world, doth draw in and breathe out the common air; ſo the child of God doth draw in and breathe forth the breath of life, by which man was made a living ſoul to God, and this breathing that is pure and divine, all that are in the old man or fallen corrupt nature know nothing of, it is a myſtery to them; but a babe in Chriſt knows it to be true, and although the children in our father's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily are of ſeveral ages, growths or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both in ſtrength and underſtanding, yet this I have obſerved in all my travels, that thoſe that live to God, continue in a ſtate of breathing to him while here, and hunger and thirſt after a more full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his divine preſence, that as every day brings us nearer to the grave, ſo every day the ſoul may be brought into a more divine union and communion with God; which is a certain ſign to me, of the divine life and health of a ſoul, if I find it ſweetly breathing unto the Lord, and hungring and thirſting after his righteouſneſs; and it is very evidently ſeen, and eaſily known by the converſation of perſons, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

            <p>Dear friend, as thou well obſerved, it is a great help to the ſoul to know its own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and from whence it is fallen, that it may know whither to return. Theſe things are very true, and the knowledge of them hath been a great comfort to me, and ſo have the experiences of the ſervants of the Lord, agreeable to the teſtimonies left on record, which are as waymarks to the ſpiritual traveller; and we have a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in and by them, but above all Chriſt our holy pattern and heavenly leader, my ſoul prizeth the knowledge of his footſteps, the leading of his ſpirit, the ſpirit of truth, the comforter, which the father hath ſent to lead us into all truth, who hath ſaid, "by this I know that I am true, becauſe I ſeek not mine own honour, but the honour of him that ſent me." And Oh! ſaith my ſoul, that we may follow the leadings of our
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017424_0032_0FA11B7A1BA7BE10"/>unerring guide in all things that he may lead us into, and I have good cauſe to believe, he will bring through all tribulations to the honour of God and our comfort; for the Lord hath brought my ſoul through many tryals, one after another as he ſaw meet, ſome more of which I may give an hint of (viz.) After my inward tribulation was abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then outward tryals began, for there were ſome of no ſmall account, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured with all their might and cunning, to hinder the work from proſpering in me, and as Saul hunted David, and ſought to take away his natural life, ſo theſe hunted my ſoul to take away its life, which it had in God, but all wrought together for my good. I have often ſeen, and therefore may ſay, the Lord knoweth what is beſt for his children, better than we know for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo my enemies inſtead of driving my ſoul away from God, drove it more near to him, for this tryal cauſed me to prove the ſpirit which had the exerciſe of my mind, and I found it to be the ſpirit of truth, which the worldly and ſelf-minded cannot receive, for I found the nature of it to be harmleſs and holy, and to lead me to love mine enemies, to pity them and pray for them, and this love was my preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as I gave up in obedience to the operation and requiring of this meek ſpirit,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017424_0033_0FA11B7A88B704A0"/>it miniſtred ſuch peace to my ſoul, that the world cannot give. But there was a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in me, to pleaſe all, which I found to be very hard for me to be weaned from, ſo as to ſtand ſingle to God, for when I did fear man, I had nothing but anguiſh and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and I uſed often to walk alone and pour out my complaint to the Lord. But after a long time when the Lord had tryed my fidelity to him as he ſaw meet, one day as I was ſitting in a meeting in ſilence, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, to know my ſtrength renewed in him and by him. This portion of ſcripture was given to me (viz.) "Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ye my people, ſaith your God, ſpeak comfortably to Jeruſalem and cry unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed, that her iniquities are pardoned, that ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord's hand double for all her ſins." This brought great comfort to my ſoul, and I treaſured it in my heart, and I made this obſervation, that from that time the Lord gave my ſoul (as the apoſtle Peter expreſſes it) a more abundant entrance into the heavenly kingdom or New Jeruſalem, whoſe walls are ſalvation and her gates praiſe, and my mind was brought into more ſtillneſs, and troubleſome thoughts were in a good degree expelled, and my outward enemies grew weary of their work and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their hope. The praiſe I freely, in
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017424_0034_0FA11B7B4624A1C0"/>great humility, offer up and aſcribe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for it was his own work to preſerve me from many ſtrong temptations. So after I had peace at home every way, I was drawn by the ſpirit of love, to travel into the North of England, and on my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney my ſoul had many combats with the evil ſpirit; when I was aſleep he tormented me as long as he could. I have indeed had a long war with the devil many ways, and abundance of courage was given to me to make war with him, and I always gained the victory, when cowardly fearful nature was aſleep, which was comfortable to my mind, and I did hope that the Lord would give me perfect victory over the devil when I was awake, as he had let me ſee it to be ſo when I was aſleep, and the ſpirit which led me forth, was to me like a needle of a compaſs, touched with a loadſtone, for ſo it pointed where I ought to go, and when I came to the far end of the journey. In thoſe days I had certain manifeſtations of many things in dreams, which did come to paſs according to their ſignifications, and I was many times forewarned of enemies, and ſo was better able to guard againſt them; I travelled in great fear and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Lord was with me to his glory and my comfort, and brought me home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in peace. And in the year 1697, in the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017424_0035_0FA11B7BF6725AC0"/>ſixth month, as I was ſitting in a meeting in Glouceſter, which was then the place of my abode, my mind was gathered into perfect ſtillneſs for ſome time, and my ſpirit was as if it had been carried away into America, and after it returned, my heart was as if it had been diſſolved with the love of God, and it flowed over the great Ocean, and I was conſtrained to kneel down and pray for the ſeed of God in America, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern never went out of my mind day nor night, until I went to travel there in the love of God, which is ſo univerſal that it reaches over ſea and land; but when I looked at my concern with an eye of human reaſon, it ſeemed to be very ſtrange and hard to me, for I knew not the country, nor any that dwelt therein; and I reaſoned much concerning my own unfitneſs, but when I let in ſuch reaſonings, I had nothing but death and darkneſs, and trouble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my mind, but when I reſigned up my all to the Lord, and gave up in my mind to go, then the divine love did ſpring up in my heart, and my ſoul was at liberty to worſhip the Lord as in the land of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; thus I tryed and proved the concern ſeveral times in my own heart, till at laſt theſe words ran through my mind with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (viz.) The fearful and unbelieving ſhall have their portion with the hypocrite
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017424_0036_0FA11B7CB95C24A0"/>in the lake that burns with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; which is the ſecond death; this brought a dread, and I told my huſband that I had a concern on my mind to go to America, and aſked him if he could give me up. He ſaid he hoped it would not be required of me; but I told him it was, and that I ſhould not go without his free conſent, which ſeemed a little hard to him at firſt, but a little while after I was taken with a violent fever, which brought me ſo weak, that all that ſaw me thought I ſhould not recover. But I thought my days work was not done, and my chief concern in my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was about going to America. But ſome were troubled that I had made it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, becauſe they thought I ſhould die, and people would ſpeak reproachfully of me, and ſaid, if I did recover, the ſhip would be ready to ſail before I ſhould be fit to go, &amp;c. But I thought if they would but carry me and lay me down in the ſhip, I ſhould be well, for the Lord was very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to my ſoul in the time of my ſickneſs, and gave me a promiſe that his preſence ſhould go with me ; and then my huſband was made very willing to give me up, he ſaid if it were for ſeven years, rather than to have me taken from him forever. So at laſt all thoſe difficulties paſſed over, and I failed from Briſtol in the 9th month, 1697, with
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017424_0037_0FA11B7D754EAEC8"/>my companion Mary Rogers. The dangers we were in at ſea, and the faith and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Lord gave to my ſoul would be too large here to relate, for I had ſuch an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my being in my proper place, that the fear of death was taken away; Oh! it is good to truſt in the Lord and be obedient to him, for his mercies endure forever; ſo about the middle of the 12th month, 1697, through the good providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, we arrived in Virginia, and as I travelled along the country from one meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another, I obſerved great numbers of black people, that were in ſlavery, and they were a ſtrange people to me, and I wanted to know whether the viſitation of God was to their ſouls or not, and I obſerved their converſation, to ſee if I could diſcern any good in them, ſo after I had travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four weeks, as I was in bed one morning in an houſe in Maryland, after the ſun was up and ſhone into the chamber, I fell into a ſlumber, and dreamed I was a ſervant in a great man's houſe, and that I was drawing water at a well to waſh the uppermoſt rooms of the houſe, and when I was at the well, a voice came to me, which bid me go and call other ſervants to help me and I went preſently; but as I was going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in a very pleaſant green meadow, a great light ſhined about me, which exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017424_0038_0FA11B7E655845B0"/>the light of the ſun, and I walked in the midſt, and as I went on in the way, I ſaw a chariot drawn with horſes coming to meet me, and I was in care left the light that ſhone about me, ſhould frighten the horſes, and cauſe them to throw down the people which I ſaw in the chariot; when I came to them, I looked on them, and I knew they were the ſervants, I was ſent to call, and I ſaw they were both white and black people, and I ſaid unto them, why have you ſtaid ſo long? And they ſaid the Buckets were frozen, we could come no ſooner, ſo I was ſatisfied the call of the Lord was unto the black people as well as the white,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ethiopia ſhall ſoon ſtretch out her hands unto God. Pſ. lxviii, 31.</note> and, I ſaw the fulfilling of it in part, before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of America, with many more remarkable things, which would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious here to mention.—But, Oh! great is the condeſcenſion and goodneſs of God to poor mankind, it is a good obſervation on the tender dealings of our heavenly father, "that we may ſet up our Ebenezer and ſay Hitherto hath the Lord helped us," and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I may ſay to his praiſe, it hath been through many ſtreights and difficulties, more than I can number, and they have all wrought together for the good of my ſoul, and I have cauſe to believe, that every ſon
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017424_0039_0FA11B7EF2AF43F8"/>or daughter he receives, he chaſtens, tries, and proves, and theſe that do not bear the chaſtiſements of God, do prove baſtards and not ſons, but I may ſay as one did of old, "It is good for me that I have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted &amp;c." and it is good to follow the leadings of the ſpirit of God, as faithful Abraham did, who was called the friend of God, who did not withhold his only ſon, when the Lord called for him, and it is my belief the Lord will try his choſen ones as gold is tried, and will yet refine them as gold is refined, and what if he brings us yet down again into the furnace, which way it ſhall pleaſe him, until we are ſeven times refined. We ſhall be the better able to bear the impreſſion of his image upon us in all our converſations, and if the day ſhould come, wherein none ſhall buy nor ſell, that have not the mark of the beaſt, either in their right hand or in their forehead, it is but what hath been told us beforehand, and theſe that will know an overcoming, it muſt be by the blood of the lamb, (viz.) by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the meek, love, and ſuffering ſeed, and by the word of their teſtimony, and that love not their lives unto death, we may obſerve that thoſe that had not the mark of the beaſt in their forehead, if they had in their right hand it would do, they could ſhew it if there was occaſion, to keep off a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017424_0040_0FA11B821C5D7980"/>ſtroke (this I take near home.) Oh the myſtery of iniquity how ſecretly it works, we may well ſay, the teſtimony that Jeſus bore to the young man, that deſired to follow him, is very true, "Foxes have holes and fowls of the air have neſts, but the ſon of man hath not where to lay his head," Oh! Innocent truth, Oh! plain, meek, humble Jeſus, where doth he repoſe, where doth he reign without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation.</p>
            <p>Dear Friend, excuſe my freedom with thee, for the love of God conſtraineth me, and I do believe that the Lord will ſhew thee yet further, what teſtimony thou muſt bear for his name, and what thou muſt ſuffer for his ſake, (if faithful) for trying times will come, and offences will be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (and taken) but there is nothing will offend thoſe that love the Lord Jeſus above all, for altho' many murmured and were offended at Jeſus when he told them the truth, and that which was of abſolute neceſſity for all to know and witneſs in themſelves, as we read in the 6th of John, beginning at the 32d verſe in his anſwer to the Jews, but by that time he had done, many of his diſciples went from him, then ſaid he to the twelve, "Will ye alſo go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way." But Peter ſaid, "whether ſhall we go, thou haſt the words of eternal life,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017424_0041_0FA11B83D443D208"/>and we believe and are ſure, thou art Chriſt the ſon of the living God." So God hath given to the faithful to believe, yea, and we are ſure that the ſpirit of truth is come, that leads the followers of it into all truth, and that Chriſt who is one with his ſpirit, who was once offered, to bear the ſins of many, has appeared again the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation. Oh! ſurely the goodneſs of God hath been very great to the children of men from age to age, and from one generation to another, ever ſince the fall of our firſt parents, the more my mind penetrates into it, the more I am like to be ſwallowed up in admiration of his condeſcenſion and goodneſs through all his diſpenſations, but above all in tne manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Jeſus Chriſt our holy pattern and heavenly leader, Oh! my ſoul praiſe him for whom the knowledge of his holy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, God gave for a light to us gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles? and to be his ſalvation to the ends of the earth, and hath given his ſpirit to dwell in us, and accepted our ſouls to dwell in him. Oh admirable goodneſs! ſhall we leave him? He is the word of eternal life, and whither ſhall we go? and ſo far as any are followers of Jeſus, ſo far I deſire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, or to be one with them, and no further, let theſe do what they will, if any will go back into the ſea, out of which the
