            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A DISCOURSE upon Natural Religion in an univerſity profeſſedly under chriſtian inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by a miniſter of Chriſt, appears to ſome, if not criminal, yet highly improper. They have an idea that Natural and Revealed Religion are oppoſed to each other, and mutually deſtructive. It is a miſtaken idea: They are to be conceived rather as different rays of light from the Great Source of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which conjoin to promote the ſame moſt valuable deſign—the information, virtue, and happineſs of mankind. The honorable Founder of this Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had this conception when he eſtabliſhed it. The Truſtees, who carry into effect his will, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, who introduce the lecturer to their chapel on this occaſion, mean not thereby to weaken religion, but yield her ſupport.</p>

WE have in the Chriſtian Apoſtles Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas a noble inſtance of zeal in maintaining a belief in the being and government of God, the moſt eſſential principle of Natural Religion. They were now in Lyſtra in Lycaonia, indifferent to their eaſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſafety, could they but be the inſtruments of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the ignorant in the nature and obligations of religion and virtue, more fully taught and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Jeſus Chriſt, the moſt eminent preacher of righteouſneſs who had ever viſited mankind. Endued with divine power, that they might the more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully effectuate the important ends of their miſſion, they exerted it "on one impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb." They ſaid to him with a loud voice, "ſtand upright on thy feet: And he leaped and walked." The inhabitants ſeeing what Paul had done, were affected with lively admiration; and conceiving the fancied beings above, whom they adored, only capable of ſuch aſtoniſhing acts, "they ſaid one to another, the gods are come down to us in the likeneſs of men." This idea made ſo deep an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on their minds, "that they called Barnabas Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, becauſe he was the chief ſpeaker. Then the prieſt of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done ſacrifice with the people." Vain and ambitious men would have been moſt highly gratified with the honor of being eſteemed the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, or the interpreter of his will. Yielding to the flattery, they would cheerfully have been crowned with garlands, and permitted hecatombs of beaſts to have been ſlain in ſacrifice to their glory. But theſe primitive preachers of chriſtianity were uneaſy and ſad
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028238_0005_0FD744C3E108D150"/>with the propoſal of honors which became only the great Creator and ſupreme Governor of the Univerſe. Moved with pity and indignation, when they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their deſign, "they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, ſirs, why do ye theſe things? We alſo are men of like paſſions with you, and preach unto you, that ye ſhould turn from theſe vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the ſea, and all things that are therein: Who in times paſt ſuffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheleſs he left not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs."</p>
            <p>To repreſent what Reaſon, when uncultivated or highly improved, ſays upon the important ſubjects of religion and morals; and if poſſible, brighten and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our faith in its inſtructions, is the duty to which I am appointed on this occaſion. In purſuit of this deſign, I aſk your patience and candor. I fervently entreat, above all things, the guidance and benediction of the Father of Lights!</p>
            <p>UPON the juſt idea of Natural Religion, and the conſequences which flow from its maxims, I ſhall make ſeveral remarks, which I hope will be pertinent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive. I would obſerve however before I begin, that there is no probability I ſhall advance a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception upon theſe topics. The moſt I can do is to collect within the compaſs of a ſingle diſcourſe, ſome of thoſe ſentiments relative to them, which have the moſt powerfully affected my own mind, arranged in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner, and expreſſed in different language. Theſe truths have been collecting ever ſince men began
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028238_0006_0FD744C567430680"/>to think; they have enlarged as they have continued to think; they would fill volumes were they all prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly detailed. Moreover, they form a common fund, from which any one may take the truths he underſtands, and can intelligibly explain, aſſured he makes no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe of the opinions of his predeceſſors and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, than they have made of theirs. Indeed it may be truly ſaid, there is ſcarcely a queſtion in Natural Religion, which doth not frequently ariſe in the minds of well educated, and thinking perſons, to which they do not return ſome of thoſe different anſwers which are diffuſed through innumerable books.</p>
            <p>WHAT IS NATURAL RELIGION? To this inquiry, anſwers will be made, differing with the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of thoſe who make them. The improved part of mankind, during modern periods moſt famed for lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary excellence, hath been divided into two grand ſects, the friends and the oppoſers of Revelation. According to this diſtinction, they have given oppoſite explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Natural Religion. The friend of Revelation aſſerts that a complete code of this Religion contains all the truths relative to GOD, his nature, perfections, and government—to man, his nature, duty, and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which may be illuſtrated and confirmed by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional inquiry and argumentation. Nor does he think himſelf chargeable with impropriety in calling this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of truths Natural Religion, though many of its important principles have been made known to him by Revelation; principles, which have enabled him to think to an extent, and write with a ſtrength of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon theſe intereſting ſubjects, which, if he had been left to his own unaſſiſted reaſon, would have been impoſſible. In his opinion, the doctrines of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028238_0007_0FD744C88F1632A8"/>when explained and rendered more credible by the efforts of the human mind, become parts of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion.</p>
            <p>IMPRESSED with theſe ideas, many who deſerve the ſtyle of the friends of Revelation, have applied their time, and all the energy of great abilities, to confirm by rational argumentation the principles of piety, virtue, and moral obligation; as well as the propriety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a future ſtate of exiſtence and retribution. The Lecture founded in England by Sir Robert Boyle, the ornament of his age, of religion, philoſophy, and literature, brought forth a large liſt of eminent writers, who in their immortal performances explained and defended the truths of Natural and Revealed Religion.</p>
            <p>THE preſent Lecture was eſtabliſhed, no doubt, by Judge Dudley, our reſpectable countryman, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one which has been mentioned. A proof, amongſt a multitude of others agreeable to our feelings, that Americans have beeen ready to follow, in laudable and beneficial inſtitutions, the elder and more wealthy inhabitants of Europe!</p>
            <p>THE moſt celebrated Miniſters of Chriſtianity have, in their more private diſcourſes, exerted their ingenuity and learning to promote the ends of theſe public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. Several in civil life, and in the other learned profeſſions, have employed fine powers of mind in the promotion of the ſame good cauſe. To this meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice they have been animated, not only by their unfeigned regard to ſacred truth, but by the prejudice of unbelievers againſt Clergymen, as the hired ſupporters of religion. However ill-founded and ungenerous the imputation, yet it has ever deſerved the attention of the friends of religious truth univerſally. Thoſe of them,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028238_0008_0FD744D2D7822488"/>who paying it the reſpect they ought, have laid aſide their more peculiar offices, and employed ſome of their time, and the vigor of their abilities, in a deſign ſo truly valuable, deſerve the ſincere thanks of the wiſe and good.</p>
            <p>AMONGST thoſe of this claſs, who have appeared within a few years paſt, Monſieur Necker, the great Financier of France, is highly to be eſteemed and admired. He ſaw, with deep regret, that the principles of an impious philoſophy, rendered perſuaſive with the graces of good compoſition, and all the ingenuity of which the cauſe was capable, threatened ſerious evils to that beautiful and powerful empire. Its latent venom had already weakened in many perſons the firmneſs of their religious faith, and its powerful motives to uſeful and excellent conduct in every relation of life. Yea, it threatened that general diſſoluteneſs in principles and manners, which, unleſs counteracted, threatens the body politic with terrible convulſions and gradual deſtruction. Removed from the buſineſs and pleaſures of court by one of thoſe revolutions not unuſual in that ſituation, and amidſt the tranquillity and gloom of retirement, he does not meanly reſign himſelf to the ſad feelings of mortification, but nobly reſolved to apply a remedy to the growing infidelity of the nation in which he had been ſo much diſtinguiſhed. He gave to the world his thoughts "ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS OPINIONS;" a work of the firſt celebrity on the moſt intereſting queſtions; which, with all the ſtrength of powerful reaſoning, has thoſe charms of language and fancy which affect the heart, and render it peculiarly adapted to perſuade, as well as inſtruct. The young and gay, together with thoſe who move in the higher
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028238_0009_0FD744D534081568"/>circumſtances of life, cannot be under better human guidance, than when, with teachable diſpoſitions, they are attentive to his inſtructions.</p>
            <p>THE oppoſers of Revelation, though they do not agree amongſt themſelves in their explanation of Natural Religion, yet agree in rejecting the repreſentation of it which has now been made. Some of their moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable writers aſſert Natural Religion to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which mankind receive equally from the God who made them; that their Creator and ſovereign Lord has enlightened their underſtandings univerſally with a complete ſyſtem of religion and moral obligation, and therefore that they need no further divine or human inſtruction on the ſubject. If this account were juſt, we might reaſonably expect in the department of religion, that we ſhould be neither dependent on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction nor ſtudy for information in any of its branches. We might, without heſitation, conclude we ſhould, as we met together, without any diſtinction of character, converſe with as much readineſs and preciſion upon its doctrines, precepts, and motives, as well-taught natural philoſophers do upon the laws which govern this diviſion of creation. In our ſtudies, we may form in our conception a conſiſtent plan of this nature, and ſupport it with arguments, which we eſteem honorable to God, and flattering to man. Is not God, ſay we, <hi>impartially</hi> juſt and good? Will not his creatures then of the ſame rank <hi>equally</hi> participate of his bounties? How can He, with any propriety of character, make diſtinctions between them, pleaſing on the one ſide, and painful on the other? Is not the knowledge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a <hi>common</hi> concern of mankind; equally as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the improvement, honor, and happineſs of all
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028238_0010_0FD744D8E1F8F5E0"/>our race, as of any particular nations or perſons? Muſt it not then, under his equal and beneficent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be communicated <hi>alike</hi> to all? But when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the world, and compare the real ſtate of man with what this ſcheme of thought would lead us to conclude it muſt be, we ſhall be convinced it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial. For the more we obſerve, the more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable it will appear to us, that our improvement in this, as in other kinds of knowledge, depends upon nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural abilities, ſituation, and the means we enjoy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; with reſpect to which circumſtances, the children of men greatly differ from each other. Do we ever find that thoſe who have been denied the bleſſings of education, of inſtructive books and converſation, or have had no leiſure from the neceſſary buſineſs of life for application and ſtudy, can conceive ſo extenſively upon the ſubjects of religion, and converſe ſo correctly upon them, as thoſe who have been favored with theſe advantages? No; there is, and ever will be, a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference between them. Is it not ridiculous to ſay, the prieſt of Jupiter had as enlarged ſentiments and well-informed notions of God, and the ſervices due to him, who would have paid divine honors to deified men, as the chriſtian apoſtles, who taught that they ſhould turn from idolatrous worſhip unto the living God, who made heaven, and earth, the ſea, and all things that are therein? That Cicero, who applied his admirable powers of mind to gain the moſt extenſive and correct knowledge of religion and laws he was able, had no fuller and better ideas of them than the moſt uninſtructed Roman? That Dr. Clarke, with his pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating mind and laborious ſtudy applied to the ſubjects of religion and morals, was not better acquainted with them than a Hottentot?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:028238_0011_0FD744E376535D28"/>
MANY ſenſible men of this claſs, convinced that this idea of Natural Religion is untenable, have adopted the following; that Natural Religion conſiſts of all thoſe divine and moral diſcoveries which man is able to make by the unaſſiſted efforts of his reaſon alone. The reply made to this ſcheme is, that it is impoſſible to know, amidſt the variety of religious and moral truths which man conceives, in the great variety of ſituations in which he is placed on earth, what number of them have their ſource from unaided reaſon; conſequently, whether in this view there is any ſuch thing as Natural Religion. Were we to employ ourſelves to ſeparate thoſe truths of a religious nature, which derive to us from tradition, remote revelation, or the hints and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect converſation of others grounded ultimately upon theſe, from thoſe decidedly otherwiſe, we ſhould find ourſelves engaged in a difficult and unſatisfactory taſk. We ſhould by this proceſs be fully convinced, that we could not certainly affirm of any of them, that they were the offspring of our intellectual exertions alone, that our apprehenſion of them was not owing more nearly or remotely to ſuggeſtions and aids from God. Mankind begin to learn of each other from infancy. Nations learn of nations. One age is inſtructed by another age. There is a moſt intimate connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men, and dependence upon each other with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to religious and moral diſcoveries, as there is in almoſt every thing elſe. Perhaps of any object of this kind of knowledge, after a due conſideration, and with a proper ſpirit of inquiry, we ſhould be unwilling to ſay, this is a truth for which I am ſolely indebted to my own underſtanding, without any obligation to revelations from God. It will have an influence upon our minds
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028238_0012_0FD744EB8CB480A0"/>favorable to truth, when in this courſe of thought, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, why ſome of the moſt celebrated ancient philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers travelled to the regions where, in the opinions of Jews and Chriſtians, divine revelation began to diſplay its light, if they felt not the need of inſtruction beyond the unaided efforts of their own minds? Why, after the publiſhment of Chriſtianity, the heathen writers appear to have more conſiſtent ideas of God, and the worſhip which we owe him; and of morals, together with a future ſtate of exiſtence and equal retribution, than they ever publiſhed before? Why, ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian ſcriptures, into the world, with liberty to read them without diſtreſſing pains and penalties, our religious knowledge has been ſo much more increaſed, and our motives to worthy and good conduct ſo much more ſtrengthened and improved?</p>
            <p>Is not this then the only conſiſtent and defenſible definition which can be given of Natural Religion? NATURAL RELIGION conſiſts of all thoſe truths, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to God, his being, perfections, and government; to man, his duty, his motives to action, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, let the firſt ſuggeſtion of them to our minds ariſe from whatever ſource it may, which we can in any degree apprehend, illuſtrate, and confirm by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional argumentation. I know not how the oppoſers or the friends of Revelation can object to this definition completely. It meets in part with the conception of both of them. The firſt ſay, Denying wholly the idea of any religious light from God but by the exerciſe of our intelligent powers, that all the truths of religion and morality with which we are acquainted, become known to us, as ſoon as we arrive at the age of mature thought and manly action, without any incidence to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028238_0013_0FD744EC63192B20"/>miſtake; or, that the moſt excellent inſtructions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and virtue are only principles, which have been diſcovered in one period of time by the human mind, and improved upon in another, until they have arrived to their preſent degree of perfection. Chriſtian writers take the principles of Revelation, enlarge upon them, illuſtrate and confirm them by long chains of reaſoning in their writings, and ſtyle them Natural Religion.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me now to make ſeveral obſervations which have an intimate connexion with this ſubject. The firſt is,</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE may be fully perſuaded of truth in ſubjects, which far exceed our adequate comprehenſion. We aſſume it as a principle with reſpect to all effects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in human power, that they muſt have a cauſe equal to their production. Experience and obſervation ſo early, ſo conſtantly, and powerfully teach us this principle, that it ſeems to us as a ſelf-evident maxim of reaſon and truth. To the ſame principle we recur with confidence when we would rationally account for the exiſtence and preſervation of the univerſe of being. Yet when we contemplate the cauſe of theſe greater effects, we are convinced <hi>he</hi> eſſentially differs from the inferior cauſes with which we are more familiarly acquainted. To the inquiry, Who created, and upholds the things which are ſeen, and believed by us to exiſt, though not ſeen? We anſwer, An intelligent being, ſelf-originated and independent, uncauſed himſelf, and yet the cauſe of every thing elſe. But why, you aſk, are we obliged to embrace a concluſion ſo incomprehenſible to our minds, and which confounds our moſt convincing modes of reaſoning? The reply is, After the fulleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the ſubject of creation and preſervation,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028238_0014_0FD744EF689A0718"/>this ſeems the moſt ſatisfactory method of accounting for them. Till we have arrived to this grand and ſingular Being, we have not in our conception obtained the ultimate and ſufficient cauſe of all things; for though in our aſcent to Him, we paſs through a long ſeries of cauſes, yet each one of them requires a cauſe of its own origin, and ſubſiſtence. In Him alone do our minds reſt eaſy as the univerſal Parent, the conſtant Preſerver of all things, "who is from everlaſting to everlaſting, the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and forever, without any variableneſs or ſhadow of turning." Says an inquirer to an Indian philoſopher, upon what reſts the world? He anſwers, upon an elephant. But upon what, aſks the inquirer, ſtands the elephant? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, upon the back of a tortoiſe. But upon what, continues the inquirer, ſtands the tortoiſe? He made no further reply; nor was it worth while; for if he had mentioned ten thouſand ſupporters, which needed ſupport themſelves, ſtill the inquirer would have aſked, but upon what ſtands this? Nor would he have ceaſed aſking the ſame queſtion, until he had mentioned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which had appeared to his mind a <hi>ſubſtratum,</hi> equal to the ſupport of every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>THAT the ultimate and ſupreme Cauſe of all things ſhould be conceived intelligent, is moſt reaſonable. For wherever we look, we ſee means connected with ends; ſimplicity and art; order, beauty, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Theſe our obſervation and experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us are not the offspring of undirected motion, or of chance and neceſſity, but of an intelligent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Mind. From this Being we take all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, weakneſſes, and corruptions of man, and aſcribe to him almighty power, perfect intelligence,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028238_0015_0FD744EF7A153B70"/>omnipreſence, omniſcience, inſinite benevolence, and immutable rectitude. Our minds are too ſmall-ſized to admit an adequate idea of theſe perfections, which form his ſupreme excellency. Yet we are led to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them attributes of his divine nature by ſhort and powerful reaſonings.</p>
            <p>WHAT can reſtrain his power through the whole courſe of poſſibilities, who gave to intelligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate cauſes throughout the univerſe their whole energy, who controuls, ſuſpends, and enervates them at his pleaſure? What addition can be made to that Mind, which is the parent of all other minds, from the feebleſt to the moſt exalted? Is not the aſſertion, that a being can act where he is not, moſt abſurd? Muſt not He then be every where preſent, who ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and ſuſtains univerſal nature? Have we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided evidence that the Author of our exiſtence is good? With but few exceptions, our race have more health than ſickneſs, and more eaſe than pain. The evils they ſuffer are frequently medicinal, and in event bleſſings. They may, by diſcretion and well-directed labors, render their ſituation much more eligible and happy than it ſometimes proves. Still it is imperfect, and abounds with ſorrows. We can conceive it within the power of God to grant us worth and pleaſure far ſuperior to what we poſſeſs here. We ſee no reaſons in his character which ſhould diſincline him to an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our circumſtances, agreeable to our wiſhes, in coming periods of exiſtence: When we think moſt ſoberly, we find many probabilities, which ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us he will. A conception that a Being thus perfect can ever be miſtaken, ill-diſpoſed, or ſail doing in every ſituation what is abſolutely beſt, is groundleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028238_0016_0FD744F1315D4888"/>
THESE principles have been enlarged upon by many acute writers in our own, as well as foreign languages: and have produced a firm belief of the prime truths of Natural Religion in minds not leſs penetrating than their own. I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE UTILITY of the principles of Natural Religion is a conſiderable confirmation of their truth. Utility, it is acknowledged, when partial, may be no proof of truth in principles, or propriety in actions. Principles the moſt indefenſible and pernicious, may aid our ſucceſs at times in the acquiſition of honor and profit; and preſerve us eaſy and cheerful within, when we ought to feel all the ſadneſs of remorſe, and the affliction of guilt. But when principles and motives have a permanent good influence on our worth and enjoyment on the whole, they then have the utility, which we ſhould prize as invaluable; they then have the approving ſeal of the Author of Nature upon them, teaching us they are principles which he would have us eſteem his ſacred will, and reverence and obey as his edicts. Is not this moſt evidently the caſe with the maxims and motives of Natural Religion? Do not legiſlators, who have the moſt ſeriouſly contemplated the cauſes of national ſafety and proſperity, point out obedience to them as the beſt calculated means of public ſecurity, reputation, and honor? Do they not with aſſurance foretel the gradual declenſion and ruin of thoſe ſtates and empires, which with obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance deſpiſe and violate them? Our reaſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and obſervation prove that we cannot as private perſons too highly venerate, too carefully culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and obey theſe principles, if we wiſh our rectitude and happineſs. They ſolemnly warn us againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028238_0017_0FD744F98444BA48"/>to them as a fruitful ſource of painful remorſe and probable ruin. Sober-minded and ſenſible indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, together with enlightened and virtuous poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, have ever declared with the Jewiſh prophet, "the work of righteouſneſs is peace; the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance ſorever." I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE capacity of religious knowledge which belongs to human creatures. All mankind, no doubt, wherever their habitations are appointed them on earth, have ſome degree of this capacity. But in this reſpect there is a great difference between them; a difference, which will be ſmaller or greater in proportion to the combined influence of three different cauſes—the natural ſtrength of their minds, the induſtry with which they improve them, and the favorableneſs of their ſituation for ſuch inveſtigations. There can be no doubt that men differ greatly from each other in the natural ſtrength and capaciouſneſs of their minds, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, though they are equally induſtrious, they will make a different degree of progreſs in their acquaintance with religious truth. How oppoſed in ſtrength of intellect, and their circumſtances of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in divine and moral ſcience, are thoſe in the moſt uninſtructed and diſadvantageous circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of human nature, when compared with thoſe who have high mental abilities, united with the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of education, converſation, and books, to render them acquainted with the doctrines of piety and virtue? Between theſe extremes, there is, as in light, a gradual change from a ſmall degree of illumination to the full ſplendor of day. Moreover, there is an obſervable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of capacity between thoſe in the ſame general ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028238_0018_0FD744FF73331610"/>And, amongſt thoſe who are in like circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſome improve their abilities far better than others.</p>
            <p>THE only anſwer we can make thoſe who inquire, why this conſtitution of things has taken place, is, "It is ſo, O Father, becauſe ſo it hath ſeemed good in thy ſight." Exiſtence is his free and undeſerved gift, which he may grant to any number of beings at the time he pleaſes, accompanied with more or fewer abilities of worth and enjoyment. All the claim his creatures have upon him is, that he ſhould not appoint them an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance of ſuffering, without voluntary ill behavior and guilt upon their ſide. Further, the future ſtate of life, which we hope for, and which the reaſonings of our minds render probable, give room for the moſt perfect adjuſtment of any inequalities which have taken place in this condition of exiſtence. "The judge of all the Earth will do right." I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THAT Natural and Revealed Religion are ſo far from being oppoſed, that they mutually ſtrengthen each other. REVELATION is ſtrictly a ſyſtem of dogmatical inſtruction in thoſe points which relate to our faith, duty, and future expectations. Its authority does not depend upon any reaſonings interſperſed with its decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but upon the evidence we have that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has thus taught us, and commanded us. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: When we are inſtructed in the Chriſtian ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we ſhall riſe from the dead hereafter, and live in a ſtate of perfect retribution, if we believe the information upon the ground of Revelation, we do not believe it becauſe of any argumentations which may attend it, for we ſhould be bound to believe the ſame, was it unattended with them. We believe only upon this ground, becauſe God has taught us our future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028238_0019_0FD71F692F511538"/>and accountability. As mere natural religion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, our conduct is different. In this character we receive no aſſertion as an object of faith, or direction as a command of duty, which we are not able by rational proceſs to prove ſo, either probably or indiſputably. Yet in theſe two characters, notwithſtanding we are firm believers in Revelation, and enjoy its beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, we always exiſt in this ſtate. Hence we may clearly perceive how Natural Religion and Revelation ſhould be friendly in their influence upon each other. The firmeſt believer in Chriſtianity ſeeks to render his faith more firm, than the evidence of teſtimony can alone render it, by rational illuſtration and argument. When by analogies, facts, and inferences from allowed premiſes, he can explain, and corroborate the doctrines or precepts of his religion, his doubts leſſen, and he eſteems it more worthy his cordial acceptation and ſteady ſupport. In this way there has been a moſt reſpectable diſplay of human abilities, by the friends of Revelation, in anſwer to its oppoſers.</p>
            <p>WHAT unbeliever, who has read their writings with the candor and attention they deſerve, but will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his prepoſſeſſions againſt the religion of Chriſt are much leſs than they were before? Where is the Chriſtian who will refuſe to own his mind has been inſtructed, and faith ſtrengthened by their labors? The direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Revelation to illuſtrate and confirm the truths of Natural Religion none can diſpute; for in plain terms it teaches all its great doctrines and precepts; and eſtabliſhes them by evidence which it had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but which is in itſelf powerful evidence.</p>
            <p>THESE obſervations I have thought fit to make upon the ſubject of Natural Religion. I hope they will be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028238_0020_0FD74503C1414A00"/>eſteemed pertinent to the ſubject—and may be uſeful. I ſhall ſay no more, but conclude with an addreſs to the young gentlemen, the ſtudents, in this UNIVERSITY.</p>
            <p>YE are here placed in a healthy and delightful ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the care and indulgence of your parents. The Governors and Inſtructors of this Society afford you excellent means of acquiring the habits of regularity and order, and of laying a foundation for uſeful and eminent progreſs in divine and human knowledge. Ye are indeed like trees planted by rivers of water, in a climate moſt favorable to their nouriſhment and growth. How diſgraced muſt ye be, and deſerving of neglect and puniſhment, if ye fail to be richly laden with the invaluable fruits of uſeful and ornamental lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erature, of religion and virtue; of abilities actively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to increaſe public and private ſecurity and happineſs!</p>
            <p>BUT upon this occaſion, and peculiarly in our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I would entreat you by motives the moſt ſacred and intereſting to yourſelves, and the ſociety of which you will ſoon be active and important members, moſt ſeriouſly to ſtudy the evidences of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the obligations of virtue, the influence of which, when ſteadily believed, muſt be highly beneficial.</p>
            <p>WE who have paſſed the meridian of life, and have entered upon the evening of our days, muſt ſoon cloſe them. Ye will ariſe in our ſtead; and take our places! The principles of Religion, when firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, form not only an active cauſe of that integrity which rewards us perſonally with peace of mind, and prepares us for better ſcenes of being hereafter; but of all that promotes public tranquillity, order, and felicity, of all that adorns and improves ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:028238_0021_0FD745065FE3C5C8"/>
IT is particularly obſerved by writers on the cauſes of the riſe and declenſion of ſtates, their proſperity and ſufferings, that ſtates under ſuch a form of government as ours, and which need ſo great a degree of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, order, and induſtry, to ſet all the cauſes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proſperity and ſplendor in ſucceſsful motion, muſt be indebted for them principally to the diſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of uſeful knowledge, and the lively influence of a religious faith, productive of genuine fruits. When they contemplate us irreligious, intemperate, ignorant, diſorderly, and idle, they exclaim in tones of extreme grief, Alas, our country! Thou art loſt to whatever is good, and great. Thou art degraded, and making continual progreſs towards overthrow and deſtruction!</p>
            <p>IN theſe principles, we who have lived befor you, were early educated. Inſtruction and general example tended to give them the deepeſt impreſſion with us at the period of life, when human creatures are taught with the moſt eaſe and ſucceſs. Not have diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed events happened in the world, which might render them leſs venerable in our view, and leſs efficacious on our conduct, till ſince we have arrived to an age not given to change.</p>
            <p>THE caſe is different with you at the moſt hazardous time of your lives, when you are moſt apt to learn, and receive impreſſions. The ſubjects of religion are now more freely converſed upon—it has ceaſed to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſreputable to attack them—it has become, in a degree, faſhionable to treat them with leſs reverence, and to diſregard the ſtricteſt commands of piety and virtue, as preciſe and ſuperſtitious. The Rulers of France, even to whoſe errors we are indulgent, have, in an eager purſuit after Civil Liberty, ſeen fit to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028238_0022_0FD7450A86B08640"/>Religion to a very degraded ſtate. Yield not your underſtandings or hearts to either of theſe cauſes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the charms of novelty, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions of inclination! Such looſe and immoral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, propagated and embraced here, would disfigure the ſtructures of Natural and Revealed Religion, which have been hitherto ſo highly revered by us, and ſo juſtly eſteemed the ornament of our country, our ineſtimable bleſſing. They would introduce habits and manners, which would be exceedingly hurtful to individual vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and excellence, to the riſing ſtrength and glory of our REPUBLIC!</p>
            <p>BESEECH the inſpiration and guidance of the great Source of truth, purity, and love! Live under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant influence of the ſacred principles of religion and virtue, which you enjoy in the higheſt ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement! Recommend them by your inſtructions and examples, after you have entered the world, to all around you! Theſe principles, when duly cheriſhed by you, will reward you with eſteem and honor from the wiſeſt and beſt of mankind! They will bleſs you with approbation and peace of mind, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than rubies, and every thing elſe you can deſire! They will afford you the ſweeteſt conſolation in the dark hours of adverſity, and lighten up the valley of the ſhadow of death! They will introduce you to the patronage and bleſſing of the great Creator and Lord of the Univerſe: To whom be glory and honor, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever.</p>
