            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE FIGHTING SAILOR TURN'D <hi>Peaceable Chriſtian,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>In the Year 1646. I being then about 14 Years of Age, was impr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s'd (or forc'd) and carry'd into the Wars in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where I remained about two Years, in the Time of the Long Parliament; then was carry'd to <hi>London,</hi> and I went into the Wars againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> in which I had many Deliverances, too long here too mention; yet they all at that time wrought but little upon me. Then I was turn'd over into the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Frigot; in which Ship, in proceſs of Time, it pleaſed God to convert me; as will appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>As I was Boatſwain's Mate, I had the Command of about 200 Men in this Ship, and it was my Place, to ſee that the Men attended, and were preſent at the Time of Worſhip; and I was diligent in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002654_0006_0FE5DB4ECFFE1208"/>
of that Service; and when any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to obey my Command, in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I endeavour'd by Force to compel them.</p>
            <p>Now of the many Deliverances, I ſhall only hint at three or four that happen'd in that Day, which wrought ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe upon me. The aforeſaid four De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, was at a Place call'd <hi>Sancta Cruze,</hi> in the Iſland of the <hi>Canaries;</hi> where I had not only thoſe four, but many Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances.</p>
            <p>News being brought to our General <hi>Blake,</hi> as we lay in <hi>Cales-Bay,</hi> that ſixteen Sail of Galeons arriv'd at <hi>Sancta Cruze</hi> from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> we inſtantly went out, and in a few Days got thither, and found as it was reported; and ſeveral Ships went in before us, to make Diſcovery how they lay, and anchoring at ſome Diſtance, about half Gun-ſhot from the Caſtle, which was large, and had 40 Guns at leaſt, and there was ſeveral Forts and Breaſt-Works, of about 8 or 10 Guns each. The Wind blew very right on the Shore, and we coming in, in a later Squadron, went under our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Stern to know where we ſhould be? and were anſwer'd, <hi>Where we could get room.</hi> So we ran in, but could get no room to bring up our Ship; ſo we went a-ſtern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our Ships, and the Smoke being ſomewhat
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002654_0007_0FE5DB4F93E0DE00"/>
abated, we found our ſelves to be within half a Cable's Length of the Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Galeon, of about 50 Guns, and 300 Men; and not above a Cable's Length from the Admiral, a Galeon of about 50 or 60 Guns, and having alſo about 400 Men, and within half Gun-ſhot of a large Caſtle, of 40 Guns; and within Muſquet-ſhot of ſome Forts and Breaſt-Works.</p>
            <p>And when we had brought up our Ship, we were about half a Cable's length from the Vice-Admiral, juſt in his Weak, or in the Head of him; then our Captain call'd to me, to make all ready, or get to veer nearer the Galeon: <hi>For I will,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>be on Board the Vice-Admiral.</hi> So we veer'd to be on Board of him, and ſo faſt as we veer'd towards him, he veer'd from us, until he came about Muſquet-ſhot of the Shore. Then the Captain call'd to me, to get a Hauſer out of the Gun-Room-Port, and clap a Spring on the Cable; when done, we veer'd our Cable, and by juſt croſs his Hawſe, about half a Muſquet-ſhot from him; then we run all the Guns we could on that Side towards him, which were in Number 28 or 30, and all Hands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to it in earneſt.</p>
            <p>And the ſecond Broadſide ſome of our Shot, as we judged, fell into his Powder-Room
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002654_0008_0FE5DB50EA6FCCD0"/>
and ſhe blew up, and not one Man eſcaped, that we could perceive.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral, was going to ſerve us, as we had ſerved his Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which we perceiving, ply'd him very cloſe, with about 28 or 30 Guns; and the third Broadſide, all his Men leap'd over-board, and inſtantly ſhe blew up.</p>
            <p>And there was a ſmall Caſtle on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side, which (after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was blown up) we went to work againſt its Fort, and in a ſhort Time made them weary of it.</p>
            <p>And as for the Caſtle of 40 Guns, we were got ſo far into the Bay, that they could not bring upon us above two or three Guns.</p>
            <p>But when we went off, they ply'd us cloſe with their great Guns, but did us no great Damage.</p>
            <p>After this Expedition was over, and that we had blown up the two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals, I took the Long-Boat, to go on Board a Galeon, that lay on Shore near to another Caſtle, ſuppoſing that the Men were not on Board; but there were ſome, and they lay cloſe on Board, until we came within two or three Ships length of them, and then they roſe up and fir'd ſeveral Guns at us; but being ſo near their Ship, all their Shot went over us: Which I call the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002654_0009_0FE5DB535E800F48"/>
firſt great Deliverance. Then on our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn towards our Ship, they from ſeveral Caſtles and Breaſt-Works, fir'd briskly at us with great and ſmall Shot, which came very near us; notwithſtanding we all got ſafe on Board our own Ship: And this I call the ſecond great Deliverance.</p>
            <p>In a little Time, the Smoke of their Guns being gone, I ſaw three Galeons on Shore, all on Board one another; one of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Shore, and one croſs her Hawſe, and the other croſs her Stern, about a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot from our Ship; and there was a Caſtle on one Side of them, and a Breaſt-work on the other, with about 50 or 60 Men in it, as was ſuppoſed, and the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons lay about half a Cable's Length from the Caſtle, and the ſame Diſtance from the Breaſt-work, and about fifty Yards from the Shore: Then I took the Pinnace, and two Men with me, and was going to ſet them on Fire; but the Captain ſaw me, and call'd me back, and ſent five Men more with me; and on our ſetting forward, our Ship fir'd a Gun, and in the Smoke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we got on Board the Galeon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Harm, (the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having left them) and I inſtantly ſet one of them on Fire, which burnt the other two Galeons. And when we could ſtay no longer, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſon of the Fire, and our Ship's Crew
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002654_0010_0FE5DB55B15C71B0"/>
not being as formerly, mindful of us, to fire ſome Guns, that in the Smoke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we might have retir'd back, without being diſcovered by any from the Breaſt-works; but they ſeeing of us, we were forc'd, by reaſon of the Fire, to return preſently towards our own Ship. The Breaſt-work then having full Sight of us, diſcharg'd a Volley of about 50 or 60 ſmall Shot, and kill'd two of our Men, and ſhot a third in the Back; and I ſat cloſe to one that was kill'd, between him and the Shore, and cloſe to him that was ſhot in the Back, and receiv'd no Harm: And this was a third and eminent Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>And coming out of the Bay, we came within three or four Ship's Length of the Caſtle that had 40 Guns; and they kept them in Readineſs, until we came directly over-againſt the Caſtle, then they fir'd, but we were ſo near, that moſt of the Shot went over, and did us little Harm, only in our Rigging: And I was on the Clue of the Main-tack, getting the Main-tack on Board, and the Shot cut the Bolt-Rope a little above my Head: And this was the fourth Deliverance, and all in ſix Hours Time, and never to be forgotten by me; but I deſire to be thankful to God, who
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002654_0011_0FE5DB5713B26778"/>
from theſe and many other Dangers, has apparently delivered me.</p>
            <p>And the aforeſaid 16 Galeons, were very large Ships, from 300 Tons to 1000, and upwards; and the firſt that I burnt, as our Men judged, had a great deal of Silver on Board, being a Ship of about 800 Ton, and the other two richly laden, and about 7 or 800 Ton, and all periſhed together; and all the reſt of the ſixteen being richly laden, not having Time to get their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out, we being ſo ſuddenly upon them, were all burnt and deſtroyed, together with their Lading. But then I neither was a <hi>Quaker,</hi> nor were any of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo called on Board our Ship; nor ever to my Remembrance, had heard of any called by that name.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the firſt Riſe of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in our Ship: There was ſome Soldiers put on Board us, and one of them had been at a Meeting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the aforeſaid People; and there was two young Men in the Ship, who had ſome Converſe with him, but he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the Ship in a little time, but the two young Men made little Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any Conviction or Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until about ſix Months after. The firſt Thing obſervable was, they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to hear the Prieſt, or put off their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002654_0012_0FE5DB57D7D11B60"/>
Hats to the Captain, for which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them <hi>Quakers:</hi> Theſe two met often together in Silence, and their ſo meeting caus'd a ſerious Enquiry among others, and their Number increaſed, and as they encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo Perſecution increaſed againſt them; and the Captain was ſore troubled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed at their Increaſe, himſelf being a <hi>Baptiſt Preacher;</hi> the Prieſt that officiated in our Ship was cruel and bitter againſt them; crying out thus to me, <hi>O Thomas, an honeſt Man, and a good Chriſtian! Here is a dangerous People on Board,</hi> (that is to ſay the <hi>Quakers) a blaſphemous People, denying the Ordinances and Word of God.</hi> The which made me as cruel as himſelf, and I gave them many a heavy Blow, and I was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent upon them, and a great Perſecutor of them; but the Remembrance of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Deliverances ſtruck cloſe to me, and the Lord wrought ſo much upon me, that I could no more beat any of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and in a little Time the Lord gave me a true Sight of the Prieſt; for when I could not do his Work, and beat and abuſe the ſaid People, then I was accounted neither an <hi>honeſt Man,</hi> nor <hi>good Chriſtian</hi> by him; ſo I began to look upon the ſaid People with a ſingle Eye, for good. And the Lord by his in-ſhining Light, open'd my Underſtanding, ſo that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002654_0013_0FE5DB848533B210"/>
I ſaw a great deal of Difference between them, and other Profeſſors; whereupon I made many Promiſes unto the Lord, to be better; but they being made in my own Will, were of little Effect: Then the Lord ſhewed me, that in thoſe many Promiſes, and not keeping them, I was not benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby, and that cauſed much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me; ſo that I ſeparated from all ſorts of Profeſſors, except one <hi>Roger Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> who was called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> whom I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loved; and in all my Cruelty exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon, and againſt the ſaid People, I never ſtruck him: For he had a Check upon me, tho' he ſpake not a Word; and many Times when I had reſolv'd to ſeparate the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> when met together in a religious Manner, either by Blows or otherwiſe; then he looking upon me, I durſt not touch one of them. After ſome Time, I deſired to be much alone, and in my ſtill and quiet Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Lord was very good unto me, and gave me many a heavenly Viſitation, and tho' it was in Judgment, yet that was my Portion, and I patiently bore them, and came to love his Judgments and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations, and they became to me very ſweet and pleaſant, and of more Value than <hi>Rubies,</hi> and was my great Delight; and with them I was very well pleaſed,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002654_0014_0FE5DB5A1C170270"/>
becauſe they brought me into much Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for the which I loved them at my very Heart, for it was a Heart-work; and many Times when alone, the Lord would break in upon me, by the in-ſhining of his glorious Light in my own Heart, melted me, and mollified me: Yea, ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many Times, that I could not contain, or forbear crying out, <hi>O Lord!</hi> Inſomuch that the Profeſſors could not tell what to make of it: But I knew and felt it to be the mighty Power of God, which brought and wrought Deliverance into my Soul; and with this Exerciſe, and many more, I continued about ſix Months, being taken off all outward Concerns, and being alone, ſome ſaid I was mad, others I was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted; and ſo wrote Home to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many came on Board to ſee me, thinking the Shape of my Body was alter'd, and I heard ſome ſay, that <hi>my Body was of the ſame Shape, but I looked like a dumb Saint.</hi> In ſhort, I was a Scoff and Deriſion with all ſorts of Profeſſors, except the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> but I was one of them in my Heart, tho' not yet joined to them, for the Croſs was too hard for me as yet, but many a Time I felt that living, eternal Power, which hath made me both to tremble and quake, and was glad when it was ſo with
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002654_0015_0FE5DB5E38EBEE10"/>
me; yet then I was no profeſs'd <hi>Quaker,</hi> for the Croſs was ſtill too hard for me.</p>
            <p>But it was the Lord's good Will, and bleſſed be his Holy Name for it; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the many Judgments and ſore inward Afflictions, it was his good Will and Pleaſure, to bring my Will to be ſubject to his Will, for in thoſe dark Times, I was fully given up; yea, Life and all, to have Peace in my Conſcience with God, for that was the Thing, and the only thing that my Heart thirſted after.</p>
            <p>And one Evening being alone, (for in that I took great Delight,) and being low in my Mind, I was very earneſt with the Lord to know what People I ſhould join my ſelf unto, for then I was alone; and it was plainly ſhewed me the <hi>Quakers;</hi> of which Number the Man I loved ſo well was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted; and being one that I formerly highly eſteemed, and who had the Check upon me, when I was in the Height of Cruelty againſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> then on Board, as is before-mentioned. But the Thing at that Time did ſtartle me, that I deſired of the Lord, rather to die than live, for the reaſoning Part got up: What to ſuch a People, that both Prieſt and Profeſſors are againſt! What to ſuch a People, that I have been ſo long beating and abuſing, and that without juſt
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002654_0016_0FE5DB5F9F97B520"/>
Cauſe! Death would be more welcome to me. And here the Enemy, that old ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Serpent, was not wanting to inſinuate many Things into my Mind: But God was pleaſed to put me in Mind of the manifold Preſervations and Deliverances he had brought me through; ſo I took up this Reſolution, by the Aſſiſtance of the Lord, <hi>Whether</hi> Quaker, <hi>or no</hi> Quaker, <hi>Peace with God I am for:</hi> Yet it coſt me many a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sigh, and many a Tear, before I could give up to go to <hi>Roger Dennis,</hi> my Friend, called a <hi>Quaker:</hi> But good was the Lord, and for ever bleſſed be his worthy Name, who followed me with his dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reproofs: Inſomuch that I could contain no longer, but gave up and went to my Friend <hi>Roger Dennis,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I would ſpeak with thee,</hi> and he very mildly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I will go with thee:</hi> I having a Cabin, we went down, and when in, I ſhut the Door, and we ſat ſome Time; and before he open'd his Mouth, the Hand of the Lord was upon me, and melted my Heart, and brought me into great Tenderneſs, and then he ſpake but a few Words, but they were in great Humility and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards me, hitting the Mark to a Hair's Breadth; ſo that I had great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, being quiet in my Mind, and we parted in great Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002654_0017_0FE5DB6105A35FE8"/>Not long after, the old Enemy, the Devil, was very buſy: <hi>What! to join thy ſelf to ſuch a fooliſh People!</hi> And many more of his Stratagems; for he was like to loſe his Dominion, which made him the more furious to attack me: So that I was even weary of my Life, yet longed for the Firſt Day, that I might go to the Meeting; and it was the firſt that ever I was at: And at the Time appointed, I went to the Meeting with a great Dread upon my Mind, and ſat me down in great Quietneſs amongſt them, they being then but ſix Men.</p>
            <p>I had not been long there, but it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the publick Place of Worſhip, that I was amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> at which, many of them left the Prieſt and his Worſhip, to come and ſee me: And they made a great Noiſe and Buſtle. When the Worſhip was over, the Captain ask'd the Reaſon of that Noiſe? and it was told him, that I was amongſt the <hi>Quakers:</hi> Then he ſent for me to himſelf, and divers more of his Officers were there: The firſt that began was the Prieſt, ſaying, <hi>Thomas, I took you for a very honeſt Man, and a good Chriſtian, but I am ſorry you ſhould be ſo deluded.</hi> The mean while the Captain turning the Bible from one End to the other, to prove the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> no <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> All this while I was very quiet and ſtill in my Mind; for I found
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002654_0018_0FE5DB6272A44390"/>
therein was my Strength: And when they ſaw they could not prevail upon me, then they fell to ſlandering of me, ſaying, That at ſuch and ſuch a Time the <hi>Quakers</hi> came to me, ſaying, Do ſuch and ſuch a thing: which was all falſe, by which I got great Strength: For never any <hi>Quaker</hi> came to me, but <hi>Roger Dennis,</hi> one that I dearly lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deſired his Company, and that was but the Night before. So when they had done, I went to my Friends in great Peace and Satisfaction, ſaying to them, That <hi>when I went to the Captain, I was ſcarce half a</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, <hi>but by their Lies and falſe Reports againſt me, they have made me almoſt a whole</hi> Quaker, <hi>or at leaſt I hope to be one.</hi> My Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me in much Love and Tenderneſs, and ever after I kept to their Meetings.</p>
            <p>After this, Truth prevailed very much, and had a great Sway in the Ship, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral were convinced; ſo that when I came among them, there was but ſix; but in leſs than ſix Months after, we were twelve Men and two Boys, of which one was the Prieſt's.</p>
            <p>There was ſuch a Blow given to Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that it never got up again, whilſt in that Ship, tho' much try'd for by the Captain; for he got ſeveral Men out of other Ships, on purpoſe to perſecute the <hi>Quakers;</hi> who came with great ſwelling
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002654_0019_0FE5DB6798397250"/>
Words, as tho' they would have devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us at once: But, bleſſed be the Lord, they never had Power to touch one of us; for their Horns were nipp'd in the Bud, and ſeveral of them in a ſhort Time were cut off by Death, inſomuch that Men were afraid to be in that Office to abuſe us.</p>
            <p>About this Time we had a great Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſwept away above Forty in a little Time; and moſt of us, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> had the Diſtemper, but none died of it, yet were brought very low. We took great Care of one another when ſick, that nothing was wanting amongſt us, but what one had, was free for all of us; and our Diligence and great Care of the Sick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, was ſuch, that I have heard ſome Men ſay, when upon a Languiſhing Pillow and Death-Bed, <hi>Oh carry me to the</hi> Quakers, <hi>for they take great Care of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they will take ſome Care of me.</hi> At this Time the Captain was very kind to me, and frequently ſent me Part of what he had, and order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me a Cabin; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I lay in a Hammock. And now all was very quiet, no Perſecution, but a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Love amongſt all ſorts of Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were then on Board, and Truth had great Dominion, and ſeveral were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002654_0020_0FE5DB685DEFAE58"/>After I began to be well, I ſent to the Captain, to know if I might have that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin I lay in before I was convinced; and he granted my Requeſt, for no one inclined to lie therein; alledging, it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Space of Time; and it proved very ſerviceable; for I not only lay therein, but made Uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for our Meeting-place.</p>
            <p>Now all Things were in Quiet, and the Captain continued our Friend for ſome Time, and ſhewed us more Kindneſs than any other Profeſſors; The Captain would often ſay, <hi>Thomas, take thy Friends; do ſo and ſo, or ſuch and ſuch a thing;</hi> and I took my Friends, and did it far beyond his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, by which he got great Credit: For as yet we were not brought to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify againſt Fighting; yet we would take none of the Plunder. And in all our deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Attempts, wherein we were then concerned, we received no Hurt, tho' ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others were killed and wounded, who ſat cloſe by us; at which Time the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain would ſay to other Captains, <hi>that he cared not if all his Men were</hi> Quakers, <hi>for they were the hardieſt Men in his Ship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Time of Liberty I looked upon it but as a Fore-runner of farther Exerciſe; for what was done in pretended Friendſhip,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002654_0021_0FE5DB69BA514688"/>
was but to ſerve their own Ends: I expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Time would come to try all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, which accordingly did, and drove every Man to his own. We being now at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> were ordered to go to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> to take or burn a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War; and our Station was to lie againſt a Caſtle to batter it, the which we did; and one Corner of the Caſtle play<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d ſome Shot into our Ship, and I was for beating down that Corner: And we, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſought with as much Courage as any, ſeeing then no farther; and for my Part, I was ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ipt into my Waitcoat, (every one in fighting Habit) and went to it in Earneſt, and with as much Courage as ever; and I went into the Fore-caſtle, and levell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my whole Strength and Rigour to kill and deſtroy Mens Lives, and in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute after I could not kill or deſtroy a Man, if it were to gain the World; for as I was coming out of the Fore-caſtle Door, to ſee where the Shot fell, the Word of the Lord run thro' me, <hi>how if I
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002654_0022_0FE5DB6AEA62E038"/>
had kill'd a Man;</hi> and it was with ſuch Power, that for ſome Time I hardly knew whether I was in the Body or out of it; but when I came to ſee, and felt what it was, I turned about, and put on my Clothes, and walked on the Deck, as tho' I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen a Gun fir'd, under a great Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Mind; and ſome ask'd me, <hi>If I was hurt?</hi> I anſwer'd, <hi>No; but under ſome Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Conſcience on the Account of Fighting,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' I had not heard that the <hi>Quakers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to fight. And when Night came, we went out of the Caſtle-ſhot, and I much deſired to know, what the Friends would ſay to this: I ſent for two of them, one was the man I loved ſo well, and I queri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much with them about Fighting; to which they gave me little Anſwer; but ſaid, <hi>If the Lord ſent them well home, they could never go to it again;</hi> my Anſwer to them was, with a Dread and Fear upon me, <hi>That if I ſtood honeſt to that of God in my own Conſcience, and if we came to it to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that with the Lord's Aſſiſtance I would bear my Teſtimony againſt it.</hi> For this I plainly ſaw, that inaſmuch as we had been ſo great Actors in it, now we muſt bear our Teſtimony againſt Fighting; not doubting but Way will be made for my Delivery; but if not, the Will of the Lord be done. The next Day, we heard that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002654_0023_0FE5DB6EC0203230"/>
ſeveral were kill'd on Shore; the which added much to my Sorrow. Some Time after, a Friend went to die Captain to be cleared; he asked his Reaſon? His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>He could fight no longer:</hi> Then ſaid the Captain, <hi>He that denies to fight in Time of</hi> Engagement, <hi>I will put my Sword in his Guts. Then,</hi> ſaid the Friend, <hi>thou wilt be a Manſlayer, and guilty of ſhedding Blood:</hi> for which the Captain beat him ſorely with his Cane and Fiſt: Altho' he was a <hi>Baptiſt-Preacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here the Captain, who had been our Friend, and a Shelter to us from wicked Men, is now become again our Enemy, and we left open to every wicked Spirit to kill us, whenſoever we deny to fight: For the printed Orders fixed upon the Ship ſays, <hi>If any Man flinch from his Quarters in Time of</hi> Engagement, <hi>any may kill him:</hi> Yet for all the hard Things, I had a ſecret Hope and Belief, that if we ſtood true to what the Lord had made known unto us, the Lord would deliver us out of all their Hands.</p>
            <p>Some Time after (about the Year 1655.) we were at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and we were ordered to go a Cruizing; and one Morning, we eſpied, a great Ship bearing down upon us, which we ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War, with whom we had Wars: So Orders was given to make the Ship clear to Fight.

               <hi>Now comes a trying Time, to prove every one's Foundation.</hi> I being then upon the Deck, a great Weight tell upon me, and I deſired very earneſtly of the Lord for Strength, to bear what was coming upon us to try our Foundation; and farther, I deſired of the Lord, what to do in ſuch a Streight? and it was anſwer'd me, <hi>To have a Meeting.</hi> And this ſeemed to be very ſtrange; for all the Men were in an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, one heaving one Way, and another another; and then I queried, whether Friends would meet? and it was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>If they met not, I was clear.</hi> So then I went down, with a Dread upon me, and ſpoke to two or three of them; and they met all of them in a little Time, twelve Men and two Boys, at our old Meeting-place, to my great Satisfaction; for only two of them knew of my Exerciſe, and how it was with me at <hi>Barcelona:</hi> But bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord, who open'd my Mouth, and I declared to them how Things was with me, and that Things ſeemed very dark and cloudy, or Words to that Effect; yet my Hopes and Belief was in the Lord, that I had not the leaſt Scruple, but that the Lord would deliver me, and not me only, but all ſuch as were of my Faith and Belief; adding, <hi>I lay not this as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction upon any one, but leave you all to the

Lord, to do as he ſhall direct you; yet one Thing I have to adviſe you of, that you be not enſnared; in a little Time they will call you to your Quarters; which if you go, you ſhew your ſelves Men for their Turns. And farther, I muſt adviſe you, that the Captain puts great Confidence in you; therefore let us be careful that we give him no juſt Occaſion. Therefore, all that are of my Mind, let us meet in the moſt publick Place upon the Deck, in the full View of the Captain, that be may not ſay we deceived him, in not telling of him that we would not fight; that he might have put others in our room or Place.</hi> And as we were ſitting together, one of the Ship's Company came to a Friend, ſaying, <hi>I will put a Crow in thy Guts;</hi> and another ſaying, <hi>I will kill thee;</hi> and as they had an <hi>Antipathy</hi> againſt them, ſo they threaten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. Then I went with a great Dread of God upon my Mind, but clear of all Fear of Man; for bleſſed be the Lord, all Fear of Man was taken away. And when I came upon the Deck, I ſet my Back againſt the Geer-Capſtan, with my Face towards the Captain, where he had a full View of me; ſtanding there a-while, I turned my Head to ſee who was coming after me, and when I ſaw my Friends there behind me, my very Heart leap'd for Joy, and I was overcome with the Sight of them; for to me they were the lovelieſt that ever
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002654_0026_0FE5DB72B690F2C8"/>
I beheld, and my very Bowels rowled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me for them, and my Life was given up freely for them, to ſee them given up as innocent Lambs, ready for the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtanding all together. In a little Time comes the Lieutenant, and ſays to one of them, <hi>Go down to thy Quarters;</hi> his Anſwer was, <hi>I can fight no more:</hi> The which was what he looked for; for he was our great Enemy. Then he goes to the Captain, and makes the worſt of it, ſaying, <hi>Yonder the</hi> Quakers <hi>be all together, and I do not know but they will mutiny, and one ſays he cannot fight:</hi> then he ask'd his Name, and came down; He firſt heaved his Hat over-board, and took hold of his Collar, and beat him with a large Cane, and then dragged him down to his Quarters. Then the Captain goes upon the Half-Deck again, and call'd to his Man to bring him his Sword; which done, he drew it in as much Fury and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, as ever I ſaw Sword drawn; for Paſſion had overcome him. No ſooner was his Sword drawn, but the Word of the Lord ran thro' me like Fire, ſaying, <hi>The Sword of the Lord is over him: And if he will have a Sacrifice, proffer it him:</hi> And this Word was ſo powerful in me, that I greatly quivered and ſhook, tho' endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the contrary, fearing they ſhould think I was afraid of the Sword, but I was

not: And when the ſhaking was a little over, I turned my Head over my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſaid to the Friend I loved ſo well, <hi>That I muſt go to the Captain:</hi> His Anſwer was, <hi>Be well ſatisfied in what thou doſt:</hi> My Anſwer was again, <hi>There is a Neceſſity upon me to go.</hi> Then, his Anſwer was, <hi>I will go with thee.</hi> Then watching the Captain, as he came forward with his drawn Sword in his Hand, I fixt my Eye upon him, with the great Dread of the Lord upon my Mind; I ſtep'd towards him, and he furiouſly looked on me, to have daunted me; but I was carried above all his furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Looks: I had about five Paces and ſix Steps upon the Quarter-Deck before I came to him, I ſtill keeping my Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, in much Dread, and ſtep'd the five Paces, and on the third Step, his Countenance changed pale, and he turned himſelf about from me, and went off, and called to his Man to take away his Sword: I ſtanding there a while, ſaid to my Friend, <hi>The Captain is gone, let us return to our Friends;</hi> who receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a little Time, the Ship we thought to fight withal, prov'd a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> our Friend; and before Night the Captain ſent the Prieſt to me, to deſire me not to be angry with him, for it was in his Paſſion; my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

by the Prieſt to the Captain was, <hi>That I had nothing but good Will to him, and all Men living;</hi> and bid him tell the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>That he muſt have a Care of ſuch Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for if he killed a Man in his Paſſion, he might ſeek a Place for Repentance, and might not find it.</hi> And ever after this the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was very kind and reſpective to me.</p>
            <p>And thus the Lord brought me thro' many and various Exerciſes, for which I bleſs his worthy Name; for if the Trial, or Exerciſe was ever ſo great, if I was but made willing to give up to that he made known unto me, to be his Will and Mind, he never fail'd to carry me thro' it; to whom be everlaſting Praiſe, faith my Soul.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1660, about the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the IId's coming into <hi>England,</hi> for the Space of two or three Years, I met with many ſorts of Exerciſes, being forc'd or preſs'd divers Times; all which the Lord brought me thro'. And of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I ſhall hint a few, that if any ſhould meet with the like, they may not diſtruſt the Lord's Goodneſs and Strength, for he is able by his everlaſting Power, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to the uttermoſt, and will plead the Cauſe of ſuch who put their whole Truſt and Confidence in him.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1661, early one Morning,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002654_0029_0FE5DB7A8607E648"/>
going from my Quarters towards the Ship I belong'd unto, I met four Preſs-Maſters, and I might have ſhunned them, but durſt not; and when we met, they ask'd me, <hi>Whether I was a Maſter or a Mate?</hi> I denying to be a Maſter, they reply'd, <hi>You muſt go with us:</hi> Not ſo, ſaid I; then they took hold of me, two under my Arms, and two under my Hams, and lifted me upon their Shoulders, and carried me about three Hundred Yards, with my Face upwards; So that by the Signs I could diſcern which way they carry'd me, which was to <hi>Horſley-down, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll-Stairs;</hi> and then it was in my Mind, that they would heave me over the Wharf; then I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what Time of Tide it was, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young Flood, the Boat came to the Wharf-Side, and they heav'd me from their Shoulders over the Wharf, croſs the Boat-thaughts, which was about five Yards high, and had not Providence preſerved me, they had killed, or elſe crippled me, and I lying ſtill for ſome Time, one of them cryed out, <hi>What ſhall we do, we have kill'd the Man;</hi> but getting up, I went into the Boat's-Stern, at which they were glad and rejoiced; and ſo carried me over the Water, and put me on Shore.</p>
            <p>Another Time (in the Year 1662.) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Harwich</hi> laden with Corn, and no
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002654_0030_0FE5DB7BA6D1D5F0"/>
ſooner we came to an Anchor, but a Preſs-Boat came on Board us; and the firſt Man they laid Hands on, was me, ſaying, <hi>You muſt go with us. I hope not ſo,</hi> ſaid I. Then they ſwore that I was a luſty Man, and ſhould go: Then they laid Hands on me, and lifted me into their Boat, and carried me on Board the Ship <hi>Mary,</hi> one <hi>Jeremiah Smith</hi> Commander, who was a very looſe and wicked Man: So when I came to the Ship-ſide, they bad me go in, the which I had not Freedom to do: Then they ty'd a Rope about my Waſte, and with a Tackle hoiſted me, making a Noiſe, as if I had been ſome Monſter, and lower'd me down upon the Main-Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where I ſat about half an Hour, that all might have their full View of me: Then I got up, and walk'd abaft (or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind) the Main-Maſt, amongſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and when Night came, I went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the half-Deck, and laid me down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Guns on the Boards, and ſlept very well. The next Day the Steward came to me, to know my Name; I asked him for what? He reply'd, That I might have my Victuals. I told him, it was Time enough when I came for my Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals. So I continued without any Food <hi>Five Days,</hi> only at Times a Draught of Water; for I was ſenſible, if I had eat of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002654_0031_0FE5DB7FD19BD3E8"/>
their Victuals, they would have kept me. The Seamen were very kind to me, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny came in great Tenderneſs, and proffer'd me of their Victuals: I accepted of their Love, but none of their Victuals. The Captain was a very furious Man, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Drink, ſo that I could not have Opportunity to ſpeak with him; and I often deſired of the Lord for Strength to oppoſe him, or elſe to be ſtill and quiet. And on the Sixth Day in the Morning, from the Time I came on Board, I found much Exerciſe attending my Mind to go to the Captain, and I ſpake to the Maſter to tell him of it, which he did. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, having moſt of his Officers about him, ſent for me by his Man, himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Half-Deck; and as I was going along the Gallery, his Man turns about, ſaying, <hi>You muſt pull off your Hat when you come to the Captain,</hi> whoſe Back was towards me; and his Man offering to pull it off, I held it on, which cauſed a Buſtle. The Captain ſaid, <hi>Let his Hat alone, I know the</hi> Quakers <hi>very well. What is thy Buſineſs with me?</hi> To which I anſwered, <hi>I acquainted thy Men when they took me from my Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I was not for their Turns, and am come to acquaint thee;</hi> I alſo ſaid, <hi>It is not unknown unto ſome in this Ship, that I have been as great a Fighter as others, but now no

more ſo. I hear ſo,</hi> ſaid the Captain, <hi>and that thou haſt had Command, and ſo thou ſhalt have here; or elſe thou ſhalt ſtand by me, and I will tell thee what I will have done, and thou ſhalt call the Men to do it; or elſe thou ſhalt ſtand by the Fore-Braces, and I will call to thee to do ſo and ſo; and this is not killing of Men, to hale a Rope.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>But I will not do That. Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Thou ſhalt be with the Coopers, to hand Beer for them, there is great Occaſion for it.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>But I will not do That. Then,</hi> ſaid he again, <hi>I have an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thee, which will be a great Piece of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a ſaving of Mens Lives, Thou ſhalt be with the Doctor, and when a Man comes down, that hath loſt a Leg or an Arm, to hold the Man, while the Doctor cuts it off; this is not killing Men, but ſaving Mens Lives.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>But I will not do That, for it's all an Aſſiſtance.</hi> Then he ſaid, <hi>I will ſend thee a-ſhore to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>I am in thy Hand, thou may'ſt do with me what thou pleaſeſt. But,</hi> ſaid the Captain, <hi>I hear thou wilt ſtarve thy ſelf. Not ſo,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>for I have Money in my Pocket, and if thou wilt ſell me any Victuals, I will eat before thee.</hi> The Captain ſaid, <hi>I cannot ſell the King's Victuals.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Nor I cannot do the King's Work, therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat the King's Victuals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a little Time after, I was called to go into the Boat, expecting to be ſent to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002654_0033_0FE5DB83576CFE78"/>
but when we came on Shore, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my Expectation, the Captain bad me, <hi>Go which Way I would.</hi> This done, I enquired for my Friend <hi>Mary Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> looſe. And after two or three Days, I returned to the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel I was preſs'd out of: And the next Day, being very hard at Work, heaving out Corn into a Lighter, ſtripp'd in my Shirt and Drawers; then a Man of War's Boat clapp'd us on Board, and the Coxon jump'd in, and ſwore, <hi>Here's a luſty Rogue! come up,</hi> ſaid he, but I took little Notice of him, and continued heaving Corn, at which he ſword, <hi>That if I would not come up, he would lay me croſs the Shoulders.</hi> Then I ſaid, <hi>Strike me not, for if thou doſt, I will not come up; if thou ſtrike me not, I may come up.</hi> Then he ſwore to the Captain, that I was a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Have him up,</hi> ſaid the Captain, ſo I went upon the Deck: <hi>Come near,</hi> ſays the Captain; ſo I went into the Lighter, into which we heav'd the Corn, cloſe by him. Then the Captain, in a ſcoffing Manner, ſaid, <hi>Thou art no</hi> Quaker, <hi>if thou wert, I would not take thee; for if thou wert a</hi> Quaker, <hi>thou ſhouldſt be waiting upon the Lord, and let his Ravens feed thee, and not be toiling thy Body ſo:</hi> (my Shirt being then very wet with

Sweat) <hi>anſwer me,</hi> ſaid he. The Seamen crying, <hi>The Spirit does not move him;</hi> one while ſaying, <hi>Pull him in;</hi> another while, <hi>Let him alone:</hi> Thus it was for ſome time. And I got very low in my Mind, not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering what they ſaid; deſiring earneſtly of the Lord, that if I anſwered the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it might be to the Purpoſe, or elſe to be ſilent. And it roſe freſh in my Mind to the Captain: <hi>I perceive thou haſt read ſome Part of the Scriptures, didſt thou never read, that he is worſe than an Infidel, that will not provide for his Family?</hi> adding, <hi>I often heard the</hi> Quakers <hi>blamed for not working) but thou art the firſt that ever I heard blame them for working.</hi> Says the Captain, <hi>Turn him away, he is a Quaker.</hi> Being gone a little Way, he calls out, <hi>Pull him again, he is no</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: <hi>Thou art no</hi> Quaker; <hi>for here thou bringeſt Corn, and of it is made Bread, and by the Strength of that Bread, we kill the</hi> Dutch; <hi>and therefore no</hi> Quaker: <hi>Or art not thou as acceſſary to their Death as we? Anſwer me.</hi> I kept very ſtill and low in my Mind: And after their many Scoffs and Jeers; then ſaid I to the Captain, <hi>I am a Man that have, and can feed my Enemies; and well may I you, who pretend to be my Friends.</hi> The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reply'd, <hi>Turn him away, he is a</hi> Quaker.</p>
            <p>In a few Days after, I was preſs'd out of the ſame Veſſel, and carry'd on Board a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002654_0035_0FE5DB8AF72975C0"/>
Man of War; and when I came on Board, was order'd to go into the Cabin, where the Captain and ſeveral Officers were; and when I came into the Cabin, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain appear'd like a <hi>Madman,</hi> ſwearing and curſing againſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> often ſwearing, <hi>That if he did not hang me, he would carry me to the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>and he would.</hi> But I ſaid very little to them; for the Lord's Preſence was with me, and carry'd me over all their high Threats. And when he had tired himſelf, then he ſaid more mildly, <hi>What! doſt thou ſay nothing for thy ſelf?</hi> My Anſwer was, <hi>Thou ſay'ſt enough for thee, and me too;</hi> for I found it moſt ſafe to ſay little, except I had good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it. So, when they had done, I went to my Lodging, between two Guns in the Half-deck, on the Boards; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt ſleep and wake, I heard a great Outcry, <hi>Where is the Quaker? Where is the Quaker?</hi> And the Cry much increaſing, at laſt I ſaid, <hi>Here am I, what lack you at this Time of the Night?</hi> (it being about the firſt Hour) <hi>Ho!</hi> ſaid they, <hi>you muſt come to the Captain preſently.</hi> And when I came to the Cabin-Door; ſaid the Captain, <hi>Is the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker there?</hi> Yes, ſaid I. <hi>I cannot ſleep,</hi> ſaid he: But I ſlept very very well on the hard Boards. Then, ſaid he, <hi>Thou muſt go on Shore,</hi> I anſwered, <hi>I am in thy Hand, and

thou may'ſt do with me, as thou pleaſeſt:</hi> So the Boat put me a-ſhore at <hi>Harwich.</hi> And this was the Man that ſaid, <hi>Hanging was too good for me;</hi> who, in ſix Hours Time was ſo weary of me, that he could not take his natural Reſt, whilſt I was on Board.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many more of the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, hath the Lord carry'd me thro', too long here too mention; for the which, I bleſs his worthy Name: For he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, in the greateſt Straits, ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me, as I was made willing to give up to him, and to be nothing of my ſelf.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Thomas Lurting,</hi> was then <hi>George Pattiſon</hi>'s Mate, and coming from <hi>Venice,</hi> we heard that many <hi>Turks</hi> Men of War were at Sea, and that they had taken many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships; and it was much in thy Mind, that we ſhould be taken: and I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much concerned, as well for the Men, as for my ſelf; at which I went to the Maſter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd of him to go to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and to ſtay for a Convoy, and ſo long we would have no Wages; but the Maſter would not agree to this, but kept the Sea, much contrary to our Minds: And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Iſland, call'd <hi>May-York,</hi> we were chaſed by a <hi>Turks</hi> Veſſel, or a Man of War, called a <hi>Pata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002654_0038_0FE5DB8DF21BD1E0"/>
and the <hi>Turks</hi> juſt coming on Board of us: And being much concerned in Mind, I deſired of the Lord Patience under ſuch an Exerciſe; and going to the Ship's Side to ſee the <hi>Turks</hi> come in, the Word of the Lord ran thro' me, thus; <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, for all this, thou ſhalt not go to</hi> Algier: And I having formerly great Experience of the Lord's Doings upon ſeveral Deliverances in Times of War, I believed what the Lord did ſay in me. At this all kind of Fear was removed, and I received them, as a Man might his Friends, and they were as Civil to us. So I ſhewed them all Parts of the Veſſel, and what ſhe was laden withal; then ſaid I to our Men, <hi>Be not afraid, for all this, we ſhall not go to</hi> Algier; <hi>but let me deſire you, as you have been willing to obey me, ſo be as willing to obey the</hi> Turks; for by our ſo doing, we got over them: For when they ſaw our great Diligence, it made them the more careleſs of, and favourable to us. So when they had taken ſome ſmall Matter of what we were laden withal, ſome went on Board their own Ship again, and eight <hi>Turks</hi> ſtay'd with us. Then began I to think of the Maſter, and the other four, which were in the <hi>Turks</hi> Ship; for as for my ſelf, and the others with me, I had no Fear at all; nay, I was ſo far from it, that I ſaid to one of our Men, <hi>Were but the Maſter on Board, and the reſt of our Men, if there were twice as many</hi> Turks, <hi>I ſhould not fear them.</hi> For my earneſt Deſire was to the Lord, that he would put it into their Hearts to ſend them on Board; and good was the Lord, in anſwering my Deſire; for it was as a Seal to what he before had ſpoke thro' me, and in me. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the Maſter was ſent on Board, with the reſt of our Men. Then all Manner of Fear was off me, as to going to <hi>Algier;</hi> and ſome ſaid to me, <hi>I was a ſtrange Man, I was afraid before we were taken, but now I was not.</hi> My Anſwer was, <hi>I now believe I ſhall not go to</hi> Algier, <hi>and if you will be ruled by me, I will act for your Delivery, as well
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002654_0039_0FE5DB92AFED7090"/>
as any own;</hi> but as yet I ſaw no Way for it, for they were all arm'd, and we without Arms. Now we being all together, except the Maſter, I began to reaſon with them: <hi>What if we ſhould overcome the</hi> Turks, <hi>and go to</hi> May-York? At which they very much rejoyced; and one ſaid, <hi>I will kill one or two;</hi> and another ſaid, <hi>I will cut as many of their Throats as you will have me:</hi> This was our Men's Anſwer; at which I was much troubled, and ſaid to them, <hi>If I know any of you that offers to touch a</hi> Turk, <hi>I will tell the</hi> Turks <hi>my ſelf:</hi> But I ſaid to them, <hi>If you will be ruled, I will act for you; if not, I will be ſtill:</hi> Then they agreed to do what I would have them. Then ſaid I, <hi>If the</hi> Turks <hi>bid you do any Thing, do it without grumbling, and with as much Diligence and Quickneſs as you can; for that pleaſes them, and that will cauſe them to let us be together:</hi> to which they agreed. Then I went to our Maſter, who was a Friend and a very bold-ſpirited Man, and told him our Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whoſe Anſwer to me was, <hi>If we offer'd to riſe, and they overcame us, we had as good be burnt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</hi> The which I knew very well: But I could get him no Way to adhere to me, in that he was fearful of Bloodſhed, for that was his Reaſon: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that at laſt I told him, <hi>we were reſolv'd, and I queſtion'd not but to do it, without one Drop of Bloodſhed;</hi> and I believed that the Lord would proſper it, by reaſon I could rather go to <hi>Algier,</hi> than to kill one <hi>Turk.</hi> So at laſt he agreed to this, to let me do what I would, provided we killed none. At that Time, there being ſtill two <hi>Turks</hi> lying in the Cabin with him; ſo he was to lie in the Cabin, that by his being there, they ſhould miſtruſt nothing: which accordingly he did; and having bad Weather, and loſt the Company of the Man of War, which thing I much deſired; the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing our Diligence, made them careleſs of us.</p>

            <p>Then ſaid I to the Men of our Veſſel, <hi>Now we have the</hi> Turks <hi>at our Command, no Man ſhall hurt any of them; for if you do, I will be againſt you; but this we will do, now they are under Deck, we will keep them ſo, and go for</hi> May-York. So when I had ordered ſome to keep the Doors, leſt any ſhould come out, ſtrictly charging 'em not to ſpill Blood; and ſo order'd our Courſe for <hi>May-York;</hi> the which in the Morning we were near. Then my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to our Men was, if any offer'd to come out, not to let above one or two at a Time; and one came out expecting to have ſeen his own Country; but to the contrary, it was <hi>May-York:</hi> Then ſaid I to our Men, <hi>Be careful of the Door, for when he goes in, we ſhall ſee what they will do:</hi> And as ſoon as he told them, we were going towards <hi>May-York,</hi> they, inſtead of Riſing, fell all to Crying; for their Courage was taken from them, and they deſired that they might not be ſold; which I promiſed they ſhould not; and ſo ſoon as I had pacified them, I went into the Cabin to our Maſter, he not knowing what was done and ſo he told their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>That we had overcome his Men, and were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for</hi> May-York: At which unexpected News he wept; and deſired the Maſter not to ſell him; which he promiſed he would not. Then we told the Captain, we would make a Place to hide them in, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould not find them; at which they were very glad, and we did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

            </p>
            <p>But he look'd upon us as Fools, becauſe we would not ſell them; which I would not have done for the whole Iſland: But contrary to our Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he told the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who threatned to take them from us: But ſo ſoon as we heard thereof, we call'd up the <hi>Turks,</hi> and told them, <hi>They muſt help us, or the</hi> Spaniards <hi>would take them from us:</hi> So they reſolvedly helped us, and we made all Haſte to run from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> which pleaſed the <hi>Turks</hi> very well.

The before-mentioned Paſſage, was the firſt Time of Reſiſtance, for what was done towards the <hi>Turks</hi> before, was done by fair Means or Threats; not Violence; for I took great Care of them.
