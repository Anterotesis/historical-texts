            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Some of the moſt offenſive parts of this letter were recited in the indictment of Lyon, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of which (i. e. the reading the whole letter to large collections of people in a great many towers in his diſtrict, drawn together for the purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e) was the ſubject of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> count, and the "printing" it of the <hi>third</hi> count in the indictment.—[The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>first</hi> count was a letter from Lyon to Mr. Spooner, the printer of the Windſor paper.]</p>
            <p>Lyon told the court that the firſt knowledge he had of it was hearing general <hi>Mason,</hi> a ſenator from Virginia, read it to a number of gentlemen in Philadelphia laſt ſummer; that he applied to Mr. <hi>Baldwin,</hi> to whom it was addreſſed, for liberty to take a copy it, to which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e conſented, upon condition that Lyon ſhould ſhew it to his friends in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, particularly governor Robinſon and general Bradley, but not to ſuffer any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of it to be taken, nor to have it printed, to which Lyon ſaid he ſolemnly agreed.— How he came to <hi>print</hi> it in fact, however, in violation of his "ſolemn agreement," he did not inform the court.</p>
            <p>Several gentlemen who have ſeen it, and who are acquainted with Mr. Barlow, have expreſſed their decided opinions that he never wrote it. The public may reſt aſſured, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the thing, infamous as it is, was really written by <hi>Joel Barlow,</hi> and ſent by the hand of a Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> to <hi>Abraham Baldwin.</hi> The moſt indiſputable teſtimony of the fact can be laid before the public if neceſſary.— Thoſe who recollect what Mr. Barlow <hi>once was</hi>—thoſe who <hi>once</hi> reſpected and loved him for his amiable diſpoſitions, his talents, and his ſuppoſed pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They will diſcover new evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if poſſible, of the accurſed demoralizing powers of that modern French philoſophy which has made of Europe a charnel houſe, and which Mr Barlow has been long known to have embraced with enthuſiaſtic ardor.

But it often happens, in public as well as in private affairs, that the greateſt injuries are forgiven or excuſed, while ſlighter ones, ſuch as border on contempt, excite the moſt ungovernable reſentment, and lead to the greateſt acts of vengeance; a ſtriking example of this has fallen under my obſervation in the conduct of theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics: at the moment when the old gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of France was ſhaken to its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the new government of the United States was conſolidated and was beginning its operations under the moſt favorable auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices. A great revolution in America had completed its work, it convinced the world of the ſolidity of its principles, and held up to view an unexampled proſpect of public happineſs. A much greater revolution in France was opening its career. Its authors and conductors, though frightened at the imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The conduct of <hi>C. Genet,</hi> a ſubject of ſo much triumph to your cabinet and that of St. James's, was one of the cauſes that ſaved you from a war at that time.

            <p>When after every remonſtrance, and a formal demand from this government your executive was pleaſed to remove Morris from his oſtenſible ſituation in Paris, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrated, that is, he went and joined the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrants in Germany, and has been ever ſince among the enemies of France.

This and other circumſtances have given full credit to the opinion here, that a journey which Morris took from London to Berlin, in the year 1796, was a miſſion on the part of the Britiſh government to engage the king of Pruſſia to rejoin the coalition againſt France. Another fact, though of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, could not eſcape the animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the French government. John Pariſh, American conſul at Hamburg, was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Engliſh government as their agent for tranſmitting the ſubſidies and loans, to the Emperor, and the King of Pruſſia, for the war againſt France; and to freight and fit out veſſels for the tranſporting troops to the Weſt-Indies. It may be ſaid that the American government were not anſwerable for a thing of this ſort, of which they could have no knowledge; but this has not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the fact from being recognized among the proofs of an unfriendly diſpoſition on your ſide, and certainly great allowances ought to be made for the jealouſy of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The ſentiments of theſe two men were not yet known here; thoſe of the people were not yet known, becauſe it was ſuppoſed that the general idolatry for Waſhington had prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from being freely uttered; theſe were the reaſons why the Directory determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take no decided ſtep in conſequence of Monroe's recal, until the public voice ſhould decide between theſe two candidates. <hi>This accounts for the interest which the French seemed to take in the event of that election.

            <p>When the election of Adams was announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced here, it produced the order of the 2d of March, which was meant to be little ſhort of a declaration of war; but it was ſo far ſhort of it as to leave room on your ſide to come forward with an additional project of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, if you wiſhed to avoid that calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
            <p>The enmity of the old Preſident towards France, was now conſidered as nationalized in America, and the government here was determined to fleece you of your property, to a ſufficient degree to bring you to your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the only nerve in which it was preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſenſibility lay, which was your pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary intereſt.</p>
            <p>This uncomplying diſpoſition of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory induced Mr. Adams to call an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meeting of Congreſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to make a ſpeech.</p>
            <p>To a man who had the leaſt pretenſions to prudence, there were but two courſes to be taken; one was to declare war if he wiſhed to ruin his country; the other was, if he wiſhed to ſave it, to offer to negociate by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome man or men that he knew would be agreeable to France; or, at leaſt, not to play the bully, by forcing a man back, who had juſt been driven out of Paris. The true policy would have been, to retrieve the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Waſhington, by ſending back Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe. You cannot imagine the effect produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here by the name only of a known friend to liberty in America. A report prevailed here for a few days, that Madiſon was nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this miſſion;—it almoſt diſarmed the government of all reſentment. Had the the news proved true, and Madiſon arrived, the buſineſs would have been ſettled in 24 hours.</p>
            <p>But Adams to attain his object, whatever it might be, found out a third courſe, which diſcovers more invention than I ſuppoſed him to poſſeſs: he formed a commiſſion of three to make the people of the United States believe that a negociation was offered on their part, and then filled it up with names from which there could not be the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſucceſs. The firſt was a man who had juſt been refuſed, and could not be offered again without an inſult: ſending him back, was undoubtedly intended as an inſult, and it was ſo received: the ſecond was a man whoſe effigy had been burnt in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, for his violent defence of the Britiſh treaty—at leaſt it was ſo reported and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved here: the third was a little <hi>make-weight</hi> man, appointed with the intention that he ſhould have no influence:—and yet, to prove to you the facility of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after all that had paſſed, I am able to aſſure you, from the beſt authority, that if Gerry had been ſent alone, and not ſhackled with the other two, the directory would have negociated with him, without any difficulty; at preſent, the three have been here five months, without being received or rejected; and a new law is made, by which an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal number of neutral veſſels will fall into the hands of the French.</p>
            <p>I ſhall hardly gain credit with you were I to ſtate on how ſmall a pivot the fate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions turns in Paris at this moment.</p>
            <p>The ſpeech of John Adams, at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Congreſs in November, was waited for here with as much expectation as if peace or war depended upon it. It was hoped that after he had ſent his commiſſioners, he would at leaſt avoid the uſe of inſulting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage againſt the nation with whom he was pretending to treat. But when we found him borrowing the language of Edmund Burke, and telling the world that, although he ſhould ſucceed in treating with the French, there was no dependence to be placed on any of their engagements; that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality were at an end; that they had turned pirates and plunderers, and it would be neceſſary to be perpetually armed againſt them, though you were at peace— we wondered that the anſwer of both houſes had not been an order to ſend him to a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. Inſtead of this, the Senate have echoed the ſpeech with more ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lity than ever George the third experienced from either houſe of Parliament. Read over the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph that ſpeaks of France; his bringing in of the word Europe, under pretence of generalizing it, is ſo flimſy a cover for his attack on thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nation, that it only adds to the abuſe, by attempting to impoſe on the underſtanding; he certainly could not mean the Engliſh, for he brags in the next para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph how well they keep their treaty. He could certainly mean nobody but the French, for no other nation have overturned religion. Had this ſpeech borne a friendly aſpect, or had the paragraph in queſtion been ſimilar to the one inſerted in the ſpeech of governor M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fflin, on the ſame ſubject, it would have facilitated the negociation, and probably ſaved millions to the United States.</p>
            <p>In enumerating the cauſes which have brought the two republics to the brink of war, ſeveral memorable ſpeeches in your houſe of repreſentatives, muſt not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. One of your orators calls the French government a <hi>five headed monster</hi>—another ſays, Barras, when he pronounced his farewell ſpeech to Monroe, muſt have been drunk or mad. Theſe gentlemen forget that Barras reads their ſpeeches; and that the five head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed monſter, when it ſhall have devoured the fry of Europe, may poſſibly ſhark them in their turn.</p>
            <p>Another ſubject of complaint, and that not the leaſt, is the ſcurrility of many of your newſpapers, againſt the republic: among the moſt abuſive i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES, which is conſidered here as an official paper, or printed under the eye and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the government. The office of foreign affairs receives theſe papers regularly; and you cannot ſuppoſe that any of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults paſs unnoticed. It is remarked here, and with great truth, that there is more dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty calumny againſt the French in American than in the London papers.</p>
            <p>But it is in vain to amuſe ourſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the nature of the diſeaſe, unleſs there be a remedy within our reach. In my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there is one, but I have ſcarcely any hope that you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wiſe men will ſtumble upon it. Acknowledge your error in ſending Pinckney and Marſhall to this country;— recall them, and perhaps Gerry with them— name and ſend Madiſon or Monroe to take their place, and let the Preſident in his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Senate acknowledging the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, utter ſentiments full of friendſhip to the French nation, government, and cauſe— let him acknowledge that the principles of liberty are equally dear to the two countries —and deprecate the idea of gratifying the tyrants of the world, by exhibiting the two great republics, whoſe exiſtence they ſtrove in vain to prevent, now tearing out each others vitals.</p>
            <p>I perceive that much ſtreſs is laid by your Preſident, and your other leaders, on the conduct of this Government, in refuſing to receive your ambaſſador Pinckney. I wiſh thoſe gentlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n could ſome how or other be made acquainted with the following hiſtory. I hope you will not ſuppoſe, by inſerting it here, my intention is to juſtify the French government: No, my object will be truly to ſerve my country, and to vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of all the ardent ſpirits among you, if they ſhould neglect this opportunity of going to war for the three broken wheels of Gen. Pinckney's carriage.</p>
            <p>In the year 1796, the Swediſh ambaſſador here, the Baron de Stahl, obtained leave of abſence, and preſented his ſecretary as charge d'affaires, who had the king's commiſſion for that purpoſe. This man was refuſed, on which de Stahl preſented a note to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of foreign relations, deſiring him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the reaſons, that the king might know in what he had offended the republic, ſince he had been the firſt in Europe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and the moſt ardent to deſerve its friendſhip. The anſwer to this note was, an order to the new charge d'affaires to quit the republic, and a recall of the French am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from Stockholm. As ſoon as cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers could paſs to Sweden and back, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was accommodated, by the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Baron de Stahl, who was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the French.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time the Ambaſſador of Tuſcany, while in peaceable exerciſe of his functions, was ordered by the government to quit Paris in 24 hours, and the republic in 8 days, without any reaſons aſſigned. He obeyed, and the Grand Duke very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſantly ſent another.</p>
            <p>The ambaſſadors of Portugal and Rome, who were in full credence and activity a few weeks ago, are now in priſon in Paris. It is true that this was in conſequence of a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between this government and each of theirs. But the fate of agents in ſuch caſes, uſed to be, to be ſent away, and not to be impriſoned.</p>
            <p>The king of Spain lately ſent a new ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador here, in great pomp, who is refuſed, and ordered to quit the country, without reaſons publicly aſſigned.</p>
            <p>You will remark, that in this light the Spaniſh and Swediſh are caſes in point, for your Pinckney. But their poor Kings had not learned the etiquette of John Adams, to name and ſend back the ſame man who had been refuſed. Kings, at this day, have no notion of a rupture with France.</p>
            <p>Another event has lately happened to the Baron de Stahl, which makes the Swediſh caſe, taken altogether, different from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican. (God grant that the American may never come to it, as long as you have loving couples to ſend on theſe miſſions.) The wife of Baron Stahl is juſt ſent out of the republic on a ſuſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hear none of your wicked bachelors remark, that this order was ſolicited by the huſband; no ſuch reaſon is aſſigned. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had the Baron obtained the order, he ought to have obtained leave to clamor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it afterwards; decency ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and yet he has not done it. Had it been an American ambaſſador, and had the American been me, I ſhould have tried hard to get my caſe inſerted in a ſpeech of John Adams, or a letter of Timothy Pickering. I repeat to you, that I am not undertaking the hopeleſs and uſeleſs taſk of vindicating all the meaſures that the violent convulſions of the revolution have induced this people to adopt. But when Mr. Adams ſhall hear of the ſending away of his ambaſſador, I would adviſe him, and all thoſe who are concerned in his wounded honor, to club that commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity with the kings, princes, and ſtates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, and to try to bear their part with a patience becoming a government that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your three commiſſioners will doubtleſs ſeize this occaſion, by Mr. Lee, to forward their diſpatches. Theſe will probably be of a nature to induce the Preſident to take ſome deciſive ſtep; and I am in trembling expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſeeing him give another deſperate leap into the regions of madneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
