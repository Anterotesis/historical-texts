            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have the Hiſtory of <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>'s Reign in this, and in the Three foregoing Chapters: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on the Throne of his Father, (as we read <hi>Chapt.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) He ſets himſelf betimes to ſeek the LORD God of his Father, and to promote the Work of Reformation in <hi>Judah</hi>; GOD was pleaſed to own him in this work, and to crown him with Riches &amp; Honour; (<hi>Ver</hi> 5, 6.) ſo that the fear of him fell on the Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; they bring him Preſents and pay him
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002232_0004_0FDAD42F8430D0A0"/>
Tribute, (<hi>Ver.</hi> 11) Hence we might note; That the beſt way for Princes when they come to Sit on the Throne to Provide for their own Honour and ſafety &amp; for the good of their People, is to begin with matters of Religion. If a People over whom they Rule be grown Corrupt the beſt way they can take to make their Reign Long and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, is to ſet about the Work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the firſt place. We Read of his care for the Safety of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and his doing much Buſineſs in <hi>Judah,</hi> by Building <hi>Caſtles and Citys of Store</hi> in it, (<hi>Ver</hi> 12,) and <hi>Placing his Men of War</hi> in the Fenced Citys, to the end of the Chapter. Hence note; That Religion is no hindrance to Worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Men may be concerned for the one &amp; not neglect the other. <hi>Subordinata non puga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>; Both theſe Ends may be purſued to good Advantage by the Heads and Rulers of a People: But alas! The Brighteſt Suns have their Spots, and the Beſt of Men have their Defects. We Read of an Error in, his Conduct in the beginning of the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Joyning in Affinity with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and going up with him to <hi>Ramoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

large in the Eighteenth Chapter. We Read of his Returning in Safety to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> (<hi>Chapt.</hi> I9. <hi>Ver</hi> 1.) And of his being Reproved by <hi>Jehu</hi> the Son of <hi>Hanani</hi> the Seer for what he had done (<hi>Ver.</hi> 2) After this he Viſits the Kingdom from one end of it to the other, the better to know the ſtate of his People, and further to Reform what he found to be Amiſs among them, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and make up what might be wanting. We Read of his ſetting Judges in the Land throughout all the Fenced Citys of <hi>Judah,</hi> and giving them a Solemn Charge (<hi>Ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7) So of his ſetting Officers over the Houſe of the Lord, to inſpect the Service, Worſhip and Government of it, (<hi>Ver.</hi> 8.) And of his giving them their Reſpective Charges and Directions to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>[But however the Prophet had told him of his Error in Uniting with <hi>Ahab</hi> and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting him that was Gods open and Avowed Enemy, and that for this there was wrath upon him from before the Lord, <hi>i e.</hi> God was Angry for it, and would give ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Teſtimony againſt him for it in the way of his Providence.]</p>
            <p>Now the beginning of this Twentieth Chapter in which the Text is contained, ſeems to have ſome reſpect to that Rebuke
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002232_0006_0FDAD4359FEAE218"/>
&amp; Threatning; as if God were about to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil &amp; to accompliſh it; for we read here that the Men of <hi>Moab, Ammon and Mount Scir,</hi> a Numerous Baud are Combined againſt him; upon the Report of this he is ſore afraid; ſets himſelf to Seek the Lord, and Proclaims a Faſt throughout all <hi>Judah,</hi> (<hi>Ver.</hi> 3, 4.) We read of his Prayer in the Audience of the Congregation, (from the 5 <hi>Ver. to the</hi> 12 <hi>Ver. incluſively.</hi>) So of the Anſwer and the great Overthrow of his Enemies Conſequent upon it (from the 14. <hi>Ver. to the</hi> 25. <hi>Ver.</hi>) The People of <hi>Judah</hi> are much Affected with this Signal Salvation wrought for them by the Mighty Hand of God; So that they Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelves in the Valley of <hi>Berachah</hi> to Bleſs the Lord, (<hi>Ver.</hi> 26.) We Read of their Triumphant Return to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (<hi>Ver.</hi> 27, 28) This great Overthrow wrought by the Hand of the Lord, ſtrikes a Dread into the Enemies of <hi>Judah</hi>; So that the Realm has Reſt and Quiet round about: And the Chapter Concludes the Scene of his Happy Reign, for we Read of his Death and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial in the beginning of the next:</p>
            <p>Yet in the Cloſe of all, his Imperfection as noted in Two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In this, <hi>That he did not Compleat the Work of Reformation.</hi>

               </gap>her <hi>Ahab</hi>: For this God is Angry, &amp; the Meaſures concerted between them are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. [See this from <hi>Ver.</hi> 35. to the end of the Chapter.] But my work is to Conſider his Failing in the firſt Head, (<hi>Ver.</hi> 33) In the Words note then theſe two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That though Jehoſaphat went a great way in the work of Reformation, yet he was not Able to go through with it</hi>: Inſtance is given where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he Failed; We are told, <hi>He walked in the ways of Aſa his Father,</hi> (Ver. 32.) And <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from it, doing that which was right in the ſight of the Lord; howbeit the high places were not taken away.</hi> By high Places in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Speech, we Underſtand the Hills, High Grounds, places of the Earth above others; and the Original Word will bear this ſenſe, it ſignifies in its Primitive the Height of any thing, as the Top of Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, &amp;c. And is here Metonimically uſed to Expreſs the Altars Erected in ſuch Places for Sacrifice, or any Images ſet up in them for Religious Worſhip, or their Worſhiping the True God in ſuch places from a Corrupt Conformity to the Heathen: We read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Heathen Nations that they had <hi>Many gods</hi> or Subordinate Deities; they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002232_0008_0FDAD43B4D61A8C0"/>
Limited them to particular Kingdoms, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Hills, Groves, &amp;c Agreeable to this noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſet up their Temples, Chappels or Altars for Worſhip, in their Reſpective Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Now the Men of <hi>Iſrael and Judah</hi> had learnt their way and were very hardly brought off from it: Hence tis noted as a Failure in him and ſome other of the Pious Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ſet to Reform the People: though they did many things in the Work yet here they Failed and came ſhort. But here ſeems to ariſe a Difficulty to Reconcile the Text, with <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. For there we Read, that <hi>he took away the high places and the groves out of Judah.</hi> Two Things are offered to Reconcile the Texts.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That he took them away in part, but not in whole; only ſuch where Images were Worſhiped.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) They might be taken away in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign and be ſet up a new in the latter part of it; when the King was grown into Years, and not ſo well Able to look after the ſtate of the People, or elſe was now grown more Remiſs in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note the Ground of this; <hi>For as yet the People had not Prepared their Hearts to the God of their Fathers</hi>: They had not got their Hearts Acted and Prepared for this Work,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002232_0009_0FDAD43CBA8B3A78"/>
ſo as to purſue it, &amp; to go thro' with it. The Word in its root ſignifies to Fit, Form, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, Confirm, &amp;c. Tis ſometimes taken in an Ill ſenſe and points out the Judgments of God, ready to be brought on Wicked Men, which he has fitted for them, Pſal. 7.13. <hi>He hath prepared for him the Instruments of Death,</hi> &amp;c. And tis no more than what a Sinning People have cauſe to expect, if they prove Incorrigible for all the means uſed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and to Amend them. <hi>Judah</hi> is here Blam'd, and not the King in the Caſe; they were not Prepared and ſteadily bent to Seek the Lord God of their Fathers in Sincerity; and to Conform to him in every thing, without any Reſerve. They would Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the True God, yet not be Confin'd to the Temple, but for Convenience, Eaſe, and from Affection to their Ancient Cuſtom, would yet Worſhip him in the High Places. This <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> was Forced to Connive at, or was not Able to Redreſs. Antiquity is very Venerable in matters of Religion, and proves many times a good Paſs-port for Error: their Diſeaſe was very Inveterate and hard to be Cured. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23 Beſides there might need Prudence to be uſed here (as in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Weight) to carry on the Work by degrees; leaſt by driving too faſt, he ſhould beget ſtrong Prejudices in the People
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002232_0010_0FDAD43D8D6104B0"/>
againſt it. And ſo he might loſe the ground that he had gained.</p>
            <p>From the Words thus Opened, we may note this Doctrine.</p>

               <hi>DOCT</hi> That however, Pious Rulers may be Spirited for the Work of Reformation; tis not to be Expected they ſhould go through with the Work, except the Heart of the People be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and Diſpoſed for it.</p>
            <p>Tis given as the Reaſon in the Text, why King Jehoſaphat came ſhort in the Work and did not finiſh it, tho' a Man of Spirit and Reſolution for the Work: even becauſe the Heart of the People was not touched aright, caſt into Gods Mould, ſo as to ſeek him in Sincerity, their Heart was not right with God: Hence Obedience was Partial and Feigned, now wherein twas Agreeable to their Intereſt, Temper and Humour, they were ready to Conform; but wherein Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, Cuſtom, Particular Affection did Oppoſe, Prejudice Weighed the Ballance to the Contrary ſide, and there was nothing more to be done.</p>
            <p>In the Handling of the Doctrine, I ſhall Labour to give ſome Anſwer to theſe two Enquiries:</p>

            <p>Of theſe in Order:</p>

The like is Noted of the Judgments of God upon them at times, tho' Compar'd <hi>to the Light that goeth

forth,</hi> Hoſ. 6.5. Speedy in their motions, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in their operations; yet they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the impetuous motion of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affections, headlong into Sin without uſing the power of Self-reflection God had given them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8 6. The ſame ſpirit Chriſt Himſelf notes in the <hi>Jews</hi> in his day, That they ſhut their Eyes againſt the light, &amp; did very much oppoſe the Means of Conviction from a love to their Luſts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 19 But now when they are brought to ſee the need they ſtand in of Conviction, and to uſe the means for this end; to ſubmit to Duty, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on their ways, they may be ſaid in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to be prepared for the work: Jer. 2.23. <hi>See thy way in the valley, and know what 'tis thou haſt done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When they have any clear Conviction.</hi> When they are brought not only to ſubmit to the means of Conviction, but Warnings, Reproofs, Threatnings and Judgments have been ſet home, ſo as to give them ſome diſtinct view of their evil ways &amp; corrupt carriages, they now lie fair for a Reformation; When a People ſee their Pride, Murmurings, Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Injuſtice, Covetouſneſs, Formality in Religion, viſible Contempt of God's Word &amp; Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is now ſome ground to hope theſe &amp; other Sins they are guilty of may come to be Reformed. A People under
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002232_0013_0FDAD44914B75070"/>
this Conviction when call'd upon to Return, will know wherein they ought to Return. Particular Perſons are in the way to Reform when they fall under clear and ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; and 'tis ſo with the Body of a People. Hence <hi>Searching &amp; Trying</hi> as the means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is ſpoken of by the Church, as ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to her <hi>turning to the Lord,</hi> Lam. 3.40</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When they ſee their way of Sin to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive &amp; Ruinous to them.</hi> A Sinning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whilſt ſecure are very apt to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ward off Threatnings &amp; to fence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Judgments. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. &amp; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15 Tis the frame of Particular Perſons in a ſtate of carnal Security; and 'tis the frame of the Body of a People, till God comes to Convince &amp; Awaken them; They ſee not the deadly and fatal tendency of their ways: But now when God will Reform &amp; Amend them, He ſhews them their way is not ſafe but danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that 'tis not the way to Proſper, but 'tis the way to Deſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.16. And by this means he checks them in their Career, &amp; makes them afraid of their Courſe. There is a natural dread of Miſery in every man: hence men muſt Think of turning their way when they ſee it leads to Ruine. We ſee this to be founded in the light of Reaſon, in the Inſtance given of the People of <hi>Nineveh</hi> when threatned with ſudden Deſtruction,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002232_0014_0FDAD44A579C5B78"/>
they are brought by it to Reform &amp; to Cry mightily to God for Mercy, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When they ſee they are in the way to be a happy People, upon their Reformation &amp; Return to God.</hi> A Sinning People bro't into Diſtreſs by Sickneſs, Poverty, Famine, Sword, Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Uſury, Injuſtice, Opreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they be not quite paſt feeling, they are wont to ſhew an Uneaſy Spirit; They want to have theſe Evils removed &amp; to be bro't into good Circumſtances, but they ſee not how 'tis to be brought about by a better Regard to the Rules of Religion, they be not convict that the Evils bro't upon them are the fruit of their corrupt Carriages; Hence ſee not that Reformation is the way to Proſper; they can't ſee their Happineſs to be ſecured by their being a Religious People; ſome that are better than others fare no better than others but worſe in ſome reſpects, according to that remark. <hi>He that departeth from evil maketh himſelf a prey,</hi> Iſa. 59.15.

            </p>
            <p>Queſt II. <hi>Whence is it we are not to expect that Pious Rulers, however ſpirited for the work, ſhould be able to go through with it, except the Heart of the People be prepar'd for it?</hi> To this I Anſwer in Two things, which may ſerve to clear up the Doctrine and to ſet forth the ground &amp; reaſon of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe there be many Sins that will eſcape their Notice &amp; Obſervation.</hi> If they be very curious &amp; wakeful in their Remarks, yet there will be many deeds of Darkneſs that will eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape their notice: There will be ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, Uncleaneſſ, Wantoneſs, Injuſtice, Lying, Forgery, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 8.12 <hi>Seeſt thou what they do in the dark?</hi> Hence if there be good Laws made for the curbing Men from Sin &amp; the Executive Power be lodged in the Hands of thoſe that are men of Spirit &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for the work: they can't uſe it for the Correcting ſuch Secret Wickedneſs, The
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002232_0016_0FDAD45005929708"/>
fear of Puniſhment will curb men from the open Acts of Sin; but men will be getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſecret Corners, &amp; there carrying on their Wicked Deſigns: Beſides, ſome Actions not Private in their nature, will be kept from the Cognizance of the Judge, for the want of juſt &amp; timous Information. Men under Oath at ſuch a time to make due Preſentment of breaches of Law, won't have that Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regard to their Duty as they ought to have: Men called in as Witneſſes before the Judge, againſt the Criminal, will be very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to do their duty; they will trifle at a ſtrange rate with a ſolemn Oath, rather than diſguſt a Friend or diſoblige a good Nei'bor: and there may be this temptation too to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it in ſome even a conſcience of guilt. That they are chargeable with the ſame Crime, &amp; there only needs Complaint or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be made againſt them in order to their being call'd in Queſtion; which their Neighbours will be ſure to make (being privy to the matter) if they don't favour them as much as poſſible in the Caſe depending Now if the Sins of a People don't come under the Notice of Rulers, they are not in the way to Reform and Amend them. Now ſuch Sins involve a People in Guilt, and lay them open to the Judgments of God, if they be very great, of a deep dye; become general; and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002232_0017_0FDAD4510E7E9240"/>
are not ſo properly Secret, but are kept hid from Publick Cenſure by the Countenance or Connivance of others; and there is not that care taken as might be to cut off the occaſion of them: To this ſome Judicious Divines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the inſtance of <hi>Achan, Joſh.</hi> 7.11. And we have a like obſervation, 2 <hi>King</hi> 17.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard at ſuch a time a People are guilty of many Sins which Rulers are not able to Reform, tho' they do come under their Notice &amp; Observation.</hi> The carriage of a People may be ſuch as may provoke God to anger many ways, &amp; expoſe them to the Judgments of God ;and yet their Actions not be Cenſurable by Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Rulers. 'Tis eaſy, for inſtance, to obſerve a great deal of Pride in the Geſture &amp; Attire of a People; irreverent Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Superiors; a great deal of Worldlineſs &amp; Covetouſneſs; that the Heart of a People is gone off from God &amp; gone after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that they are much more concerned about getting Land &amp; Money &amp; Stock, than they be about getting Religion revived, and ſecuring the Salvation of their Souls. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, A great deal of Coidneſs &amp; Formality in Religion, Contempt caſt upon the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship &amp; Ordinances of God; a great deal of precious Time ſpent in a vain unprofitable way; much Injuſtice &amp; Diſhoneſty in dealing, pinching on the ſtraights and neceſſities of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002232_0018_0FDAD45650716D48"/>
men; ſo of the working of a Froward, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and Repining Spirit; for which the Land Mourns, And God is greatly diſpleaſed with a People for ſuch ſins as theſe are, &amp; yet theſe things are not Cenſurable Evils in the Civil Government, nor yet in the Churches of God And there are theſe two Reaſons to be given of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Becauſe they are ſo General.</hi> Corrupt Practiſes that are not of the groſſeſt nature, they grow to be general in a time of publick declenſion among a profeſſing People; ſo tis with the Sin of Covetouſneſs, there is a vein of it to be ſeen in all Ranks &amp; Orders of men, <hi>Jer</hi> 6.13. <hi>Ezek</hi> 33.21. Sometimes the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of a People ſhew it ſelf in a Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Complaining ſpirit againſt GOD thoſe he has ſet over them in place of Rule; now this diſpleaſes God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.1. But the Sin being general, there is nothing to be done by Rulers in a Coerſive way to reſtrain it; the Sin is general and being ſupported by men of influence the power of Rulers is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to check it, So 'twas with <hi>Corah</hi> &amp; his Accomplices; they were mighty men, Men of renown in the Congregation; they durſt to withſtand <hi>Moſes &amp; Aaron</hi> God's Miniſters to their faces and doubtleſs had made a ſad overture among the People had not the Lord ſignally appeared for the help &amp; vindication
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002232_0019_0FDAD424767BF3C8"/>
of his Servants, by the terrible deſtruction bro't on the Heads of the Rebellion, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3, 33, 34 The like I might obſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pride, Intemperance, Injuſtice, and Oppreſſive Dealing, when once they come to be general among a People; when Vice comes to be general, &amp; tis abetted by men of power &amp; influence, it now grows fierce &amp; rampant as a lion; and there is little to be done by Rulers to tame it: the torrent of Sin is now grown ſo mighty that the power of Rulers can do but little to ſtem it: Hence they ſit down now &amp; grow diſcouraged, <hi>Moſes</hi> does ſo when the weight &amp; burden of the People lay upon him, tho' a man of extraordinary Grace &amp; Gifts, &amp; favoured at times with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Aſſistance in his work, See his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in the caſe, Numb 11 14. <hi>I am not able to bear all this People alone, becauſe it is too heavy for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe there is ſo much pleaded in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them.</hi> A People grown corrupt in general, they come to be bold &amp; daring; they will (to be ſure ſome among them now <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Sin as Sodom &amp; hide it not,</hi> Iſa. 3 9. They will ſet up &amp; juſtify ſome things very corrupt; they will plead in the defence of a Worldly Covetous ſpirit, under the colour or ſpecious pretence of Prudence, Diligence, Frugality, Neceſſity <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When times are hard
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002232_0020_0FDAD45B93AE44E0"/>
&amp; difficult, now the law of Self-preſervation calls for it; 'tis needful in order to their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and the maintenance of their Families. So the intemperate and inordinate uſe of the Creature, 'tis covered under a Plea of lawful Chriſtian liberty. The corrupt Affections of men now greatly darken 'em, that they can't judge aright of things. Pride, Paſſion, Envy, Hatred, regard to Credit, Profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet men on work to deviſe Arguments to defend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Actions; and ſerve greatly to prejudice them againſt what is offer'd to ſhow ſuch practiſes to be Unjuſtifiable. Some actions that men will own to be ſinful, <hi>in ſe</hi>; &amp; cry out of as ſuch, they aſſert them to be lawful, <hi>

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002232_0021_0FDAD45FD9216150"/>
to give them any Conviction in the caſe; if a People have ſufficient Light held forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, they won't receive it, See it in them, Mal. 3.7. —<hi>Wherein ſhall we return?</hi> But I proceed to the Uſe of the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE, I <hi>Hence tis an Error, when the work of Reformation don't go on, preſently to cry out of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; and to ſay, tis becauſe they don't do what they can in the work.</hi> A People are apt to err here &amp; the Religious part of them too; they complain of the Sins of the times; ſay there is a great deal of Pride, Contention, Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Intemperance, Lying, Deceit, Cheating, Oppreſſion, Idleneſs, Sabbath-prophanation, Neglect of God's Houſe and Worſhip to be ſeen among us; Sins teſtified againſt Year after Year by the Lord's Meſſengers; and what have been often mentioned from this awful Desk in this Anniverſary Solemnity: But ſtill there is no change; the Complaint is the ſame; we are ſaid to be yet <hi>in a Dying Languiſhing way.</hi> Now what's the Reaſon? Now ſome preſently run here, <hi>Rulers be not ſpirited for the work</hi>; they don't lead out in it; <hi>Miniſters be not ſo Zealous for the work as they ſhould be.</hi> But if there be a failure here in men of an higher Rank and Order, tis not wholly to be reſolved here that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done in a general way towards a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002232_0022_0FDAD46255CA3770"/>
now this is clear from theſe Two things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>In that a ſinning People may Reform in many things if Rulers fail in point of Duty</hi> Were a People ſpirited for the work, they might do much to promote it. if they had not their direction and aſſiſtance in it from Rulers as might be deſir'd.

The like we might note of many other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt practiſes Men live in and allow of: The reaſon why they be not reformed, is not for the want of Ability, but for the want of a Diſpoſition; tho' I grant whenever Vicious Men do reform and amend, the preventing Grace of God is firſt to be seen in Convincing &amp; Awakening them to ſee the Evil of their way &amp; the deſtructive tendency of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2 19.

And here then give me leave (tho' unworthy to dictate any thing to you,) To Suggeſt one or two things relating to your Publick work as what may be proper to revive us in this our time of general Deadneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Do what in you lies in your miniſtry to reach the Conſciences of men</hi>: Regard this mainly in the choice of Subjects and in the method of handling them: In a corrupt time there is a great ſcarcity of Godly men among a People many are ſecure and faſt aſleep in Sin, they ſtand in great need of Terrour, &amp; are like to periſh and go down to Hell without it. In a Popular Audience Miniſters are not ſo much to Regard <hi>the Smoothneſs of Language, Exactneſs of ſtile,</hi> as the <hi>weight of their matter,</hi> the <hi>ſtrength &amp; pungency of their motives</hi>; At ſuch a time to play the Oratour is to amuſe the minds of men and to lull them into a ſtate of Indolence and Inſenſibility, the Wiſdom and Fidelity of Miniſters is ſeen at ſuch a time in ſpeaking piercing words to their hearers, Ecc. I2 II <hi>the words of the wiſe are as goads, &amp;c.</hi> Divine Truths are ſo Pure Sublime &amp; Spiritual as that they need not the Garniſhings of humane Eloquence to ſet them off; but they

appear moſt bright &amp; majeſtick in their native dreſs: The great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workman and knew well how to handle the Sword of the Spirit that is the Word of God, &amp; we find him (tho' on ſome ſpecial Occaſions ſpeaking much in the ſtile of an Orator, yet) when he comes to Preach CHRIST or the Terrors of the Law, he uſes <hi>all freedom and plainneſs of Speech.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4 &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Labour to open the nature of Converſion and to urge the Neceſſity of it upon your Hearers.</hi> A People in a corrupt time grow dark as to converſion work, few Experience it and ſuch as have it tis not in ſo diſtinct a way as is to be deſired, now Miniſters need to revive the Doctrine, to lend the People into the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it and to convince them of the abſolute neceſſity of it in order to Salvation; as Chriſt has taught, John 3 3. <hi>Except a man be Born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> Tis the way to have the Miniſtry crowned with Succeſs, and to take off the Prejudices of the People againſt it; Tis eaſy to obſerve a Spirit of Jealouſy prevailing in the People of this Land againſt the Miniſtry of it; Hence every Difference, though of a leſſer nature from the Primitive Conſtitution of theſe Churches, is Suſpected by ſome Religious and Holy men and cryed out againſt, as Innovation and a Degree of Declenſion and of Apoſtaſy, as the

way to inveſt the Miniſters with the Sole power of Church Government, and to cut off the Priviledge of the Brotherhood; a thing which that great Ornament of Piety and learning in this Land, <hi>viz</hi> Mr OAKES, took notice of and made a very cloſe Remark upon in his Election Sermon many Years paſt; And there is ſomething of the Leaven to be ſeen ſince if it has not been Growing: Now what is to be done for a Remedy in the caſe? Lets Labour to come up to and if possible to go beyond thoſe gone before us in a Spirit of Zeal for Practical &amp; Experimental Piety; And if God give ſucceſs it may tend to Convince men that God is with us, as with them; And that he has ſhewed to us ſomething of the form and faſhion of his houſe, as well as much of it to them; And that they did not in their Platform ſet up their Pillar of <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> and ſay to their Succeſſors, <hi>hitherto ſhall ye come &amp; no further</hi>; Theſe Renowned Patrons did Great and Wonderful things, and their Name is ever to be precious to us; their thoughts on Converſion Work have doubtleſs been Improved upon by ſome of a Refined tho't and great Experience ſince.

Let <hi>Parents and Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> then ſet to work: Our Families muſt be Nurſeries of <hi>Piety and Learning,</hi> in order to its going well with the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> See to the <hi>Education and Inſtruction of Children, and all under your Care</hi>: Reſolve with <hi>David, to walk before God in your Houſes with a perfect heart,</hi> Pſ. 101.2. Uſe your Authority to curb all under your care from Sin and Vanity. <hi>Perſonal and Family Reformation</hi> is neceſſary, in order to that which is <hi>Publick</hi>: And the work muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin here, if ever it comes to <hi>be General.</hi> See to it then that you put away Wickedneſs from your Tabernacle; Job II.I4. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwell in thy tabernacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By way of <hi>Motive</hi> to this Work, let us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe following things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:002232_0051_0FDAD4B26F4351C8"/>1. <hi>Tis in our power to reform many things that we know to be Amiſs.</hi> Many things are found amiſs among us that are very plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and none of us can have the face to ſay, tis not within our compaſs to reform them: God in the <hi>Publick Covenant,</hi> calls on a Sinning people to reform, now this ſhows tis what is practicable by them, Jer. 7.3, 5. <hi>Amend your ways and doings.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.13. The Obedience God calls for from his <hi>Covenant People,</hi> conſidered in a collective way, is what they are capable of from common Aſſiſtance and a due Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the means of teaching they do enjoy. Men that are <hi>Intemperate,</hi> may reform, and come to be Sober Men: Men given to <hi>Strife and vain Jangling, may ſtudy to be quiet and do their own buſineſs,</hi> as directed to do, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11 Men <hi>unjuſt and uncharitable,</hi> may labour to be juſt and honeſt in their dealing, and kind and charitable to others: Men that <hi>Neglect the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip</hi> on <hi>Sabbath Days,</hi> and on other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, may put honour upon it, by a ſteady and conſtant attendance on it: The ſame Legs that will Carry a Man <hi>to the Tavern,</hi> will Carry him <hi>to the place of Publick Worſhip, if he will put them to the Service.</hi> If Men want <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace,</hi> and ſo are uncapable in <hi>ſtatu quo, i.e.</hi> in their preſent condition of gracious actings, yet they are capable of <hi>External Conformity</hi> to the Rules of the Goſpel: Men when urged
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002232_0052_0FDAD4B713722640"/>
to Reform, <hi>ſay they cannot</hi>; but tis becauſe <hi>they Will not.</hi> Hence God Charges it on the Corrupt &amp; Sinful Will of man; Pſal 8I.II. <hi>But my People would not hearken to my Voice, and Iſrael would none of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We have choice means of Conviction in things wherein we are Dark.</hi> We have a great deal of Light held forth to us to ſhew us what is Sinful, and that the way of Sin is deſtructive and ruinous; in the Pains taken by our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to Check this and the other Vice: We have great light held forth to us from the Word of God; the Miniſters of Chriſt have not ceaſed to <hi>ſhow unto us our Tranſgreſſions</hi> on this publick and ſolemn Occaſion, and alſo at other times; beſides, the Providences of God have been many times very Convincing, and have ſerved to point out Sin in particular, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. So that if we uſe the Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, we are in the way to be Enlightned; Our ignorance under ſuch Means of light, renders us very inexcuſable; Joh.3.19. <hi>This iſ the Condemnation,</hi> &amp;c God repreſents the Carriage of his People when got into ſuch a frame, as Brutal or worſe, Iſa. 1.3. <hi>The Ox knows his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib: but Iſrael doth not know me, my People doth not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We ſhall lie open to Publick Judgments till we do Reform.</hi> God may ſpare us from his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful

Patience, and he may give us a reſpite now and then from Publick Judgments; He may beſtow many Publick Favours on us; He may give us Peace, and Health, and Plenty, as the fruits of his Benignity: <hi>for his ways are not as ours, but infinitely above them,</hi> Iſa. 55. 8. But there is no way to ſave us from Publick Guilt, but by giving to us a ſpirit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; See Iſa. 4.4. <hi>When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the Daughters of Zion, and ſhall have purged the blood of Jeruſalem from midſt thereof, by the ſpirit of judgment, and by the ſpirit of Burning.</hi> The Spirit of God is there Promiſed in the times of the Goſpel to work for Conviction on the hearts of men, as a Spirit of Judgment to Convince them, as a Spirit of Burning to Refine them, to Conſume their greater &amp; leſſer Iniquities, <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Gloſs on the Text, Vol.2 Pag 259</note> It being ſo then, it follows, if there be a great deal of pains taken by <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> to cut off Occaſions of Sin, and to ſave us from publick Guilt If <hi>Miniſter</hi> obtain Mercy of the Lord to be Faithful, ſuch as <hi>knowing the Terror of the Lord,</hi> uſe proper means to perſwade men, as <hi>Paul</hi> Speaks 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 11 If there be much of the Purity of Doctrine and Worſhip to be ſeen among us Again, if there be a number of Godly, Holy Perſons in our Towns, ſuch as

ſhew by their Diſcourſe and Converſation, that they have been with JESUS. Further, Tho' God at times is pouring out his Spirit for the carrying on Converſion Work, in a Remarkable manner, in particular places, yet according to the tenour of the <hi>Publick Covenant,</hi> as we are a Body Collective by it, till we come to Reform and Amend in the General, we ly open to Publick Judgments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The work of Reformation, if it be General, will make way for our being a Happy People.</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant People of God are under ſingular Advantage to be a happy People; Tis God's primary intention to make them ſo when He takes them into ſo near a Relation to Himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.29. <hi>Happy art thou, O Iſrael: who is like unto thee. &amp;c.</hi> Hence if it don't prove ſo in the Event, tis ever charg'd upon them as their own fault. The Promiſes of the Covenant are great, &amp; the good of them is made over to a People upon condition of Obedience that they are under ſpecial advantage to perform; Now this Obedience is called their Righteouſneſs, Deut. 6 25 <hi>And it ſhall be our righteouſneſs, if we obſerve to do all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments before the Lord our God, as He has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us</hi>: i.e That for which they are Juſtified &amp; Accepted before God as the Heirs of the Promiſe. According then to the Nature of the Covenant &amp; God's Oeconomy in the Government of the Houſe of Iſrael; we may conclude were Religion revived, we ſhould ſoon ſee the face of our Land Renewed; the diſtempers of our Civil State would be healed; no more Complaint that the Head is ſick &amp; the Heart faint; to uſe the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa</hi> 1.5. Our Heart Jealouſies, Animoſities, ſeparate Intereſts would ceaſe. Men would ſstudy Love &amp; Unanimity
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002232_0055_0FDAD4BE8F412AA8"/>
in all their Concerns; they wou'd agree to Proſecute the Publick Good truly &amp; faithfully: And as an Ingenuous Writer <note n="‖" place="bottom">See <hi>Norris</hi> Miſcellany's. Pag. 171.</note> in his fine way of Expreſſion, notes on the conduciveneſs of Chriſtian Charity to the good &amp; benefit of Humane Society; <q>Nothing would now be wanting to Verify and Realize the Dreams of the Golden Age; to Anticipate the Millennial Happineſs, and to bring down Heaven upon Earth. Society would ſtand firm &amp; compact like a Mathematical Frame of Architecture, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by mutual Dependences &amp; Coherences; and every mans Kindneſſes would return again upon himself in the Circle &amp; Reciprocation of Love.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides Now Converſion work is like to go on &amp; many Souls Saved from Wrath to come, and bro't to be the Heirs of Life: The Publick Church ſhall ſhare largely in that Promiſe, by God's Gathering in of His Elect, Iſa. 54. 13. <hi>Thy Children ſhall be taught of God; and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children.</hi> So Iſa. 55 13. <hi>Inſtead of the Thorn ſhall come up the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, &amp; inſtead of the Briar ſhall come up the Myrtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree; and it ſhall be to the Lord for a Name, for an everlaſting ſign which ſhall not be cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude then, Let us all Unite in this great Work, &amp; join ſervent Prayers with the Means uſed, that they maybe crowned with Succeſs: Let us with Ephraim, take words &amp; return; Hof. 14.2. <hi>Take with you Words &amp; turn to the Lord, ſay unto Him, Take away all Iniquity &amp; receive us graciouſly. So will we render the calves of our Lips.</hi>
