            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

UNderſtanding you are come down to repreſent your Town in the approaching Seſſion, I heartily <hi>congratulate</hi> you on the ſame: And ſeeing the divine Providence, which Superintends humane Affairs, has allotted you that Service, I hope you will approve your ſelf <hi>a ſincere Lover of your Country,</hi> and make it abundantly evident, that <hi>our moſt valuable Intereſts</hi> lay near your Heart.</p>
            <p>It is alſo my earneſt Wiſh, that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the whole General Aſſembly may enjoy the Divine Conduct and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in all the weighty and Arduous Affairs that may come before them,; and ſo be (under Heaven) <hi>the happy Instruments of lengthning out our Tranquility.</hi>

The <hi>Country</hi> Gentleman. Sir, I moſt paſſionately pronounce Amen to your Wiſh; and as to my ſelf, as it has ever been my Ambition, ſo (I truſt) it ſhall be my unſhaken Reſolution, inſtead of Sacrificing the publick Good, and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecking a good Conſcience <hi>to gratify a few deſigning Men,</hi> to lay out my ſelf, as I have Ability and Opportunity in the ſervice of my dear, native Country. I confeſs things look Diſcouraging, in as much as the Times may juſtly be ſaid to be <hi>troublous</hi>; in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Diviſions and Animoſities which are among us; but I hope <hi>Good</hi> will come out of <hi>Evil,</hi> and a <hi>Serene Morning</hi> ſucceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Stormy Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. Gent.</hi> Your Reſolutions are worthy a Man of Honour, and thoſe who invincibly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to ſuch Reſolves, do truly <hi>merit Praiſe,</hi> the love of which is a Paſſion deeply fixed in the mind of every extraordinary Perſon; and thoſe who are moſt affected with it, ſeem moſt to partake of that <hi>divine particle,</hi> which diſtinguiſhes mankind from the inferior Creation. The Stoicks ſay, we reaſonably owe more to our native Country, than to all other things in this lower World, as ſhe Impales the reſt we love and cheriſh;

and who ſtand firm in her preſervation, &amp; on the contrary muſt neceſſarily periſh with her.</p>
            <p>From this generous Affection, ſo many em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent Actions have taken Birth, of ſuch HEROES as have gloriouſly expoſed their Lives for the preſervation of their Country, and laid aſide their <hi>private Injuries,</hi> for fear of revenging them at the <hi>publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such indeed, challenge a peculiar Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Reſpect, as they are made Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Conſervation and Protection of Men; and acquire a Univerſal Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is the laſt degree of happineſs <hi>here,</hi> and after they are fallen Aſleep, it may be ſaid of them;
<q>
                  <l>'Look thro' yon Azure Vault! what Rays of Light</l>
                  <l>'Dart from the HEROES glitt'ring Forms! How Bright</l>
                  <l>'Their Radiant Crowns! —</l>
                  <l>'While here their Country's Weal had their Regards,</l>
                  <l>'Now Heaven beſtows munificent Rewards:</l>
                  <l>'As in the Orb of glorious Deeds they mov'd,</l>

               </q>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002111_0005_0FBB83897098D778"/>Thus their Memory, which is <hi>precious,</hi> ſhall be tranſmitted to the lateſt Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to their Immortal Honour: On the other Hand, with what marks of Infamy do they deſerve to be ſtigmatiz'd, who (tho' Heaven has Liberally furniſh'd them with large A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities to benefit Mankind) are acted by a <hi>mean, norrow, contracted ſpirit,</hi> may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from what I have ſaid: (for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries illuſtrate each other.) This may be called <hi>ſordid Frugality</hi> with a witneſs; when Men are influenc'd by private views, and on every Occaſion ſacrifice the <hi>publick</hi> Good to their <hi>particular</hi> Intereſts; moſt certainly the memories of ſuch ſhall be accurſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. Gent.</hi> What you have ſaid is agreeable to the Sentiments of Mankind in general; but, Sir, what are we to think of the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, Jarrs,</hi> and <hi>Contentions,</hi> that ſpirit of <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> prevailing among us; (tho' we have a GOVERNOUR, other Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations would give thouſands of Pounds to enjoy) Doth not <hi>this</hi> look with an ill aſpect?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. Gent.</hi> Truly <hi>this</hi> is matter of Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and will be ſo to all good men; for the univerſal Suffrage of Mankind, and the Oracles of Eternal Truth, do abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002111_0006_0FBB838AB6C63B68"/>
that a <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>City, i. e.</hi> any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of whatever Denomination, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably fall and come to Ruin, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. Gent.</hi> But what do you aſſign as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin, and Source of our Diviſions; is not the <hi>want of a Medium,</hi> think you, one great Cauſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. Gent.</hi> The want of a Medium may, no doubt, be aſſign'd as one great cauſe of our Calamities; for the Silver and Gold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ship'd off, and the Paper Bills exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; what <hi>Oppreſſion, Injustice,</hi> and <hi>cruel U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury;</hi> what <hi>tricking, cheating, defrauding,</hi> and <hi>overeaching,</hi> like a Deluge, has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd us? to the grievous Scandal of the Chriſtian Name.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the various Schemes, &amp; projections, and Sentiments of Men (as their particular Intereſts, and private views have led them) have been exhibited, and almoſt an infinite number of Pamphlets diſperſed thro' the Country; to this are owing, the Conteſts and Controverſies among us, which have been managed with ſuch <hi>furious Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Party warmth,</hi> as has ended in Enmity, and utter Alienation: But to ſay no more
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002111_0007_0FBB838CF4AD90B0"/>
of former things; what think you of Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s <hi>diſtreſſed ſtate of Boſton,</hi> with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Anſwers; and what Reception do they meet with among you in the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. Gent.</hi> Altho' the Government ſaw good very highly to reſent ſome paſſages in that Treatiſe, yet I verily believe the Gentleman <hi>was far from deſigning any Reflection</hi> on it (as he ſolemnly declares, pag. 9.) but that the Good and Happineſs of the Town and Country were lying near his Heart; and that <hi>moſt</hi> of the things therein contained are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, is obvious to every man, who is acquainted with the circumſtances of things, which he has ſet in a <hi>true light,</hi> in the Judgment of all Judicious Men, whom I have convers'd with.</p>
            <p>When I perus'd a Pamphlet, containing ſome Remarks, &amp;c. on the above mention'd Tract, and obſerved the Author's <hi>circular way of Argumentation</hi>; I ſuppoſed (being immers'd in more ſublime Studies) he might imagine himſelf on ſome <hi>lofty Topick in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks,</hi> and ſo has at once been miſtaken in his <hi>Theme,</hi> and his Notions of the <hi>true Intereſt</hi> of his Country: 'Tis well he owns himſelf liable to <hi>miſtakes,</hi> for it requires no great Judgment or Penetration, to detect his Abſurdities and Inconſiſtences; altho' he

boaſts, (pag. 12) that he has <hi>made Things appear as plain and certain as a Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Demonſtration</hi>; and challenges <hi>any man to confute him</hi>; but (pag. 19.) he calls the ſame things, <hi>matters of doubtful Diſputation</hi>: But his wonderful Projection, to force Men (by a fatal Neceſſity) to Induſtry, Frugality, and Good Husbandry, and ſo at once to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate us out of our Difficulties, is, to have <hi>neither Money or Credit:</hi> (Sir, don't you think <hi>Longitude,</hi> and a <hi>Communication between us and the Moon,</hi> will be found out quickly, and be made as plain as a <hi>Demonſtration!</hi>) Surely this Projection would ſoon extricate us out of this <hi>wretched Life,</hi> if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould fall in with it, <hi>and I am great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived, if we ever ſee good days again:</hi> But I would have our Projector make the Experiment, and try whether it is <hi>practicable</hi> to ſubſiſt any time without <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Credit</hi>; and if he finds it is, then let him recommend his Project to the Government.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> (in pag. 2. and 9. of his tract) touches to the <hi>Quick</hi> an Order of Gentlemen (as if a man ſhould thruſt a Firebrand into a Neſt of Hornets) who with ſhame (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſhameleſs manner) Cry, GIVE YE: But it was not long before one of the fierceſt of 'em, being rous'd up, (as a ſtrong man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Wine) and having fill'd his Pandoras Box, and fitted himſelf for his Maſters Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſits down, to blot with his deteſtable Scurrility, a Paper calld the <hi>Deadham Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi>; in which poſture, were it not juſt to paint him (ſomething as I've ſeen K. <hi>J</hi>—) with the Father of Lyes at at his right hand to <hi>instigate</hi> and <hi>dictate,</hi> and an huge Bowl of exhillerating PUNCH at his left to <hi>intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (as one ſays) can any be ſo ſimple as to think, the Cauſe he ſeems to patronize can receive any Benefit by the <hi>Clamour and Railing</hi> of ſo mean and ſordid a Wretch, whoſe Tongue, as we uſe to ſay, is no Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Here he makes a mighty <hi>Stir</hi> (from his tender regards for the honour of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and out of his <hi>high-flying Zeal,</hi> thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out Non-reſiſtance &amp; Paſſive Obedience, that we <hi>ſpeak not Evil of Dignities, and be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> in ſuch haſte, that he jumps over the 2d Chap. of the Epiſtle, in which there is an Apoſtolical Interrogation, which he would do well to conſider and <hi>apply,</hi> for it is directly leveld as if deſigned for <hi>him,</hi> Verſe 23. <hi>Thou that makeſt thy boast of the Law, thro' breaking the Law diſhonoureſt thou God?</hi> But what has this man to do with the Goſpel? Has he

ever read Pſal. 50.16, and onward? Or doth <hi>Paul</hi> give a toleration for men to <hi>be drunk,</hi> and in their merry Cups to <hi>threſh their wives,</hi> contrary to the Light and Law of Nature as well as the Goſpel? Or is it <hi>Peter</hi>? No: Perhaps 'tis his pretended Succeſſor at <hi>Rome</hi> gives the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> with promiſes of Pardon for all Sins, paſt, preſent, and to come.</p>

Gent.</hi> Sir, What you have ſaid brings to my mind an inſufferable Affront lately offer'd to the Town of <hi>Boston.</hi> On the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> being the Day of our Election of Repreſentatives, and the Pretenders Birth Day there came into the publick Town-Meeting, a certain Gentleman, (or rather mercenary R—l) and having placd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Bench, and aſſum'd an uncommon Air of Impudence, he began <hi>imperiouſly to dictate to his ſuperiors</hi>; and out of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant Loyalty to King GEORGE, and Love to the Proteſtant Succeſſion, propos'd, <hi>That all the Inhabitants of the Town (tho' otherwiſe qualifi'd according to Law (ſhould have the Oaths of Allegiance and Abjuration tender'd to them, before they might be a lowed to vote</hi>: And having aſſerted that there was a Law obliging thereunto (tho' he could not
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002111_0011_0FBB839612B6AA28"/>
produce the ſame) he went on with his talk as pertinently as a Man may be ſuppos'd to do, if he ſhould undertake to prove to a demonſtration, that <hi>Lawyer and Liar are ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonimous Terms</hi>; Till Mr. Moderator was forc'd to exert his Authority to ſtill his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Tongue: This extreamly exaſperated the Town, to be challeng'd by ſuch a d— D—, when perhaps there are not 400 more <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>loyal Subjects</hi> (with humble ſubmiſſion to <hi>Lancaſhire Jack)</hi> in the Kings Dominions; but 'tis generally ſuppos'd he came (<hi>as a Tool</hi>) to ſet the Town together by the Ears, and <hi>hinder</hi> the expected Choice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. G.</hi> We are not ignorant in the Country of the confounded <hi>jugling Tricks</hi> that have been acted juſt before the their choice of Repreſentatives in the ſeveral Towns, by ſending <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> and diſpatching abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Letters (with News from Robinſon Cruſo's Iſland)</hi> from <hi>Vill</hi> to <hi>Vill,</hi> to amuſe the Country; inſinuating that if things were carried on as they were the laſt Seſſion, we muſt expect <hi>the ſame Fate,</hi> and that the Country will <hi>be ruin'd by the vast Expence and Damage of broken Conventions</hi>; much like the Cry of the High-flying Party in England, in QUEEN ANN's Time, <hi>the Church, the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002111_0012_0FBB83984533E0F0"/>
Church</hi> is in Danger! And there has not been wanting their utmoſt Efforts, nor any ſtone left unturned, to compaſs their Noble Deſigns, &amp; make things anſwer their Deſire, tho' they have been drove to ſuch Extremity in two Towns (as I am well Inform'd) to bring in two Gentlemen, <hi>(who ate by ſome accounted Pillars in the Houſe)</hi> that their <hi>Evangelical Paſtor</hi> in one, and an <hi>ungodly Aethropian</hi> in the other, were <hi>Voters</hi> to make a Majority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how unprecedented each of theſe Inſtances are, I leave the world to Judge. Probably all this mighty ſtir has been made, to antedote the <hi>Doſe of Hellebore</hi> Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> adminiſtred to the Country, (pag. 9. of his <hi>Diſtreſſed State)</hi> where he adviſes them to ſend publick ſpirited men, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, not Sheriffs and Lawyers, who are the only men, who are benefitted by their Neighbours Straits, and fill their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers out of the Ruins of their Eſtates; but <hi>ſi populus 'vult decipi, decipiatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. G.</hi> It is too well known what ſly Inſinuations have been uſed by a Set of Raſh men in Boſton (before the coming together of the Convention, under the Hypocritical Diſguiſe of contending for Perogatives) with the Country Gentlemen, to Induce 'em to fall into ſuch Meaſures, as may endanger the Loſs of a Charter, <hi>full of Singular Privilidges</hi> (which would be very grateful to ſeveral Gentlemen, whoſe Names I forbear to mention) and involve us in ſuch miſerable Circumſtances, <hi>as a little valiant talk over a Bowl of Punch cannot extricate out of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002111_0013_0FBB839A0BA06120"/>
               <hi>C. G.</hi> I had not been half an hour in Town before I was ſaluted by a very corpulent Gentleman of the 'Change, who thruſt into my hand a Pamphlet, which he told me was a <hi>Word in Seaſon,</hi> and contained Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great Importance; and was very importunate with me, to give it a ſpeedy Peruſal: The Title of it was, <hi>News from Robinſon Cruſo's Iſland</hi>; and I ſoon found it contained ſundry ſcandalous Reflections of the Houſe of Repreſentatives. That on purpoſe to ſhow their ſpite to the G——n, they had put a publick Affront on him, and were guilty of the higheſt and moſt <hi>ſordid Ingratitude</hi>; That they were <hi>Punch Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and <hi>Enemies of their Country,</hi> and bringing on it <hi>the laſt Degree of Slavery:</hi> And on the whole, I was far from being of our celebrated News-mongers mind, that it was proper <hi>to be communicated,</hi> and <hi>worth Peoples knowing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. G.</hi> Whoever was the Author of that ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pamphlet, 'tis generally and on good grounds ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be one, whoſe <hi>Scribendi Cacoethes</hi> has made him famous on both ſides the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> whoſe Brain is overcharged with ſo great a variety of News, that the Country feels themſelves on many accounts the <hi>worſe for him.</hi> The main Spring of his Learned Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon ſeems to be, to fright the Country out of their Privileges, leſt while they lawfully uſe them, <hi>they ſpit in the Face of Government</hi>: And having run his Parallel to a very great Length, anon he begins to utter <hi>grievous Menaces,</hi> and to roar and bellow like the Popes Bull, that we have by a <hi>Train of bad Uſages</hi> compelled a good Spirited Governour to ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible Reſolution, that <hi>he will make us know he is our Governour</hi>: But with ſubmiſſion to his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> we <hi>do know</hi> he is our Governour, (and <hi>as ſuch,</hi> wou'd have all due Regards paid him; But what then? Muſt we therefore <hi>tamely and quietly</hi> give up all
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002111_0014_0FBB839D386BE8A0"/>
our <hi>Rights and Priviledges</hi>; and ſo render our ſelves obnoxious to the Curſe of ſucceeding Generations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. G.</hi> No verily: for if we tamely give up one Inch, we ſhall (according to the Proverb) find by ſad Experience, we ſhall loſe an Ell; and anon (like the Giants after the Flood) nothing will be reſtrained them of all that they have imagined; And who knows where their Deſigns and Deſires will terminate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. G.</hi> But the great Controverſy of late, has been touching the <hi>Aſſemblies Right of chuſing a Speaker</hi>; and <hi>the Governour's Power to Negative their Choice</hi>; which Matter has been ſet in a true Light by an honourable Gentleman, in his juſt and ſeaſonable Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, wherein he has fully made it appear, <hi>That the Houſe of Repreſentatives have an unqueſtionable, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Right, to chooſe their Speaker; and that the Governour has no Negative Voice in that Election</hi>; and that the giving up of this Point, which is of ſo great Concern and Importance, would give a deadly wound to the Conſtitution: And altho' that Gentlemans Name has been greatly Canvas'd by a few, whoſe Endeavours have been uſed to caſt an Odium upon it; (yet if it be a true Maxim that Intereſt will not lie) he is one who has approved himſelf a true Friend to his Country, a loyal Subject to King GEORGE. One who will never be guilty of <hi>liſtening to a few deſigning Men,</hi> nor be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by <hi>popular and plauſible Inſinuations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. G.</hi> The Choice of a Speaker is one of the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Priviledges this Province Enjoys, and of which, 'tis ſtrange there ſhould be any Endeavours to deprive them.</p>
            <p>I hope this Aſſembly will intirely fall in with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the laſt, and that private differences, will no more have any influence on the Publick Affairs; (which is highly unreaſonable, by how much the Publick Good, ought to be preferred to particular men's Intereſts) and in a word, may this Province ever
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002111_0015_0FBB839E3807EEE0"/>
have an Aſſembly that will <hi>quit themſelves like Men,</hi> in ſtanding up for the <hi>just Rights</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of their Country: May we ever enjoy a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> Government, that will aſſert and maintain the <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> of the Crown, and being extricated out of the Difficulties we labour under, may we again ſee <hi>happy and glorious Days,</hi> and the Council of all ſuch as would ſtrike at our Conſtitution be turned into fooliſhneſs; to which, every good man will ſay AMEN.</p>
            <p>Before we part, Sir, I beg the Favour that you would read to me a certain Letter, which you told me formerly, you had by you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. G.</hi> Sir, I ſhall the more readily grant your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, becauſe it has Relation to ſome things we have diſcours'd of: It is as follows, viz.</p>
