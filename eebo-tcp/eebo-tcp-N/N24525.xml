            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</head>
            <p>THE name of the Abbé MAURY hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo diſtinguiſhed not only in France, but alſo in this and other countries of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, that his literary productions will, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, attract a degree of attention correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with that, which his public charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and conduct have excited.</p>
            <p>As a member of the Conſtituting Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſembly, it was his lot to ſtep forward at an epoch, which will for ever remain memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the annals of France.</p>
            <p>IN the midſt of thoſe conteſts and recrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations, which prevailed among the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent orders of which that aſſembly was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the Abbé MAURY ſtood forth as the champion of the Church, and of Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. His eloquence and abilities elevated him to diſtinguiſhed importance amongſt his brethren, while his undaunted ſpirit acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freſh energy from the number, the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the attacks of his opponents: thus, though repeatedly foiled, yet like an expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:032455_0004_0FF26988CD547DA8"/>hero in the field of battle, he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to yield, but with his lateſt breath.</p>
            <p>His zeal and talents ſhone conſpicuous in this criſis of public affairs; and we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he hath ſince received from the hands of his Holineſs at Rome, the reward of a ſtrenuous defence of a tottering church.</p>
            <p>BUT not only hath the Senate borne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his abilities: the Preſs, alſo, ſuper-adds its teſtimony in various literary produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>ELOQUENCE, the ſubject of that work, which is here preſented in an Engliſh dreſs, appears to have occupied his matureſt tho'ts; and the juſtice and enlargement of his ideas upon this ſubject mark the ſucceſs, with which he has purſued it.</p>
            <p>To boaſt of his attaining to originality of thought on a ſubject, which hath been ſo frequently and ſo ably diſcuſſed, would, doubtleſs, be preſumptuous: to inſinuate that he has written a complete ſyſtem, would be to contradict his own profeſſions; but, to acknowledge, that he has thrown out a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of uſeful hints, and that in his manner of diſcuſſion, he is lively and intereſting, is no more than to pay him that tribute, to which his merit may juſtly lay claim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032455_0005_0FF2695D73EF8458"/>
THE following Diſſertation is only one of ſeveral, which M. MAURY hath given to the public. There are alſo collected in one vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume <hi>the Panegyrics of</hi> S. LOUIS and of FENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LON; <hi>Reflections on the Sermons of</hi> BOSSUET; and <hi>the Panegyric of</hi> S. AUSTIN.</p>
            <p>IN theſe he has diſcovered the talents of an Orator, particularly in that ſpecies of the art ſtiled <hi>Panegyric,</hi> to which the French have ever ſhewn more attachment than the Engliſh<note n="*" place="bottom">A late publication hath ſince appeared, and been attributed to the Abbé, conſiſting, chiefly, of ſpeeches delivered by him in the National Aſſembly.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IN the work now offered to the public, and which ſeems the moſt material for a young ſpeaker to peruſe, the Abbé has preſcribed thoſe rules, and ſuggeſted thoſe obſervations, by which he appears to have been guided in his own compoſitions.</p>
            <p>IN confirmation of the good opinion, which the tranſlator has conceived of M. MAURY'S performance, he tranſcribes, with pleaſure, the remarks of the MONTHLY REVIEWERS on thoſe diſcourſes, of which the following tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation conſtitutes the firſt:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The firſt of theſe diſcourſes relates to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of the Eloquence of the Pulpit, and does great honour to the taſte, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032455_0006_0FF26A0AB4A49BB8"/>and feelings of the ingenious author. His reflections on CICERO, DEMOSTHENES, BOSSOET, FENELON, TILLOTSON, MASSIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LON, BOURDALOUE, SAURIN, BRIDAINE, &amp;c. are ſenſible and ſolid; and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and rules are every way adapted to form the taſte of a young Orator to that affecting ſimplicity, which diſdains all friv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olous ornaments, and has no other object in view than to touch and to perſuade.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe is followed by two Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were delivered before the French Academy in honour of St. Louis, and Fenelon; another in honour of St. Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, delivered in the General Aſſembly of the French Clergy; and a piece intituled, Reflections on the Sermons of Boſſuet laſt publiſhed." All theſe are excellent in their kinds.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Monthly Review,</hi> vol. lvii. p. 309.</note>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>THE teſtimony of an eminent literary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter now living, were liberty allowed to tranſcribe it, and mention his name, would add ſtrength to the foregoing obſervations.</p>
            <p>THE Editor feels himſelf conſtrained to apologize for the part he has taken. He began, at firſt, to peruſe and tranſlate Abbé MAURY'S performance <q>on the Eloquence of the Pulpit and the Bar,</q> in the courſe of
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:032455_0007_0FF26A0E94E31390"/>his private ſtudies, and merely with a view to his perſonal improvement.</p>
            <p>SOME elucidations from Engliſh authors naturally occurred to his mind, which he has, accordingly, annexed. But it was not till afterwards, and in compliance with the wiſh of thoſe, whoſe judgment he reſpects, that he thought of ſubmitting the whole to public view. He cannot be inſenſible that imperfections may diſcover themſelves to the eye of rigid criticiſm; while, at the ſame time, he would indulge a hope, that the time and pains employed will render this tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Abbé's ſentiments not wholly unacceptable to the young ſtudent and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for whoſe uſe it is principally deſigned.</p>
            <p>IT will appear, on peruſal, that the Abbé MAURY'S predilection for French Preachers and Orators gives a tincture of ſeverity to his cenſures on the Engliſh; and that, in one or two inſtances, his zeal for the Romiſh Church embitters his language with regard to the conduct and writings of ſome Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>EVERY man hath his partialities. For the prejudices of education, country, connexions, great allowances muſt, and, by every liberal mind, will be made. This is an age of free enquiry; and, in proportion as this ſpirit prevails, we ſhall ſay with the poet,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:032455_0008_0FF26A148C56A160"/>
               <l>—Veniam petimus</l>
               <l>Dabimuſque viciſſim.</l>
            </q>
            <p>FREE liberty muſt, therefore, be allowed to every reader to judge for himſelf what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of regard is to be paid to a few paſſages, wherein the Abbé gives ſuch an unbounded preference to ſome of his favourite French Catholic Preachers, above thoſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church, and the Engliſh nation.</p>
            <p>To the works of eloquent French writers recommended by M. MAURY, perhaps it will be no diſcredit to add as a model of Pulpit-Eloquence, the ſermons of the late Rev. CHARLES CHAIS, Paſtor of the French Church at the Hague.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Sermons of the Rev. C. CHAIS were printed in 1790, in two volumes; for a character of which, the reader is referred to the Appendix to the ſeventy-eighth volume of the Monthly Review, and the Appendix to the third volume enlarged.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FOR Engliſh authors and preachers, the reader is referred to ſeveral of the notes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the following tranſlation.</p>
            <p>OF thoſe who have written profeſſedly on the ſubject of Eloquence, the ſtudent may profitably peruſe CICERO, QUINTILIAN, and LONGINUS among the ancients; and ſuch modern authors as WARD, GIBBON, FORDYCE, CAMPBELL, BLAIR, and POLWHELE; to which may be added ROLLIN, and FENELON.</p>

               <p>IN preſenting the public with this feeble production, I propoſe, with a juſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my own abilities, to lay before them ſome obſervations which have occurred to me in the courſe of my reading, or oratorial compoſitions, reſpecting the art of Eloquence, which it is the ſtudy of my life to cultivate.</p>
               <p>THEY were written at firſt merely for my own private uſe. If I have ſometimes giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a decided opinion, I intreat the reader to remember that I ſpeak to him with freedom yet without preſumption, and that I myſelf
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:032455_0013_0FF26A1DDD69E070"/>am far from conſidering the reſult of my obſervations as laying down rules of the art.</p>
               <p>THE general idea which I form, at firſt view, of the eloquence of the pulpit is this.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A MAN of ſenſibility diſcovers his friend about to take a ſtep contrary to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or duty. He is deſirous of oppoſing it, but he is afraid of repelling confidence by a haſty contradiction. He gently inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uates himſelf into his mind. He does not, at firſt, oppoſe. He enquires. He is not regarded. He requires only to be heard, and inſtantly he ſtates his reaſons, and offers convincing arguments with modeſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.—No anſwer is returned. He then complains, not of obſtinacy, but of ſilence. He meets all objections and refutes them. Animated by the tender zeal of friendſhip, he is far from attempting to ſhine by his wit, or to diſhearten by his reproaches. He ſpeaks only the language of affection. At length aſſured of having arreſted the attention of his friend, he uncovers the precipice under his feet, and ſhews him all its depth, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:032455_0014_0FF26A1FD28F01D0"/>to alarm his imagination, that weakeſt, and yet moſt predominant of our faculties.</p>
               <p>HE thus ſucceeds in moving him. He now deſcends to entreaty, and gives an unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vent to his ſighs and tears.—The work is done; the heart yields, and his friend is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded. They both embrace; and it is to the eloquence of friendſhip that reaſon and virtue are indebted for the honour of victory.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIAN ORATORS! behold your model. Let that compaſſionate man who ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſympathetic tenderneſs in order to convince, be you; and that friend who ſhould be moved in order to be undeceived, be your auditory.</p>

               <p>IT is only neceſſary, in fact, for the Orator to keep one man in view amidſt the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that ſurrounds him; and, excepting thoſe enumerations which require ſome vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in order to paint the paſſions, conditions, and characters, he ought merely, while com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, to addreſs himſelf to that one man,

               </head>
               <p>EVERY Orator poſſeſſed of original ideas, without ever attempting to aſtoniſh, will have new and ſtriking plans, merely by attending to the ſcope of his own genius.</p>
               <p>PLANS are frequently ſingular and whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, eſpecially when they are drawn from the text. This irkſome reſtraint ſcarcely ever ſucceeds in moral diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>MASSILON hath ſketched out the diviſion of his ſermon on confeſſion, where we find ſo many beauties in detail, upon a paſſage in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032455_0027_0FF269CE66196718"/>the Goſpel. He takes for his text that verſe of St. John,<note n="*" place="bottom">John, ch. v. verſe 3.</note>

               <p>THIS application is doubtleſs ingenious; but it is too far fetched. The excellent taſte of MASSILON only yields this once to the temptation of drawing a very artificial plan from the analyſis of his text.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Methinks the cenſure of Doctor BLAIR applies to this quaint diviſion of Maſſilon's diſcourſe, when he remarks, that <q>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of moſt of the French ſermons are theſe: from a mode that prevails among them of taking their texts from the leſſon of the day, the connexion of the text with the ſubject is often unnatural and forced; and their applications of Scripture are fanciful rather than inſtructive."—He farther remarks, "that their method is ſtiff and cramped by their practice of dividing their ſubject al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either into three, or two, main points; and their compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is in general too diffuſe, and conſiſts rather of a very few thoughts ſpread out, and highly wrought up, than of a rich variety of ſentiments. Admitting, however, all theſe defects, it cannot be denied, that their ſermons are formed upon the idea of a perſuaſive, popular Oration; and therefore, (he adds,) I am of opinion they may be read with benefit.</q>

               <head>SECTION VIII. <hi>Of the Progreſſion of the Plan.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHETHER it be a moral ſubject that is diſcuſſed, or one's talents be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon panegyrics or myſteries, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary to obſerve a ſpecified progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the diſtribution of the plan, in order to impart an increaſing force to the points adduced, to give weight to the argument, and energy to the rhetorical movements. It is as rare as it is difficult to render both parts of a ſermon equally excellent, becauſe the ſame reſources ſeldom preſent themſelves to the imagination of the Orator. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, however, ought to excel the former. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oquence always declines when it ceaſes to riſe. It is therefore to the ſecond branch of the diviſion that the moſt perſuaſive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and pathetic ſentiments ought to be reſerved.</p>
               <p>CICERO, whoſe plan is very diſtinct in all his Orations, although ſeldom announced in the exordium, adopts a method very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the advancement of his proofs, which obliges him to be ſurpaſſing himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by freſh efforts in proportion as he proceeds in the difficulties of his ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:032455_0030_0FF26A59CC7D4BD0"/>
OPEN his Orations. He at once denies the fact which is oppoſed to him; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he proves, that, by taking its truth for granted, nothing could thereby be concluded againſt his client.</p>
               <p>I SHALL only quote here two ſtriking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this excellent method.</p>
               <p>In defending Archais who had been his preceptor, and of whom he always ſpeaks with the moſt lively gratitude, Cicero thus divides his Oration; <q>I ſhall prove that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chais is a Roman citizen; and that, if he were not, he would be very deſerving to be one.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE plan of the Oration in favour of Milo is no leſs forcible. "Milo," ſays he, <q>hath not ſlain Clodius; if he had ſlain him, he would have done well.</q> The mind of man cannot reaſon with more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity and energy.</p>
               <p>NOR are we to conclude that Cicero pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus accidentally on ſome particular occaſions. In his "Oratorial diviſions," in that charming dialogue where this great man ſubmits to an examination upon this art, by anſwering all the queſtions which his ſon puts to him upon Eloquence, Cicero eſtabliſhes, as a fixed rule, this manner of dividing the diſcourſe. He ſays. <q>It is thus you ought
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032455_0031_0FF26A40883E88E0"/>to reaſon; you muſt either deny the fact that meets you, or if you admit it, you muſt prove that the conſequences which your opponent has drawn do not reſult from it<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>TO all thoſe rules which art furniſhes for conducting the plan of a diſcourſe, we proceed to ſubjoin a general rule from which Orators, and eſpecially Chriſtian Orators, ought never to ſwerve.</p>
               <p>WHEN ſuch begin their career, the zeal for the ſalvation of ſouls which animates them, doth not render them always unmindful of the glory which follows great ſucceſs. A blind deſire to ſhine and to pleaſe is often at

               <p>IT is unqueſtionably to be wiſhed that he who devotes himſelf to the arduous labours which preaching requires, ſhould be wholly ambitious to render himſelf uſeful to the cauſe of religion. To ſuch, reputation can never be a ſufficient recompence: But if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſo pure have not ſufficient ſway in your breaſt, calculate, at leaſt, the advantages of ſelf-love, and you may perceive how inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably connected theſe are with the ſucceſs of your miniſtry.</p>
               <p>IS it on your own account that you preach? Is it for you that religion aſſembles her vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in a temple? You ought not to indulge ſo preſumptuous a thought. However, I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider you as an Orator. Tell me then; what is this you call Eloquence?

               <p>WIT pleaſes in an epigram or a ſong, but it never produces great effects in a numerous aſſembly. True Eloquence proſcribes all thoſe thoughts which are too refined or far-fetched to ſtrike the people; for, indeed, what elſe is it than a brilliant ſtroke affecting and enlivening a multitude, which, at firſt view, merely preſents to the Orator in extended and motionleſs heap, and which ſo far from participating the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of him who ſpeaks, ſcarcely grants him a cold and ſtrict attention?</p>

THE beginning of a diſcourſe ought to be ſimple and modeſt, in order to conciliate to the preacher the good will of his auditory. The Exordium, nevertheleſs, deſerves to be ſtudied with the greateſt care. It is proper to confine oneſelf in this part to the unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſingle idea which may include the whole extent of the ſubject. It is here where indications of the plan ſhould be quickly made known; where the leading aim of the diſcourſe ſhould be pointed out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out filling up too much room; where lucid principles ſhould diſcover the deep reflection of the Orator who is capable of obtaining, at once, a commanding influence, over all his hearers<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>The firſt quality of an Exordium is brevity. This, however, has a proper meaſure, for as it ought not to be exceſſively long, ſo neither ſhould it be too ſhort, the middle way is beſt. If the Exordium were too ſhort, it would oblige the hearer to enter too ſoon into the matter without preparation enough; and exceſſive length would weary him; for it is with an auditor, as with a men who viſits a palace, he does not like to ſtay too long in the court, or firſt avenues, he would only view them tranſiently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtopping, and proceed as ſoon as poſſible to gratify his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal curioſity.</q> 
                     <bibl>ROBINSON'S CLAUDE, vol. ii. p. 469.</bibl>
                     <p>M. CLAUDE farther obſerves that an Exordium ſhould be clear, cool and grave; engaging and agreeable; connected with the text or ſubject to be diſcuſſed; ſimple and unadorned; not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſometimes figurative: his illuſtration of theſe points well deſerves peruſal. <hi>Ibid,</hi> p. 469—480.</p>

               <p>SUCH is the art of BOSSUET, when, that he might ſtrike the mind forcibly, he ſays, at the beginning of his funeral Oration for
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032455_0037_0FF26A4A8B71DAF8"/>Henrietta of England, that he will <q>in one ſingle woe deplore all the calamities, and in one ſingle death, ſhew the death and the emptineſs of all human grandeur.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHATEVER doth not lead towards the principal points of a ſermon is uſeleſs in an Exordium. Let us, therefore, in this part of the diſcourſe, avoid ſubtle reflections, quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſſays, common places, and even tropes and metaphors.</p>

               <p>IT is, nevertheleſs, neceſſary ſtrongly to fix the attention of a wandering congregation; and I do not ſee that we violate the rules of art in ſurpriſing the hearer by an unexpected ſtroke which may draw him off from his own thoughts, provided that this ſudden emotion do not beguile his expectation, and that the Orator always proceeds in the enlargement of his ſubject.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is this continual propagation of great ideas, by which they are mutually enliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; it is this art of inceſſantly advancing in compoſition that gives ſtrength to Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, rapidity to diſcourſe, and the whole intereſt of dialogue to an uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ideas, which, were they disjointed, would produce no effect, but languiſh and die.</p>
               <p>THE progreſſion which imparts increaſing ſtrength to each period is the natural repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of thoſe tranſports of ſoul which ſhould enliven throughout the compoſitions of the Orator. Hence it follows, that an eloquent writer can only be formed by a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility and vaſtneſs of thought.</p>
               <p>DETACHED phraſes, ſuperfluous paſſages, witty compariſons, unprofitable definitions, the affectation of ſhining or ſurpriſing at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word the extravagance of genius, theſe do not enrich but rather impoveriſh a writer as often as they interrupt his progreſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>The thoughts with which good authors embelliſh their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are plain, natural, and intelligible; they are neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nor far fetched, and as it were, forced in, in order to make a parade of wit, but always riſe out of the ſubject to be treated of, from which they ſeem ſo inſeparable, that we cannot think the things could have been otherwiſe expreſſed, at the ſame time that every one imagines he would expreſs them the ſame way.</q>

LET, then, the Orator avoid, as moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rocks, thoſe enſnaring ſallies which would diminiſh the impetuoſity of his ardour. Without pity on his productions, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever regretting the apparent ſacrifices which it will coſt him, let him, as he proceeds, retrench this heap of flouriſhes which ſtifles his Eloquence inſtead of embelliſhing it, and which hurries him on forcibly, rather than gracefully, towards his main deſign.</p>
               <p>IF the hearer find himſelf continually where he was; if he diſcover the enlargement, the return of the ſame ideas, or the playing upon words, he is no more tranſported with the admiration of a vehement Orator; it is a florid declaimer whom he hears without effect. He does not even hear him long. He alſo, like the Orator, makes idle reflections on every word.

               <p>MISTAKEN man of genius! wert thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the true method of attaining Eloquence, inſtead of diſguſting thy hearer with thy inſipid antitheſes, his attention would not be at liberty to be diverted. He would partake of your emotions. He would become all that you mean to deſcribe. He would imagine that he himſelf could diſcover the plain and ſtriking arguments which you laid before him, and, in ſome meaſure, compoſe your diſcourſe along with you. His ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be at its height, as would be your glory.

                     <q>What formed the diſtinct character of Father MASSILLON'S Eloquence was, that all his ſtrokes aimed directly at the <hi>heart,</hi> ſo that what was ſimply reaſon and proof in others, was feeling, in his mouth. He not only convinced, he affected, moved, and melted his hearers. He did not confine himſelf to diſcover only the injuſtice and unreaſonableneſs of vice; he ſhewed it in ſuch a hideous and hateful light, that you could no longer ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be under the empire of ſuch a cruel tyrant; you could no longer conſider it in any other light than that of a ſworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of your felicity.

               <head>SECTION XIV. <hi>Of Cicero.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT would be a vain attempt to excuſe the diſtance ſo perceptible between the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of the French Bar, and the Orators of the Roman Senate, by ſuggeſting the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent intereſts which were entruſted to them. Cicero, I know, has ſometimes had the glory of being ſtyled "the Defender of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic:" But did he not often undertake cauſes of leſs importance? and are not moſt of his Orations devoted to the affairs of his fellow-citizens? This great man wanted not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Auditory in order to diſplay all the riches of his genius. He was more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent when he pleaded before the Roman people, than when he ſpoke in the preſence of Caeſar.</p>
               <p>HIS Oration for Ligarius is written in a charming ſtyle; but it is not conſidered as the moſt eloquent of his works. Cicero re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts the life of Ligarius of an uſurper, as if he were imploring the clemency of a lawful ſovereign. The commendations which he laviſhes on Caeſar in the ingenious concluſion of his ſpeech, ſeem to juſtify the reproaches which he received from the ſtoic Brutus, after
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032455_0051_0FF26A6E6C4C7828"/>the death of the Dictator, in that famous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where Brutus accuſes him of flattering Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius, and which is juſtly ranked amongſt the chief productions of antiquity.</p>
               <p>IT is in his Orations againſt Verres; againſt Cataline; in his ſecond Philippic; in the concluſions of all his ſpeeches; it is in his treatiſes of "the Orator," and "of illuſtrious Orators," that we find the Eloquence of Cicero. All his writings ought to be the manual of Chriſtian Orators.</p>
               <p>THE rapidity with which he compoſed his immortal diſcourſes, notwithſtanding the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity and importance of the concerns which oppreſſed him, did not prevent him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing on his ſtyle a perfection ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that it is as eaſy to underſtand his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as it is difficult, and perhaps even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to tranſlate them well. His example evidently proves that our Advocates ſhould not juſtify their inattention to Elocution by the inevitable avocations of their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>IT was during a very ſhort interval, and amidſt the agitation of a civil war, that Cicero publiſhed his famous Orations againſt Marc Antony, which he called his Philippics.</p>
               <p>WE are at a loſs to conceive how he could retain ſufficient freedom of mind, after the death of Caeſar, and in the ſixty-fourth and laſt year of his life, to compoſe thoſe fourteen

                     <p>CICERO, as an Orato, is thus characterized by Dr. BLAIR: <q>In all his orations there is high art. He begins generally with a regular exordium; and with much preparation and inſinuation prepoſſeſſes the hearers, and ſtudies to gain their affections. His method is clear, and his arguments are arranged with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. His method is indeed more clear than that of Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes, and this is one advantage which he has over him: we find every thing in its proper place. He never attempts to more till he has endeavoured to convince; and in moving, eſpecially the ſofter paſſions, he is very ſucceſsful. No man that ever wrote, knew the power and force of words better than Cicero. He rolls them along with the greateſt beauty and pomp; and, in the ſtructure of his ſentences, is curious and exact to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree. He is always full and flowing, never abrupt. He is a great amplifier of every ſubject; magnificent, and in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, highly moral. Though his manner i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> on the whole, diffuſe, yet it is often happily varied, and ſuited to the ſubject. When a great public object abuſed his mind, and demanded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and force, he departs conſiderably from that looſe and declamatory manner to which he inclines at other times, and becomes exceedingly cogent and vehement.... This great Orator, however, is not without his defects. In moſt of his orations there is too much art, even carried to the length of oſtentation. He ſeems often to aim at obtaining admiration, rather than at ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating conviction. Hence, on ſome occaſions, he is ſhewy rather than ſolid; and diffuſe, where he ought to have been preſſing. His ſentences are, at all times, round and ſonorous; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accuſed of monotony, for they poſſeſs variety of cadence; but from too great a ſtudy of magnificence, he is ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in ſtrength. Though the ſervices which he had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his country were very conſiderable, yet he is too much his own panegyriſt. Ancient manners which impoſed fewer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints on the ſide of decorum, may, in ſome degree, excuſe, but cannot entirely juſtify his vanity.</q>

IT is not, ſurely, to be aſcribed to any principle of taſte, but to the fear of diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Auguſtus, who had ſhamefully ſacrificed his benefactor Cicero, that Virgil and Horace were cowardly enough never to make mention in their poetry of this Orator, as celebrated in the preſent day as is Rome itſelf. Virgil, eſpecially, ought not to have forgotten him when celebrating the privileges of the Roman people. But the aſſaſſin of Cicero was upon the throne; and the courtly poet did not ſcruple to make a ſacrifice to Auguſtus of one of the moſt glorious monuments of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in yielding the palm of Eloquence to the Orators of Greece, in preference to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul

                     <p>M. ROLLIN, remarking on this paſſage, ſays, <q>Theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Abp. are extremely rational and judicious; and the cloſer we examine his opinion, the more we find it conformable to good ſenſe, right reaſon, and the moſt exact rules of true rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric. But whoever would take upon him to prefer Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes' Orations to thoſe of Cicero, ought, in my opinion, to poſſeſs pretty near as much ſolidity, force, and elevation of mind, as Demoſthenes muſt have had to compoſe them. Whether it be owing to an old prepoſſeſſion in favour of an author we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly read from our tender years; or that we are accuſtomed to a ſtyle which agrees more with our manners, and is more adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our capacities, we cannot be perſuaded to prefer the ſevere auſterity of Demoſthenes to the inſinuating ſoftneſs of Cicero; and we chuſe to follow our own inclination and taſte for an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who is, in ſome meaſure, our friend and acquaintance, rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than to declare, upon the credit of another, in favour of one that is almoſt a ſtranger to us.</q>

                     <p>Mr. HUME joins with thoſe critics who give the preference to Demoſthenes. Speaking of the charms of Cicero's Eloquence, he ſays, <q>Some objections I own, notwithſtanding his vaſt ſucceſs, may lie againſt ſome paſſages of the Roman Orator. He is too florid and rhetorical; his figures are too ſtriking and palpable; the diviſions of his diſcourſe are drawn chiefly from the rules of the ſchools; and his wit diſdains not always the artifice even of pun, a rhyme, or jingle of words. The Grecian addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to an Audience much leſs refined than the Roman Senate or Judges. The loweſt vulgar of Athens were his ſovereigns, and the arbiters of his Eloquence. Yet is his manner more chaſte and auſtere than that of the other. Could it be copied, its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs would be infallible over a modern Aſſembly. It is rapid harmony, exactly adjuſted to the ſenſe: it is vehement reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without any appearance of art: it is diſdain, anger, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, freedom, involved in a continued ſtream of argument. And of all human productions, the Orations of Demoſthenes preſent to us the models which approach the neareſt to perfection.</q>

                     <p>Mr. KNOX obſerves, that <q>Many critics have employed their talents in making compariſons between Demoſthenes and Tully.</q> 
                        <q>All of them agree in attributing to the former conciſeneſs, and to the latter diffuſion: and, according to this judgment, they have not heſitated to give the preference to the Athenian. The conciſe vehemence of Demoſthenes carried all before it by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; the prolixity of Cicero gained ground by the ſoft arts of inſinuation. The effect of the former was ſudden and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that of the latter, comparatively weak and dilatory.</q>

                     <p>Dr. BLAIR ſhall bring up the rear in the liſt of thoſe critics who have compared Cicero and Demoſthenes. <q>The character of the latter is vigour and auſterity; that of Cicero is gentleneſs and inſinuation.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032455_0057_0FF269C15E3D12D8"/>Cicero would have placed himſelf forever below Demoſthenes.</p>
               <p>IT is the irrefragable force of the reaſoning; it is the irreſiſtible rapidity of the rhetorical movements, which characterize the Eloquence of the Athenian Orator. When he writes, it is to give ſtrength, energy, and vehemence to his thoughts. He ſpeaks, not as an elegant writer who wiſhes to be admired, but as a paſſionate man tormented by truth; as a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032455_0058_0FF269C312EED510"/>menaced with the greateſt misfortunes, and who can no longer contain the tranſports of his indignation againſt the enemies of his country.</p>
               <p>HE is the champion of Reaſon. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends her with all the ſtrength of his genius: and the roſtrum where he ſpeaks becomes the place of combat. He at once conquers his auditors, his adverſaries, his judges. He does not ſeem to endeavour to move you: hear him, however, and he ſhall cauſe you to weep upon reflection. He overwhelms his fellow citizens with reproaches; but, then, theſe are only the interpreters of their own remorſe.</p>
               <p>DOTH he refute an argument? He does not diſcuſs it. He propoſes a ſingle queſtion for the whole anſwer, and the objection no longer appears.</p>
               <p>DOTH he wiſh to ſtir up the Athenians againſt Philip? It is no more an Orator who ſpeaks: it is a General; it is a King; it is a Prophet; it is the Tutelar Angel of his country. And when he threatens his fellow citizens with ſlavery, we think that we hear from a diſtance the noiſe approaching of the rattling chains which the tyrant is bringing them.</p>
               <p>THE Philippics of Demoſthenes, and his famous Oration "pro corona," in favour of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032455_0059_0FF269981E370FC8"/>Cteſiphon, are juſtly admired; but I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the learned, and Chriſtian Orators read but little of his other works; his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the peace, his firſt and ſecond Olynthiac, his Oration of Cherſoneſus, and many other maſterly productions truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his genius. In theſe too much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten writings, and which ſeem to be of no ſervice to the reputation of Demoſthenes, we might be able to find ſufficient claims to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his fame, were all his other productions of Oratory unknown.</p>
               <p>IT is enough to repeat here one ſingle paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.—</p>
               <p>THE enemies of Demoſthenes, (certain wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without talents, Aeſchines excepted, who preſumed to conſider themſelves as his rivals becauſe they ſet themſelves up for Orators in Athens,) accuſed him of ſeeking, in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, rather his own reputation, than the public good. This great man, abuſed for a long while without complaining, deigned at length to confute their clamours in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the Athenian people. He thus addreſſes them in his Oration of Cherſoneſus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I AM ſo far from regarding all thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Orators as citizens deſerving of their country, that, ſhould any one ſay to me this moment, And thou, Demoſthenes, what ſervices haſt thou rendered to the<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032455_0060_0FF269AD8D48D548"/>Republic? I would neither, O Athenians, ſpeak of the expenſes I have incurred on behalf of my fellow-citizens in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my employments, nor of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives whom I have redeemed, nor of the gifts which I have preſented to the city, nor of all the monuments which will one day teſtify my zeal for my country; but this is the anſwer I ſhould make: My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct hath always been the reverſe of the maxims of theſe Orators. I could, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, have followed their example, and like them, have flattered you. But I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſacrificed my perſonal advantage, my ambition, and even the deſire of pleaſing you. I have addreſſed you ſo as to rank myſelf below other citizens, and to exalt you above the other people of Greece. O Athenians! permit me now to bear this witneſs of myſelf. No; I never indulged the expectation of attaining the firſt place among you, were I even to make you the loweſt of mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is to thoſe enemies, and to the ſad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of cruſhing them with all the weight of his genius and virtue, that Demoſthenes is indebted for this ſublime paſſage, one of the fineſt ſtrokes of his Eloquence.</p>
               <p>IT would be very eaſy to multiply ſimilar quotations, when ſpeaking of this Orator.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032455_0061_0FF26A701D1E5880"/>But it, is not my deſign to prevent public ſpeakers from reading him.

Is Demoſthenes an Orator who amuſes himſelf barely with tickling the ear, by the ſound and harmony of periods; or does he impoſe upon the mind by a florid ſtyle and ſnining thoughts? Such Eloquence may, indeed, dazzle and charm, the moment we hear it; but the impreſſion it makes is of a ſhort duration.

                     <p>Dr. BLAIR makes the following remarks on the ſtyle of Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes: <q>His Orations are ſtrongly animated; and full of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity and fire of public ſpirit. They proceed in a continued ſtrain of inductions, conſequences, and demonſtrations founded on ſound reaſon. The figures which he uſes are never ſought after; but always riſe from the ſubject. He employs them ſparingly indeed; for ſplendour and ornament are not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of this Orator's compoſition. It is an energy of thought peculiar to himſelf, which forms his character, and ſets him above all others. He attends much more to things than to words. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>arget the Orator, and think of the buſineſs. He warms the mind, and impels to action. He has no parade and oſtentation; no methods of inſinuation; no laboured introductions; but is like a man full of his ſubject, who, after preparing his audience by a ſentence or two for hearing plain truths, enters directly on buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.... The ſtyle of Demoſthenes is ſtrong and conciſe, though ſometimes, it muſt not be diſſembled, harſh and abrupt, His words are very expreſſive; his arrangement is firm and manly; and far from being unmuſical. Negligent of leſſer graces, he ſeems rather to have aimed at that ſublime which lies in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His action and pronunciation are recorded to have been uncommonly vehement and ardent; which, from the manner of his compoſition, we are naturally led to believe. The character which one forms of him, from reading his works, is of the auſtere, rather than the gentle kind. He is, on every occaſion, grave, ſerious, paſſionate; takes every thing on a high tone; never lets himſelf down, not attempts any thing like pleaſantry. If any fault can be found to his admirable Eloquence, it is, that he ſometimes borders on the hard and dry. He may alſo be thought to want ſmoothneſs and grace. But theſe defects are far more than compenſated, by that admirable and maſterly force of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Eloquence, which, as it overpowered all who heard it, cannot, at this day, be read without emotion.</q>

You would imagine that between the Biſhop of Bitonto, and the Biſhop of Meaux, there had elapſed an interval of many ages. There is not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the difference of a century and a half. But theſe two periods, ſo near to each other,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032455_0068_0FF2699DBABF4E80"/>are divided by all the diſtance which removes the groſſeſt barbariſm from the moſt refined taſte.</p>
               <p>WE have in the edition of the Council of Trent, publiſhed at Louvaine in 1567, all the ſermons which were delivered in the different ſeſſions, before that Aſſembly. There are ſome funeral Orations, and more than thirty other diſcourſes, which were preached by the Biſhops, by the Doctors of the Faculty of Paris, or by the Monks. That of the Biſhop of Bitonto is the only one which hath retained ſome celebrity; and as it is evidently the beſt of all, it is by this piece that we are enabled to judge of the Eloquence of the ſixteenth century.</p>
               <p>THIS ſermon contains ſome beauties of Oratory; but it is written without method, or taſte, and ſometimes preſents an indecent mixture of ſacred ſcripture and heathen my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology.</p>
               <p>THE Biſhop of Bitonto ſays, <q>That nature hath given us two hands, two eyes, and two feet, in order that man may be a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in epitome whilſt making uſe of all his members together; for one hand waſhes the other, and one foot ſuſtains the other.</q>

We might repeat twenty examples of this ſort from the ſame diſcourſe. But there is need of one quotation only, in order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the merit of an Orator, when we make it from Boſſuet.</p>

               <head>SECTION XVII. <hi>Of Interrogation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TIME, that deſtroyer of ill-founded repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, adds, every day, freſh luſtre to the glory of Boſſuet. I obſerve, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that this great Orator, whoſe merit hath been for ſome time attacked among us, is more warmly and univerſally admired ſince there has been a renunciation of the depraved taſte of the Eloquence of words. The vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032455_0070_0FF26AA8F09DE088"/>which diſtinguiſhes him, as it does Demoſthenes, appears to me frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from accumulated interrogations which are equally familiar to each of them.</p>
               <p>INDEED, of all the figures of Oratory, Interrogation is the moſt overwhelming and rapid. If it be employed in unfolding the principles on which the diſcourſe is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſpreads over it an inevitable obſcurity, and a ſpecies of declamation, which diſguſts perſons of good taſte. It is after a clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the obligations of the Chriſtian Religion, that particular details of its moral injunctions, enlivened by this impetuous movement, forcibly ſtrike the hearers, add remorſe to conviction, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, arm law againſt conſcience. It is by earneſt and repeated interrogations, that the Orator proves and attacks, accuſes and anſwers, doubts and affirms, affects and inſtructs. Is there, in Eloquence, a ſurer way to agitate the human heart, than by ſuch queſtions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another in rapid ſucceſſion, to which there is no need of waiting for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe that is unavoidable and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? Can we better manage the pride of the guilty, than by ſparing him the diſgrace of a direct reproach, at the very time we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of his foibles or his vices? Or ſay—how can we impart more force to truth,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032455_0071_0FF26A8051869A50"/>more weight to reaſon, than by confining ourſelves to the ſimple privilege of interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the wicked? By what means can ſuch an one elude the Orator, who ſhuts up all the avenues by which he endeavours to eſcape from himſelf? An Orator, who makes choice of him as judge, as ſole judge, as the private judge, of the receſſes of his own heart only, which he cannot miſtake? What anſwer will he return, if the general queſtions, which be himſelf converts into ſo many perſonal accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, ruſh upon him, and gather ſtrength? If, to theſe evidences overwhelming to the ſinner, there follows a ſublime and ſtriking repreſentation, which terrifies his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cauſes his thoughts to be greatly confuſed? Thus reſembling a ſolemn ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which the judge proceeds to pronounce upon the guilty, after having firſt confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
               <p>SUCH is that ſublime and famous Apoſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe, which MASSILLON addreſſes to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, in his ſermon, "on the ſmall number of the elect:" "O God! where are thine elect?" Theſe words, ſo plain, ſpread conſternation. Each hearer places himſelf in that liſt of reprobates which had preceded this paſſage. He dares no more reply to the Orator, who had, again and again, demanded of him, if he were of the number of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032455_0072_0FF269AF528D34E0"/>whoſe names alone ſhall be written in the book of life; but, entering with conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into his own heart, which ſpeaks ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently plain by its compunctions, he then imagines that he hears the irrevocable decree of his reprobation.</p>
               <p>THE eloquent RACINE almoſt always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by interrogations, in impaſſioned ſcenes; and this figure, which gives ſuch an ardent rapidity to his ſtyle, animates and warms all his arguments, none of which are ever cold, ſlat, or abſtracted.</p>
               <p>THE ſucceſs of this oratorical figure is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in Eloquence, when it is properly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. It is the natural language of a ſoul deeply affected. If you wiſh to ſee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it, a famous one now occurs to me.</p>
               <p>EVERY one knows that ſine introduction of CICERO, who, unable to expreſs the lively indignation of his patriotic zeal, ruſhes abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Cataline, and inſtantly overwhelms him by the vehemence of his interrogations. <q>How long, O Cataline, wilt thou abuſe our patience?

They are, indeed, on ſo many occaſions, the native language of paſſion, that their uſe is extremely frequent; and, in ordinary converſation, when men are heated, they prevail as much as in the moſt ſublime Oratory. The unfigured literal uſe of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation is to aſk a queſtion; but when men are prompted by paſſion, whatever they would affirm, or deny, with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, they naturally put in the form of a queſtion; expreſſing thereby the ſtrongeſt confidence of the truth of their own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and appealing to their hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſhall he not do it? Or hath he ſpoken? And ſhall he not make it good?' (<hi>Numbers</hi> xxiii. 19.) So Demoſthenes, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the Athenians; 'Tell me, will you ſtill go about and aſk one another, what news? What can be more aſtoniſhing news than this, that the man of Macedon makes war upon the Athenians, and diſpoſes of the affairs of Greece? Is Philip dead? No, but he is ſick. What ſignifies it to you whether he be dead or alive? For, if any thing happens to this Philip, you will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately raiſe up another.' All this, delivered without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, had been faint and ineffectual; but the warmth and eagerneſs which this queſtioning method expreſſes, awaken the hearers, and ſtrike them with much greater force.</q>

                        <q>Much to the ſame purpoſe we may add thoſe ſublime interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the book of Job, where the Almighty is himſelf the Speaker; and that in the eleventh chapter of the ſame poem: Canſt thou by ſearching find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is high as heaven, what canſt then do? deeper than hell, what canſt thou know? All the energy of this paſſage would be loſt if once diveſted of the interrogations; ſhould it be ſaid, Thou canſt not by ſearching find out God: Thou canſt not find out the Almighty unto perfection: it is high as heaven, and thou canſt do nothing; and it is deep as hell, and thou canſt know nothing.</q>

                        <q>Another very happy illuſtration of the force of this figure may be brought from the ſpeech of St. PAUL, (<hi>Acts</hi> xxvi.) where, with aſtoniſhing effect, he transfers his diſcourſe from Feſtus to Agrippa. In verſe 26 he ſpeaks of him in the third perſon? The King, ſays he, 'knows of thoſe things, before whom alſo I ſpeak freely.' He then turns abruptly upon him: 'King Agrippa, believeſt thou the Prophets?' And immediately anſwers his own queſtion: 'I know that thou believeſt.'

                  </note> Often devoid of taſte, they deſcend, I confeſs, to burleſque details; but they forcibly ſtrike the ſenſes; their threatenings impreſs terror; the people liſten to them with profit: many among them have ſublime ſtrokes; and an Orator doth not hear them without advantage, when he is ſkilful in obſerving the important effects of his art.</p>
               <p>M. BRIDAINE, the man, who, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, is the moſt juſtly celebrated in this way, was born with a popular Eloquence, abounding with metaphorical and ſtriking
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032455_0076_0FF269B11F5604B8"/>expreſſions; and no one ever poſſeſſed, in a higher degree, the rare talent of arreſting the attention of an aſſembled multitude.</p>
               <p>HE had ſo fine a voice, as to render cradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the wonders which hiſtory relates of the declamation of the ancients, for he was as eaſily heard by ten thouſand people in the open fields, as if he had ſpoken under the moſt reſounding arch. In all he ſaid, there were obſervable unexpected ſtrokes of Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the boldeſt metaphors, thoughts ſudden, new, and ſtriking, all the marks of a rich im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination, ſome paſſages, ſometimes even whole diſcourſes, compoſed with care, and written with an equal combination of taſte and animation.</p>
               <p>I REMEMBER to have heard him deliver the introduction of the firſt diſcourſe which he preached in the Church of St. Sulpice, in 1751. The firſt company in the capital went, out of curioſity, to hear him.</p>
               <p>BRIDAINE perceived among the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many Biſhops, and perſons of the firſt rank, as well as a vaſt number of eccleſiaſtics. This ſight, far from intimidating, ſuggeſted to him the following exordium, ſo far at leaſt as my memory remains, of a paſſage, with which I have been always ſenſibly affected, and, which, perhaps, will not appear unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Boſſuet, or Demoſthenes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:032455_0077_0FF26A81FB0567D0"/>
                  <q>AT the ſight of an Auditory ſo new to me, methinks, my brethren, I ought only to open my mouth to ſolicit your favour in behalf of a poor miſſionary, deſtitute of all thoſe talents which you require of thoſe who ſpeak to you about your ſalvation. Nevertheleſs, I experience to-day, a feeling very different. And, if I am caſt down, ſuſpect me not of being depreſſed by the wretchech uncaſineſs occaſioned by vanity, as if I were accuſtomed to preach myſelf. God forbid that a miniſter of Heaven ſhould ever ſuppoſe he needed an excuſe with you! for, whoever ye may be, ye are all of you ſinners like myſelf. It is before your God and mine, that I feel myſelf impelled at this moment to ſtrike my breaſt. UNTIL now, I have proclaimed the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of the Moſt High in Churches covered with thatch. I have preached the rigours of penance to the unfortunate who wanted bread. I have declared to the good inhabitants of the country the moſt awful truths of my religion. Unhappy man! what have I done? I have made ſad the poor, the beſt friends of my God! I have conveyed terror and grief into thoſe ſimple and honeſt ſouls, whom I ought to have pitied and conſoled! It is here only where I behold the great, the rich, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032455_0078_0FF26AB0A8019F78"/>of ſuffering humanity, or ſinners daring and hardened. Ah! it is here only where the ſacred word ſhould be made to reſound with all the force of its thunder; and where I ſhould place with me in this pulpit, on the one ſide, Death which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens you, and on the other, my great God, who is about to judge you. I hold to-day your ſentence in my hand. Tremble then in my preſence, ye proud and diſdainful men who hear me! The neceſſity of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the certainty of death, the uncertainty of that hour, ſo terrifying to you, final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, the juſt judgment, the number of the elect, hell, and above all, Eternity! Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! Theſe are the ſubjects upon which I am come to diſcourſe, and which I ought, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to have reſerved for you alone. Ah! what need have I of your commendation, which, perhaps, might damn me, without ſaving you? God is about to rouſe you, while his unworthy miniſter ſpeaks to you! for I have had a long experience of his mercies. Penetrated with a deteſtation of your paſt iniquities, and ſhedding tears of ſorrow and repentance, you will, then, throw your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into my arms; and, by this remorſe, you will prove that I am ſufficiently elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHO doth not, by this time, perceive, how much this Eloquence excels the frigid
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032455_0079_0FF269B942A05148"/>and miſerable pretenſions of modern wit? In apologizing, ſo to ſpeak, for having preached upon hell in the villages, Bridaine boldly aſſumed all the authority over his auditory, which belonged to his office, and prepared their hearts for the awful truths, which he intended to announce. This Exordium alone gave him a right to ſay every thing. Many perſons ſtill remember his ſermon on Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the terror which he diffuſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the congregation, whilſt blending, as was usual with him, quaint compariſons with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime tranſports, he exclaimed, <q>What foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, my brethren, have you for ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your dying day at ſuch a diſtance? Is it your youth? 'Yes', you anſwer; 'I am, as yet, but twenty, but thirty'. Sirs, it is not you who are twenty or thirty years old, it is death which has already advanced twenty or thirty years towards you. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: Eternity approaches. Do you know what this Eternity is? It is a pendulum whoſe vibration ſays continually, Always —Ever—Ever—Always—Always! In the mean while, a reprobate cries out, 'What o'clock is it? And the ſame voice anſwers, Eternity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE thundering voice of Bridaine, added, on thoſe occaſions, a new energy to his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and the Auditory, familiarized to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032455_0080_0FF2697B1621E4C0"/>his language and ideas, appeared at ſuch times in diſmay before him. The profound ſilence which reigned in the congregation, eſpecially when he preached until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of night, was interrupted from time to time, and in a manner very perceptible, by the long and mournful ſighs, which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all at once, from every corner of the Church where he was ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>ORATORS! ye who are wholly engroſſed about your own reputation, fall at the feet of this apoſtolic man, and learn from a miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, wherein true Eloquence conſiſts. The people! the people! they are the, principal, and, perhaps, the beſt judges of your talents.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Whoever, upon compariſon, is deemed, by a common Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the greateſt Orator, ought moſt certainly to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch, by men of ſcience and erudition. And, though an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Orator may triumph for a long time, and be eſteemed altogether perfect by the vulgar, who are ſatisfied with his accompliſhments, and know not in what he is defective; yet, whenever the true genius ariſes, he draws to him the attention of every one, and immediately appears ſuperior to his rival.</q>

               </head>
               <p>THE ſucceſs of this ſort of popular Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is infallible, when there is unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a voice ſufficiently ſtrong to maintain its
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032455_0081_0FF26A8C2A829950"/>vehemence, and a taſte ſufficiently delicate to avoid its eccentricities.</p>
               <p>HENCE we draw this concluſion, that it is a great error to diſcard, from the goſpel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, thoſe awful ſubjects, which enkindle the imagination of the Preacher, while they tend to arouſe every conſcience. Beſides that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is founded upon thoſe awful truths, which its miniſters ought not to conceal, and which men are afraid to hear, in proportion to their tendency to produce a converſion. I know no ſubjects which give a more ample ſcope to the art of Oratory.</p>
               <p>THE Chriſtian Orator, who is above enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his compoſitions with them, renounces his greateſt advantages.</p>
               <p>BUT, while we preſent theſe objects of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, we cannot be too ſtrongly convinced that it would be better to leave ſinners in ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than to drive them to deſpair; that this is not ſo much to reach the end as to exceed all bounds; that the goſpel is a law of love, and not a code of wrath; that men are nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally ſo weak that their faults ought to excite more compaſſion than anger; that a Preacher is not the miniſter of the vengeance of Heaven, but the diſpenſer of its mercies; that inſtead of repelling ſinners, it is proper to affect, to win, to reclaim them through fear to love; and to attemper the rigour of the law with the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032455_0082_0FF26AB2638E0148"/>attraction of the rewards of the goſpel. Yes; it would be doubtleſs too ſevere, only to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce threatenings to men, who need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to be encouraged and conſoled.</p>
               <p>MAKE choice of affecting ſubjects, which lay hold of, and intereſt, the man and the Chriſtian. Be ſerupulous about chooſing thoſe confined ſubjects, which circumſcribe the Orator within too narrow bounds, which are connected with no moral precept, or which make a part of all diſcourſes on morality. Avoid frivolous ſubjects, whoſe ſurface ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſhowy, but which when we attempt to ſearch into them, only preſent us with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars too inſignificant and ſlender for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; ſuch as treat of matters of decorum rather than of duty; ſuch as ſuggeſt materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for a letter rather than grounds for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Avoid quaint ſubjects, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for the multitude, merely ſerving the Orator himſelf for a pompous declamation, in which the human heart can take no intereſt; philoſophical and abſtract ſubjects, equally remote from religion and Eloquence, and more adapted to the Portico or the Lyceum, than to the Goſpel pulpit; thoſe ſubjects, in a word, which, though they may have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being novel and animating, are really far-fetched and affected, and, in which, a diſcovery is made, not ſo much of genius, as of the want of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:032455_0083_0FF26A8DDD746F90"/>
MANY good ſubjects ſtill remain for Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Orators to invent or revive. But then is no need to ſearch for them, when they do not Happen to preſent themſelves naturally to the mind, as by an involuntary inſpiration.</p>
               <p>BEGIN with ſtudying the prevailing best of your genius; and, after having tried your ſtrength on different ſubjects of argument, imagination, or ſentiment, conſtantly follow that ſort, which is moſt peculiarly your own, and which nature itſelf hath deſtined for you.</p>
               <p>BE not afraid of going in beaten tracks. A fertile Orator always diſcovers new trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in old mines. Wherefore ſhould we heſitate to enter afreſh upon thoſe ſubjects which have been already ſucceſsfully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? It is becauſe our great maſters have laid hold of all their moſt ſtriking beauties, and that in draining thoſe fields, formerly ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they have changed them into barren de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts?</p>
               <p>LET us here be candid. If we were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe lucid plans, thoſe original ideas, which we ſo juſtly admire in their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhould we have conceived them of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? The ſuperiority of the models ought to enkindle our emulation, inſtead of damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our courage.</p>
               <p>IF Boſſuet, Bourdaloue, Maſiillon, were to return upon earth, think we, that their genius
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032455_0084_0FF26AB89E20B138"/>would be ſo fettered by their former maſterly performances, as to be incapable of freſh productions? or that theſe immortal Orators would not, even at this day, have been equal to themſelves? Exert your talents and zeal! The ſubjects, which ſeem to be exhauſted, will immediately receive new life: and the Orator, who can even now acquire original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, after theſe primitive men, ſhall participate their renown through all ages.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHEREFORE ſhould we ſuppoſe that we could ſucceed better in Eloquence by making choice of ſubjects leſs known, when we ſo ſeldom obſerve diſtinguiſhed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the ſpecies of Panegyric, although the maſters of the art have not hitherto travelled this road with that eclat which they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in delivering doctrinal and moral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes? The new ſubjects in this branch of Eloquence, which remain for Chriſtian Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to handle, do not infallibly ſuggeſt to their minds the moſt eloquent Orations. This remark proves that not new ſubjects, but new
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032455_0085_0FF26A8FA362FD90"/>ideas, are wanting, in order to excel in the art of Oratory.</p>
               <p>NOTHING, however, is more adapted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the imagination, than the praiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by the ſacred miniſtry on thoſe Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian heroes, whoſe examples do credit to our religion, while they condemn our behaviour.</p>
               <p>IF it be an excellent and pleaſing ſight to behold perſons aſſembled in a Church, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being inſtructed in all the duties of religion, it is alſo, without doubt, a very noble inſtitution to have altars erected to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and public eulogiums decreed to the moſt reverend ſaints, whom religion holds up to the imitation of her children. But men, whoſe lives, although in other reſpects unblemiſhed, have been, notwithſtanding, not much known, do not furniſh ſufficient materials for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>To acquire and maintain the honour of ſuch ſolemn homage, it is neceſſary to poſſeſs celebrity proceeding from ſuperior genius, or brilliant actions; to have obtained a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed influence over the age, or, at leaſt, over the country, in which one has lived; to have formed an epoch in the hiſtory of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; to be exalted above the common vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; to have outlived oneſelf by illuſtrious monuments; and to appear before poſterity with a reputation commanding reſpect: for,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032455_0086_0FF269CCC9D19490"/>in ſpite of all the pomp of declaimers, a ſaint unknown will only obtain eulogiums unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed like himſelf.</p>
               <p>THE moſt common fault, attending this ſpecies of diſcourſe, is, a failure in giving a juſt deſcription of the character of the man who is praiſed.</p>
               <p>PANEGYRISTS more or leſs dwell upon the ſurface, inſtead of penetrating to the bottom, of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>MOST Panegyrics, diſtinguiſhed from one another merely by the title, are equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all ſaints in ſimilar circumſtances, and conſequently do not characterize any one.</p>
               <p>IT is on this account that we have not, as yet, any collection of the kind, which could be quoted for a model.</p>
               <p>THE Panegyrics of Flechier, ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled as maſter-pieces in the rhetoric of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, are, in the preſent day, extremely fallen from their ancient glory.</p>
               <p>THOSE of Maſſillon are univerſally conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as the leaſt valuable of his productions. We are continually loſing ſight of the ſaint, whom the Orator is praiſing to purſue long digreſſions of morality, generally foreign to the ſubject, and of which, not one paſſage is remembered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:032455_0087_0FF26A9367AC4FA0"/>
THE inattention of Preachers has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſguſt of the public. This ſpecies of compoſition is now pretty generally abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Excepting a very ſmall number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged ſubjects, which ſhould never be given up, Panegyrics are very rarely pronounced in the pulpits of Paris.</p>
               <p>IT is when compoſing theſe ſacred eulogies that we ought eſpecially to keep in view this diſtinguiſhed maxim of Boileau, "Nothing is beautiful but truth."</p>
               <p>IT is allowable to embelliſh facts by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, or by contraſts, provided that we confine ourſelves to thoſe innocent artifices of Eloquence; but it is ridiculous to pretend a falſe admiration, which every one ſees through, and in which no one participates.</p>
               <p>INDETERMINATE commendations, common places, accumulated epithets, deceitful adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diſguſtful exaggerations, diſcover igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or knavery, and at once deſtroy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the auditory.</p>
               <p>LET the Orator, then, always reflect that he is placed in the Pulpit of truth; that he is ſurrounded with a number of intelligent hearers; that that which ceaſes to be probable is revolting; that the public opinion is never impoſed on with impunity; and that extrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agant compliments debaſe him who beſtows
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032455_0088_0FF26999CAED4978"/>them without ever exalting him who receives them. Lyſippus ſaid juſtly, that he had honoured Alexander more by repreſenting him with a pike in his hand, than Apelles, who always painted him hurling the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt like Jupiter.</p>
               <p>WHEN the ſubject of a panegyric is fertile in events, the moral ought to ariſe out of the hiſtorical narrative, without ſmothering, it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a heap of reflections which occur to every auditor. A method too didactic would be injurious to the diſcourſe, by impeding its rapidity.</p>
               <p>THOROUGHLY comprehend the character and actions of the man whom you celebrate. Surround him with his contemporaries. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the manners of the age in which he lived. Collect, combine, all the particulars which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>end to the ſame point, that, with them, you may frame your materials. Arrange, ſo to ſpeak, the virtues, the talents, the events, the misfortunes, which hiſtory preſents to your view, and you will then impart to your narrations all the ſtrength of argument, and all the glow of Eloquence.</p>
               <p>WE cannot but reprobate the method of thoſe inanimate Panegyriſts, who confound rhetorical diſtribution with chronological or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>

VINCENT DE PAUL; a man of great virtue, though poſſeſſed of but little renown; the beſt citizen whom France hath had; the Apoſtle of humanity, who, after having been a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd in his childhood, hath left in his country eſtabliſhments of more utility to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, than the fineſt monuments of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, Louis XIV.</p>
               <p>HE was, ſucceſſively, a ſlave at Tunis, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor of the Cardinal de Retz, Miniſter of a village, Chaplain-General of the galleys, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of a college, Chief of the miſſions, and Joint-Commiſſioner of Eccleſiaſtical Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note n="*" place="bottom">Adjoint au miniſtère de la feuille des Beáneáfices.</note> He inſtituted, in France, the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032455_0092_0FF2696B4A947B18"/>of the Lazariſts, and of the Daughters of Charity, who devote themſelves to the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the unfortunate, and who ſcarcely ever change their condition, although their vows only bind them for a year. He endowed hoſpitals for foundlings, for orphans, for the inſane, for galley-ſlaves, and for old men. His generous compaſſion reached all kinds of wretchedneſs, with which the human ſpecies is oppreſſed, and monuments of his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence are to be found throughout all the provinces of the kingdom. When reading his life, we remark, that nothing does more honour to religion, than the hiſtory of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions formed in favour of humanity, when humanity is beholden for them to the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the altars. Whilſt kings, armed againſt each other, ravage the earth already laid waſte by other ſcourges. Vincent de Paul, the ſon of a huſbandman of Gaſcony, repaired the public calamities, and diſtributed more than twenty millions of livres in Champagne, in Picardy, in Lorraine, in Artois, where the inhabitants of whole villages were dying through want, and were afterwards left in the fields without burial, until he undertook to defray the expenſes of interment. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, for ſome time, an office of zeal and charity towards the gallies. He ſaw, one day, a wretched galley-ſlave, who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to three years confinement for ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032455_0093_0FF26A9D40902A40"/>and who appeared inconſolable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his wife and children having been left in the greateſt diſtreſs. Vincent de Paul ſenſibly affected with his ſituation, offered to put himſelf in his ſtead, and, what doubtleſs will ſcarcely be credited, the exchange was accepted. This virtuous man was chained among the crew of galley-ſlaves, and his ſent continued to be ſwollen during the remainder of his life, from the weight of thoſe honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able irons which he had borne.</p>
               <p>IT is evident how much an action like this is capable of ſuggeſting to the mind of an Orator; and that he would be unworthy or his profeſſion, if he related it without excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tears.</p>
               <p>WHEN this great man came to Paris, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings were ſold in the ſtreet of St. Landry for twenty ſous a piece; and the charge of theſe innocent creatures was committed, out of charity, as was reported, to diſeaſed women, from whom they ſucked corrupted milk.</p>
               <p>THESE infants whom Government aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to public compaſſion, almoſt all periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſuch as happened to eſcape ſo many dangers were introduced clandeſtinely into opulent families, in order to diſpoſſeſs the legitimate heirs. This, for more than a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, was a never-failing ſource of litigation, the particulars of which are to be found in
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032455_0094_0FF26ABC5D842700"/>the compilation of our old lawyers. Vincent de Paul at once provided funds for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of twelve of theſe children. His charity was ſoon extended to the relief of all thoſe who were left expoſed at the doors of the churches. But that unuſual zeal, which always gives life to a new inſtitution, having cooled, the reſources entirely failed, and freſh outrages were renewed on humanity.</p>
               <p>VINCENT DE PAUL was not diſcouraged. He convoked an extraordinary aſſembly. He cauſed a number of thoſe wretched infants to be placed in the church; and forthwith mounting the pulpit, he pronounced, with his eyes bathed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ears, that diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which doth as much honour to his piety as his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and which I faithfully tranſcribe from the hiſtory of his life, drawn up by M. Abelly, Biſhop of Rhodes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>COMPASSION and charity have aſſuredly induced you, Ladies, to adopt theſe little creatures for your children.

Ceaſe, for the preſent, to be their mothers, that ye may become their judges. Their life and their death are in your hands. I am going to put it to the vote, and to take the ſuffrages. It is time to pronounce their

               <p>SIGHS were the only anſwer to this pathetic exhortation: and the ſame day, in the ſame church, at that very time, the Foundling Hoſpital at Paris was founded and endowed with a revenue of forty thouſand livres.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſucceſs attending this diſcourſe of Vincent de Paul, in the erection of the Foundling Hoſpital at Paris, is elſewhere (§ 48) compared to that of the Biſhop of Worceſter's ſermon, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the public benevolence to found an Hoſpital for Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in London; and hence our author is led to remark, that "Eloquence could not obtain a more excellent triumph."

               <p>IT is common in Panegyrics, or in funeral Orations, for Orators to ſketch the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of contemporaries who have been the rivals or antagoniſts of the man whoſe virtues are praiſed. Such paſſages are commonly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               <p>WHEN Maſſillon preached to the Nuns of Chilot, in the preſence of the Queen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he drew the picture of the Prince of Orange, to pleaſe the conſort of King James; but his genius rendered him no ſervice on this occaſion. Maſſillon only introduces one thought, in order to deſcribe William III. which he expreſſes with ſufficient preciſion, and afterwards dilates with his uſual elegance, but without thoroughly inveſtigating the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Stadtholder, or availing himſelf of the reſult of the hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:032455_0098_0FF26ABE26594E78"/>
HIS amplification was more adapted to conſole the Queen of England, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Prince of Orange. It may ſerve for an illuſtration of the fact, that Maſſillon enlarged too much on the ſame idea, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely miſapplied his fluency of expreſſion.</p>
               <p>WOULD you wiſh to know how Boſſuet has deſcribed the Protector CROMWELL? Contraſt with the exceſſive copiouſneſs of the Biſhop of Clermont, the energetic impetuoſity of the Biſhop of Meaux. Nothing will more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mark the difference of their genius.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A MAN, in whom was combined an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible depth of mind, the refined hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and the ſkilful politician; a man, capable of any undertaking, and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found diſſimulation; equally active and indefatigable in peace and war; who left nothing to Fortune, that he could take from her, either by reſolution or foreſight; withal ſo vigilant, and prepared on every ſide, that he never neglected the opportunities, with which ſhe preſented him.

               <p>SINCE the diſcuſſion of the different rules, to which the art of Eloquence ſubjects Chriſtian Orators, hath led me on to various epiſodical details, I muſt not proceed to more it portant matters, without dwelling a little longer on another branch of miniſterial wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, which has much affinity to Panegyrics, and eſpecially to the deſcription of characters.</p>
               <p>I MEAN to ſpeak of COMPLIMENTS, with which we are ſometimes led to begin, or finiſh, our pulpit diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>ESTABLISHED uſage no longer permits the miniſters of the goſpel to preach the ſacred word before the rulers of the world, without burning at their feet ſome grains of incenſe. Kings are, therefore, much to be pitied, who
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032455_0100_0FF26B8C00A6EA78"/>are purſued with flattery in thoſe very Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where they come to learn their duty, and to be humbled for their faults: but it is, alſo, to be regretted, that Chriſtian Orators, who ought then to ſpeak as the conſcience of the guilty, ſhould degrade themſelves to a level with a crowd of flatterers. What muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs comfort them, is, the aſſurance that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations enjoined upon the man who offers them, cannot dazzle the great, to whom they are addreſſed.</p>
               <p>LET no one, however, exceed the bounds of juſt praiſe; for religion doth not permit it any farther than is conſiſtent with truth.</p>
               <p>LET us ever recognize an Apoſtle as an enemy to falſehood, even in thoſe Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherein one might ſo often ſuppoſe himſelf freed from the obligation of ſincerity.

               <p>ADULATION always diſpleaſes. <q>To praiſe Princes for virtues which they have not,</q> ſays the Duke de Rochefoucauld, <q>is to inſult

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Thought, 320.</note> It is, at leaſt, to forget the reſpect which is due to them.</p>
               <p>EUSEBIUS, in "the life of Conſtantine,"<note n="†" place="bottom">B. iv. chap. 4.</note> relates, that this Emperor impoſed ſilence upon a preacher, who was baſe enough to imitate, in his ſermon, the fiction of Virgil reſpecting the Apotheoſis of Auguſtus, by telling Conſtantine, that, after his death, he ſhould be aſſociated with the Son of God in the government of the univerſe.</p>
               <p>I ADMIRE in Boſſuet, that noble and manly freedom, which he always poſſeſſed, through ſear of flattery. We diſcern, in his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a certain apoſtolic ſeverity, and a marked diſlike of adulation.</p>
               <p>HAD an indifferent perſon been nominated to praiſe Madam de la Valliere, for entering into a religious order, in the preſence of Queen Maria Thereſa, he would not have declined ſuch an opportunity of extolling the virtues of the conſort of Louis XIV.</p>
               <p>"IT is proper", ſaid Boſſuet to her, <q>it is fit, Madam, that as you form by your rank ſo conſiderable a part of worldly grandeur, you ſhould ſometimes join in ceremonies, wherein we learn to undervalue it.</q> The Orator then recals his ſubject, and thinks no more of the Princeſs.</p>

FENELON never weakened, in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the force of the ſacred maxims, which he hath recorded in Telemachus againſt flatterers.</p>
               <p>ONE ſingle Compliment of this kind is alone extant. It is to be found towards the concluſion of the diſcourſe, which he deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered at the Conſecration of the Elector of Cologne. That paſſage is alike worthy of Fenelon, by its diſtinguiſhed moderation, as well as by the rhetorical expreſſion, which he makes uſe of, to juſtify the reſervedneſs of his eulogium.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>YOU have juſt heard, my brethren, all that I have ſaid to this Prince. What have I not dared to ſay to him? And what ought I not to be bold to ſay to him, ſince his only fear is not to know the truth? The greateſt praiſe would do him infinitely leſs honour, than the epiſcopal liberty with which he wiſhes me to addreſs him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is difficult to adopt a direct addreſs in Compliments, without appearing either to exaggerate, or to have an uniformity of ſtyle, and alſo without embarraſſing the perſon too much, whom we mean to praiſe.</p>
               <p>IT is preferable to include them in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe of the holy ſcriptures, or in prayer to God, or in an apoſtrophe addreſſed to the auditory.</p>

BUT, whatever be the mode of expreſſion that we ſelect, the Compliment delivered muſt be connected with the ſubject under diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; common places, which characterize no one, muſt be avoided; inſtruction muſt be blended with praiſe, or, rather, be made to proceed out of the praiſe itſelf; we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves to a ſmall number of lively and ſtriking ideas; and endeavour to conclude with a paſſage happily expreſſed, and eaſily remembered.</p>
               <p>BOURDALOUE never excelled in this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. All his compliments are trivial. In the ſermon he preached at Verſailles, two days after the marriage of the Duke of Bourbon, ſon of the great Dauphin, with Adelaide of Savoy, he repeated, towards his concluſion, a paſſage of ſcripture, the application of which forcibly ſtruck the auditory. Some eſteemed it a very happy alluſion, while others were of opinion, that it degenerated into a play of words.</p>
               <p>AFTER a very inſtructive eulogium, Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloue ſpeaks, in theſe terms, of the young Princeſs:</p>

ATTEMPT not, then, to write a book, when you are compoſing a ſermon. Guard againſt ever adopting the languid trammels of a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who ſpeaks from his pen, or his paper, while I ſhould be attending to his diſcourſe as the inſpiration of the moment.</p>
               <p>ARE you deſirous that your Eloquence may be animated? Subſtitute for the languor of a continued diſcourſe, the livelineſs of an immediate addreſs. Converſe continually with your hearers. Inſtead of wandering in abſtract contemplations, as if you were meditating in ſolitude, ſpeak to that numerous aſſembly, which gathers around to hear you.</p>
               <p>YOU will find a very good example of this direct addreſs, in <q>the familiar inſtruction of Maſſillon, upon the ceremony of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</q> an admirable exhortation, which, bears no reſemblance to any of his other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and, in which, each expreſſion is a dart thrown by the Orator, transfixing the hearts of his Auditory!</p>
               <p>To ſpeak to the hearers is not ſufficient. It is alſo requiſite to make them ſpeak them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to add to the variegated charms of an immediate addreſs, the never failing and increaſing effect of Dialogue.</p>
               <p>THE ancients diſcuſſed, in Dialogues, the moſt philoſophic ſubjects. Theſe men, who
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032455_0106_0FF26B8FCEB5BF40"/>knew ſo well how to imitate nature, did not compoſe inanimate books, when they meant to unfold the ideas which they had collected in their meditations. They approached to the manner of the drama. They placed, upon the ſtage, ſome friends, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſe converſations they reported. They thus diſcuſſed various oppoſite opinions, with an equal mixture of wiſdom and urbanity. They made choice of each reader for a judge; and hence it is, that they have diffuſed over the writings of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, all that delight, which is experienced while attending to the converſation of a ſelect number of intelligent gueſts, who mutually impart each other's thoughts, in the agreeable freedom of an entertainment.</p>
               <p>IF, by this mode of Dialogue, Plato and Cicero have ſucceeded in enlivening meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical ſubjects, how much greater impulſe and life would it not impart to Eloquence?</p>
               <p>IN Oratory, Dialogue ſupplies the place of alternate ſpeakers, breaks the monotony, gives ſtrength to the argument, and inſpires confidence, provided the Orator does not weaken thoſe difficulties which he ought to propoſe to himſelf; for, if the hearer can render the objections more forcible than the Orator, he will no longer attend to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</p>
               <p>

BESIDES, nothing is better calculated for reviving the attention, than thoſe ſuſpenſions, properly managed, which cauſe the hearers to fluctuate in a kind of uncertainty, proceeding at firſt from an emotion of ſurpriſe, when the Orator ſtarts objections to himſelf, which he afterwards converts into curioſity, when he refutes them.</p>
               <p>I AM often delighted with thoſe cogent queſtions in the Diſcourſes of MASSILLON, which engage the attention of the hearers, at the very moment when they might be apt to withdraw it.</p>
               <p>AN example of this ſort occurs in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon "on the mixture of the righteous and the wicked."</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE righteous deprive iniquity of every excuſe. Do you ſay that you have done no more than to follow eſtabliſhed prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents? But have the righteous, who are among you, conformed to them? Do you plead the unavoidable conſequences of illuſtrious deſcent? You know ſome, who, with a name ſtill more diſtinguiſhed than your own, impart ſanctity to ſplendor. Do you plead the vivacity of your years?—the weakneſs of your ſex? Every day will ſhew you ſome, who, in the bloom of youth, and with all the talents ſuited to this world,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032455_0108_0FF26B921BCEF520"/>have their minds ſupremely bent on Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Is it the diſtraction of buſineſs? You may ſee thoſe engaged in the ſame cares with yourſelf, who, notwithſtanding, make ſalvation their principal concern. Is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your delight? Pleaſure is the firſt deſire of all men, and of the righteous, in ſome of whom it is even ſtronger, and whoſe natural diſpoſitions are leſs favourable to virtue, than in you. Do you plead your afflictions? There are ſome good men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed. Or proſperity? There are thoſe to be met with, who, amidſt their abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, devote themſelves to God. Or the ſtate of your health? You diſcover ſome, who, in ſickly bodies, poſſeſs ſouls filled with divine fortitude. Turn yourſelf which way you will; as many righteous, as many the witneſſes which teſtify againſt you.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The diſcuſſion of a variety of important ſubjects in the form of Dialogue has been frequently adopted. The ancient Greek and Roman Writers abounded in this method of compoſition. Among others, PLATO, LUCIAN, CICERO, MACROBIUS, the author of the <hi>Dialogue concerning the Cauſes of the Corruption of Eloquence</hi> (aſcribed by ſome to Tacitus, and by others to Quintilian;) AESCHINES, SOCRATICUS, MINUTIUS, FELIX, XENOPHON,<note n="†" place="bottom">XENOPLION may, without much impropriety, be called a Dialogue-writer; for, though his writings are not in the direct form of Dialogue, yet he continually makes his characters ſpeak in their own language. HOMER, alſo, abounds in this form of Dialogue.

               <p>STYLE loſes its fulneſs and energy, when words are environed with cumbrous epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets.</p>
               <p>It hath been remarked, that, in the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical analyſis of languages, the ſubſtantive
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032455_0115_0FF26AFA2AEDBF00"/>is nothing, as it were, becauſe <hi>abſtract,</hi> and the adjective every thing, becauſe it is <hi>ſenſible.</hi> But it is not ſo in Eloquence, where, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Epithet not being required by the accompanying word, oppreſſes the period, without ſtrengthening the thought.<note n="*" place="bottom">"Feeble writers," ſays Dr. BLAIR, <q>employ a multitude of words to make themſelves underſtood, as they think more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly; and they only confound the reader. They are ſenſible of not having caught the preciſe expreſſion, to convey what they would ſignify; they do not, indeed, conceive their own meaning very preciſely themſelves; and, therefore, help it out, as they can, by this and the other word, which may, as they ſuppoſe, ſupply the defect, and bring you ſomewhat nearer to their idea: they are always going about it, and about it, but never juſt hit the thing. The image, as they ſet it before you, is always double; and no double image is diſtinct. When an author tells me of his <hi>courage</hi> in the day of battle, the expreſſion is preciſe, and I underſtand it fully. But if, from the deſire of multiplying words, he will needs praiſe his <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>fortitude;</hi> at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he joins theſe words together, my idea begins to waves. He means to expreſs one quality more ſtrongly; but he is, in truth, expreſſing two. <hi>Courage</hi> reſiſts danger; <hi>fortitude</hi> ſupports pain. The occaſion of exerting each of theſe qualities is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and being led to think of both together, when only one of them ſhould be in my view, my view is rendered unſteady, and my conception of the object indiſtinct.</q>

               <p>CHRISTIAN Orators, do you, yourſelves, eraſe ſuch diſguſting pleonaſms. Paſs a critical judgment upon your productions, and, together with ſuch inſignificant expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, baniſh all thoſe negligencies of ſtyle, which degrade the ſublimity of the ideas.</p>
               <p>IT is not required that the whole of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhould be equally ſtriking; but it is requiſite that it be all equally well written, and that Eloquence make amends, by the beauty of the expreſſion, for the quality of the thoughts when they are ordinary; juſt as ſculpture adds, by the richneſs of the drapery, to the elegance of the figures.</p>
               <p>WE muſt allow pauſes for admiration. This is chiefly neceſſary for the ſake of energy. If, therefore, it be remarked that there are many very eloquent paſſages in a ſermon
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032455_0117_0FF26B5376345BA8"/>compoſed with care, and containing forcible arguments, the praiſe will be ſufficient; ſince there is none as yet extant, which is in all reſpects perfect.</p>
               <p>Is the merit of a pure and elegant ſtyle your ambition? Multiply the copies of your diſcourſes, and ceaſe not to tranſcribe your performance until you are able to afford ſatisfaction to yourſelf.</p>
               <p>AN Orator ought to adopt the motto of Caeſar, who <q>thought that he had done nothing, while there remained any thing for him to do.</q> The more he writes, the better he writes; and it is only by ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tediouſneſs of reiterated tranſcriptions, that he can diſplay in his ſtyle all the elegance of his taſte.</p>
               <p>HENCE it is, that very few men of learning employ all their powers to advantage. The greater part, being accuſtomed to reſt too ſoon contented, die without ever having known the extent of their own talents.</p>
               <p>FRESH ideas, the beauties of enlargement, the exquiſite ſentiment of a finiſhed paſſage, which Horace ſo well defined and reliſhed when he called it, <hi>qui me mihi reddat amicum;</hi> in a word, the elegant and variegated turns of expreſſion, which compoſe the beauty of ſtyle, do not occur to a writer in the firſt caſt
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032455_0118_0FF26B9E4F5A1978"/>of a work, and are generally the effect of a ſlow correction.</p>
               <p>WHILE there remains room to alter. there is opportunity for improvement. It is the characteriſtic of excellence in all the arts, ſo ſenſibly to ſtrike the ſpectator who admires it, that he can conceive of nothing tranſcending that which he beholds.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER little we may have accuſtomed ourſelves to write, we eaſily diſtinguiſh thoſe paſſages, which have not been ſufficiently ſtudied, and which proceeded from the pen of the writer, before they had been thoroughly digeſted in his own mind. This haſty or negligent compoſition ſoon diſcovers itſelf, not, as is commonly ſuppoſed, by the pleaſing freedom of a diction ſomewhat too unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and irregular, but by the confuſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, all the conſtituent parts of which are ſtiff and forced.</p>
               <p>THE more the writer hurries himſelf, the more dragging, of courſe, is his ſtyle. And, when it is ſaid that a writing "ſmells of the lamp," it is an evident proof that it is not ſufficiently laboured.</p>
               <p>WHEN the ſteel hath been well poliſhed, the edge of the file is no more perceived.</p>

A PAINS-TAKING Orator, who is deſirous of giving the finiſhing ſtroke to his produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is always repaid for his trouble. If correction do not ſuggeſt to him the materials of a diſcourſe, it, at leaſt, points out expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions unworthy of the pulpit, which ſometimes eſcape in the ardour of compoſition; and<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032455_0121_0FF26B5B2030A190"/>this, doubtleſs, is a valuable advantage in a ſtyle wherein we apprehend, juſtly enough, that one bad word doth oftentimes more injury, than a weak argument.</p>
               <p>CORRECTION ſuggeſts to the Orator appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate expreſſions, which render his ideas more ſtriking, and his ſentiments more impaſſioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "In the ſame manner," ſays Cicero, <q>as clothes, at firſt invented through neceſſity, have afterwards become ornamental to the human body, ſo words, created by neceſſity, impart alſo beauty to diſcourſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE value of well placed expreſſions is ſo ſtriking in the art of Oratory, that the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a paſſage ſometimes depends upon a ſingle word. Take an example which is deſerving of admiration. I ſelect it from an excellent diſcourſe, which the Cardinal de Rohan, Grand Almoner of France, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon preſenting the body of Louis XIV. at the Abbey of St. Dennis. <q>The Prince, whoſe loſs we mourn, leaves, it is true, <hi>names</hi> celebrated upon earth; and poſterity the moſt remote, will, like us, admire Louis the Great, the Juſt, the Conqueror, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific, the Friend of Learning, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of Kings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>HAD the Cardinal de Rohan ſaid, that this Monarch left upon earth a celebrated <hi>name,</hi> his expreſſion would hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032455_0122_0FF26BA4352FB518"/>but the ſame phraſe put in the plural, while ſpeaking only of one man, and the enumeration of the ſeveral titles of glory of Louis XIV. which at once juſtifies this bold aſcription, appear to me a ſublime ſtroke.</p>
               <p>MASSILLON knew alſo, this ſecret of the art. In his writings, a word, which ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a paradox, often expreſſed a new thought, and a very weighty and juſt idea. Such is that admirable Apoſtrophe, which we read in his ſermon, <q>on the mixture of the righteous and the wicked.</q> 
                  <q>Ye great ones of the earth! the innocent pleaſure of ſincerity, without which there is nothing agreeable in the commerce of mankind, is denied you, and ye have no more friends, becauſe it is too <hi>beneficial</hi> to be one.</q>

THE image is falſe, when there is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of terms: as in that phraſe, <q>I ſhall aſcend to the foundation of the Carteſian ſyſtem.</q> It is incoherent, when it deſcribes, on one ſide, a phyſical ſubſtance, and on the other, a moral ſubject: ſuch is that parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, <q>I ſay then (and I always continue fixed upon my principles.)</q> It is puerile and far-fetched, whenever it forms an affected and unuſual periphraſis: as when ſun-dials have been called "the regiſters of the ſun."

               <p>ELOQUENCE, in common with Poetry, has the happy privilege of embelliſhing its images with the nobleſt expreſſions, which, without this contrivance, could not belong to the Style of Oratory.</p>
               <p>BOSSUET excels in that admirable talent of uniting the moſt familiar narrations to the dignity of his diſcourſes; and he proves by his own example, that an able writer will always poſſeſs the art of adapting to the Style of Eloquence, whatever could be related in the freedom of converſation.</p>
               <p>No excuſe can, therefore, be any longer admitted in favour of thoſe Orators, whoſe Style is mean, and grovelling, in relations much leſs common, than ſome of thoſe which Boſſuet has given us in his funeral Orations.

                        <q>Unity is of great conſequence in every compoſition; but in other diſcourſes, where the choice and direction of the ſubject are not left to the ſpeaker, it may be leſs in his power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. In a ſermon it muſt be always the Preacher's own fault, if he tranſgreſs it. What I mean by unity, is, that there ſhould be ſome one main point to which the whole ſtrain of the ſermon ſhall refer. It muſt not be a bundle of different ſubjects ſtrung together, but one object muſt predominate throughout. This rule is founded on what we all experience, that the mind can attend only to one capital object at a time. By dividing, you always weaken the impreſſion. Now this unity, without which no ſermon can have much beauty, or much force, does not require that there ſhould be no diviſions or ſeparate heads in the diſcourſe, or that one ſingle thought only ſhould be, again and again, turned up to the hearers in different lights. It is not to be underſtood in ſo narrow a ſenſe: it admits of ſome variety; it admits of under parts and appendages, provided always that ſo much union and connexion be preſerved, as to make the whole concur in ſome one impreſſion upon the mind. I may employ, for inſtance, ſeveral di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

BOSSUET'S "Hiſtory of the Variations." is "juſtly quoted as a maſter-piece of this ſort, wherein this great man unites all the branches of his ſubject, by the ſole band of his logic; and thus connects, without confuſion, the moſt abſtract and diſſimilar propoſitions.</p>
               <p>TRANSITIONS, which are only built on the mechaniſm of the ſtyle, and merely conſiſt in a fictitious connexion between the laſt word of the paragraph which finiſhes, and the firſt word of the ſentence which begins, cannot, with propriety, be admitted as natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but are rather forced combinations. True rhetorical Tranſitions are ſuch as follow the courſe of the reaſoning, or ſentiment, with eaſe, almoſt without art, and unperceived by
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:032455_0135_0FF26B74B129D4A8"/>the hearer; ſuch, as unite the materials of the diſcourſe, inſtead of merely ſuſpending ſome phraſes upon each other; ſuch, as bind the whole together, without obliging the Preacher to compoſe a new exordium to each ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which his plan exhibits to him; ſuch, as form an orderly and methodical arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the ſimple unfolding of the ideas, in ſome meaſure, imperceptible to the Orator himſelf: ſuch, as call for, and correſpond with, each other by an inevitable analogy, and not by an unexpected aſſociation; ſuch, in fine, as meditation produces by ſuggeſting valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts, not ſuch as the pen furniſhes in its ſearch after combined reſemblances.</p>

               <p>IF a deſultory ſtyle, if ſhort expreſſions, in a word, if poor ideas can never ſtrictly unite, let us diſcard them, without heſitation, from a rhetorical diſcourſe. A broken and
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032455_0136_0FF26BBB936C4658"/>ſententious ſtyle will never make powerful impreſſions upon the multitude. Eloquence requires a kind of diction, expanded, lofty, ſublime, in order to develope the emotions of the ſoul, and to impart to thought all its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy. He who renews his thoughts line by line, is always frigid, ſlow, monotonous, and ſuperficial. Sublimity is ſimply the effort of genius tranſcending ordinary ideas. Let your thoughts dive deep. Stop not to pick up the ſparkling grains of ſand upon that ground which covers a mine of gold. Shoot beyond vulgar conceptions; and you will find the true ſublime, between that which is common, and that which is exaggerated. Unconſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your ſteps, confine not yourſelf within the narrow limits of thoſe curtailed phraſes, which drop every moment with the expiring idea; but diſplay in their vaſt extent, thoſe copious and commanding modes of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which impart to Eloquence its energy, its elevation, its vehemence, and its grandeur.

<p>Dr. WARD'S obſervations upon this point are as follow:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There are two kinds of Order, in the conſtruction of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, one of which may be called <hi>natural,</hi> and the other <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</hi> We call that order <hi>natural,</hi> when all the words in a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence are ſo placed, as they are connected with, or follow each other, in a grammatical conſtruction. And it may properly enough admit of this name, as it is founded in the nature of a propoſition, and the relation of the ſeveral words, of which it conſiſts, to each other. And this ſeems agreeable to the natural way of conveying our thoughts which leads us firſt to expreſs the ſubject, or thing, of which ſome other thing is ſaid, before the predicate, or that which is ſaid concerning it; and with reſpect to both, as every idea ſucceeds another in the order of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to range it in the ſame order, when we communicate them to others.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Our language in general keeps pretty much to this method. But in one thing, particularly, it recedes from it; and that is, in placing adjectives, which denote the properties of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſubſtantives or ſubjects, whoſe properties they are. As when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>
                           <hi>Artificial order,</hi> as it reſpects ſimple ſentences, has little or no regard to the natural conſtruction of words; but diſpoſes them in ſuch a manner, as will be moſt agreeable to the ear, and beſt anſwer the deſign of the ſpeaker. The Latins take a much greater liberty in this reſpect, than we do, or the nature of our language will permit. Quintilian ſays, it is beſt for the verb to ſtand laſt, when there is no particular reaſon to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and he gives this reaſon for it, 'becauſe the force of the ſentence lies in the verb.' They likewiſe ſeparate ſuch words as have an immediate relation between them, or depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance one upon another; and place any of them firſt or laſt, as they pleaſe. In ſhort, their order ſeems in a manner arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it does not break in upon perſpicuity, to which they uſually attend. But moſt of theſe things are unſuitable to the genius of our language. The Latin tongue commonly admits of a much greater var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, this reſpect, much more limited and confined than the Latin. The natural order is certainly more plain and eaſy; but yet it muſt be owned, that the other has its advantages, and thoſe very conſiderable. The language both of the Greeks and Romans has more ſtrength, as well as harmony, than any modern tongue; which is owing, in a good meaſure, to this liberty in their compoſition. For by giving their periods the fineſt tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <q>In the Latin language, the arrangement, which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obtains, is, to place firſt, in the ſentence, that word which expreſſes the principal object of the diſcourſe, together with its circumſtances; and afterwards, the perſon, or the thing, that acts upon it. Thus Salluſt, comparing together the mind and the body; <hi>Animi imperi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Latin order gratifies more the rapidity of the imagination, which naturally runs firſt to that which is its chief object; and, having once named it, carries it in view throughout the reſt of the ſentence. In the ſame manner in poetry,</q>

                        <q>An Engliſh writer, paying a compliment to a great man, would ſay thus: "It is impoſſible for me to paſs over, in ſilence, ſuch remarkable mildneſs, ſuch ſingular and unheard of clemency, and ſuch unuſual moderation, in the exerciſe of ſupreme power." "Here, we have, firſt preſented to us, the perſon who ſpeaks. 'It is impoſſible for <hi>me;</hi> next, what that perſon is to do; impoſſible for him <hi>to paſs over in ſilence;'</hi> and laſtly, the object which moves him ſo to do, 'the mildneſs, clemency, and moderation of his patron.' Cicero, from whom I have tranſlated theſe words, juſt reverſes this order; beginning with the object, placing that firſt which was the exciting idea in the ſpeaker's mind, and ending with the ſpeaker and his action. <hi>Tantum manſuetudinem, tame inuſitatam in auditamque clementia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>The Latin order is more animated; the Engliſh more clear and diſtinct.

               <p>NEVERTHELESS, without this meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of periods, Style is flat and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious. A Chriſtian Orator ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

               <p>BOSSUET meant to intimate in the funeral Oration for Tellier, that that magiſtrate had breathed his laſt, while repeating this verſe of the pſalm, <q>I will ſing of the mercies of the Lord forever;</q> and ſee how the Orator recals, if I may ſo ſay, before all his auditory, this circumſtance of the death of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor: "Enraptured that he could pour forth his grateful acknowledgements even with his dying breath, he began the hymn of praiſe for divine mercies. <hi>I will ſing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of the mercies of the Lord forever.</hi> He expires while repeating theſe words, and continues ſinging with Angels the ſacred ſong."</p>

IT is judgment, which points out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the word; and it is the propriety of expreſſion which renders it perſpicuous. But, to give perſpicuity to the ideas, it is requiſite to be thoroughly informed. The writer, who is neceſſitated to learn while he compoſes, is generally obſcure. He, on the contrary, who hath, during a length of time, brought his knowledge to maturity, becomes
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032455_0147_0FF26ACC1A7020A0"/>ſufficiently maſter of his ſubject, to baniſh from his ſtyle, ambiguity, double entendre, and declamation.</p>
               <p>OBSCURITY proceeds from ignorance, when the expreſſion is void of ſenſe; from deſign, when it is far-fetched; from negligence, when the thought is confuſed; and from depravity of taſte, when the word is more abſtract than the idea. The ſtyle of ſacred Eloquence ought to be clear, and, in ſome ſort, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. The rapidity of utterance, which never allows time for examination, requires in a ſermon all the perſpicuity of the moſt familiar language.<note n="*" place="bottom">"We ſhould uſe," ſays FENELON, <q>a ſimple, exact, eaſy ſtyle, that lays every thing open to the reader, and even prevents his attention. When an author writes for the public, he ſhould take all the pains imaginable to prevent his reader's having any. All the labour ſhould be his own; and he ſhould leave nothing but pleaſure and inſtruction to his readers. They ſhould never be put to the trouble of finding out his meaning. None but thoſe who deal in riddles are allowed to puzzle people. Auguſtus would rather have frequent repetitions uſed, than that there ſhould be the leaſt degree of obſcurity in a diſcourſe.

The ſupreme perfection of a ſpeaker's ſtyle ſhould be to pleaſe the unlearned, as well as the learned, by exhibiting an abundance of graces for the latter, and being very perſpicuous for the former. St. Auſtin wrote at firſt againſt the Manichees, in a flowery and ſublime ſtyle; whence his writings were unintelligible to thoſe who had but a moderate ſhare of learning, at leaſt not without great difficulty.

Again, Obſcurity is occaſioned either by too ſhort and conciſe a manner of ſpeaking, or by ſentences too long and prolix.

ENTER a church in the middle of a ſermon: if, in a minute, you do not diſcern the drift of the diſcourſe; if you be obliged to wait to the end of a diviſion, in order to penetrate the deſign of the preacher, pronounce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, that he wanders in a labyrinth of common places; that he hath not compoſed through inſpiration; and that he labours hard to make up, by the redundancy of words, for the ſterility of ideas.</p>
               <p>WHAT, then, will you diſcover in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible loquacity? diſguſting repetitions, or extravagant conceptions; plagiariſms or imitations; an incurable facility of uttering expreſſions, which always leave the mind empty; pitiful proofs of a beggarly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity, from which nothing can be expected; and diſcourſes, of which all the contents were known before they were heard.</p>
               <p>HENCE ariſe thoſe frequent enumerations, which are only a redundancy of words, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as dazzling in the delivery, as they are inſipid in the peruſal.

A SUDDEN ſtroke is merely a haſty ſally; if it be well prepared, it becomes a ſublime movement.</p>
               <p>MAY I be permitted to render my idea more familiar by a compariſon?—You walk by yourſelf, in the fields, on a ſummer's day. You give ſcope ſucceſſively to a variety of thoughts, with which the view of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the ſilence of nature, inſpire you. When your mind is thus wholly engaged with theſe pleaſing reveries, all of a ſudden you hear thunder which craſhes at a diſtance. This noiſe at firſt alarms you. In the mean time, the ſky is ſerene, the air is calm, all is tranquil about you; and this firſt impreſſion of terror is ſoon eraſed from your memory. But, when the horizon lowers, and is covered with dark clouds; when the ſun diſappears; when the hurricane rolls whirlwinds of duſt; when the lightning flaſhes; when the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere is inflamed; and when the thunder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards roars over your head; you will be alarmed; and your mind, prepared by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual emotions, will then have a more lively ſenſation of the violence of the ſhock ariſing from ſuch continued perturbation. It is the ſame with Eloquence. Through a multitude of adventitious ideas, the mind muſt be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually prepared to participate in all the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of paſſion or terror, of joy or grief, of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032455_0154_0FF26C1BB3CC19F0"/>love or indignation, with which you yourſelf are agitated. The impreſſion too ſoon wears off, if the heart be not ſufficiently mollified to enable it to penetrate without meeting with oppoſition.</p>
               <p>DOTH Boſſuet intend to give you a high idea of the courage, with which the queen of England ſtruggled againſt all her misfortunes? His relations, were they introduced even without art, would aſtoniſh you; but, when uſhered in by this ſublime image, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you: <q>Like a column, whoſe ſolid maſs appears the firmeſt ſupport of a ruinous temple, when that lofty edifice which it ſuſtains reſts upon it without overthrowing it; thus the queen diſcovers herſelf to be the firm ſupport of the ſtate, when, after having for a long time borne its weight, ſhe is not even bowed down under its fall.</q> Your mind, ſtruck with this ſpectacle which the Orator had the art of repreſenting before you, beholds the queen of England conſtantly raiſed above her adverſities; and your imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination is continually deſcribing to itſelf this column, which remains ſtanding in the midſt of the ruins with which it is ſurrounded.</p>

               <p>THROW yourſelf, at once, into the midſt of the danger, that you may the better diſplay the reſources of your genius, and make your attack while put upon your defence. This riſk, to which the Orator expoſes himſelf, imparts to Eloquence a glow of enthuſiaſm, which raiſes him ſuperior to his uſual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>IT is evident, that on ſuch hazardous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the great buſineſs of an Orator con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in omitting no precautions, and in adding energy to art.</p>

IT is an excellent method to make choice of a proper and ingenious circumlocution to convey the meaning of what cannot be ſo well expreſſed. The Hypotheſis is a figure well adapted to yield this reſource to Eloquence. Cicero often uſes it in his Orations, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe againſt Verres, where he is every moment forming ſuppoſitions more ſtriking than the facts, with a view to render the exactions of Verres odious to the people of Rome.</p>
               <p>BOSSUET, whom I am pepetually quoting, becauſe I know not a better model, hath made an admirable uſe of Hypotheſis, in his fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oration for Tellier. <q>Sleep on, ye rich men of the earth, and remain in your native duſt.

But then, I think a kind of monotony and uniformity runs through all his writings; he has every where almoſt the ſame turns, the ſame figures, the ſame method.

                  </note> who, in the compoſition of his funeral Oration for Turenne, ſtands in the foremoſt rank of Orators, although he do not delineate the excellent character of his hero in private life, and his diſcourſe be, in other reſpects, far inferior to the chief per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of Boſſuet, affords us, in a letter which is prefixed to his funeral Orations, a ſingular example of egotiſm and vanity. He draws his own portrait in this letter; and one would imagine that he is ſending to his friend the materials for a panegyric; or rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is a complete eulogium, in which he forms ſparkling antitheſes from the recital and contraſt of his various merits. See how Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032455_0160_0FF26C1D63217438"/>deſcribes himſelf in this paſſage: he tells us, that <q>he hath a ſort of genius capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of executing whatever he undertakes; his ſtyle is nature approaching to art, and art reſembling nature. Nothing can be added to what he writes, without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, nor retrenched without removing ſomething neceſſary. He can ſcatter ſome grains of odoriferous incenſe to refreſh, and yet not overpower; but he accepts of none which are not equally pure with thoſe which he beſtows. There is diſcernible in his eyes a certain ſomething correſponding with his genius. After all, it would be better if he could inure himſelf to ſtudy, and if his memory, ſomewhat treacherous, without however being unfaithful, were equally ſerviceable to him as his genius. But there is no perfection in the world, and every one hath his weak ſide.</q> It were to be wiſhed, for the honour of Flechier, that poſterity had confirmed this judgment, which he paſſed upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>IT is, without doubt, an unneceſſary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that a Chriſtian Orator could ever ſuffer himſelf to advance, in the pulpit, an egotiſm ſo prepoſterous. It is always dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſpeak about oneſelf before a large aſſembly. We are even careful to avoid this abſurdity in ſmall companies; and it appears
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032455_0161_0FF26BDB8595D328"/>to me, that it was owing to good taſte, as much as to Chriſtian humility, that the word <hi>I</hi> was baniſhed from the writings of Port-Royal.</p>
               <p>THE Abbé de Fleury ſays, that the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſhould himſelf be kept out of view in his narration, <q>ſo that the reader may not have leiſure to reflect, whether the facts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded be written well or ill; whether they be written at all; whether he have a book in his hands; whether there be an author in the world. It is thus that Homer wrote.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>What the amiable FENELON ſays of poets, and which he ſtrengthens with the ſanction of Plato's judgment, may, with equal propriety, be applied to hiſtorians: <q>The poems of Homer and Virgil are full of a noble ſimplicity; their art is entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; nature itſelf appears in all that they ſay. We do not find a ſingle word, that ſeems purpoſely deſigned to ſhew the poet's wit. They thought it their greateſt glory never to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but to employ our attention on the objects they deſcribe; as a painter endeavours to ſet before your eyes wide foreſts, mountains, rivers, diſtant views, and buildings; or the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, actions, and different paſſions, of men, in ſuch a lively manner, that you cannot trace the maſterly ſtrokes of his pencil, for art look, mean and coarſe when it is perceived. Plato, who hath thoroughly examined this matter, aſſures us, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, the Poet [ſo alſo the Hiſtorian or Preacher] ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep out of ſight, make himſelf to be quite forgotten by his readers, and repreſent, only thoſe things and perſons which he would ſet before their eyes.</q>

                     <p>Mr. KNOX tells us, that his <q>opinion coincides with that of the beſt judges of antiquity, that the diction of the hiſtorian ſhould not be ſuch, either in the conſtruction or ſelection of words, as to allure the attention of the reader from the facts to the words, from the hero to the writer.</q> The ſame author condemns <q>ſome of the moſt popular hiſtorians of France, who have violated the gravity and dignity of the hiſtoric page, by perpetual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to be witty." And he adds, "though the works of ſuch may afford pleaſure, it is not ſuch as reſults from legitimate hiſtory. The writer evidently labours to diſplay himſelf, and his own ingenuity: but it is one great ſecret in the art of writing, that the writer ſhould keep himſelf out of ſight, and cauſe the ideas, which he means to convey, fully to engroſs the reader's attention. They cannot indeed otherwiſe produce their proper effect.

THE firſt part of his diſcourſes generally conſiſts of a commentary upon his text. In my opinion, all his critical diſcuſſions upon hiſtory, grammar, or chronology, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely different from E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BESIDES, the ſhew of erudition, with which Saurin impoſes on ſo many of his readers, ought not to be held of any account, even if all this ſcientific dreſs were not miſtimed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is no very difficult taſk to copy commentators, or to tranſlate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>ON this account, therefore, when you read Saurin, do not ſtop ſhort at any of the firſt parts of his diſcourſes. This manner of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which, at the beginning of this century, was called "the Refugeé ſtyle," has been charged againſt him on ſubſtantial grounds. He uſes a tranſlation of the Bible, which was made immediately after the ſeparation of the Proteſtant churches; and this old language, contraſted with his modern Eloquence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts to his ſtyle a ſavage and barbarous air. I might quote examples, if his ſermons were not ſo diffuſe.</p>
               <p>SAURIN, however, writes with ardour and vehemence. He doth not make an oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhow of wit; he doth not loſe ſight of his auditory; he forcibly urges his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he knows when to inſiſt upon them; he is moved, and he inflames.

                  </gap> he had joined, to the ſtudy of examples, the reſidence of Paris.</p>
               <p>No Chriſtian Orator, after Boſſuet, (to whom there can be none compared when ſpeaking of Pulpit-Eloquence) hath laboured more carefully or ſucceſsfully the perorations of his diſcourſes. In them, Saurin always recalled the idea of death. This object ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them as ſolemn as they are affecting. They commonly conſiſt of repetitions; and this return of the ſame ſet of expreſſions is very proper, when making the application of a ſermon to the different claſſes of hearers. It is by this figure, that he recapitulates his proofs; and then he points to the open grave, as if the liſtening congregation, ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into it, were not thenceforward to hear any other inſtruction, or rather, as if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were preaching for the laſt time.</p>
               <p>THE ſermons of Saurin, <q>on the wiſdom of Solomon,</q> and <q>on the diſcourſe of St. Paul to Felix and Druſilla,</q> appear to me the maſter-pieces of this Orator.</p>
               <p>IT is commonly ſuppoſed, that he never allowed himſelf to make uſe of declamations againſt the church of Rome; but I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that fanaticiſm cannot break out more paſſionately, than in his ſermons on <q>the

               </p>
               <p>SAURIN is transformed. He riſes to the level of Demoſthenes, when he ſpeaks of the emigration of the Proteſtants; above all, when he thunders againſt Louis XIV. He is never more eloquent, nor more ſublime, than when waſting his fury againſt this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, whoſe name perpetually recurs in his diſcourſes, and, principally, in the ſermons, which I am about to quote.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtrophe is well known; <q>and thou formidable Prince, whom I once hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured as my king, and whom I ſtill regard as the ſcourge of the Lord,</q> &amp;c. Saurin finiſhes this paſſage by ſaying, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives Louis XIV; but he does not attempt to impreſs this inſulting moderation on the minds of the people of Holland. It is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in the pulpit of Saurin, where have been fabricated the arms of Hochſtet, of Malpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and Ramillies; and where that impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable reſentment hath been produced, which preſided at the conferences of Gertruidemberg.</p>
               <p>NEVER did an Orator conceive any thing more daring than the dialogue of Saurin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his auditory, in his ſermon "on the faſt of 1706." "My people," ſaith
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032455_0174_0FF26AF0777A4928"/>the moſt High <q>my people, what have I done unto thee?" "Ah, Lord! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things haſt thou done unto us!—the ways of Zion covered with mourning," &amp;c. Anſwer, and hear witneſs here againſt the Eternal.</q>

His three great works were intitled "Pamela, or Virtue rewarded;" "The Hiſtory of Clariſſa Harlowe;" and "The Hiſtory of Sir Charles Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. "Dr. Johnſon ſtyles him "an author from whom the age has received great favours, who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the paſſions to move at the command of virtue."

At preſent, [Mr. Hume firſt publiſhed his Eſſays about the year 1742] there are about half a dozen ſpeakers in the two houſes, who, in the judgment of the public, have reached very near the ſame pitch of Eloquence; and no one pretends to give any one the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the reſt. This ſeems to me a certain proof that none of them have attained much beyond a mediocrity in their art, and that the ſpecies of Eloquence, which they aſpire to, gives no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to the ſublimer faculties of the mind, but may be reached by ordinary talents, and a ſlight application.

Of all the ſpeeches ſpoken in the houſe, how few have ever been collected and preſerved in libraries, as models of claſſical elegance? Paſſion and perſonal animoſity have, indeed, produced many invectives which gratify the ſpleen of party, and are for the time extolled beyond all the productions of preceding ingenuity. But is there extant a ſingle volume of ſpeeches, by the moſt famous among the Orators of the upper houſe, which can be produced as a claſſical book, or ſtand in competition with the Orations of Cicero? I regret that the fury of party, and the meanneſs of ſervitude, have, for the moſt part, excluded that true taſte, true grace, and true ſpirit, which is neceſſary to form a claſſical Orator, from the harangues of an aſſembly, which may be doomed the moſt auguſt in Europe.</q>

But, though we join in the applauſe of common fame, yet let us aſk, where are to be found the volumes of oratorical elegance? Have the ſpeeches which have gained the praiſe of admiring kingdoms, been no where collected and recorded? Do we lock them up in our book-caſes, and put them into the hands of our children as models for imitations, as leſſons to form their young minds, and raiſe a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of orators and patriots? No; the ſpeeches are celebrated at firſt, and while they anſwer a temporary purpoſe. They are like vegetables of the night, or inſects of a day. They have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that ſolidity of merit which can render the ore valuable when the ſtamp is effaced, and the occaſion of it almoſt forgotten and quite diſregarded; which can preſerve the plate ſtill ſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able after the faſhion is antiquated.</q>

                     <p>It is, indeed, a ſubject of regret, that the ſpeeches of this great man, and of other eminent Orators, have not been more carefully preſerved as models for youth, as well as for the inſtruction of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity at large.

Of Mr. Burke it may be remarked, that, perhaps there are few, if any, members of parliament, whoſe printed ſpeeches will bear a compariſon with that which this Orator addreſſed to the people of Briſtol, on the occaſion of a general election. We find in it that beautiful panegyric of the late Mr. Howard referred to, p. 79. The concluſion of this celebrated ſpeech has been much admired, when he ſaid, <q>And now, Gentlemen, on this ſerious day, when I come, as it were, to make up my account with you; let me take to myſelf ſome degree of honeſt pride on the nature of the charges brought againſt me. I do not here ſtand accuſed of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, or neglect of duty. It is not ſaid, that, in the long period of my ſervice, I have, in a ſingle inſtance, ſacrificed the ſlighteſt of your intereſts to my ambition, or to my fortune. It is not alleged, that, to gratify any anger or revenge of my own, or of my party, I have had a ſhare in wronging or oppreſſing any one man of any deſcription: No; the charges againſt me are all of one kind, that I have puſhed the general principles of general juſtice and benevolence too far; farther than a cautious policy would warrant, and farther than the opinions of many would go with me. In every accident which may happen through life, in pain, in ſorrow, in depreſſion, and diſtreſs, I will think of this accuſation, and be comforted.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, perhaps, though the laſt, yet not the leaſt of theſe ſeveral Orators, of whom our nation may be proud, may be ranked the venerable Earl MANSFIELD, now, like the ſetting ſun, ready to diſappear from our view.</p>
                     <p>His eloquence as a pleader, his uprightneſs as a judge, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as a man, and as a peer, will embalm his memory to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
                     <p>Upon this great character, Dr. Fordyce paſſes this juſt eulogium: <q>Lord Mansfield joins to the moſt engaging manner of ſpeaking, the art of preſenting his ſubject in a light and language ſo clear and flowing, and at the ſame time ſo ſtriking and ſpirited, that if his eloquence or pleadings have not produced effects equal to thoſe recorded of Cicero or Demoſthenes, it may be accounted for by reflecting on the circumſtances of the different ages in which they lived. He is ſo filled with his ſubject, that he ſeems often to be at a loſs to determine which of his ideas ought to be preferred, and which omitted in his pleadings. None of the maſters of Eloquence that we know or read of, poſſeſſed this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar talent but Demoſthenes.</q>

THE Engliſh can boaſt of ſome ſtrokes of this kind, although far inferior to the anſwer of Marius.</p>
               <p>WHEN the parliament of Great-Britain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to paſs a bill, which denied to perſons accuſed on a criminal account the privilege of defending themſelves by the help of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Lord BOLINGBROKE, who was againſt this intended law, attempted to oppoſe it; but, intimidated by the aſſembly before which he was ſpeaking, he could not articulate a ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the words he attempted to utter were at every breath dying away on his lips; when, making an extraordinary effort, he cried out, <q>You wiſh, Gentlemen, that the accuſed ſhould appear before you in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves. If your preſence hath impoſed ſilence upon me, judge of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which it would produce upon the unfortunate, who ſhould behold in you judges ready to ſend them to the ſcaffold.</q> This ſingle reflection, unqueſtionably more eloquent than all the arguments which Lord Bolingbroke could have alleged, cauſed the rejection of this new deſign.</p>
               <p>Mr. CHARLES FOX, who is, in the preſent day, conſidered as the moſt eloquent man of Great-Britain, pronounced, in parliament, the eulogium of the late General Montgomery: one of the court-party interrupted him in
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032455_0186_0FF26C3B6CB1ECD0"/>theſe words, <q>How dare you praiſe a rebel before the repreſentatives of the nation?" I will not refrain,</q> Mr. Fox immediately replied, <q>from repelling the outrage done to the memory of a great man. You all know the meaning of the word <hi>rebel</hi> in the mouth of my adverſaries. If you have any doubts of the true ſenſe of this expreſſion, I would entreat you to recollect, that it is to theſe pretended rebellions we owe our preſent conſtitution, and the privilege of being aſſembled at Weſtminſter to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intereſts of our country.<note n="*" place="bottom">The late celebrated Iriſh parliamentary Orator, Mr. FLOOD, is ſaid to have rendered himſelf, at times, diſtinguiſhed for ſuch ſort of oratorical ſtrokes, as thoſe which the Abbé Maury here aſcribes to Bolingbroke and Mr. Fox; and alſo for ingenious and ſentimental expreſſions.
<p>As a ſpecimen of the latter ſort, it is recorded, that, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the American war, having indulged himſelf in one of thoſe prophecies, which experience has ſince proved to be ſo erroneous, relative to the ruin of this country, by the loſs of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, Mr. Flood ſaid, <q>Deſtruction ſhall come upon the Britiſh empire, like the coldneſs of death; it ſhall creep upon it from the extreme parts:</q> and in ſpeaking of the conduct of Lord Chatham, upon the ſtamp act, and alluding to a paſſage in Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides, he introduced the following beautiful epiſode: <q>Illuſtrious man! to whoſe tomb poſterity ſhall come and ſay, as Pericles did, over the bodies of his deceaſed fellow-ſoldiers, You are like to the Divinities above us—you are no longer with us, you are known only by the benefits, which you have conferred.</q> Such an enlivening ſtroke deſerves to be reſcued from oblivion.</p>
                        <p>In BOSWELL'S Life of the celebrated Dr. JOHNSON, there is a remark inſerted, in relation to the written Life of Young, which may be quoted as one of thoſe ſtrokes of energetic and prompt Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which M. Maury acknowledges the Engliſh poſſeſs.</p>
                        <p>"The Life of Dr. Young," (in Johnſon's Lives of the Poets,) was written," ſays Mr. Boſwell, "by Mr. Croft, and diſplays a pretty ſucceſsful imitation of Johnſon's ſtyle. A certain very eminent literary character oppoſed this idea vehemently; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, "No, no, it is <hi>not</hi> a good imitation of Johnſon; it has all his pomp, without his force; it has all the nodoſities of the oak without its ſtrength." This was an image ſo happy, that one might have thought he would have been ſatisfied with it; but he was not: and ſetting his mind again to work, he added, with great felicity, "it has all the contortions of the Sybil, without the inſpiration."</p>

                        <q>The ſagacious CLARKE pretended not to wit. He affected not the ambitious ornaments of rhetoric. He rarely reaches the ſublime, or aims at the pathetic; but in a clear, manly, flowing ſtyle, he delivers the moſt important doctrines, confirmed on every occaſion by well applied paſſages from ſcripture. If he was not a ſhining Orator, according to the ideas of rhetoricians, he was a very agreeable as well as uſeful preacher. He was not perfectly orthodox in his opinions; a circumſtance which has lowered his character among many.

                     <p>The following is the character of this divine, which was given in the <hi>Gentleman's Magazine:</hi>

               <p>THE Eloquence of TILLOTSON, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, is highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have read his ſermons with the ſtricteſt impartiality, and theſe are my ſentiments of the works of this Prelate, who is univerſally, regarded as the firſt Orator of England.</p>

TILLOTSON is an excellent writer. His principal merit conſiſts in the ſtyle. He muſt, therefore, be much injured by a tranſlation, in which the vernacular expreſſion is loſt, and eſpecially by ſuch a tranſlator as Barbeyrac, who was always deficient in ſublimity, in embelliſhment, in energy, and in elegance. But, while we acknowledge all the faults of this French verſion, the ſubject-matter of the Archbiſhop of Canterbury's ſermons ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains far inferior to the diſcourſes of Maſſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and Bourdaloue.<note n="*" place="bottom">From this acknowledgement of M. Maury, that his ideas of Tillotſon's ſermons are derived from this imperfect French verſion of Barbeyrac, it would ſeem, that he himſelf has but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Engliſh language; if ſo, it muſt be preſumed that he is not a competent judge of Engliſh writers, and that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the indiſcriminate cenſures, which he paſſes upon our Engliſh divines, muſt, in a great meaſure, be aſcribed to his own ignorance of their works, and the language in which they are written.</note>
               </p>
               <p>TILLOTSON is more of a theologian than a moraliſt. He ſcarcely ever diſcuſſed any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than controverſial ſubjects. He employs the ſame dull modes of ſyllogiſm or diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and merely habituates himſelf to an inſipid uniformity of method.</p>
               <p>I DISCOVER in his diſcourſes no rhetorical movements, no great ideas, no ſublime ſtrokes: he generally divides every paragraph, and has thirty or forty ſubdiviſions in each of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. His particulars are inſipid, futile, and often devoid of excellence. In ſhort,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032455_0191_0FF26C1067491160"/>Tillotſon is ſo much a ſtranger to the art of Eloquence, that he ſcarcely ever makes an exordium or a peroration. Is this, then, the Orator whom they are bold enough to put in competition with our French preachers?<note n="*" place="bottom">Maury had no good reaſon whatever, to bring Archbiſhop Tillotſon forward as the perſon, generally eſteemed the firſt Orator among Engliſh Divines. For ſoundneſs and ſtrength of argument, few of his own country have exceeded, and none of the French Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have equalled, the celebrated and worthy Archbiſhop. His warmeſt admirers have never eſteemed him as a firſt rate Orator, but have agreed with the general opinion in placing him in rather an inferior ſituation of that claſs. He is, however, a great favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite among his countrymen, who attend ſo much to the <hi>ſapere</hi> from the pulpit, as to neglect the <hi>fari</hi> to a faulty degree. Let it be recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that he has been the moſt powerful, the unanſwerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent of the Romiſh church, and that Maury has indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in attacking the Proteſtant church, on the weakeſt ſide of its moſt formidable champion, whilſt he has affected to overlook many others leſs obnoxious, whoſe claim to Oratory he dared not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travert. <bibl>E. <hi>Albany.</hi>

<p>Tillotſon, as a writer, had conſiderable merit; but he was not without his faults. His ſtyle is ſo deficient in accuracy and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, that it will not, in the preſent day of refinement, permit him to be held up as a model for imitation.

The truth, however, is, his words are frequently ill-choſen, and almoſt always ill-placed; his periods are both tedious and unharmonious; as his metaphors are generally mean, and often ridiculous; a fault, which ſeems to be chiefly owing to his having had no ſort of notion of rhetor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical numbers.

                     <p>The learned Dr. DODDRIDGE, in his <q>Character of Engliſh Divines,</q> (in MS) makes the following conciſe remarks on Tillotſon: <q>Some pertinent expreſſions; method admirably clear, beyond almoſt any other man. Many ſermons contain nothing remarkable, particularly in his poſthumous works; yet ſome there are equal to any formerly publiſhed. His beſt pieces are thoſe at the beginning of his firſt and ſecond volumes; ſuch are thoſe "on evil ſpeaking," and "forgiving our enemies." He made great uſe of Barrow and Wilkins, with whom compare ſome few of his ſermons.

                     <p>Dr. BLAIR'S ſentiments of Tillotſon are thus expreſſed: <q>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon has long been admired as an eloquent writer, and a model for preaching. But his eloquence, if we can call it ſuch, has been often miſunderſtood. For, if we include in the idea of eloquence, vehemence and ſtrength, pictureſque deſcription, glowing figures, or correct arrangement of ſentences, in all theſe parts of Oratory the Archbiſhop is exceedingly deficient. His ſtyle is always pure, indeed, and perſpicuous, but careleſs and remiſs, too often feeble and languid; little beauty in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his ſentences, which are frequently ſuffered to drag unharmoniouſly; ſeldom any attempt towards ſtrength or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity. But, notwithſtanding theſe defects, ſuch a conſtant vein of good ſenſe and piety runs through his works, ſuch an earneſt and ſerious manner, and ſo much uſeful inſtruction conveyed in a ſtyle ſo pure, natural, and unaffected, as will juſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to high regard, as long as the Engliſh language re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; not, indeed, as a model of the higheſt eloquence, but as a ſimple and amiable writer, whoſe manner is ſtrongly expreſſive of great goodneſs and worth. As appears in the Archbiſhop, negligence may ſometimes be carried ſo far, as to impair the beauty of ſimplicity, and make it border on a flat and languid manner.</q>

I AM not acquainted with the ſermons of YOUNG, in which we ſhould, doubtleſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that plaintive poetry, that depth of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, and even thoſe eccentric ideas, which the penſive Paſtor of Welwyn collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his nocturnal meditations. But Young does not appear to me to have had an imagination ſufficiently pliable and verſatile for the Eloquence of the pulpit.</p>
               <p>THE preachers of Charles II. who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to hear Bourdaloue at Paris, have but faintly imitated him; and even now, when his ſermons are ſpread through the whole of Europe, the revolution, which they ought to produce in Chriſtian Eloquence, hath not, as yet, taken place amongſt the Engliſh.<note n="*" place="bottom">"The Engliſh preachers" ſays a very ſenſible writer, <q>are, it is certain, more diſtinguiſhed by their juſtneſs of ſentiment, and ſtrength of reaſoning, than by their oratorial powers, or talents of affecting the paſſions. More ſolicitous to convince than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, they chuſe to employ their abilities in endeavouring to impreſs the mind with a ſenſe of the truths they deliver, by the force of argumentation, inſtead of rouſing the affections by the energy of their eloquence. We meet with no examples in their writings of thoſe ſtrokes of paſſion, which penetrate and cleave the heart at once, or of that rapid, overpowering eloquence, which carries every thing before it like a torrent. They ſeem to have conſidered mankind in the ſame light in which Voltaire regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the celebrated Dr. Clarke, as "mere reaſoning machines;" they ſeem to have conſidered them as purely intellectual, void of paſſion and ſenſibility. This ſtrange miſtake may, perhaps, be ſuppoſed to be partly the effect of the philoſophical ſpirit of the times, which, like all other prevailing modes, is ſubject to its deliriums; certain, however, it is, that, while man remains a compound being, conſiſting of reaſon and paſſion, his actions will always be prompted by the latter, in whatever degree his opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions may be influenced by the former.</q>

                        <q>The French and Engliſh writers of Sermons proceed upon very different ideas of the Eloquence of the Pulpit; and ſeem indeed to have ſplit is betwixt them. A French ſermon is, for the moſt part, a warm, animated exhortation; an Engliſh one, is a piece of cool, inſtructive reaſoning. The French preachers addreſs themſelves chiefly to the imagination and the paſſions; the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, almoſt ſolely to the underſtanding. It is the union of theſe two kinds of compoſition, of the French earneſtneſs and warmth, with the Engliſh accuracy and reaſon, that would form, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my idea, the model of a perfect ſermon.</q>

There are few arts, in my opinion, farther from perfection, than that of preaching is among us. In proof of the fact it is ſufficient to obſerve, that an Engliſh ſermon, inſtead of being a perſuaſive, animated Oration, ſeldom riſes beyond the ſtrain of correct and dry reaſoning: whereas, in the ſermons of Boſſuet, Maſſillon, Bourdaloue, and Flechier, among the French, we ſee a much higher ſpecies of Eloquence aimed at, and in a great meaſure attained, than the Britiſh preachers have in view. The French have adopted higher ideas both of pleaſing and perſuading by means of Oratory, though, ſometimes, in the execution, they fail. In Great-Britain, we have taken up Eloquence on a lower key; but in our execution have been more correct. In France, the ſtyle of their Orators is ornamented with bolder figures; and their diſcourſe carried on with more amplification, more warmth and elevation. The compoſition is often very beautiful; but ſometimes, alſo, too diffuſe, and deficient in that ſtrength and cogency which render Eloquence powerful.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>Modern Eloquence is much more cool and temperate than the Grecian and Roman; and in G. Britain eſpecially, has confined itſelf almoſt wholly to the argumentative and rational. It is much of that ſpecies which the ancient critics called the "Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuis," or "Subtilis;" which aims at convincing and inſtructing, rather than affecting the paſſions, and aſſumes a tone not much higher than common argument and diſcourſe.</q>

                     <p>Still, however, though much remains to be accompliſhed in our iſland in the art of pulpit-elocution, it muſt be confeſſed, that we are by no means deficient in theological diſcourſes, which would reflect honour on any country, or in compoſitions, which will bear to undergo the ordeal of a correct attic taſte. And it appears to be a well-founded, as it is a pleaſing reflection, that our pulpit-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions have been, for ſome length of time, in an improving ſtyle. The Divines of the laſt century wanted, it is true, that accuracy and refinement of taſte, which characterize ſome of our modern diſcourſes; but ſome of them abounded in lofty ſentiments and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable energy.

                        <q>He was an excellent preacher, and a great promoter of public charities, particularly the Worceſter Infirmary, and the Hoſpital for inoculating the Small Pox, at London. His ſermon in favour of this latter inſtitution, preached in 1752, was much admired, and contributed greatly to extend the practice of Inoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation. He publiſhed ſome other ſingle ſermons. Born about the year 1696, died in 1759.</q>

IT is aſſerted, that this diſcourſe influenced the public benevolence to endow an Hoſpital for Inoculation.</p>
               <p>IF, indeed, the Biſhop of Worceſter hath participated this kind of glory with Vincent de Paul, it muſt be acknowledged, that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence could not obtain a more excellent triumph. This ſermon is an intereſting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation, and new as to its object; but the prelate, who delivered it, will never be placed in the rank of Orators.</p>
               <p>DESTITUTE of imagination, and of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, he wanders into abſtract calculations reſpecting population; into low details about the ſecondary fever; and, after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all thoſe combinations, certainly more ſuited to a medicinal ſchool than a Chriſtian aſſembly, he quotes the teſtimonies and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Meſſrs. Ranby, Hawkins, and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton, ſurgeons of London, of whom he ſpeaks with as much veneration as if they were Fathers of the church.</p>
               <p>THE more we read foreign Orators, the more we perceive the pre-eminence of the French preachers.</p>
               <p>THE Spaniards and Germans are yet in the rudiments of Chriſtian Eloquence. Father SEIGNERY has been for ſome time extolled as the Bourdaloue of Italy. He hath been
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032455_0203_0FF1D8BBAAFB5390"/>tranſlated. His moſt zealous partiſans have given him up. How, indeed, can we admire ridiculous paſſages and popular fables, which we ſhould ſcarcely tolerate in inſtructions to country villagers?</p>

               <p>A WANT of genius, however, is not what we can charge upon theſe corrupters of Chriſtian Eloquence, unleſs we ſhould be of opinion, that, owing to their deficiency in this reſpect, they diſcovered too ſtrong an affectation of it.

ELOQUENCE, become a ſtranger to the works of learned men, was ſtill cultivated by a ſmall number of real Orators, whom popular opinion placed far below all thoſe faſhionable declaimers. But, in the hiſtory of the arts there are remarkable epochs, when a ſuperior writer recals the public attention towards thoſe methods which have been abandoned, and draws along with him a number, who follow him in the courſe in which he himſelf has excelled.</p>
               <p>SUCH is the glory, which M. THOMAS hath had among us. He contributed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate revolution, which has renewed the taſte in Oratory for panegyrics: in theſe, he hath diſplayed as much Eloquence, as Fontenelle had diſcovered of penetration.<note n="*" place="bottom">FONTENELLE was a celebrated French author, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Voltaire the moſt univerſal genius of the age of Louis XIV. He wrote on a variety of ſubjects, particularly a number of pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics on the deceaſed members of the Academy of Sciences, to which he had been appointed perpetual ſecretary.
See <hi>New and General Biographical Dictionary.</hi>
                  </note> He inſpired the moſt lively enthuſiaſm for great men. He improved the mind by the excellence of his ſentiments. He directed his diſcourſes to an uſeful object. He, in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, promoted the utility of his writings by collecting them together, and enriching them with his "Eſſay on Panegyrics."

               <p>THE ſtyle, which M. Thomas cultivated, poſſeſſes much of that manner, ſo well adapted for the pulpit, by the elevation of the ideas, and the moral ſtrain, which is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally to be found in them. Do we wiſh to ſee the example of this writer become ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to preachers? Let us recollect, that, in the corruption of Eloquence, the language of Religion was forgotten; and that, in order to impart to our miniſtry its former luſtre, we muſt, at once, become Orators, and Chriſtian Orators.</p>
               <p>IT is by inceſſantly reading the Holy Scriptures, that we learn to ſpeak that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual language, which diffuſes through a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, repreſentations alternately affecting, majeſtic, or terrible.</p>
               <p>LET us never conſider it as a painful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, that we are happily bound to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate the ſacred writings into our compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Bible is for the ſtyle of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that which mythology is for the Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of poets. In the ſacred volumes, there are to be found thoughts ſo ſublime, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo energetic, deſcriptions ſo eloquent,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:032455_0207_0FF26C9DD8688CE8"/>allegories ſo well choſen, ſentences ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, ejaculations ſo pathetic, ſentiments ſo tender, that we ſhould adopt them from taſte, if we were ſo unhappy as not to ſearch after them from a principle of zeal and piety.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Without doubt a preacher ought to affect people by ſtrong, and ſometimes even by terrible images: but it is from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he ſhould learn to make powerful impreſſions. There he may clearly diſcover the way to make ſermons plain and popular, without loſing the force and dignity they ought always to have."—"The ſtudy of the ſacred writings was, in the firſt ages of the church, reckoned to be ſufficient. Hence came that paſſage in the apoſtolical conſtitutions, which ſays, "If you want hiſtory, or laws, or moral precepts, or eloquence, or poetry, you will find them all in the ſcriptures." In effect, it is needleſs to ſeek elſewhere for any thing that is neceſſary to form our taſte and judgment of true Eloquence. St. Auſtin ſays, we ought to exalt and improve our knowledge, by the authority of ſcripture; and our language, by the dignity of its expreſſions.</q>
                     <p>
                        <q>The difference betwixt them [the beſt heathen and inſpired writings] will, upon compariſon, be found much to the honour of ſcripture. It ſurpaſſes them vaſtly in native ſimplicity, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and grandeur. Homer himſelf never reached the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of Moſes's ſongs; eſpecially the laſt (Deut. xxxii. 1, &amp;c.) which all the Iſraelitiſh children were to learn by heart. Never did any ode, either Greek or Latin, come up to the loftineſs of the Pſalms: that one, in particular, which begins thus; "The mighty God, even the Lord, hath ſpoken," (Pſal. 1, &amp;c.) ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the utmoſt ſtretch of human invention. Neither Homer, nor any other poet, ever equalled Iſaiah deſcribing the majeſty of God, in whoſe ſight the "nations of the earth are as the ſmall duſt; yea leſs than nothing, and vanity;" ſeeing it is He that ſtretcheth out the heavens like a curtain, and ſpreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in." (Ch. xl. 10, &amp;c) Sometimes this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet has all the ſweetneſs of an eclogue, in the ſmiling images he gives us of peace: (See ch. xi. and xxxv.) and ſometimes he ſoars ſo high as to leave every thing below him. What is there in antiquity that can be compared to the Lamentations of Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, when he tenderly deplores the miſeries of his country? (v. 2, &amp;c. ch. ii. and ch. iii.) or to the prophecy of Nahum, when he foreſees in ſpirit the proud Nineveh fall under the rage of an invincible army? (i. 3, &amp;c.) We fancy that we ſee the army, and hear the noiſe of arms and chariots. Every thing is painted in ſuch a lively manner, as ſtrikes the imagination. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet far out-does Homer. Read likewiſe Daniel denouncing to Belſhazzar the divine vengeance ready to overwhelm him; and try if you can find any thing in the moſt ſublime originals of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that can be compared to thoſe paſſages of ſacred writ. In all the reſt of ſcripture there appears a natural and beautiful variety.</q>

                     <p>Dr. BLAIR recommends the language of Sacred Scripture to Preachers, by ſaying, that <q>when properly employed, it is a great ornament to ſermons. It may be employed, either in the way of quotation, or alluſion. Direct quotations brought from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in order to ſupport what the preacher inculcates, both give authority to his doctrine, and render his diſcourſe more ſolemn and venerable. Alluſions to remarkable paſſages, or expreſſions of ſcripture, when introduced with propriety, have generally a pleaſing effect. They afford the preacher a fund of metaphorical expreſſion, which no other compoſition enjoys, and by means of which he can vary and enliven his ſtyle. But he muſt take care that any ſuch alluſions be natural and eaſy; for if they ſeem forced, they approach to the nature of conceits.</q> Dr. Blair refers us for examples to Biſhop Sherlock's Diſcourſes, vol. i. diſc. i. and to Seed's Sermons, ſerm. iv.</p>

A CHRISTIAN Orator may, and even ought to, ſeize upon all the riches, which he diſcovers in theſe divine books. It is there where plagiariſm is permitted him, and the more treaſures he draws from thence, the better are his auditors pleaſed with his thefts.</p>
               <p>QUOTATIONS from inſpired authors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come authorities, which render the miniſtry of a Chriſtian Orator more venerable; and witneſſes, which he derives from heaven or hell, in order to inſtruct the earth.</p>
               <p>WOE! Woe to him, if he be aſhamed of the goſpel, at the very time when he is
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032455_0209_0FF26CA1B59525D8"/>preaching it, and if, from an indecent and criminal complaiſance, he dare not name Jeſus Chriſt in that pulpit, where he comes to occupy his place!</p>
               <p>AN abundance of new and unknown beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtill remain in the Holy Scriptures to excite the preacher's emulation.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER be the thought which he wiſhes to expreſs, he will always find the primary idea, at leaſt, in the books of Revelation, if he have ſufficient zeal to read them daily, and ſufficient diſcernment properly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. When ſearching for a paſſage which he wants, he thereby diſcovers other paſſages, which he reſerves for the ſubjects to which they are adapted. But he ought only to make uſe of ſtriking quotations; becauſe it is not neceſſary to ſpeak the language of inſpiration, in order to ſay common things.</p>
               <p>THE preacher may derive from the Bible hiſtorical compariſons, the only ones which are ſuitable for the ſtyle of the pulpit, where they always ſucceed; and thoſe analogies preſent themſelves involuntarily to an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who has grown familiar with the ſacred books.</p>
               <p>MASSILLON excels in this reſpect. You will find, in all his diſcourſes, ſometimes very ſhort compariſons, which throw light upon
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032455_0210_0FF26C7D9A145888"/>his idea, and, at other times, compariſons of greater length, which form admirable frames, in which he incloſes the picture of morals.</p>
               <p>SUCH is that rhetorical turn, which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys in his ſermon "on the Word of God," when he attacks that common abuſe of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon religious inſtruction, only with a view of depreciating the talents of the Preacher. Maſſillon makes a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to his hearers of the reproach, which Joſeph addreſſed, in diſguiſe, to his brethren: <q>It is not to ſeek for bread, that ye are come into Egypt; ye are come here as ſpies; to obſerve the weak places of this country <hi>ye are ſpies; to ſee the nakedneſs of the land are ye come.</hi>

               <p>WE reckon among the Fathers, many very learned writers in profane antiquity, ſuch as CLEMENT <hi>of Alexandria,</hi> ORIGEN, EUSEBIUS <hi>of Coeſarca,</hi> JEROM, and AUGUSTINE.</p>
               <p>I AM aware, that, in their writings, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſtyle doth not always correſpond with the extent of erudition, eſpecially if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with Cicero and Demoſthenes. But, according to the judicious obſervation of the Abbé de Fleury<note n="†" place="bottom">Second Diſcourſe.</note> when it is intended
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:032455_0214_0FF26CF0AD063EC0"/>to appreciate the merits of the Fathers of the Church, we muſt not forget the time when, nor the country where, they lived; nor to contraſt them with their moſt celebrated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, AMBROSE, with SYMMACHUS; BASIL, with LIBANIUS; and then we perceive how much ſuperior they have been to their age.</p>
               <p>IT is not, however, requiſite that a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould read all tradition. For this, his life would ſcarcely ſuffice. But, by making a ſelection of two or three Fathers of the church, the moſt conſonant to his genius; by confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, moreover, to their rhetorical writings, he will find in them ideas ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtriking to embelliſh and give weight to his ſermons.</p>
               <p>ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM is principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of having the choice of a Chriſtian Orator fixed upon him. His diction is pure and ſplendid; his eloquence is tender and perſuaſive; and he abounds ſo much in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime deſcriptions, or ingenious ideas, that we find paſſages to quote in every page of his writings.</p>
               <p>POPE CLEMENT XI. who, during his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, preached yearly at Rome on Eaſter and Chriſtmas days, and the feaſt of St. Peter, had the art of making an admirable uſe of Chryſoſtom's writings. His homilies are an

                     <q>As to the ſtyle of ſermons, it offends againſt all rules, if it be not pathetic, nervous, and ſublime. The path hath been pointed out by St. Chryſoſtom. He who was always with God, always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Abp. FENELON thus characteriſes Chryſoſtom: <q>His ſtyle is copious, but he did not ſtudy falſe ornaments. All his diſcourſe tends to perſuaſion: he placed every thing with judgment, and was well acquainted with the holy Scripture, and the manners of men. He entered into their hearts; and rendered things famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iarly ſenſible to them. He had ſublime and ſolid notions; and is ſometimes very affecting. Upon the whole, we muſt own he is a great Orator.</q>

                     <p>"Among the Greek Fathers," ſays Dr. BLAIR, <q>the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, by far, for his oratorial merit, is St. Chryſoſtom. His language is pure; his ſtyle highly figured. He is copious, ſmooth, and ſometimes pathetic. But he retains, at the ſame time, much of that character, which has been always attributed to the Aſiatic Eloquence, diffuſe and redundant to a great degree, and often overwrought and tumid. He may be read, however, with advantage, for the Eloquence of the pulpit, as being freer of falſe ornaments than the Latin Fathers.</q>

               <p>BOSSUET, who, himſelf, may be reckoned among the Fathers, and whom, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, we quote in our ſermons as we do them, ſufficiently teſtifies, by his example, how advantageous it is for a Chriſtian Orator to ſtudy the Fathers.

               <p>WHO would not be ambitious to have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, as he did, this admirable deſcription from S. AUGUSTINE, which repreſents the troubles of human life? <q>Worldings do not think that they uſe exerciſe, unleſs they diſquiet themſelves; nor that they move, unleſs they make a noiſe. That man, who is complaining of too much labour, were he delivered from that trouble, could not endure his repoſe. At one time, the day's work appears to him too ſhort; at another time, his leiſure would be to him a burden: he loves his ſervitude, and is pleaſed with his weight; and this conſtant impulſe, which involves him in a thouſand embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments, prevents him from gratifying himſelf with the image of unreſtrained lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty.

               <p>IT is ſometimes allowable to quote, in the pulpit, the profane writers of antiquity, provided that ſuch citations be not long, nor frequent, nor accompanied with hiſtorical relations foreign to religion.</p>
               <p>OUR old preachers flattered themſelves that they were very eloquent, when they had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into one barbarous compilation, which they called a Chriſtian diſcourſe, ſome ſhreds of poetry, eloquence, or hiſtory.</p>
               <p>THE author of "Pulpit-maxims," inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly compares thoſe ſermons blended with the principles of religion, and the maxims of Paganiſm, "to the Temple at Jeruſalem built with the marble and cedars of king Hiram."</p>

BUT it is no leſs certain, that Chriſtian Eloquence doth not exclude heathen teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, when the Orator is pointing out the duties of morality or the particulars of good conduct.</p>
               <p>S. BASIL has compoſed a treatiſe, in order to prove the utility of reading heathen authors. Boſſuet, whoſe learning equalled his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, drew, from time to time, out of thoſe authors, ſublime thoughts, which he quoted in the pulpit; and Bourdaloue, in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on "the love of riches," hath paraphraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this maxim of Horace,

               <p>LET us not, however, make an improper uſe of theſe examples.

               <p>THAT is a charming and flowing Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which, far from exciting violent agitations, gently inſinuates itſelf into the ſoul, and there awakes the tendereſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which is a ſucceſſion of natural and moving ſentiments, copiouſly diffuſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo that, when experienced, the Orator who inſpires them is forgotten, and we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we are converſing with ourſelves. Each word increaſes the emotion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a certain ſympathy, which affects and expands every heart.</p>
               <p>SUCH is the Eloquence of Fenelon. The firſt part of his diſcourſe <q>On the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elector of Cologne,</q> is written with the energy and ſublimity of Boſſuet; the ſecond denotes a ſenſibility, which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Fenelon.

<p>The character and method of Fenelon have been thus deſcribed: <q>He viſited his dioceſe very diligently, and preached in all the churches of it. In his public inſtructions, he ſuited his diſcourſes to every capacity; ſpeaking to the weak in an eaſy and familiar manner, whilſt he raiſed his ſtyle for thoſe who had a more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated genius. His ſermons flowed from his heart; he did not write them down, and hardly meditated on them beforehand. He only ſhut himſelf up in his cloſet to obtain by his prayers the knowledge he wanted. His only view was to be like a good father, to comfort, to relieve, and to inſtruct his flock. He was a man of extenſive learning, great genius, and of an exquiſite taſte and irreproachable morals.</q> Was born 1651, died 1715.

                     <p>In the Eulogium delivered by M. MAURY on Abp. Fenelon, before the French Academy, in 1771, he gives us the following, among many other, traits of this great and good man. <q>The eulogium of the Archbiſhop of Cambray is none other than his hiſtory written with faithfulneſs. Here, there is no occaſion to exaggerate or diſſemble.

BOURDALOUE has compoſed four different ſermons upon the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet he hath not made one ſingle Good Friday ſermon, of which the diſtinguiſhing character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic ſhould be to affect.

The mildneſs and ſimplicity of the Indians affected him ſo ſtrongly, that he made himſelf an eccleſiaſtic, in order to devote his labours to their converſion. But this ſoon became the leaſt of his attentions. As he was more a man than a prieſt, he felt more for the cruelties exerciſed againſt them, than for their ſuperſtitions. He employed every method in order to comfort the people for whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an attachment, or to ſoften their tyrants. He became the avowed patron of the Indians; and, by his bold interpoſitions on their behalf, as well as by the reſpect due to his abilities and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he had often the merit of ſetting ſome bounds to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of his countrymen.

The noted RICHARD BAXTER, alſo, though too fond of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and his ſtyle, far from being correct or elegant, has, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in ſome of his practical pieces, and particularly in that one intituled <hi>the Saints everlaſting Reſt,</hi> ſome fine and affecting paſſages. He only wanted <q>his genius to be curbed by ſalutary checks,</q> to have obtained, in his practical works, the character of a pathetic writer. There is in HOWE'S "living temple," a grand and beautiful metaphorical deſcription of human depravity under the idea of a ruinous temple (p. 155;) and in Biſhop SHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOCK'S diſcourſes, a fine and much admired piece of Eloquence, where the character of our Bleſſed Lord is contraſted with that of the impoſtor Mahomet, (v. i. p. 271;) though, perhaps, neither of theſe can be properly claſſed as <hi>pathetic</hi> pieces.

                     <p>
                        <q>There muſt be a charm added by the creative power of genius, which no didactic rules can teach, which cannot be adequately deſcribed, but which is powerfully felt by the vibrations of the heart-ſtrings, and which cauſes an irreſiſtible overflowing of the <hi>ſacri fontes lachrymarum.</hi>

                        <q>Florid diction and pompous declamation are, indeed, found to be the leaſt adapted of all modes of addreſs to affect the finer ſenſibilities of nature. Plain words, without epithets, without metaphors, without ſimilies, have oftener excited emotions of the tendereſt ſympathy, than the moſt laboured compoſitions of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille. A few words of ſimple pathos will penetrate the ſoul to the quick, when a hundred lines of declamation ſhall aſſail it as feebly and ineffectually, as a gentle gale the mountain of Plin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limmon.</q>

"I may challenge," ſays Mr. Jefferſon, <q>the whole Orations of Demoſthenes and Cicero, and of any more eminent Orator, if Europe has furniſhed more eminent, to produce a ſingle paſſage ſuperior to the ſpeech of Logan, a Mingo chief, to lord Dunmore, when governor of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. The following incidents that occurred in the ſpring of the year 1774, were the occaſion of it. A robbery and murder had been committed on the inhabitants of the frontiers of Virginia, by two Indians. The neighbouring whites, according to their cuſtom, undertook to puniſh this outrage in a ſummary way. A party was collected, and proceeded in queſt of vengeance. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was ſeen coming from the oppoſite ſhore, unarmed, and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an hoſtile attack from the whites. The moment the canoe reached the ſhore, the white party, who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, ſingled out their objects, and, at one fire, killed every perſon in it. This happened to be the family of Logan, who had been long diſtinguiſhed as a friend of the whites. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized himſelf in the war which enſued A deciſive battle was ſoon afterwards ſought, in which the Indians were defeated and ſued for peace. Logan, however, diſdained to be ſeen among the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants. But, leſt the ſincerity of a treaty ſhould be diſtruſted, from which ſo diſtinguiſhed a chief abſented himſelf, he ſent by a meſſenger the following ſpeech to be delivered to lord Dunmore:</q>

               <p>IF pathos be requiſite in a Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it is undoubtedly in the Peroration. There, the Orator ought to ſet in motion all
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032455_0231_0FF26CBDD9859990"/>the ſprings of ſenſibility, and to ſtrike the greateſt ſtrokes of Eloquence.</p>
               <p>ALL moral ſubjects tend to pathetic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. The attention of the auditory,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032455_0232_0FF26CFF9F142958"/>which always revives towards the cloſe of the ſermon, invites the Chriſtian miniſter to finiſh inſtruction by moving and energetic repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032455_0233_0FF26CC4C4199B38"/>which may powerfully affect the conſcience, and leave an indelible impreſſion upon every mind.</p>
               <p>SOME rhetoricians have laid it down as an eſtabliſhed maxim in the art of Oratory, to recapitulate, in this part of the diſcourſe, the principal arguments, and to offer an analy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I MAKE bold to object to this method, which neither Demoſthenes nor Cicero ever followed.</p>
               <p>IF this recapitulation of the proofs ought to terminate a diſcourſe, ought it not eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be adopted at the Bar?</p>
               <p>IT would be to no purpoſe to object to me here the example of Cicero, in his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Oration againſt Verres. The Orator ſucceſſively invokes, in his Peroration, all the gods and goddeſſes, whoſe temples this robber

               <p>NOW Cicero omits all theſe outrages at the concluſion of his diſcourſe, and only reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the accuſed with his ſacrileges.</p>
               <p>IT is not, therefore, true, that the Roman Orator preſents to his judges a ſummary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>MASSILLON, I confeſs, haſtily runs over ſome of his ideas in the Peroration of his diſcourſe, "on the certainty of a future ſtate;" but he does not grow languid, when he touches upon the contradictions with which he charges the wicked; and he quickly extricates himſelf by ſome moving paſſages.</p>

BESIDES, one ſingle example ſhould not ſuffice for eſtabliſhing a general rule.

Who doth not perceive, that ſuch ſort of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries would leave both the preacher and the congregation unaffected?</p>
               <p>THE Orator's concluſion muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſimple ſpeculative conſequences. He has done nothing as yet when he has proved the truth of his principles. This is the point from which he ſhould proceed, in order to ſubdue the paſſions, that the ſinner may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no excuſe, and that conviction may bring him to repentance.</p>

Reading is peculiar to this nation, and is endured in no other. It has indeed made our ſermons more exact, and has thus produced many volumes of the beſt that are extant. But, after all, though ſome few read ſo happily, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſo truly, and enter ſo entirely into thoſe affections, which they recommend, that, in them, we ſee both the correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of reading, and the ſeriouſneſs of ſpeaking ſermons; yet every one is not ſo happy; ſome by hanging their heads per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually over their notes, by blundering as they read, and by a curſory running over them, do ſo leſſen the matter of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that, as they are generally read with very little life or affection, ſo they are heard with as little regard, or eſteem. Thoſe who read, ought certainly to be at a little more pains, than, for the moſt part, they are, to read true; to pronounce with an emphaſis; to raiſe their head, and to direct their eyes to their hearers: and if they practiſed more, alone, the juſt way of reading, they might deliver their ſermons with much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.

                     <p>The learned Dr. WATTS, in his Thoughts, intitled <q>Words without Spirit,</q> deſcribes the following character: <q>Lectorius is a pious man; and worthy miniſter in a country pariſh; his diſcourſes are well formed, his ſentiments on almoſt every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are juſt and proper, his ſtyle is modern, and not unpolite, nor does he utterly neglect the paſſions in the turn of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures; yet I cannot call him a good preacher, for he does not only uſe his written notes to ſecure his method, and to relieve his memory, but he ſcarce ever takes his eye from of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his laſt ſermon, he had a uſe of reproof for ſome vices which were practiſed in a public and ſhameleſs manner in his pariſh, and he thought that theſe ſins ought not to eſcape a public rebuke. The paragraph was well drawn up, and indeed it was animated with ſome juſt and awful ſeverities of language; yet he had not courage enough to chide the guilty, nor to animate his voice with any juſt degree of zeal. However, the good man did his beſt, he went into the pulpit, and read them a chiding.</q>

                        <q>His conduct is juſt the ſame when he deſigns his addreſs in his paper to any of the ſofter paſſions; for by the coldneſs of his pronunciation, and keeping his eye ever fixed on his notes, he makes very little impreſſion on his hearers. When he ſhould awaken ſenſeleſs and obſtinate ſinners, and pluck them as brands out of the burning, he only reals to them out of his book ſome words of pity, or perhaps a uſe of terror; and if he would lament over their impenitence and approaching ruin, he can do no more than read them a chapter of lamentation.</q>

                     <p>Dr. BLAIR ſhall conclude the authorities quoted upon this point: <q>With regard to the pulpit, it has certainly been a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that the practice of reading ſermons has prevailed ſo univerſally in England. This may, indeed, have introduced ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy; but it has done great prejudice to Eloquence; for a diſcourſe re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The odium of the different ſects, about the time of the Reſtoration, drove the eſtabliſhed Church from that warmth which the ſectaries were judged to have carried too far, into the oppoſite extreme of a ſtudied coolneſs, and compoſure of manner. Hence, from the art of perſuaſion, which preaching ought always to be, it has paſſed, in England, into mere reaſoning and inſtruction; which not only has brought down the Eloquence of the Pulpit to a lower tone than it might juſtly aſſume; but has produced this farther effect, that, by accuſtoming the public <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The ſame author ſays elſewhere, <q>that the practice of reading ſermons is one of the greateſt obſtacles to the Eloquence of the Pulpit in Great-Britain, where alone this practice prevails. No diſcourſe, which is deſigned to be perſuaſive, can have the ſame force when read, as when ſpoken. The common people all feel this, and their prejudice againſt this practice is not without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in nature: what is gained hereby in point of correctneſs, is not equal to what is loſt in point of perſuaſion and force?</q>

               <p>MASSILLON ſpoke alſo with much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but ſcarcely made uſe of any action.</p>
               <p>THE Abbé POULLE and the Abbé RENAUD, and Orator of older ſtanding, have united, to their other talents, action of a higher qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and there is no preacher of this century who has been able to equal them in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
               <p>IT is an excellent method to reviſe a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as ſoon as it has been preached. The pulpit diſcovers its beauties and its faults; and, provided the Orator is ſkilful to remark the impreſſion that the diſcourſe makes upon the auditory, it is eaſy for him to obſerve the weak or prolix paſſages, which require to be improved.</p>
               <p>LET him, then, paſs judgment upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when quitting the pulpit, leſs by the report of others, than by his own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <head>SECTION LX. <hi>Of Motives to excite the Emulation of Chriſtian Orators.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I AM aware that theſe multiplied correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions occaſion very painful labour to Chriſtian preachers. Nevertheleſs, that which is really diſheartening and ſeriouſly alarming to us in our miniſtry, is neither the ſtudy, which compoſition requires, nor the reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which memory impoſes on us; but the diſcouragements increaſing as we grow old in our profeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the laſſitude, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually attends the repetition of ſermons, no longer delivered but with reluctance; the certainty of diſcovering faults continually in our diſcourſes, and of finding ourſelves, thus, not only very much on this ſide perfection, but even below the level of our own abilities; and, above all, the indifference of our age for religion. Hence it is, that perſons attend to religious inſtruction, as they would to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſpectacle; that they are deſirous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing our zeal to the ſacrifice of the moſt important truths, and the moſt forcible Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to I know not what frivolous ſubject, or rhetorical flowers; and that, in fine, it ſeems as if it were expected of us to degrade
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:032455_0248_0FF26D1189946C50"/>ourſelves, both as Apoſtles and Orators, in order to pleaſe the multitude.</p>
               <p>THESE draughts are, no doubt, bitter. It is, however, neceſſary to ſwallow them, ſhould we only ſucceed in reclaiming one wicked man to virtue, of preſerving one wretched man from deſpair; in a word, of preventing one ſingle crime from the earth.</p>
               <p>AH! what more can be neceſſary in order to quicken our ardour? Is there a virtuous and feeling mind, that can deſpiſe ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful reward?</p>
               <p>WE ſhall have fulfilled the end of our vocation, when we render ourſelves uſeful to men; in their felicity we ſhall receive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification for all our ſacrifices: the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remembrance of our youthful labours will ſerve to delight the ſolitude, and to conſole the inactivity, of our advanced years; and, when Death ſahll lay his heavy hand upon our eye-lids, we ſhall each be able to ſay to that great GOD, whoſe laws we have publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <q>O my Father! thou haſt given me thy children to inſtruct. I reſtore them to thee better. Remember all the bleſſings, which thou haſt poured upon thy people, through the inſtrumentality of thy miniſtering ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Let the tears, which I have dried up, the tears, which I have excited when
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:032455_0249_0FF26C7F495C7FE8"/>pleading in thy name, plead with thee on my behalf. I have been the inſtrument of thy clemency: make me hereafter the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thy tender mercies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>EVERY other inducement, doubtleſs, dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to a point before theſe great objects.</p>
               <p>IF it were allowable, when entering upon this courſe of life, to hold human encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in any degree of eſtimation, I ſhould ſay, without dread of contradiction, that, with a view of reviving the reliſh for Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oquence, the ſame means are made uſe of among us, which excited ſo ſucceſsful an emulation in the excellent days of the age of Louis XIV.</p>
               <p>NEVER, in the record of eccleſiaſtical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, have Chriſtian Orators found a more diſtinguiſhed attention paid to their labours, nor a more marked good will to reward their talents.</p>
               <p>AFTER having, in this manner, unfolded the ideas, which have ariſen in my own mind, on the ſubject of Eloquence, I am not afraid of being charged with having ſacriſiced the rules of taſte to the purpoſes of my own vanity.</p>
               <p>THE theories of individuals are, for the moſt part, only indirect apologies for the compoſitions of their authors; and, deſpair
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032455_0250_0FF26D14468D71C8"/>of equalling the ancient models, often gives riſe to extravagant ſyſtems.</p>
               <p>BUT if my rhetorical writings be inferior to my theory, I can, at leaſt, willingly bear this teſtimony, from the bottom of my heart, that, in deriving the Principles of Eloquence from nature, or from the chief performances of our greateſt maſters, I have been actuated by no other motive than a warm attachment to truth, and the moſt earneſt ſolicitude to contribute to the advancement of ſcience.</p>
