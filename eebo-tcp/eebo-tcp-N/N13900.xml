            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE formerly taken the liberty of holding ſome prefatory diſcourſe with my readers, on the ſubject of thoſe little hiſtories, which accident had enabled me to lay before them. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the laſt time I ſhall make uſe of their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and even, if this Introduction ſhould be found ſuperfluous, it may claim their pardon, as the parting addreſs of one, who has endeavoured to contribute to their entertainment.</p>
                  <p>I was favoured laſt ſummer with a viſit from a gentleman, a native of <hi>France,</hi> with whoſe father I had been intimately acquainted when I was laſt in that country. I confeſs myſelf particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with an intercourſe, which removes the barrier of national diſtinction, and gives to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world the appearance of one common family. I received, therefore, this young
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:017578_0003_0FBA6F4CEF91BC00"/>
Frenchman into that humble ſhed, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has allowed my age to reſt in, with peculiar ſatisfaction, and was rewarded, for any little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention I had in my power to ſhew him, by acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the friendſhip of one, whom I found to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all that paternal worth, which had fixed my eſteem, about a dozen years ago, in <hi>Paris.</hi> In truth, ſuch attention always rewards itſelf; and, I believe, my own feelings, which I expreſſed to this amiable and accompliſhed Frenchman on his leaving <hi>England,</hi> are ſuch as every one will own, whoſe mind is ſuſceptible of feeling at all. He was profuſe of thanks, to which my good offices had no title, but from the inclination that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them.—<hi>Ici, Monſieur,</hi> (ſaid I, for he had uſed a language more accommodated than ours to the leſſer order of ſentiments, and I anſwered him, as well as long want of practice would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, in the ſame tongue)—<hi>Ici, Monſieur, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur &amp; inconnu, avec beaucoup de bienveillance, mais peu de pouvoir, je ne goûte point d'un plaiſir plus ſincere, que de penſer, qu'il y a, dans aucun quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier du monde, une ame honnête, qui ſe ſouvient de moi avec reconnoiſſance.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="v" facs="unknown:017578_0004_0FBA6F5037BBBB10"/>
But I am talking of myſelf, when I ſhould be giving an account of the following papers. This gentleman, diſcourſing with me on the ſubject of thoſe letters, the ſubſtance of which I formerly publiſhed under the title of <hi>The Man of the World,</hi> obſerved, that if the deſire of ſearching into the records of private life were common, the diſcovery of ſuch collections would ceaſe to be wondered at. "We look (ſaid he) for the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of Men, among thoſe of high rank; but memoirs of ſentiment, and ſuffering, may be found in every condition.</p>
                  <p>"My father (continued my young friend) made, ſince you ſaw him, an acquiſition of that nature, by a whimſical accident. Standing one day at the door of a grocery ſhop, making enquiry as to the lodgings of ſome perſon of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a little boy paſſed him with a bundle of papers in his hand, which he offered for ſale to the maſter of the ſhop, for the ordinary uſes of his trade; but they differed about the price, and the boy was ready to depart, when my father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:017578_0005_0FBA6F51C241BE58"/>
a ſight of the papers, ſaying to the lad, with a ſmile, that, perhaps, he might deal with him for his book; upon reading a ſentence or two, he found a ſtile much above that of the ordinary manuſcripts of a grocery-ſhop, and gave the boy his price, at a venture, for the whole. When he had got home, and examined the parcel, he diſcovered it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of letters put up, for the moſt part, according to their dates, which he committed to me, as having, he ſaid, better eyes, and a keener curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, than his. I found them to contain a ſtory in detail, which, I believe, would intereſt one of your turn of thinking a good deal. If you chooſe to undergo the trouble of the peruſal, I ſhall take care to have them ſent over to you by the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity I can find, and if you will do the Public the favour to digeſt them, as you did thoſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſly</hi> and his children."—My young Frenchman ſpeaks the language of compliment; but I do not chooſe to tranſlate any further. It is enough to ſay, that I received his papers ſome time ago, and that they are thoſe which I have tranſlated, and now give to the world. I had perhaps treated them as I did the letters he mentioned; but I
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:017578_0006_0FBA6F5340C31180"/>
found it a difficult taſk to reduce them into nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, becauſe they are made up of ſentiment, which narrative would deſtroy. The only power I have exerciſed over them, is that of omitting letters, and paſſages of letters, which ſeem to bear no relation to the ſtory I mean to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. In doing this, however, I confeſs I have been cautious: I love myſelf (and am apt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from a common ſort of weakneſs, to imagine that other people love) to read nature in her ſmalleſt character, and am often more appriſed of the ſtate of the mind, from very trifling, than from very important circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>As, from age and ſituation, it is likely I ſhall addreſs the Public no more, I cannot avoid taking this opportunity, of thanking it for the reception it has given, to thoſe humble pages which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly introduced to its notice. Unknown, and unpatronized, I had little pretenſion to its favour and little expectation of it; writing, or arranging the writings of others, was, to me, only a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite amuſement, for which a man eaſily finds both time and apology. One advantage I drew
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:017578_0007_0FBA6F5510D04E58"/>
from it, which the humane may hear with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; I often wandered from my own woe, in tracing the tale of another's affliction, and, at this moment, every ſentence I write, I am but eſcaping a little farther from the preſſure of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Of the merit or faults of the compoſition, in the volumes of which I have directed the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a ſmall ſhare only was mine; for their tendency I hold myſelf entirely accountable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, had it been a bad one, I had the power of ſuppreſſing them; and from their tendency, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, more than any other quality belonging to them, has the indulgence of their readers ariſen. For that indulgence I deſire to return them my grateful acknowledgments as an editor; I ſhall be proud with better reaſon, if there is nothing to be found, in my publications, that may forfeit their eſteem as a man.</p>

JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ. A SENTIMENTAL NOVEL. IN A SERIES OF LETTERS.</head>

                  <head>LETTER I. JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ TO MARIA DE RONCILLES.</head>
                  <p>"THE friendſhip of your Maria misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune can never deprive you of."—Theſe were the words with which you ſealed that attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we had formed in the bliſsful period of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. The remembrance of thoſe peaceful days we paſſed together in the convent, is often recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my mind, amidſt the cares of the preſent. Yet do not think me fooliſh enough to complain of the want of thoſe pleaſures which affluence gave us; the ſituation of my father's affairs is ſuch as to exclude luxury, but it allows happineſs; and, were it not for the recollection of what he
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017578_0009_0FBA6F5A82738488"/>
once poſſeſſed, which now and then intrudes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon him, he could ſcarce form a wiſh that were not gratified in the retreat he has found.</p>
                  <p>You were wont to call me the little philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher; if it be philoſophy to feel no violent diſtreſs from that change which the ill-fortune of our family has made in its circumſtances, I do not claim much merit from being that way a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. From my earlieſt days I found myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambitious of wealth or grandeur, contented with the enjoyment of ſequeſtered life, and fearful of the dangers which attend an exalted ſtation. It is therefore more properly a weakneſs, than a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in me, to be ſatisfied with my preſent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                  <p>But, after all, my friend, what is it we have loſt? We have exchanged the life of gaiety, of tumults, of pleaſure they call it, which we led in Paris, when my father was a rich man; for the pure, the peaceful, the truly happy ſcenes which this place affords us, now he is a poor one. Dependence and poverty alone are ſuffered to complain; but they know not how often great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is dependent, and wealth is poor. Formerly, even during the very ſhort ſpace of the year we were at <hi>Belville,</hi> it was vain to think of that domeſtic enjoyment I uſed to hope for in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017578_0010_0FBA6F5E8F4F2C98"/>
we were people of too much conſequence to be allowed the privilege of retirement, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe luxurious walks I ſometimes found means to take—with you, my dear, I mean—the day was as little my own, as in the midſt of our win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hurry in town.</p>
                  <p>The loſs of this momentous law-ſuit has brought us down to the level of tranquility. Our days are not now pre-occupied by numberleſs engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor our time anxiouſly divided for a rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of amuſements; I can walk, read, or think, without the officious interruption of polite viſitors; and, inſtead of talking eternally of others, I find time to ſettle accounts with myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Could we but prevail on my father to think thus!—Alas! his mind is not formed for contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that narrow ſphere, which his fortune has now marked out for him. He feels adverſity a defeat, to which the vanquiſhed ſubmit, with pride in their looks, but anguiſh in their hearts. He is cut off from the enjoyment of his preſent ſtate, while he puts himſelf under the cruel ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of diſſembling his regret for the loſs of the former.</p>
                  <p>I can eaſily perceive how much my deareſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is affected by this. I ſee her conſtantly on the watch for every word and look that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017578_0011_0FBA6F60790A7A60"/>
his feelings; and ſhe has, too often, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to obſerve them unfavourable. She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and commonly ſucceeds in her endeavour, to put on the appearance of cheerfulneſs; ſhe even tries to perſuade herſelf that ſhe has reaſon to be contented; but, alas! an effort to be happy, is always but an increaſe of our uneaſineſs.</p>
                  <p>And what is left for your JULIA to do? In truth, I fear, I am of little ſervice. My heart is too much intereſted in the ſcene, to allow me that command over myſelf, which would make me uſeful. My father often remarks, that I look grave; I ſmile (fooliſhly I fear) and deny it; it is, I believe, no more than I uſed to do formerly; but we were then in a ſituation that did not lead him to obſerve it. He had no conſciouſneſs in himſelf, to prompt the obſervation.</p>
                  <p>How often do I wiſh for you, MARIA, to aſſiſt me! There is ſomething in that ſmile of yours (I paint it to myſelf at this inſtant) which care and ſorrow are unable to withſtand; beſides the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effect produced by the intervention of a third perſon, in a ſociety, the members of which are afraid to think of one another's thoughts.—Yet you need not anſwer this wiſh of mine; I know how impoſſible it is for you to come hither at preſent. Write to me as often as you can; you will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017578_0012_0FBA6F61EE9811F0"/>
order in my letters, nor obſerve it in your anſwers; I will ſpeak to you on paper when my heart is full, and you will anſwer me from the ſympathy of yours.</p>

                  <head>LETTER II. JULIA TO MARIA.</head>
                  <p>I AM to vex my MARIA with an account of trifles, and thoſe too, unpleaſant ones, but ſhe has taught me to think, that nothing is inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to her, in which I am concerned, and inſiſts on participating, at leaſt if ſhe cannot alleviate, my diſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>I am every day more and more uneaſy about the chagrin which our ſituation ſeems to give my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A little incident has juſt now plunged him into a fit of melancholy, which all the attention of my mother, all the attempts at gaiety which your poor JULIA is conſtrained to make, cannot diſſipate or overcome.</p>
                  <p>Our old ſervant Le Blanc is your acquaintance; indeed he very ſoon becomes acquainted with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very friend and viſitor of the family, his age prompting him to talk, and giving him the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of talking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017578_0013_0FBA6F63627359E8"/>
Le Blanc had obtained permiſſion, a few days ſince, to go on a viſit to his daughter, who is married to a young fellow, ſerving in the capacity of coachman at a gentleman's in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Belville.</hi> He returned laſt night, and, in his uſual familiar manner, gave us an account of his expedition this morning.</p>
                  <p>My father enquired after his daughter: He gave ſome ſhort anſwer as to her; but I ſaw by his face that he was full of ſome other intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. He was ſtanding behind my father, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one hand on the back of his chair; he began to rubit violently, as if he would have given the wood a poliſh by the friction. "I was at <hi>Belville,</hi> Sir," ſaid he. My father made no reply; but Le Blanc had got over the difficulty of beginning, and was too much occupied by the idea of the ſcene, to forbear attempting the picture.</p>
                  <p>"When I ſtruck off the high road, ſaid he, to go down by the Old Avenue, I thought I had loſt my way; there was not a tree to be ſeen. You may believe me as you pleaſe, Sir; but, I declare, I ſaw the rooks that uſed to build there, in a great flock over my head, croaking for all the world as if they had been looking for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue too. Old Laſune's houſe where you, Miſs, (turning to me) would frequently ſtop in your
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017578_0014_0FBA6F689E7107A0"/>
walks, was pulled down, except a ſingle beam at one end, which now ſerves for a rubbing-poſt to ſome cattle that graze there; and your roan horſe, Sir, which the Marquis had of you in a preſent, when he purchaſed <hi>Belville,</hi> has been turned out to graſs among the reſt, it ſeems; for there he was, ſtanding under the ſhade of the wall; and when I came up, the poor beaſt knew me, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chriſtian would, and came neighing up to my ſide as he was wont to do. I gave him a piece of bread I had put in my pocket in the morning, and he followed me for more, till I reached the very gate of the houſe; I mean what was the gate, when I knew it; for there is now a rail run acroſs, with a ſmall door, which Le Sauvre told me they call Chineſe. But after all, the Marquis is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there to enjoy thoſe fine things; he lives in town, Le Sauvre ſays, eleven months in the year, and only comes down to <hi>Belville,</hi> for a few weeks to get money to ſpend in Paris."</p>
                  <p>Here Le Blanc pauſed in his narration. I was afraid to look up to ſee its effect on my father; indeed the picture which the poor fellow had, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, drawn, had too much affected myſelf.—Laſune's houſe!—My MARIA remembers it; but ſhe knows not all the ties which its recollection has upon me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017578_0015_0FBA6F6A3A097F88"/>
I ſtole however a ſide-long glance at my father. He ſeemed affected, but diſdain was mixed with his tenderneſs; he gathered up his features, as it were, to hide the effect of the recital. "You ſaw Le Sauvre then?" ſaid he coolly.—"Yes," anſwered Le Blanc; but he is wonderfully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince he was in your ſervice, Sir; when I firſt diſcovered him, he was in the garden picking ſome greens for his dinner; he looked ſo rueful when he lifted up his head and ſaw me! indeed I was little better myſelf, when I caſt my eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round. It was a ſad ſight to ſee! for the Marquis keeps no gardener, except Le Sauvre himſelf, who has fifty things to do beſides, and only hires another hand or two, for the time he reſides at <hi>Belville</hi> in the ſummer. The walks that uſed to be trimmed ſo nicely, are covered with mole-hills; the hedges are full of great holes and Le Sauvre's chickens were baſking in the flower-beds. He took me into the houſe, and his wife ſeemed glad to ſee her old acquaintance, and the children clambered up to kiſs me, and Jeanot aſked me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his god-mother, meaning you, Madam, and his little ſiſter enquired after her handſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, as ſhe uſed to call you, Miſs. "I have got, ſaid Nanette, two new miſtreſſes, that are finer dreſſed than ſhe, but they are much prouder and not half ſo pretty;" meaning two of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017578_0016_0FBA6F6BACF43590"/>
Marquis's daughters, who were at <hi>Belville</hi> for a few days, when their father was laſt there. I ſmiled to hear the girl talk ſo, though Heaven knows my heart was ſad. Only three of the rooms are furniſhed, in one of which Le Sauvre and his family were ſitting; the reſt had their windows darkened with cobwebs, and they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed ſo when Le Sauvre and I walked through them, that I ſhuddered, as if I had been in a monument.</p>
                  <p>"It is enough, Le Blanc," ſaid my mother, in a ſort of a whiſper. My father aſked ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different queſtion about the weather. I ſat, I know not how, looking piteouſly, I ſuppoſe; for my mother tapped my cheek with the word Child; emphatically pronounced. I ſtarted out of my reverie, and finding myſelf unable to feign a compoſure which I did not feel, walked out of the room to hide my emotion. When I got to my own chamber, I felt the full force of Le-Blanc's deſcription, but to me it was not pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; it is not on hearts that yield the ſooneſt that ſorrow has the moſt powerful effects; it was but giving way to a ſhower of tears, and I could think of <hi>Belville</hi> with pleaſure, even in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of another.—They may cut its trees, MARIA, and alter its walks, but cannot ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face it as to leave no traces for the memory of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017578_0017_0FBA6F6D270C23B8"/>
your JULIA!—Methinks I ſhould hate to have been born in a town; when I ſay my native brook or my native hill, I talk of friends of whom the rememberance warms my heart. To me, even to me, who have loſt their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, there is ſomething delightful in the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly recollection of their beauties; and, here, I often wander out to the top of a little broom-covered knoll, merely to look towards the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where <hi>Bellville</hi> is ſituated.</p>
                  <p>It is otherwiſe with my father. On Le Blanc's recital he has brooded theſe three days. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it had on him is ſtill viſible in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and but an hour ago, while my mother and I were talking of ſome other ſubject, in which he was joining by monoſyllables, he ſaid, all at once, that he had ſome thoughts of ſending to the Marquis for his roan horſe again, ſince he did not chuſe to keep him properly.</p>
                  <p>They who have never known proſperity, can hardly be ſaid to be unhappy; it is from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance of joys we have loſt, that the arrows of affliction are pointed. Muſt we then tremble, my friend, in the poſſeſſion of preſent pleaſures, from the fear of their embittering futurity? Or does Heaven thus teach us that ſort of enjoyment, of which the rememberance is immortal? Does it
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017578_0018_0FBA6F71577FE268"/>
point out thoſe as the happy, who can look back on their paſt life, not as the chronicle of pleaſure, but as the record of virtue?</p>

My mother too! If he knew how much it preys upon her gentle ſoul, to ſee the impatience with which he ſuffers adverſity!—Yet alas! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking creature that I am, I judge of his mind by my own, and while I venture to blame his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, I forget that it is entitled to my pity.</p>
                  <p>This morning he was obliged to go to the neighbouring village to meet a procureur from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> on ſome buſineſs, which he told us would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him all day. The night was cold and ſtormy, and my mother and I looked often earneſtly out, thinking on the diſagreeable ride he would have on his return. "My poor huſband!" ſaid my mother, as the wind howled in the lobby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. "But I have heard him ſay, mamma, that in theſe little hardſhips, a man thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unfortunate, but is never unhappy; and you may remember he would always prefer riding to being drove in a carriage, becauſe of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he told us he ſhould feel from a clean room and a cheering fire when he got home." At the word Carriage, I could obſerve my mother ſigh; I was ſorry it had eſcaped me; but, at the end of my ſpeech, we looked both of us at the hearth, which I had ſwept but the moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the faggots were crackling in the fire, and my little Fidele lay aſleep before it.—He prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his ears and barked, and we heard the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017578_0020_0FBA6F740554EDE0"/>
trampling of horſes in the court. Your father is returned, cried my mother; and I ran to the door to receive him. "JULIA, is it not?" ſaid he (for the ſervant had not time to fetch us a light) but he ſaid it coldly. I offered to help him off with his ſurtout. "Softly, child, ſaid he, you pull my arm awry." It was a trifle, but I felt my heart ſwell when he ſaid this.</p>
                  <p>He entered the room; my mother took his hand in hers, "You are terribly cold, my love." ſaid ſhe, and ſhe drew his chair nearer to the fire; he threw aſide his hat and whip, without ſpeaking a word. In the centre of the table, which was covered for ſupper, I had placed a bowl of milk, dreſſed in a way I knew he liked, and had garniſhed it with ſome artificial flowers, in the manner we uſed to have our deſſerts done at <hi>Belville.</hi> He fixed his eyes on it, and I began to make ready my anſwer to a queſtion I ſuppoſed he would aſk, who had trimmed it ſo nicely? But he ſtarted haſtily from his chair, and ſnatching up this little piece of ornament, threw it into the fire, ſaying, "we had now no title to finery." This was too much for me; it was fooliſh, very fooliſh, but I could not help letting fall ſome tears. He looked ſternly at me, and, muttering ſome words which I could not hear, walked out of the room, and ſlapped the door roughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017578_0021_0FBA6F785AD19DA8"/>
him. I threw myſelf on my mother's neck, and wept outright.</p>
                  <p>Our ſupper was ſilent and ſullen; to me the more painful, from the mortifying reverſe which I felt from what I had expected. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not taſte the milk; my mother aſked him to eat of it with an affected eaſe in her manner; but I obſerved her voice faulter as ſhe aſked him: As for me, I durſt not look him in the face; I trembled every time the ſervant left the room; there was a protection, even in his preſence, which I could not bear to loſe. The table was ſcarcely uncovered, when my father ſaid he was tired and ſleepy; my mother laid hold of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and offered to accompany him to their chamber: She bid me good night; my father was ſilent; but I anſwered as if addreſſing myſelf to both.</p>
                  <p>MARIA! in my hours of viſionary indulgence, I have ſometimes painted to myſelf a huſband—no matter whom—comforting me amidſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes which fortune had laid upon us. I have ſmiled upon him through my tears; tears, not of anguiſh, but of tenderneſs;—our children were playing around us, unconſcious of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; we had taught them to be humble and to be happy;—our little ſhed was reſerved to us,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017578_0022_0FBA6F796D0515E0"/>
and their ſmiles to cheer it.—I have imagined the luxury of ſuch a ſcene, and affliction became a part of my dream of happineſs!</p>
                  <p>Thus far I had written laſt night; I found at laſt my body tired and drowzy, though my mind was ill diſpoſed to obey it: I laid aſide my pen, and thought of going to bed; but I continued ſitting in my chair, for an hour after, in that ſtate of languid thinking, which, though it has not ſtrength enough to faſten on any ſingle object, can wander without wearineſs over a thouſand. The clock ſtriking one, diſſolved the enchantment; I was then with my MARIA, and I went to bed but to continue my dream of her.</p>
                  <p>Why did I wake to anxiety and diſquiet?—Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh! that I ſhould not bear without murmuring, my proportion of both!—I met my mother in the parlour, with a ſmile of meekneſs, and ſerenity on her countenance; ſhe did not ſay a ſingle word of laſt night's incident; and I ſaw ſhe purpoſely avoided giving me any opportunity of mentioning it; ſuch is the delicacy of her conduct with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my father. What an angel this woman is! Yet I fear, my friend, ſhe is a very woman in her ſufferings.</p>

                     </gap> ſpeaker of our company, while my father ſat with us. He rode out ſoon after breakfaſt, and did not return till dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. I was almoſt afraid of his return, and was happy to ſee, from my window, ſomebody riding down the lane along with him. This was a gentleman of conſiderable rank and fortune in our neighbourhood, the Count Louis de Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban. I do not know how it has happened, but I cannot recollect having ever mentioned him to you before. He is not one of thoſe very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting characters, which are long preſent with the mind; yet his worth is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and his friendſhip to my father, though of late acquiſition, deſerves more than ordinary acknowledgment from us. His hiſtory we heard from others, ſoon after our arrival here; ſince our acquaintance began, we have had it, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times from himſelf; for though he has not much frankneſs about him to diſcover his ſecrets, he poſſeſſes a manly firmneſs, which does not ſhrink from the diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>His father was only brother to the late Francis Count de Montauban; his mother, the daughter of a noble family in <hi>Spain,</hi> died in child-bed of him, and he was ſoon after deprived of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining parent, who was killed at a ſiege in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> His uncle took, for ſome time, the charge
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017578_0024_0FBA70D3A79721C0"/>
of his education; but, before he attained the age of manhood, he diſcovered, in the Count's behaviour, a want of that reſpect which ſhould have diſtinguiſhed the relation from the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and after having, in vain, endeavoured to aſſert it, he took the reſolution of leaving <hi>France,</hi> and travelled a-foot into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he met with a very kind reception from the relations of his mother. By their aſſiſtance, he was afterwards enabled to acquire a reſpectable rank in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh army, and ſerved, in a ſeries of campaigns, with diſtinguiſhed reputation. About a year ago, his uncle died unmarried; by this event he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the family eſtate, part of which is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in this neighbourhood; and ſince that time, he has been generally here, employed in ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it; for which, it ſeems, there was the greater neceſſity, as the late Count who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lived at the old hereditary ſeat of his anceſtors, had, for ſome of the laſt years of his life, been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely under the dominion of rapacious domeſtics, and ſuffered his affairs in this quarter, to run, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their guidance, into the greateſt confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Though, in <hi>France,</hi> a man of fortune's reſidence at his country-ſeat is ſo unuſual, that it might be ſuppoſed to enhance the value of ſuch a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet the circumſtance of Montauban's great fortune was a reaſon, I believe, for my father's
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017578_0025_0FBA70D544DB3D88"/>
ſhunning any advances towards his acquaintance. The Count at laſt contrived to introduce himſelf to us (which, for what reaſon I know not, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extremely anxious to do) in a manner that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my father; not by offering favours, but by aſking one. He had led a walk through a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of his ground, along the courſe of a brook, which runs alſo through a narrow neck of my father's property, by the intervention of which the Count's territory was divided. This ſtrip of my father's ground would have been a purchaſe very convenient for Montauban; but, with that peculiar delicacy which our ſituation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, he never made the propoſition of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, but only requeſted that he might have leave to open a paſſage through an old wall, by which it was incloſed, that he might enjoy a continuation of that romantic path, which the banks of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet afforded. His deſire was expreſſed ſo polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it could not be refuſed. Montauban ſoon after paid a viſit of thanks to my father, on the occaſion; this laſt was pleaſed with an incident, which gave him back the power of conferring an obligation, and therefore, I preſume, looked on his new acquaintance with a favourable eye; he praiſed his appearance, to my mother and me; and ſince that day, they have improved their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance into a very cordial intimacy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:017578_0026_0FBA70DAA2696320"/>
In many reſpects, indeed, their ſentiments are congenial. A high ſenſe of honour is equally the portion of both. Montauban, from his long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the army, and his long reſidence in <hi>Spain,</hi> carries it to a very romantic height. My father, from a ſenſe of his ſituation, is now more jealous than ever of his. Montauban ſeems of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly diſpoſition. My father was far from being ſo once; but misfortune has now given his mind a tincture of ſadneſs. Montauban thinks lightly of the world, from principle. My father, from ill-uſage, holds it in diſguſt. This laſt ſimilarity of ſentiment is a favourite topic of their diſcourſe, and their friendſhip ſeems to increaſe, from every mutual obſervation which they make. Perhaps it is from ſomething amiſs in our nature, but I have often obſerved the moſt ſtrict of our attachments to proceed from an alliance of diſlike.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething hard and unbending in the character of the Count, which, though my father applauds it under the title of magnanimity, I own myſelf womaniſh enough not to like. There is a yielding weakneſs, which to me is more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the inflexible right; it is an act of my reaſon to approve of the laſt; but my heart gives its ſuffrage to the firſt, without pauſing to inquire for a cauſe.—I am aukward at defining; you
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017578_0027_0FBA70DCACA81930"/>
know what I mean; the laſt is ſtern in Montauban, the firſt is ſmiling in MARIA.</p>
                  <p>Mean time, I wiſh to feel the moſt perfect gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for his unwearied aſſiduities to oblige my father and his family. When I think on his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common friendſhip, I try to forget that ſeverity, which holds me ſomehow at a diſtance from him.</p>
                  <p>Though I meant a deſcription, I have ſcrawled through moſt of my paper without beginning one. I have made but ſome ſlight ſketches of his mind; of his perſon I have ſaid nothing; which, from a woman to a woman, ſhould have been mentioned the ſooneſt. It is ſuch as becomes a ſoldier, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manly than handſome, with an air of dignity in his mien that borders on haughtineſs. In ſhort, were I to ſtudy for a ſentence, I ſhould ſay, that Montauban was made to command reſpect from all, to obtain praiſe from moſt, but to engage the affections of few.</p>
                  <p>His company to-day was of importance to us. By ourſelves, every one's look ſeemed the ſpy on another's. We were conſcious of remembering what all affected to forget. Montauban's conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation reconciled us, without our being ſenſible of it.</p>
                  <p>My father, who (as it commonly happens to the aggreſſor in thoſe caſes) had perhaps felt more from
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017578_0028_0FBA70DE70AE2498"/>
his own harſhneſs, than either my mother or I, ſeemed happy to find an opportunity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his former familiarity. He was gayer, and more in ſpirits, than I have ſeen him for a long time paſt. He inſiſted on the Count's ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evening with us. Montauban at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf. He had told us, in the courſe of converſation, of his having appropriated the evening to buſineſs at home; but my father would liſten to no apology, and the other was at laſt overcome. He ſeems, indeed, to feel an uncommon attachment to my father, and to enjoy more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his company, than I ſhould have expected him to find in the ſociety of any one.</p>
                  <p>You are now, in the account of correſpondence, I do not know how deep, in my debt. I mean not to aſk regular returns; but write to me, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, when you can; and write larger letters than your laſt. Put down every thing, ſo it be what you feel at the time; and tell every incident that can make me preſent with you, were it but the making up of a cap that pleaſes you. You ſee how much paper I contrive to blot with trifles.</p>

                  <p>YOU ſaw, my friend, with what reluctance I left <hi>Spain,</hi> though it was to return to the country of my birth, to the inheritance of my fathers. I trembled when I thought what a ſcene of confuſion the ſtrange miſmanagement of my uncle had left me to diſentangle; but it required only a certain degree of fortitude to begin that buſineſs, and it was much ſooner concluded than I looked for. I have now almoſt wrought myſelf out of work, and yet the ſituation is not ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting as I imagined. I have long learned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that flippancy, which characteriſes my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; yet, I know not how it is, they gain upon me in ſpite of myſelf; and while I reſolve to cenſure, I am forced to ſmile.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Paris,</hi> however, I fled, as if it had been infeſted with a peſtilence. Great towns certainly contain many excellent perſons; but vice and folly predominate ſo much, that a ſearch after their oppoſites is beyond the limits of ordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance; and, beſides the ſuperiority of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the firſt are ever perked up to view, while the latter are ſolicitous to avoid obſervation.</p>

In the country I found a different ſtyle of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Here are impertinents who talk nonſenſe, and rogues who cheat where they can; but they are ſomewhat nearer nature in both. I met with ſome female relations, who ſtunned me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts in cookery, and preſcriptions in phyſic; but they did not dictate to my taſte in letters, or my judgment in philoſophy. Ignorance I can bear without emotion; but the affectation of learning gives me a fit of the ſpleen. I make indeed but an aukward figure among them; for I am forced, by repreſenting my uncle, to ſee a number of our family friends, whom I never heard of. Theſe good people, however, bear with me wonderfully, and I am not laughed at, as you predicted.</p>
                  <p>But they ſometimes peſter me with their civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. It is their principle, that a man cannot be happy alone; and they tire me with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, out of pure good nature. I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to undeceive them: The greater part do not underſtand my hints; thoſe who do, repreſent me a ſour ungracious being, whom <hi>Spain</hi> has taught pride and ſullenneſs. This is well, and I hope the opinion will propagate itſelf apace. One muſt be ſomewhat hated, to be independent of folly.</p>
                  <p>There is but one of my neighbours, whoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I find at all congenial to my own. He has
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017578_0031_0FBA70E5B784CC90"/>
been taught by misfortune to be ſerious: For that I love him; but misfortune has not taught him to be humble: For this I love him the more. There is a pride which becomes every man; a poor man, of all others, ſhould poſſeſs it.</p>
                  <p>His name is Pierre de Roubigné: His family of that rank, which is perhaps always neceſſary to give a fixed liberality of ſentiment. From the conſequences of an unfortunate law-ſuit, his circumſtances became ſo involved, that he was obliged to ſell his paternal eſtate, and retire to a ſmall purchaſe he had made in this province, which is ſituated in the midſt of my territories here. My ſteward pointed it out to me, as a thing it was proper for me to be maſter of, and hinted, that its owner's circumſtances were ſuch as might induce him to part with it. Such is the language of thoſe devourers of land, who wiſh to make a wilderneſs around them, provided they are lords of it. For my part, I find much leſs pleaſure in being the maſter of acres, than the friend of men.</p>
                  <p>From the particulars of Monſ. de Roubigné's ſtory which I learned ſoon after I came hither, I was extremely ſolicitous of his acquaintance; but I found it not eaſy to accompliſh my deſire, the diſtance which great minds preſerve in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, keeping him ſecluded from the world. By
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017578_0032_0FBA70E7A86EF3C0"/>
humouring that delicacy, which ruled him in his acceptance of a new acquaintance, I have at laſt ſucceeded. He admits me as his gueſt, without the ceremony which the little folks around us oblige me to endure from them. He does not think himſelf under the neceſſity of eternally talking to entertain me; and we ſometimes ſpend a morning together, pleaſed with each other's ſociety, though we do not utter a dozen ſentences.</p>
                  <p>His youth has been enlightened by letters, and informed by travel; but what is ſtill more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, his mind has been early impreſſed with the principles of manly virtue: He is liberal in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, but rigid in the feelings of honour.</p>
                  <p>Were I to mark his failings, I might obſerve a degree of peeviſhneſs at mankind, which, though mankind may deſerve, it is the trueſt indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not to allow them. He feels that chagrin at his ſituation, which conſtitutes the victory of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune over us—but I have not known misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and am therefore not entitled to obſerve it. His family conſiſts of a wife and daughter, his only ſurviving child, who are equally eſtimable with himſelf. I have not, at preſent, time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them. I have given you this ſketch of him, becauſe I think he is ſuch a man as might be the friend of my Segarva. There are ſo few in this trifling world, whoſe mutual excellence deſerves
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017578_0033_0FBA70EE4C6E7EC0"/>
mutual eſteem, that the intervention of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues ſhould not bar their acquaintance; and we increaſe the ſenſe of virtue in ourſelves, by the conſciouſneſs of virtue in others.</p>

                  <head>LETTER V. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</head>
                  <p>I DESCRIBED to you, in my laſt, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that family, whoſe acquaintance I have chiefly cultivated ſince I came hither. His wife and daughter I promiſed to deſcribe—at leaſt ſuch a promiſe was implied—perhaps I find pleaſure in deſcribing them—I have time enough at leaſt for the deſcription—but no matter for the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>MADAME DE ROUBIGNÉ has ſtill the remains of a very fine woman; and, if I may credit a picture in her huſband's poſſeſſion, was in her youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably handſome. She has now a ſort of ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her look, which ſeems the effect of reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in adverſity. Her countenance bears the marks of ſorrow which we do not ſo much pity as revere; ſhe has yielded to calamity, while her
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017578_0034_0FBA70EF7908E038"/>
huſband has ſtruggled under its preſſure, and hence has acquired a compoſure, which renders that uneaſineſs I remarked in him more obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the contraſt. I have been informed of one particular, which, beſides the difference of ſex, may, in a great meaſure, account for this. She brought Roubigné a very conſiderable fortune, the greateſt part of which was ſpent in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate law-ſuit I mentioned. A conſciouſneſs of this makes the huſband impatient under their preſent circumſtances, from the very principle of generoſity, which leads the wife to appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
                  <p>In her converſation ſhe is guided by the ſame evenneſs of temper. She talks of the world as of a ſcene where ſhe is a ſpectator merely, in which there is ſomething for virtue to praiſe, for charity to pardon; and ſmooths the ſpleen of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's obſervations by ſome palliative remark which experience has taught her.</p>
                  <p>One conſolation ſhe has ever at hand: <hi>Religion,</hi> the friend of calamity, ſhe had cultivated in her moſt proſperous days. Affliction, however, has not driven her to enthuſiaſm; her feelings of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion are mild and ſecret, her expreſſion gentle and charitable. I have always obſerved your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly-religious, amidſt their ſeverity to their
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017578_0035_0FBA70F028BEE498"/>
neighbours, manifeſt a diſcontent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſpirits like MADAME DE ROUBIGNÉ's have that inward peace which is eaſily ſatisfied with others. The rapturous blaze of devotion is more allied to vanity than to happineſs; like the torches of the great it diſtreſſes its owner, while it flames in the eye of the public; the other, like the ruſh-light of the cottager, cheers the little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily within, while it ſeeks not to be ſeen of the world.</p>
                  <p>But her daughter, her lovely daughter!—with all the gentleneſs of her mother's diſpoſition, ſhe unites the warmth of her father's heart, and the ſtrength of her father's underſtanding. Her eyes in their ſilent ſtate (if I may uſe the term) give the beholder every idea of feminine ſoftneſs; when ſentiment or feeling animates them, how eloquent they are! When Roubigné talks, I hate vice, and deſpiſe folly; when his wife ſpeaks, I pity both; but the muſic of JULIA's tongue gives the throb of virtue to my heart, and lifts my ſoul to ſomewhat ſuperhuman.</p>
                  <p>I mention not the graces of her form; yet they are ſuch as would attract the admiration of thoſe, by whom the beauties of her mind might not be underſtood. In one as well as the other, there
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017578_0036_0FBA70F1A4A7E940"/>
is a remarkable conjunction of tenderneſs with dignity; but her beauty is of that ſort, on which we cannot properly decide independent of the ſoul, becauſe the firſt is never uninformed by the latter.</p>
                  <p>To the flippancy, which we are apt to aſcribe to females of her age, ſhe ſeems utterly a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Her diſpoſition indeed appears to lean, in an uncommon degree, towards the ſerious. Yet ſhe breaks forth at times into filial attempts at gaiety, to amuſe that diſquiet which ſhe obſerves in her father; but even then it looks like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over the natural penſiveneſs of her mind. This melancholy might be held a fault in JULIA; but the fortune of her family has been ſuch, that none but thoſe, who are totally exempted from thinking, could have looked on it with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>It is only indeed, when ſhe would confer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs on others, that ſhe ſeems perfectly to enjoy it. The ruſtics around us talk of her affability and good humour with the livelieſt gratitude; and I have been witneſs to ſeveral ſcenes, where ſhe diſpenſed mirth and gaiety to ſome poor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in our neighbourhood, with a countenance as cheerful as the moſt unthinking of them all. At thoſe ſeaſons I have been tempted from the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017578_0037_0FBA70F6C704D830"/>
gravity natural to me, and borrowed from trifles a temporary happineſs. Had you ſeen me yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day dancing in the midſt of a band of grape-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, you would have bluſhed for your friend; but I danced with JULIA.</p>
                  <p>I am called from my deſcription by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of her whom I would deſcribe. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has ſent his ſervant to inform me, that his wife and daughter have agreed to accompany him in a walk, as far as to a farm of mine, where I have ſet about trying ſome experiments in agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Roubigné is ſkilful in thoſe things; as for me, I know I ſhall loſe money by them; but it will not be loſt to the public: And if I can even ſhew what will not ſucceed, I ſhall do ſomething for the good of my neighbours. Methinks too, if JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ would promiſe to come and look at them—But I ſee their family from my window.</p>

                  <p>YOU rally me on the ſubject of the Count de Montauban, with that vivacity which I have ſo often envied you the poſſeſſion of. You ſay, you are ſure, you ſhould like him vaſtly. "What a bleſſing, in a remote province, where one is in danger of dying of <hi>ennui,</hi> to have this ſtiff, cruſty, honourable Spaniard, to teaſe and make a fool of!" I have no thoughts of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, and therefore I do not like him vaſtly; but, I confeſs, I begin to like him better than I did. He has loſt much of that ſternneſs (dignity my father calls it) which uſed to chill me when I approached him. He can talk of common things in a common way; and but yeſterday he danced with me on the green, amidſt a troop of honeſt ruſtics, whom I wiſhed to make happy at the ſmall expence of ſharing their happineſs. All this, I allow, at firſt, ſeemed foreign to the man; but he did not, as I have ſeen ſome of your wiſe people do, take great credit for letting himſelf down ſo low. He did it with a deſign of frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though ſome of his native loftineſs remained in the execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="unknown:017578_0039_0FBA70F9EFDF8610"/>
We are much in his debt on the ſcore of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic happineſs. He has become ſo far one of the family as to be welcome at all times, a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege he makes very frequent uſe of; and we find ourſelves ſo much at eaſe with him, that we never think even of talking more than we chuſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him. He will ſit for an hour at the table where I am working, with no other amuſement than that of twiſting ſhreds of my catgut into whimſical figures.</p>
                  <p>I think that he alſo is not the worſe for our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: I ſuppoſe him the happier for it, from the change in his ſentiments of others. He often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with my father, and will not allow the world to be altogether ſo bad as he uſed to do. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who can now be merry at times, jokes him on his apoſtacy. He appealed to me this morning for the truth of his argument. I told him, I was unable to judge, becauſe I knew nothing of the world. "And yet, (replied he gallantly) it is from you one ſhould learn to think better of it: I never knew, till I came hither, that it contained any thing ſo valuable as MADEMOISELLE DE ROUBIGNÉ." I think, he looked fooliſh when be paid me this compliment. I curtſied, with compoſure enough. It is not from men like Montauban that one bluſhes at a compliment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:017578_0040_0FBA70FE9F151F70"/>
Beſides the general addition to our good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, his ſociety is particularly uſeful to me. His diſcourſe frequently turns on ſubjects, from the diſcuſſion of which, though I am ſomewhat afraid to engage in it, I always find myſelf the wiſer. Amidſt the toils of his military life, Montauban has contrived to find leiſure for the purſuit of every extenſive and uſeful knowledge. This, though little ſolicitous to diſplay, he is always ready to communicate; and, as he finds me willing to be inſtructed, he ſeems to find a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in inſtructing me.</p>
                  <p>My mother takes every opportunity of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging this ſort of converſation. You have often heard her ſentiments on the mutual advantage of ſuch intercourſe between the ſexes. You well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member her frequent mention of a male friend, who died ſoon after her marriage, from whom, ſhe has told us, ſhe derived moſt of the little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment her mind can boaſt of. "Men (ſhe uſed to ſay) though they talk much of their friends, are ſeldom bleſt with a friend. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that companionſhip, which they miſtake for friendſhip, is really deſtructive of its exiſtence; becauſe the delicacy of the laſt ſhrinks from the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> touch of the former; and that, however pure in their own ſentiments, the ſociety which they ſee each other hold with third perſons, is too
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017578_0041_0FBA70FFE81323D8"/>
groſs, not to break thoſe tender links, which are abſolutely eſſential to friendſhip. Girls (ſhe ſaid) eaſily form a connexion of a more refined ſort; but as it commonly begins with romance, it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom outlaſts the years of childhood, except when it degenerates into cabal and intrigue; but that the friendſhip of one of each sex, when ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as to be diſtant from love (which ſhe affirmed might be the caſe) has that combination of ſtrength and delicacy which is equally formed to improve and delight."</p>
                  <p>There may be much reaſon in her arguments; but I cannot, notwithſtanding my eſteem for him, eaſily think of Montauban as my friend. He has not yet quite obliterated the fears I felt on our firſt acquaintance. He has, however, done much to conquer them; and, if he goes on as he has begun, I know not what in time he may arrive at. Mean time I am contented with MARIA: Our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has at leaſt endured beyond the period aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my mother. Shall it not always endure? I know the anſwer which your heart will make—mine throbs while I think of it.</p>

                  <p>YOU complain of my ſilence. In truth I have nothing to ſay but to repeat, what is very unneceſſary, my aſſurances of friendſhip to Segarva. My life is of a ſort that produces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I mean in recital. To myſelf it is not vacant: I can be employed in marking the growth of a ſhrub; but I cannot deſcribe its progreſs, nor even tell why its progreſs pleaſes me.</p>
                  <p>If the word ſociety is confined to our own ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I enjoy very little of it. I ſhould except that of the family I gave you an account of ſome time ago. I fear I am too often with them; I frequently reſolve to be buſy at home; but I have ſcarce ſat down to my table when the picture of Roubigné's parlour preſents itſelf, and I think that my buſineſs may wait till to-morrow.</p>
                  <p>I bluſh to tell you what a fool I am grown; or is it that I am nearer the truth than formerly? I begin to entertain doubts of my own dignity, and to think that man is not altogether formed for the ſublime place I uſed to allot him. One can be very happy with much leſs trouble, than very
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017578_0043_0FBA7102E6280D18"/>
wiſe: I have diſcovered this at Roubigné's. It is but conquering the name of trifles, which our pride would give things, and my hours at Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigné's are as importantly filled up as any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment could make them.</p>
                  <p>After all, what is our boaſted philoſophy to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others? Its conſequence is often borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more from the language it ſpeaks, than the object it purſues, and its attainments valued, more from their difficulty, than their uſefulneſs. But life takes its complexion from inferior things; and Providence has wiſely placed its real bleſſings within the reach of moderate abilities. We look for a ſtation beyond them; it is fit that we too ſhould have our reward; and it is found in our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It is only from this cauſe, that I ſometimes bluſh, as if I were unworthily employed, when I feel myſelf happy in doing nothing at Monſ. de Roubigné's fire-ſide.</p>
                  <p>Yet do not ſuppoſe that we are always employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in talking of trifles: She has a mind no leſs capable of important reſearch, of exalted ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent.—</p>

                  <p>PITY me, MARIA, pity me! even that quiet which my letters of late deſcribed, which I was contented to call happineſs, is denied me. There is a fatality which every where attends the family of the unfortunate Roubigné; here, to the abodes of peace, perplexity purſues it; and it is deſtined to find new diſtreſs, from thoſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſources to which it looked for comfort.</p>
                  <p>The Count de Montauban—why did he ſee me? why did he viſit here? why did I liſten to his diſcourſe? though Heaven knows, I meant not to deceive him!—He has declared himſelf the lover of your JULIA!—I own his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, I eſteem his character, I know the gratitude too we owe him; from all thoſe circumſtances I am doubly diſtreſſed at my ſituation; but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, it is impoſſible that I ſhould love him.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017578_0045_0FBA71083068F5A8"/>
How could he imagine that I ſhould? or how does he ſtill continue to imagine that I may be won to love him? I ſoftened my refuſal, becauſe I would diſtreſs no man; Montauban of all men the leaſt; but ſurely it was determined enough, to cut off all hopes of my ever altering my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
                  <p>Should not his pride teach him to ceaſe ſuch mortifying ſolicitations? How has it, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alone, forſaken him? Methinks too, he has acted ungenerouſly, in letting my mother know of his addreſſes. When I hinted this, he fell at my feet, and intreated me to forgive a paſſion ſo earneſt as his, for calling in every poſſible aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Cruel! that in this tendereſt concern, that ſex which is naturally feeble, ſhould have other weakneſſes to combat beſides its own.</p>
                  <p>I know my mother's gentleneſs too well to have much to fear from her; but the idea of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's diſpleaſure is terrible. This morning, when I entreated my mother not to mention this matter to him, ſhe informed me of her having already told him. It was an affair, ſhe ſaid, of ſo much importance to his family, that ſhe durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to conceal it. There was ſomething in the coolneſs of her words that hurt me; but I ſtifled the anſwer which I was about to make, and only
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017578_0046_0FBA7109A752B238"/>
obſerved, that of that family I was the neareſt concerned. "You ſhall judge for yourſelf, my dear girl (ſaid ſhe, reſuming the natural gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her manner) I will never pretend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul your affections. Your opinions I always hold it my duty to guide; experience, dearly bought perhaps, has given me ſome title to guide them. Believe me, there are dreams of roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic affection, which are apt to poſſeſs young minds, the reality of which is not to be found in nature. I do not blame you for doubting this at preſent; but the time will come when you ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its truth."</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, MARIA? Shall that period ever arrive, when my preſent feelings ſhall be forgotten? But, if it ſhould, are they not <hi>now</hi> my conſcience, and ſhould I not be unjuſt to Montauban and myſelf, were I <hi>now</hi> to act againſt them?</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen my father. He came into my room in his uſual way, and aſked me, if I choſe to walk with him. His words were the ſame they were wont to be; but I could diſcover that his thoughts were different. He looked on me with a determined countenance, as if he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for contradiction. I concealed my uneaſineſs, however, and attended him with that appearance

of cheerfulneſs, which I make it a point of duty to wear in his preſence. He ſeemed to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſomething different; for I ſaw he was ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened from that hoſtility, may I call it, of aſpect, which he had aſſumed at firſt, and, during our walk, he expreſſed himſelf to me with unuſual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Alas! too much ſo, MARIA! Why am I obliged to offend him? When he called me the ſupport and ſolace of his age; when he bleſſed Heaven for leaving him, in the worſt of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, his JULIA to comfort him—why could I not then, amidſt my filial tears, when my heart ſhould have poured itſelf out in duty and gratitude, why could I not then aſſure him of its obedience?</p>

                  <head>LETTER IX. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</head>
                  <p>I SIT down to write to Segarva, with the idea of his preſence at the time, and the idea was wont to be a pleaſant one; it is now mixed with a ſort of uneaſineſs, like that which a man feels, who has offended, and would aſk to be forgiven. The conſciouſneſs of what I mean by this letter to reveal, hangs like guilt upon my mind; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that I have ſo long delayed writing. If you ſhall think it weakneſs—Yet I know not how I can bear chiding on this point.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould I doubt of your approving it. Our converſations on the ſex might be juſt, but they touch not JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ. Could my friend but ſee, but know her, I ſhould need no other advocate to excuſe the change of my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</p>
                  <p>Let me tell him then of my paſſion for that lovelieſt of women; that it has prompted me to offer her a hand, which, he has ſometimes heard me declare, ſhould never give away my freedom. This ſounded like ſomething manly, but it was, in truth, a littleneſs of ſoul. He who pauſes in the exerciſe of every better affection of the heart,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017578_0049_0FBA711125A7B1B8"/>
till he calculates the chances of danger or of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, is the verieſt of cowards; but the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, though frequently made, is ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver adhered to; the voice of nature, of wiſdom, and of virtue is againſt it.</p>
                  <p>To acquire ſuch a friend as JULIA DE ROU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIGNÉ—but friend is a word inſignificant of the connexion—to have one ſoul, one fate with her! to participate her happineſs, to ſhare her griefs! to be that ſingle Being to whom, the next to Divinity, ſhe pours out the feelings of her heart, to whom ſhe ſpeaks the gentleſt of her wiſhes, to whom ſhe ſighs the moſt delicate of her fears! to grant thoſe wiſhes, to ſooth thoſe fears! to have ſuch a woman (like our guardian-angel without his ſuperiority) to whom we may unboſom our own!—the creation of pleaſures is little; this is a creation of ſoul to enjoy them!</p>
                  <p>Call not mine the language of doating love; I am confident how much reaſon is on my ſide, and will now hear Segarva with patience.</p>
                  <p>He will tell me of that faſcinating power which women poſſeſs, when they would win us, which fades at once from the character of wife.—But I know JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ well; ſhe has grown up under the eye of the beſt of parents, unſchooled in the practices of her ſex; ſhe is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017578_0050_0FBA7112C6AD6190"/>
of thoſe arts of deluſion, which are taught by the ſociety of women of the world. I have had opportunities of ſeeing her at all ſeaſons, and in every attitude of mind.—Her ſoul is too gentle for the touch of art; an effort at deceit would bring it even to torture.</p>
                  <p>He will remind me of the diſparity of age, and tell me of the danger of her affections wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from one, whom, on compariſon with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe will learn to think an old man.—But JULIA is of an order of beings ſuperior to thoſe whom external form, and the trifling language of gallantry, can attract. Had ſhe the flippancy of mind which thoſe ſhallow qualities are able to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, I think, Segarva, ſhe were beneath the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Montauban.</p>
                  <p>I remember our former converſations on the ſubject of marriage, when we were both of one ſide; and that, then, you obſerved in me a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wakeful jealouſy of honour, which, you ſaid, the ſmile of a wife on another man would rouſe into diſquiet.—Perhaps I have been ſome times too haſty that way, in the ſenſe of affronts from men; but the nicety of a ſoldier's character, which muſt ever be out of the reach of queſtion, may excuſe it. I think I never ſhewed ſuſpicion of my friends; and why to this lovely one, the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017578_0051_0FBA71175F091D38"/>
delicacy of whoſe virtue I would vouch againſt the world, ſhould I be more unjuſt than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?—There is no fiend ſo malicious, as to breathe detraction againſt my JULIA.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I have canvaſſed all your objections, and, I think, I have anſwered them all. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me for ſuppoſing you to make them; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, when I tell you, that, while I did ſo, methought I loved you leſs than I was wont to do.</p>
                  <p>But I am anticipating bleſſings, which may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrive; for the gentleſt of her ſex is yet cruel to Montauban. But, I truſt, it is only the maiden coyneſs of a mind, naturally fearful. She own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her eſteem, her friendſhip; theſe are poor to the returns I aſk: But they muſt be exchanged for ſentiments more tender, they muſt yield to the ardour of mine. They muſt, they ſhall: I feel my heart expand with a glad foreboding, that tells it of happineſs to come. While I enjoy it, I wiſh for ſomething more: Let me hear then that my Savedra enjoys it too.</p>

                  <head>LETTER X. JULIA TO MARIA.</head>
                  <p>YOU know not the heart of your JULIA; yet impute it not to a want of confidence in your friendſhip. Its perplexity is of a nature ſo delicate, that I am ſometimes afraid even to think on it myſelf; and often, when I meant to reveal it to you, my utterance failed in the attempt.</p>
                  <p>The character you have heard of the Count de Montauban is juſt; it is perhaps even leſs than he merits; for his virtues are of that unbending kind, that does not eaſily ſtoop to the opinion of the world; to which the world therefore is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of its eulogium. I revere his virtues, I eſteem his good qualities; but I cannot love him.—This muſt be my anſwer to others: But MARIA has a right to ſomething more; ſhe may be told my weakneſs, for her friendſhip can pity and ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>Learn then that I have not a heart to beſtow.—I bluſh even while I write this confeſſion—Yet to love merit like <hi>Savillon'</hi>s cannot be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.—Why then do I bluſh again, when I think of revealing it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="unknown:017578_0053_0FBA711B514BC3D0"/>
You have ſeen him at <hi>Belville;</hi> alas! you know not his worth; it is not eaſy to know it. Gentle, modeſt, retired from notice,—it was the lot of your JULIA to diſcover it. She prized it the more, that it was not common to all; and while ſhe looked on it as the child of her own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was vanity to know, it was virtue to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.—Alas! ſhe was inconſcious of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, when it ceaſed to be virtue and grew into paſſion!</p>
                  <p>But wither am I wandering? I meant only to relate; but our feelings ſpeak for themſelves, before we can tell why we feel.</p>
                  <p>Savillon's father and mine were friends; his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was unfortunate, and mine was the friend of his misfortunes; hence aroſe a ſort of dependence on the one ſide, which, on the other, I fear, was never entirely forgotten. I have ſome-times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this weakneſs in my father; but the pride that leads to virtue may be pardoned. He thinks of a man as his inferior, only that he may do him a kindneſs more freely. Savillon's family, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was not ſo noble as his mind; my father warmly acknowledged the excellence of the laſt; but he had been taught, from earlieſt infancy, to conſider a misfortune the want of the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:017578_0054_0FBA711CF2B85830"/>
After the death of old Savillon, my father's friendſhip and protection were transferred to his ſon; the time he could ſpare from ſtudy, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpent at <hi>Belville.</hi> He appeared to feel in his ſituation that dependence I mentioned; in mean ſouls, this produces ſervility; in liberal minds, it is the nurſe of honourable pride. There was a ſilent melancholy about Savillon, which diſdained the notice of ſuperficial obſervers, and was never ſatisfied with ſuperficial acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His endowments did not attract the eye of the world; but they fixed the eſteem and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his friends. His friends indeed were few; and he ſeemed not to wiſh them many.</p>
                  <p>To know ſuch a man; to ſee his merit; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that yoke which Fortune had laid upon him—I am bewildered in ſentiment again.—In truth, my ſtory is the ſtory of ſentiment. I would tell you how I began to love Savillon; but the trifles, by which I now mark the progreſs of this attachment, are too little for deſcription.</p>
                  <p>We were frequently together, at that time of life when a boy and girl are not alarmed at being together. Savillon's ſuperior attainments made him a ſort of maſter for your JULIA. He uſed to teach me ideas; ſometimes he flattered me, by ſaying that, in his turn, he learned from me.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:017578_0055_0FBA71208CF3CBC0"/>
Our feelings were often equally diſguſted with many of the common notions of mankind, and we early began to form a league againſt them. We began with an alliance of argument; but the heart was always appealed to in the laſt reſort.</p>
                  <p>The time at laſt came, when I began to fear ſomething improper in our friendſhip; but the fears that ſhould guard, betray us. They make pictures to our fancy, which the reaſon they call to their aſſiſtance cannot overcome. In my ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles through the woods at <hi>Belville,</hi> I have often turned into a different walk from that I firſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to take, becauſe I ſuſpected Savillon was there!—Alas! MARIA, an ideal Savillon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me, more dangerous than the real.</p>
                  <p>But it was only from his abſence, I acquired a certain knowledge of myſelf. I remember, on the eve of his departure, we were walking in the garden; my father was with us. He had been commending ſome carnation ſeeds, which he had juſt received from an eminent floriſt at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> Savillon was examining ſome of them, which my father had put into his hand; and ſoon after, when we came to a ſmall plot, which I uſed to call my garden, he ſowed a few of them in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular corner of it. I took little notice at the time; but not long after he was gone, the flowers
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017578_0056_0FBA7121A54C4B48"/>
began to appear. You cannot eaſily imagine the effect this trifling circumſtance had upon me. I uſed to viſit the ſpot by ſtealth, for a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious feeling prevented my going openly thither, and watched the growth of thoſe carnations with the care of a parent for a darling child; and when they began to droop (I bluſh, MARIA, to tell it) I have often watered them with my tears.</p>
                  <p>Such is the account of my own feelings; but who ſhall tell me thoſe of Savillon? I have ſeen him look ſuch things!—but, alas! MARIA, our wiſhes are traitors, and give us falſe intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. His ſoul is too noble to pour itſelf out in thoſe trivial ſpeeches which the other ſex often addreſſes to ours. Savillon knows not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of compliment; yet methinks from Savillon it would pleaſe. May not a ſenſe of his humble fortune prevent him from ſpeaking what he feels? When we were firſt acquainted, JULIA DE ROU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIGNÉ was a name of ſome conſequence; fallen as ſhe now is, it is now her time to be haughty, and Savillon is too generous to think otherwiſe. In our moſt exalted eſtate, my friend, we are not ſo difficult to win, as we are ſometimes imagined to be: it unfortunately happens, that the beſt men think us the moſt ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="unknown:017578_0057_0FBA7123AD897880"/>
I know I am partial to my own cauſe; yet I am ſenſible of all the impropriety with which my conduct is attended. My <hi>conduct,</hi> did I call it? It is not my <hi>conduct;</hi> I err but in <hi>thought.</hi> Yet, I fear, I ſuffered theſe thoughts at firſt without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. They have grown up, unchecked, in my boſom, and now I would controul them in vain. Should I know myſelf indifferent to Savillon, would not my pride ſet me free? I ſigh, and dare not ſay that it would.</p>
                  <p>But there is ſomething tenderer and leſs tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in that feeling with which I now remember him, than when his preſence uſed to alarm me. Obliged to leave <hi>France,</hi> where Fortune had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him an inheritance, he is gone to <hi>Martinique,</hi> on the invitation of an uncle, who has been ſeveral years ſettled in that iſland. When I think of the tract of ocean which ſeparates us, my head grows dizzy as I think!—that this little heart ſhould have its intereſts extended ſo far! that, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Atlantic, there ſhould exiſt a being, for whom it ſwells with imaginary hope, and trembles, alas! much oftener trembles, with imaginary fear!</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a ſituation, wonder not at my coldneſs to Montauban. I know not how it is; but, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I eſteem him leſs than I did, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous reaſon that he loves me when I would
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017578_0058_0FBA712668D4FCD8"/>
not have him. I owe him gratitude in return, though I cannot give him love; but I involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily refuſe him the firſt, becauſe he aſks the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I have not to beſtow!</p>
                  <p>Would that he had never ſeen your JULIA! I expect not a life of happineſs, but had looked for one of quiet. There is ſomething in the idea even of peaceful ſadneſs, which I could bear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repining; but I am not made for ſtruggling with perplexity.</p>

                  <p>FROM your letters, MARIA, I always find comfort and ſatisfaction: And never did one arrive more ſeaſonably than the laſt. When the ſoul is torn by contrary emotions, it is then we wiſh for a friend to reconcile us to ourſelves: Such a friend am I bleſſed with in you. Advice from my MARIA, is the language of wiſdom without its ſeverity; ſhe can feel what is due to nature, while ſhe ſpeaks what is required of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

I have ever thought as you do, "that it is not enough for a woman not to ſwerve from the duty of a wife; that to love another more than a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is an adultery of the heart; and not to love a huſband with undivided affection, is a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual breach of the vow that unites us."</p>
                  <p>But I dare not own to my father the attachment from which theſe arguments are drawn. There is a ſternneſs in his idea of honour, from which I ſhrink with affright. Images of vengeance and deſtruction paint themſelves to my mind, when I think of his diſcovering that weakneſs which I cannot hide from myſelf. Even before my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as his wife, I tremble, and dare not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe it.</p>
                  <p>How hard is the fate of your JULIA! Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py from feelings which ſhe cheriſhed as harmleſs, which ſtill ſhe cannot think criminal, yet denied even the comfort of revealing, except to her MARIA, the cauſe of her diſtreſs! Amidſt the wreck of our family's fortunes, I ſhared the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity; muſt I now be robbed of the little treaſure I had ſaved, ſpoiled of my peace of mind, and forbid the native freedom of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections?</p>

I am called to dinner. One of our neighbours is below, a diſtant relation of Montauban, with his wife and daughter. Another ſtranger, Liſette ſays, is alſo there, a captain of a ſhip, ſhe thinks, whom ſhe remembers having ſeen formerly at <hi>Belville.</hi> Muſt I go then, and look unmeaning cheerfulneſs, and talk indifferent things, while my heart is torn with ſecret agitation? To feel diſtreſs, is painful; but to diſſemble it, is torture.</p>
                  <p>I have now time to think and power to expreſs my thoughts—It is midnight and the world is huſhed around me! After the agitation of this day, I feel ſomething ſilently ſad at my heart, that can pour itſelf out to my friend!</p>
                  <p>Savillon! cruel Savillon!—but I complain, as if it were falſehood to have forgotten her whom perhaps he never loved.</p>
                  <p>She too muſt forget him—MARIA! he is the huſband of another! That ſea-captain, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with my father to day, is juſt returned from <hi>Martinique.</hi> With a beating heart I heard him queſtioned of Savillon. With a beating heart I heard him tell of the riches he is ſaid to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the death of that relation with whom he lived; but judge of its ſenſations, when he
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:017578_0061_0FBA7130096AC058"/>
added, that Savillon was only prevented by that event, from marrying the daughter of a rich planter, who had been deſtined for his wife on the very day his uncle died, and whom he was ſtill to marry as ſoon as decency would permit. "And before this time (ſaid the ſtranger) he muſt be her huſband."</p>
                  <p>Before this time!—While I was cheriſhing romantic hopes! or, at leaſt, while, amidſt my diſtreſs, I had preſerved inviolate the idea of his faith and my own.—But whither does this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion carry me? Savillon has broken no faith; to me he never pledged it. Hide me, my friend, from the conſciouſneſs of my folly, or let it ſpeak till its expiation be made, till I have baniſhed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon from my mind.</p>
                  <p>Muſt I then baniſh him from my mind? Muſt I forget the ſcenes of our early days, the opinions we formed, the authors we read, the muſic we played together? There was a time when I was wont to retire from the profanity of vulgar ſouls, to indulge the remembrance!</p>
                  <p>I heard ſomebody tap at my door. I was in that ſtate of mind which every thing terrifies; I fancy I looked terrified; for my mother, when ſhe

                  <p>"I come to ſee you JULIA (ſaid ſhe) before I go to bed; methought you looked ill at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per."—"Did I mamma? (ſaid I) I am well enough; indeed I am." She preſſed my hand gently; I tried to ſmile; it was with difficulty I forbore weeping.</p>
                  <p>"Your mind, child (continued my mother) is too tender; I fear it is, for this bad world. You muſt learn to conquer ſome of its feelings, if you would be juſt to yourſelf; but I can pardon you, for I know how bewitching they are; but truſt me, my love, they muſt not be indulged too far; they poiſon the quiet of our lives. Alas! we have too little at beſt! I am aware how ungracious the doctrine is; but it is not the leſs true. If you ever have a child like yourſelf, you will tell her this, in your turn, and ſhe will not believe you."</p>
                  <p>I was now weeping outright: It was the only anſwer I could make. My mother embraced me tenderly, and begged me to be calm, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reſt. I gave her my promiſe to go ſoon to bed: I am about to perform it; but to reſt, MARIA!—farewell!</p>

                  <p>WHILE I write, my paper is blotted by my tears. They fall not now for myſelf, but for my father; you know not how he has wrung my heart.</p>
                  <p>He had another appointment this day with that procureur, who once viſited our village before. Sure, there is ſomething terrible in that man's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Alas! I formerly complained of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ill humour, when he returned to us from a meeting with him; I knew not, unjuſt that I was, what reaſon he then might have for his chagrin; I am ſtill ignorant of their tranſactions, but have too good ground for making frightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</p>
                  <p>On his return in the evening, he found my mother and me in ſeparate apartments. She has complained of a ſlight diſorder, from cold I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, theſe two or three days paſt, and had lain down on a couch in her own room, till my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould return.

"Iphigenia! (ſaid my father, taking up the book) Iphigenia!" He looked on me piteouſly as he repeated the word. I cannot make you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how much that ſingle name expreſſed, nor how much that look. He preſſed me to his boſom, and as he kiſſed me, I felt a tear on his cheek.</p>
                  <p>"Your mother is in her own chamber, my love." I offered to go and fetch her: He held my hand faſt as if he would not have me leave him. We ſtood for ſome moments thus, till my mother, who had heard his voice, entered the room.</p>
                  <p>We ſat down by the fire, with my father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. He looked on us alternately, with an affected cheerfulneſs, and ſpoke of indifferent things in a tone of gaiety rather unuſual to him; but it was eaſy to ſee how foreign thoſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances were to the real movements of his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>There was, at laſt, a pauſe of ſilence, which gave them time to overcome him. We ſaw a tear, which he was unable to repreſs, begin to ſteal from his eye. "My deareſt life!" ſaid my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, laying hold of his hand and kiſſing it: I preſſed the other in mine. "Yes, (ſaid he) I am ſtill rich in bleſſings, while theſe are left me. You, my love, have ever ſhared my fortune unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining: I look up to you, as to a ſuperior Being,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:017578_0065_0FBA713AC73A4010"/>
who for all his benefits accepts of our gratitude as the only recompence we have to make. This—this laſt retreat, where I looked for peace at leaſt, though it was joined to poverty, we may ſoon be forced to leave!—Wilt thou ſtill pardon, ſtill comfort the man, whoſe evil deſtiny has drawn thee along with it to ruin?—And thou too, my child, my JULIA! thou wilt not forſake thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's gray hairs! Misfortune purſues him to the laſt: Do thou but ſmile, my cherub, and he can bear it ſtill." I threw my head on his knees, and bathed them with my tears. "Do not unman me (he cried) I would ſupport my ſituation as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a man. Methinks, for my own part, I could endure any thing—but my wife! my child! can they bear want and wretchedneſs!" "They can bear any thing with you," ſaid my mother.—I ſtarted up, I know not how; I ſaid ſomething, I know not what; but, at that moment, I felt my heart rouſed as with the ſound of a trumpet. My mother ſtood on one ſide, looking gently upwards, her hands, which were claſped together, leaning on my father's ſhoulder. He had one hand in his ſide, the other preſſed on his boſom, his figure ſeeming to riſe above itſelf, and his eye bent ſteadily forward.—Methought, as I looked on them, I was above the fears of humanity!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:017578_0066_0FBA713BF24B4E20"/>
Le Blanc entered. "'Tis enough," ſaid my father, taking one or two ſtrides through the room, his countenance ſtill preſerving an air of haughtineſs. "Go to my chamber, (ſaid he to Le Blanc) I have ſome buſineſs for you." When they left the room I felt the weakneſs of my ſoul return. I looked on my mother: She turned from me to hide her tears. I fell on her neck, and gave a looſe to mine: "Do not weep JULIA! was all ſhe could utter, and ſhe wept while ſhe uttered it.</p>
                  <p>When Le Blanc returned, he was pale as aſhes, and his hands ſhook ſo, that he could hardly carry in ſupper. My father came in a few minutes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: He took his place at table in his uſual way, and ſtrove to look as he was wont to do. During the time of ſupper, I obſerved Le Blanc fix his eye upon him; and when he anſwered ſome little queſtions put to him by my father, his voice trembled in his throat.</p>
                  <p>After being left by ourſelves, we were for ſome time ſilent. My mother at laſt ſpoke through her tears: "Do not, my deareſt Roubigné, (ſaid ſhe) add to our misfortunes by an unkind concealment of them.—Has any new calamity befallen us?—When we retired hither, did we not know the worſt?"—"I am afraid not, (anſwered he calmly) but my fears may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:017578_0067_0FBA713E12750D48"/>
juſt. Do not be alarmed, my love, things may turn out better than they appear. I was affected too much before ſupper, and could not conceal it. There are weak moments, when we are not maſters of ourſelves. When I looked on my JULIA and you, when I thought on thoſe treaſures, I was a very coward; but I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed my fortitude, and, I think, I can await the deciſion calmly. You ſhall know the whole, my love; but let me prevail on you to be comforted in the mean time: Let not our diſtreſſes reach us before their time." He rung for Le Blanc, and gave him directions about ſome ordinary matters for next day.</p>
                  <p>As I went up ſtairs to my room, I ſaw that poor fellow ſtanding at the window in the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. "What do you here (ſaid I) Le Blanc?"—"Ah! Miſs JULIA, (ſaid he) I know not well what I do." He followed me into my room, without my bidding him. "My maſter has ſpoken ſo to me.—When he called me out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſupper, as you ſaw, I went with him into his cloſet: He wrote ſomething down, as if he were ſumming up money.—'Here are ſo much wages due to you, Le Blanc (ſaid he, putting the paper into my hand). You ſhall receive the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney now; for I know not how long theſe louis may be mine to give you.'—I could not read
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:017578_0068_0FBA713FF57637E0"/>
the figures, I am ſure I could not: I was ſtruck blind, as it were, while he ſpoke ſo. He held out the gold to me: I drew back; for I would not have touched it for the world; but he inſiſted on my taking it, till I fell on my knees, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not to kill me by offering ſuch a thing. At length he threw it down on his table, and I ſaw him wipe his eyes with his handkerchief.—'My dear maſter!' ſaid I, and I believe I took hold of his hand; for ſeeing him ſo, made me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get myſelf—He waved his hand for me to leave the room; and, as I went down into the kitchen, if I had not burſted into tears, I think I ſhould have fainted away."</p>
                  <p>What will our deſtiny do with us? But I have learned, of late, to look on miſery with leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. My ſoul has ſunk into a ſtupid indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ſometimes, when ſhe is rouſed at all, I conceive a ſort of pride in meeting diſtreſs with fortitude, ſince I cannot hope for the attainment of happineſs. But my father, MARIA!—thus to bear at once the weakneſs of age, the gripe of poverty, the buffets of a world with which his ſpirit is already at war!—there my heart bleeds again! The complaints I have made of thoſe little harſhneſſes I have ſometimes felt from him, riſe up to my memory in the form of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:017578_0069_0FBA7142EB4B38B0"/>
Had he been more perfectly indulgent, methinks I ſhould have pitied him leſs.</p>
                  <p>I was alarmed, by hearing my mother's bell: She had been ſeized with a ſudden fit of ſickneſs, and had almoſt fainted. She is now a good deal better, and endeavours to make light of it; but, at this time, I am weaker than uſual, and every appearance of danger frightens me. She chid me for not having been a-bed. I leave this open till the morning, when I can inform you how ſhe does.</p>
                  <p>My mother has got up, though againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my father and me. It may be fancy, but I think I ſee her eye languid and weighed down. I would ſtifle even the thoughts of danger, but cannot. Farewell.</p>

                     <salute>MADAM,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM commanded by my dear young lady to write to you, becauſe ſhe is not in a condition to write herſelf. I am ſure, I am little able either. I have a poor head for inditing at any time; and, at preſent, it is ſo full of the melancholy ſcenes I have ſeen, that it goes round as it were, at the thoughts of telling them. When I think what a lady I have loſt!—To be ſure, if ever there was a ſaint on earth, Madame de Roubigné was ſhe—but Heaven's will be done!</p>
                  <p>I believe Miſs JULIA wrote you a letter the day ſhe was taken ill. She did not ſay much, for it is not her way to be troubleſome with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but we all ſaw by her looks how diſtreſſed ſhe was. That night my maſter lay in a ſeparate apartment, and I ſat up by her bed-ſide; I heard her toſſing and reſtleſs all night long, and now and then, when ſhe got a few moments ſleep, ſhe would moan through it ſadly, and preſently wake
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:017578_0071_0FBA7147DC6107A8"/>
again with a ſtart, as if ſomething had frightened her. In the morning a phyſician was ſent for, who cauſed her to be blooded, and we thought her the better for it; but that was only for a ſhort time, and next night ſhe was worſe than before, and complained of violent pains all over her body, and particularly her breaſt, and did not once ſhut her eyes to ſleep. They took a greater quantity of blood from her now than at firſt, and in the evening ſhe had a bliſter put on, and the doctor ſat by her, part of the night. All this time, Miſs JULIA was ſcarce ever out of her mother's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, except ſometimes for a quarter of an hour, when the doctor begged of her to go, and he and I were both attending my lady. My maſter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that laſt night took her away, and prevailed on her to put off her clothes, and go to bed, and I heard him ſay to her in a whiſper, when they had got upon the ſtairs, "My JULIA have pity on yourſelf for my ſake; let me not loſe both;"—And he wept, I ſaw, as he ſpoke; and ſhe burſt into tears.</p>
                  <p>The fourth day my lady continued much in the ſame way, but during the night ſhe wandered a good deal, and ſpoke much of her huſband and daughter, and frequently mentioned the Count de Montauban. The doctor ordered ſome things, I forget their proper name, to be laid to the ſoles
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:017578_0072_0FBA7148A2458770"/>
of her feet, which ſeemed to relieve her head much; for ſhe was more diſtinct towards morning, and knew me when I gave her drink, and called me by my name, which ſhe had not done before, but had taken me for my young lady; but her voice was fainter than ever, and her phyſician looked more alarmed, when he viſited her, than I have ſeen him do all the reſt of her illneſs. My maſter was then in the room, and preſently they went out together; my lady called me to her, and aſked who had gone out; when I told her, ſhe ſaid, "I gueſs the reaſon; but heaven be praiſed I can think of it without terror."</p>
                  <p>Her daughter entered the room juſt then; ſhe went up to her mother, and aſked how ſhe found herſelf. More at eaſe, my child, (ſaid ſhe) but I will not deceive you into hope; I believe this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary relief is a fatal ſymptom; my own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tell me ſo, and the doctor's looks confirm them.—"Do not ſpeak ſo, my deareſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! for Heaven's ſake, do not!"—was all ſhe could anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The doctor returned along with my maſter. He felt my lady's pulſe; Miſs JULIA looked up wildly in his face: My maſter turned aſide his head; but my lady, ſweet angel, was calm and gentle as a lamb. "Do not flatter me, (ſaid
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:017578_0073_0FBA714F1A4A1E28"/>
ſhe, when the doctor let go her arm;) I know you think I cannot recover."—"I am not without hopes, madam, (he replied) though, I confeſs my fears are ſtronger than my hopes."—My lady looked upwards for a moment, as I have often ſeen her do in health. Her daughter flung herſelf on the bed; I thought ſhe had fallen into a ſwoon, and wanted to lift her up in my arms, though I was all of a tremble, and could hardly ſupport myſelf. She ſtarted up, and would have ſpoken to her mother; but ſhe wept and ſobbed, and could not. My lady begged her to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; my maſter could not ſpeak, but he laid hold of her hand, and with a ſort of gentle force, led her out of the room.</p>
                  <p>My lady complained of a dryneſs on her mouth and lips: The doctor gave her a glaſs of water, into which he poured a little ſomewhat out of a phial; ſhe thanked him when ſhe had drunk it, and ſeemed to ſpeak eaſier: He ſaid, he ſhould leave her for a little: Monſ. de Roubigné came in. "Attend my daughter," ſaid ſhe to me; and I thought ſhe wanted to be alone with my maſter.</p>
                  <p>I found Miſs JULIA in the parlour, leaning on the table, her cheek reſting on her hand; when I ſpoke, ſhe fell a crying again. Soon after her
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:017578_0074_0FBA7150F21A9960"/>
father came in, and told her that her mother wiſhed to ſee her; She returned along with my maſter, and they were ſome time together.</p>
                  <p>When I was called, I found my lady very low, by reaſon, as I ſuppoſe, ſhe had worn herſelf out in ſpeaking to them. The doctor ſaid ſo too, when he returned; and in the afternoon, when I attended him down ſtairs, he ſaid to me, "That excellent lady is going faſt." He promiſed to ſee her again in two hours; but, before that time, we found ſhe had grown much worſe, and had loſt her ſpeech altogether: So he was fetched im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and when he came, he ſaid nothing was to be done, but to make her as eaſy as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and offered to ſtay with her himſelf, which he did till about three next morning, when the dear good lady expired.</p>
                  <p>Her daughter fainted away, and it was a long time before the phyſician could recover her. It is wonderful how my maſter bears up, in order to comfort her; but one may ſee how heavy his grief is on him for all that. This morning Miſs JULIA deſired me to attend her to the chamber, where her mother's corpſe is laid. I was ſurpriſed to hear her ſpeak ſo calmly as ſhe did; and, though I made ſo free as to diſſuade her much at firſt, yet ſhe perſuaded me ſhe could bear it well enough,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:017578_0075_0FBA71529620EEA8"/>
and I went with her accordingly. But when we came near the door, ſhe ſtopped, and pulled me back into her room, and leaned on my arm, and fell into a violent fit of weeping; yet, when I begged her to give over thoughts of going, ſhe ſaid ſhe was eaſy again, and would go. And thus two or three times ſhe went and returned, till, at laſt, ſhe opened the door, in deſperation as one may ſay, and I went in cloſe behind her. The firſt ſight we ſaw was Monſ. de Roubigné at the bed-ſide, bending over the corpſe, and holding one of its hands in his. "Support me, Liſette," cried ſhe; and leaned back on me again. My maſter turned about as ſhe ſpoke; his daughter took courage, as it were, then, and walked up to the body, and took the hand that her father had juſt let drop, and kiſſed it. "My child!" ſaid he. "My father!" anſwered my dear young lady, and they claſped one another in their arms. I could not help burſting into tears when I ſaw them; yet it was not altogether for grief neither: I know not how it was, but I weep when I think of it yet. May Heaven bleſs them both, and preſerve them to ſupport one another!</p>
                  <p>My lady's bell rung, and ſhe aſked me if I had written to you. When I told her I had, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

if I had ſent off the letter, and I was fain to ſay yes, leſt ſhe ſhould aſk me to read it, and I knew how bad it muſt be for her, to hear all I have told your ladyſhip repeated. I am ſure it is a ſad ſcrawl, and little worth your reading, were it not that it concerns ſo dear a friend of yours as my lady is; and I have told things juſt as they happened, and as they came up to my mind, which is indeed but in a confuſed way ſtill.

                  <p>AT laſt, my MARIA, I am able to write. In the ſad ſociety of my afflicted father I have found no reſtraint on my ſorrows. We have indulged them to the full: Their firſt turbulence is ſubſided, and the ſtill quiet grief that now preſſes on my boſom, is ſuch as my friend may participate.</p>

'Your loſs is common to thouſands.' Such is the hackneyed conſolation of ordinary minds, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing even when it is true. But mine is not common: It is not merely to loſe a mother, the beſt, the moſt indulgent of mothers!—Think, MARIA, think of your JULIA'S ſituation; how helpleſs, how forlorn ſhe is!—A father pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by misfortune to the wane of life;—but, alas! he looks to her for ſupport! He has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived the laſt of his friends; and thoſe who ſhould have been linked to him by the ties of blood, the ſame fatal diſputes, which ruined his fortune, have ſhaken from his ſide. Beyond him,—and he is old, and affliction blaſts his age!—beyond him, MARIA, and but for thee,—the world were deſolate around me.</p>
                  <p>My mother! you have ſeen, you have known her. Her gentle, but aſſured ſpirit, was the tutelary power to which we ever looked up for comfort and protection: To the laſt moment it enlightened herſelf, and guided us. The night before ſhe died, ſhe called me to her bed-ſide:—"I feel, my child, (ſaid ſhe) as the greateſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of parting, the thought of leaving you to affliction and diſtreſs. I have but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to receive or to beſtow: A reliance on that merciful Being, who, in this hour, as in all the paſt, has not forſaken me! Next to that Being,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:017578_0078_0FBA715DF18D16D0"/>
you will ſhortly be the only remaining ſupport of the unfortunate Roubigné.—I had, of late, looked on one meaſure as the means of procuring his age an additional ſtay; but I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe your conduct, or warp your heart. I know the purity of your ſentiments, the warmth of your filial affection: To thoſe and the guidance of Heaven—"She had ſpoken thus far with difficulty: Her voice now failed in the attempt. My father came into the room: He ſat down by me: She ſtretched out her hand, and joining ours, which were both laid on the bed, together, ſhe claſped them with a feeble preſſure, leaned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſeemingly worn out with the exertion, and looked up to Heaven, as if directing us thither for that aſſiſtance which her words had bequeathed us; her laſt words! for after that ſhe could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak to be heard, and only uttered ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſyllables, till ſhe loſt the power of utterance altogether.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words cannot be forgotten! they preſs upon my mind with the ſacredneſs of a parent's dying inſtructions! But that meaſure they ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—is it not againſt the dictates of a ſtill ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior power? I feel the thoughts of it as of a crime. Should it be ſo, MARIA; or do I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the whiſpers of inclination for the ſuggeſtions of conſcience? Yet I think I have ſearched my
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:017578_0079_0FBA716426871D08"/>
boſom impartially, and its anſwer is uniform. Were it otherwiſe, ſhould it ever be otherwiſe, what would not your JULIA do, to ſmooth the latter days of a father, on whoſe gray hairs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes are multiplied!</p>
                  <p>Methinks, ſince this laſt blow, he is greatly changed. That haughtineſs of ſpirit, which ſeemed to brave, but, in reality, was irritated by misfortune, has left him. He looks calmly upon things; they affect him more, but hurt him leſs; his tears fall oftener, but they are leſs terrible than the ſullen gloom which uſed to darken his aſpect. I can now mingle mine with his, free to affliction, without uneaſineſs or fear; and thoſe offices of kindneſs, which once my piety exacted, are now the offering of my heart.</p>
                  <p>Montauban has behaved, on this occaſion, as became his character. How perfect were it, but for that weakneſs which regards your JULIA! He came to ſee my father the day after that on which my mother died. "I will not endeavour (ſaid he) to ſtop the current of your grief: That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which the world offers at times like theſe, flows not from feeling, and cannot be addreſſed to it. Your ſorrow is juſt: I come to give you leiſure to indulge it: Employ me in thoſe irkſome offices, which diſtreſs us more that the tears they oblige

                  <p>And this friend his daughter is forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of.

I am aſſailed by motives on every hand; but my own feelings are ſtill unconquered. Support them, my ever faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful MARIA, if they are juſt; if not—but they cannot be unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>The only friend of my own ſex, whom I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed beſides thee, is now no more! We needed no additional tie; yet, methinks, in the grief of my heart, I lean upon yours with increaſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Thou too—I will not ſay pity—thou ſhalt love me more.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE, this moment, received your anſwer to my laſt. Ah! my friend, it anſwers not as <hi>I</hi> wiſhed. Is this forwardneſs in me, to hear, with pleaſure, only the arguments on one ſide, when my conduct ſhould be guided by thoſe on both?</p>

                     <pb n="74" facs="unknown:017578_0081_0FBA716736B7C830"/>
You ſay, "it is from the abſence of Savillon, that the impreſſion he had made on my heart has gained its preſent ſtrength; that the contemplation of diſtant objects is always ſtronger than the ſenſe of preſent ones; and that, were I to ſee him now, were I daily to behold him the huſband of another, I ſhould ſoon grow tranquil at the ſight. That it is injuſtice to myſelf, and a want of that proper pride, which ſhould be the conſtant attendant of our ſex, to ſuffer this unhappy attachment to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my mind; and, that after looking calmly on the world, you cannot allow ſo much force to thoſe impreſſions, as our youth was apt to ſuppoſe in them. That they are commonly vanquiſhed by an effort to vanquiſh them; and that the ſinking under their preſſure, is one of thoſe diſeaſes of the mind, which, like certain diſeaſes of the body, the exerciſe of its better faculties will very ſoon remove."</p>
                  <p>There is reaſon in all this; but while you argue from reaſon, I muſt decide from my feelings. In every one's own caſe, there is a rule of judging, which is not the leſs powerful that one cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it.—I inſiſt not on the memory of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon; I can forget him, I think I can—time will be kind that way—It is fit I ſhould forget him, he is happy as the huſband of another.—But ſhould I wed any man, be his worth what
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:017578_0082_0FBA7169A4C02078"/>
it may, if I feel not that lively preference for him, which waits not for reaſoning to perſuade its conſent? The ſuggeſtions I have heard of Montauban's unwearied love, his uncommon vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, winning my affections in a ſtate of wedlock, I have always held a very dangerous experiment; there is equivocation in thoſe vows, which unite us to a huſband, our affection for whom we leave to contingency.—"But I already eſteem and admire him."—It is moſt true;—why is he not contented with my eſteem and admiration? If thoſe feelings are to be ripened into love, let him wait that period when my hand may be his without a bluſh. This I have already told him; he almoſt owned the injuſtice of his requeſt, but pleaded the ardour of paſſion in excuſe. Is this fair dealing, MARIA? that his feelings are to be an apology for his ſuit, while mine are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be a reaſon for refuſal?</p>
                  <p>I am called away by my father; I heard the Count's voice below ſome time before. There was a ſolemnity in my father's manner of aſking me down, which indicates ſomething important in this viſit. You ſhall hear what that is, before this letter is cloſed.—Again! he is come to fetch me.</p>

                     </gap> at the generoſity of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban? I know the native nobleneſs of his ſoul—Was it in ſuch a girl as me to enfeeble it ſo long?</p>
                  <p>My father led me into the parlour. Montauban was ſtanding in a penſive poſture; he made me a ſilent bow. I was placed in a chair, ſtanding near another, which the Count had occupied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: He ſat down. My father walked to the window; his back was to us. Montauban put himſelf once or twice into the attitude of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but we were ſtill ſilent.</p>
                  <p>My father turned and approached us. "The Count has ſomething to communicate, JULIA. Would you chooſe, Sir, that it ſhould be addreſſed to her alone?" "No, (anſwered he) it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation to both, and both ſhould hear it made. I fear, I have, unwillingly been the cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to a family, whoſe ſociety, for ſome time paſt, has been one of the chief ſweeteners of my life. They know my gratitude, for the bleſſing of that intimacy they were kind enough to allow me. When I wiſhed for a tenderer connexion, they could not blame my wiſh; but when I preſſed it ſo far as to wound their peace, I was unworthy of the eſteem they had formerly given, an eſteem
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:017578_0084_0FBA7171500931B0"/>
I cannot now bear to loſe. When I ceaſe my ſuit, Miſs JULIA, let it ſpeak, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

In that regard, which you often had the generoſity to confeſs for me, was impaired by my addreſſes, let me recover it by this ſacrifice of my hopes; and while I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote to your quiet the ſolicitations of my love, let it confirm to me every privilege of the moſt ſacred friendſhip."</p>
                  <p>Such were the words of Montauban. I know not what anſwer I made: I remember a movement of admiration, and no more. At that inſtant, he ſeemed nobler than ever; and when, in ſpite of his firmneſs, a tear broke forth, my pity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt carried me beyond eſteem. How happy might this man make another! JULIA DE ROU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIGNE' is fated to be miſerable!</p>

The name in the ſuperſcription I have made Vervette, though my ſteward from whom I take it, is not ſure if it be exactly that; but, as he tells me the man is a procureur of ſome practice, and is certain as to the place of his reſidence, I imagine, you will have no difficulty in finding him.

                  </opener>
                  <p>I MAKE bold to write this, in great haſte, becauſe I am ſenſible of your friendſhip for my lady, and that you will thank me for giving you an opportunity of trying to ſerve her father and her in their preſent diſtreſs. She, poor lady, is in ſuch a ſituation as not to be able to write; and beſides, ſhe is ſo noble-minded, that I dare be ſworn ſhe would not tell you the worſt, leſt it ſhould look like aſking your aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>How ſhall I tell you, Madam? My poor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is in danger of being forced away from us, and thrown into priſon. A debt it ſeems owing to ſome people in <hi>Paris,</hi> on account of expences about that unfortunate law-ſuit, has been put into the hands of a procureur, who will not hear of any delay in the payment of it; and he was here this morning, and told my maſter, as Le Blanc overheard, that, if he could not procure the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in three hours time, he muſt attend him to a jail. My maſter wiſhed to conceal this from his daughter, and deſired the procureur to do his duty, without any noiſe or diſturbance; but Le Blanc had ſcarcely got up ſtairs, when ſhe called him,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:017578_0087_0FBA717928ED37F8"/>
and enquired about that man's buſineſs, and he could not hide it, his heart was ſo full, and ſo he told her all that had paſſed below. Then ſhe flew down to her father's room, and hung about him in ſuch a manner, weeping and ſobbing, that it would have melted the heart of a ſavage, and ſo, to be ſure, I ſaid to the procureur; but he did not mind me a bit, nor my lady neither, though ſhe looked ſo as I never beheld in all my life, and I was terrified to ſee her ſo, and ſaid all I could to comfort her, but to no purpoſe. At laſt a ſervant of the procureur brought him a letter, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he went out of the houſe, but left two of his attendants to watch that my maſter ſhould not eſcape; and they are now here, and they ſay that he cannot grant any reſpite; but that, as ſure as can be, when he returns, he will take away Monſ. de Roubigné to priſon. I ſend this by a boy, a nephew of Le Blanc's, who ſerves a gentleman in this province, who is juſt now going poſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the boy called on his way, by good fortune, to ſee his uncle. I am in haſte, your very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obedient ſervant,</p>

                  <head>LETTER XVIII. LISETTE TO MARIA.</head>
                  <p>TO be ſure, Madam, you muſt have been much affected with the diſtreſs in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, of which I informed you in my laſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what a friendſhip there is between my dear lady and you. And now I am much vexed, that I ſhould have given you ſo much uneaſineſs in vain, and ſend this to let you know of the happy deliverance my maſter has met with, from that moſt generous of men the Count de Montauban; I ſay, the moſt generous of men, as to be ſure he is, to advance ſo large a ſum without any near proſpect of being repaid, and without ever being aſked to do ſuch a favour; for I verily believe my maſter would die before he would aſk ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of any one, ſo high minded he is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his misfortunes. He is juſt now gone to ſee the Count, for that noble-hearted gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would not come to our houſe, leſt, as Monſ. de Roubigné ſaid, he ſhould ſeem to triumph in the effects of his own generoſity. Indeed, the thing was done as if it had been by witchcraft, without one of this family ſuſpecting ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the procureur never came back at all,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:017578_0089_0FBA717CA406A418"/>
only ſent a paper, diſcharging the debt, to one of the men he had left behind, who, upon that, behaved very civilly, and went away with much better manners, forſooth, than they came; but Le Blanc followed them to the village, where they met the procureur, and thus it was that we diſcovered the debt to have been paid by the Count, who, it ſeems, had ſent that letter, but without a name, which the procureur received, when he left us at the time I wrote your ladyſhip laſt.</p>
                  <p>Monſ. de Roubigné is returned from his viſit to the Count de Montauban, and has been a long time cloſeted with my lady, and, to be ſure, ſomething particular muſt have paſſed, but what it is I can not gueſs; only I am certain it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than common, becauſe I was in the way when they parted, and my lady paſſed me, and I ſaw by her looks that there had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. When ſhe went into her own chamber I followed her, and there ſhe ſat down, leaning her arm on her dreſſing table, and gave ſuch a ſigh, as I thought her heart would have burſt with it. Then I thought I might ſpeak, and aſked if ſhe was not well; Very well, Liſette, ſaid ſhe; but ſhe ſaid it as if ſhe was not well for all that, breathing ſtrongly, as ſhe ſpoke the words, as one
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:017578_0090_0FBA717DF4687D18"/>
does when one has run one's ſelf out of breath. "Leave me child (ſaid ſhe) I will call you again by and by." And ſo I left her as ſhe bid me, and as I went out of the room, ſhutting the door ſoftly behind me, I heard her ſtart up from her chair, and ſay to herſelf "The lot is caſt!" I think that was it.</p>
                  <p>My maſter has been all this while in his ſtudy, writing, and juſt now he called Le Blanc, and gave him a letter for the Count de Montauban, and Le Blanc told me, as he paſſed, that Monſ. de Roubigné looked gayer and more in ſpirits than uſual, when he gave it him. My lady is ſtill in her chamber alone, and has never called me, as ſhe promiſed. Poor dear ſoul! I am ſure I would do any thing to ſerve her, that I would, and well I may, for ſhe is the kindeſt, ſweeteſt lady to me, and ſo indeed ſhe is to every body.</p>
                  <p>And now, Madam, I am ſure I ſhould aſk a thouſand pardons for uſing the freedom to write to you in ſuch a manner, juſt by ſtarts, as things happen. But I am ſenſible your ladyſhip will not impute my doing ſo to any want of reſpect, but only to my deſiring to give your ladyſhip an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſituation of my lady, and of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which you were ſo condeſcending as to ſay,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:017578_0091_0FBA7182788548B8"/>
after my firſt letter, you were much obliged to me for giving you, and begged that it might be in my own ſtyle, which, to be ſure, is none of the beſt; but which your ladyſhip will be ſo good as pardon, eſpecially as I am, when I write to you about theſe matters, in a flutter, as one may ſay, as well as having little time to order my expreſſions for the beſt.

                  <head>LETTER XIX. JULIA TO MARIA.</head>
                  <p>IN the intricacies of my fate or of my conduct, I have long been accuſtomed to conſider you my ſupport and my judge. For ſome days paſt theſe have come thick upon me; but I could not find compoſure enough to ſtate them coolly even to myſelf. At this hour of midnight. I have ſummoned up a ſtill recollection of the paſt; and with you, as my other conſcience, I will unfold and examine it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:017578_0092_0FBA7183E691FE30"/>
The ready zeal of my faithful Liſette has, I underſtand, ſaved me a recital of the diſtreſs, in which my father found himſelf involved, from the conſequences of that law-ſuit we have often lamented. I could only ſhare it with him; but a more effectual friend ſtepped forth in the Count de Montauban. His generoſity relieved my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gave him back to freedom and your JULIA.</p>
                  <p>The manner of his doing this was ſuch as the delicacy of a mind, jealous of its own honour, would prompt in the cauſe of another's. I thought I ſaw a circumſtance, previous to the Count's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it, which added to that delicacy. My father did not then perceive this; it was not till he waited on Montauban, that the force of it ſtruck his mind.</p>
                  <p>When he returned home, I ſaw ſome remains of that pride, which formerly rankled under the receipt of favours it was unable to return. "My JULIA, (ſaid he) your father is unhappy, every way unhappy; but it is fit I ſhould be humble—Pierre de Roubigné muſt learn humility!" He ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theſe words in a tone that frightened me; I could not ſpeak. He ſaw me confuſed, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and, putting on a milder aſpect, took my hand and kiſſed it.—"Heaven knows, that, for
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:017578_0093_0FBA71856C3C9D90"/>
myſelf, I rate not life or liberty at much;—but, when I thought what my child muſt ſuffer—I alone am left to protect her—and I am old and weak, and muſt aſk for that aſſiſtance which I am unable to repay." "The generous, Sir, (ſaid I) know from their own hearts what yours can feel: All beyond is accident alone." "The generous, indeed, my child! but you know not all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of Montauban. When he tore himſelf from thoſe hopes which his love had taught him; when he renounced his pretenſions to that hand, which I know can alone confer happineſs on his life; it was but for a more delicate opportunity of relieving thy father.—I could not (ſaid he) while I ſought your daughter's love, bear the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of purchaſing it by a favour; now, when I have renounced it for ever, I am free to the offices of friendſhip.—Had you ſeen him, JULIA, when he pronounced this <hi>for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> great as his ſoul is, he wept! by Heaven he wept, at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing it!—Theſe tears, JULIA, theſe tears of my friend!—Would I had met my dungeon in ſilence! they had not torn my heart thus!"</p>
                  <p>MARIA, mine was ſwelled to a ſort of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic madneſs—</p>
                  <p>I full at his feet.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="unknown:017578_0094_0FBA7189D2B26850"/>
"No, my father, they ſhall not.—Amidſt the fall of her family, your daughter ſhall not ſtand aloof in ſafety. She would have ſhared the priſon of her father in the pride of adverſity; behold her now the partner of his humiliation! Tell the Count de Montauban, that JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ; offers that hand to his generoſity, which ſhe refuſed to his ſolicitation;—tell him alſo, ſhe is above deceit: She will not conceal the ſmall value of the gift. 'Tis but the offering of a wretch, who would ſomehow requite the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of her father, and the ſervices of his friend. If he ſhall now reject it, that ugly debt, which his unhappineſs lays us under, will be repaid in the abaſement ſhe endures; if he accepts of it as it is, tell him its miſtreſs is not ignorant of the duty that ſhould attend it."</p>
                  <p>My father ſeemed to recover at my words; yet ſurpriſe was mixed with the ſatisfaction his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance expreſſed. "Are theſe your ſentiments, my love? preſſing my hand cloſer in his—The heroiſm of duty was waſted—I anſwered him with my tears. "Speak, (ſaid he) my JULIA, coolly; and let not the diſtreſſes of your father warp your reſolution. He can endure any thing, even his gratitude ſhall be ſilenced."—My for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude revived again.—"There is ſome weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sir, attends even our beſt reſolves: Mine
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:017578_0095_0FBA718AE86D9048"/>
are not without it; but they are fixed, and I have ſpoken them." He aſked if he might acquaint Monſ. de Montauban. "Immediately, Sir, (I anſwered) if you pleaſe; the ſooner he knows my reſolution, the more will he ſee it flowing from my heart." My father went into his ſtudy, and wrote a letter, which he read to me. It was not all I could have wiſhed, yet I could not mend it by correction. Who ſhall give words to the ſoul at ſuch a time? My very thoughts are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate expreſſions of what I feel: There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing buſy about my heart, which I cannot reduce into thinking.—Oh! MARIA!</p>
                  <p>Montauban came immediately on receipt of this letter; we did not expect him that night; we were at ſupper. In what a ſituation was your JULIA while it laſted? In this terrible interval, I was obliged to meet his eye ſometimes, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing ordinary civilities to him. To ſee him, to ſpeak to him thus, while the fate of my life was within the power of a few little words, was ſuch torture, as it required the utmoſt of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to bear. My father ſaw it, and put as ſpeedy an end to our meal as poſſible.—We were left alone.</p>
                  <p>My father ſpoke firſt, not without heſitation. Montauban was ſtill more confuſed; but it was
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:017578_0096_0FBA718C24B3FF00"/>
the confuſion of a happy man. He ſpoke ſome half ſentences about the delicacy of my ſentiments and his own, but was entangled there, and I think, not able to extricate himſelf. At laſt, turning fuller towards me, who ſat the ſilent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the ſcene, (why ſhould I ſcore through that word when writing to you? yet it is a bad one, and I pray you to forgive it) he ſaid, he knew his own unworthineſs of that hand, which my generoſity had now allowed me to hope for; but that every endeavour of his future life—the reſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place; for his ſex have but one ſort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion for the exulting modeſty of ſucceſs—My father put my hand in his—I was obliged to raiſe my eyes from the ground and look on him; his were bent earneſtly on me: There was too, too much joy in them, MARIA; mine could not bear them long. "That hand (ſaid my father) is the laſt treaſure of Roubigné. Fallen as his fortunes are, not the wealth of worlds had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it: To your friendſhip, to your virtue, he is bleſſed in bequeathing it."—"I know its value ſaid the Count, and receive it as the deareſt gift of Heaven and you." He kiſſed my hand with rapture.—</p>

                  <head>LETTER XX. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</head>
                  <p>GIVE me joy, Segarva, give me joy—the lovely JULIA is mine. Let not the torpid conſiderations of prudence, which your laſt letter contained, riſe up to check the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of your friend, or that which his good fortune will beſtow on you. Truſt me, thy fears are groundleſs—didſt thou but know her as I do!—Perhaps I am tenderer that way than uſual; but there were ſome of your fears I felt a bluſh at in reading. Talk not of the looſeneſs of marriage-vows in <hi>France,</hi> nor compare her with thoſe women of it, whoſe heads are giddy with the follies of faſhion, and whoſe hearts are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched by the manners of its votaries. Her virtue was ever above the breath of ſuſpicion, and I dare pledge my life, it will ever continue ſo. But that is not enough; I can feel, as you do, that it is not enough. I know the nobleneſs of her ſoul, the delicacy of her ſentiments. She would not give me her hand except from motives of regard and affection, were I maſter of millions. I rejoice that her own ſituation is ſuch, as infers no ſuſpicion of intereſtedneſs in me; were ſhe
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:017578_0098_0FBA719371AF40E8"/>
not JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ, I would not have wedded her with the world for her dower.</p>
                  <p>You talk of her former reluctance; but I am not young enough to imagine that it is impoſſible for a marriage to be happy without that glow of rapture which lovers have felt and poets deſcribed. Thoſe ſtarts of paſſion are not the baſis for wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded felicity, which wiſdom would chuſe, becauſe they are only the delirium of a month, which poſſeſſion deſtroys, and diſappointment follows. I have perfect confidence in the affection of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, though it is not of that intemperate kind, which ſome brides have ſhewn. Had you ſeen her eyes, how they ſpoke, when her father gave me her hand! there was ſtill a reluctance in them, a reluctance more winning than all the fluſh of conſent could have made her. Modeſty and fear, eſteem and gratitude, darkened and enlightened them by turns; and thoſe tears, thoſe ſilent tears, which they ſhed, gave me a more ſacred bond of her attachment, than it was in the power of words to have formed.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes allowed myſelf to think, or rather I have ſuppoſed you thinking, it might be held an imputation on the purity of her affection, that from an act of generoſity towards her father, (with the circumſtances of which I was under the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:017578_0099_0FBA6F81965360B8"/>
neceſſity of acquainting you in my laſt) her hand became rather a debt of gratitude than a gift of love. But there is a deception in thoſe romantic ſounds, which tell us, that pure affection ſhould be unbiaſſed in its diſpoſal of a lover or a miſtreſs. If they ſay, that affection is a mere involuntary impulſe, neither waiting the deciſions of reaſon, or the diſſuaſives of prudence, do they not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality degrade us to machines, which are blindly actuated by ſome uncontrolable power? If they allow a woman reaſonable motives for her attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what can be ſtronger than thoſe ſentiments which excite her eſteem, and thoſe proofs of them which produce her gratitude?</p>
                  <p>But why do I thus reaſon on my happineſs? I feel no fears, no ſuſpicion of alloy to it; and I will not ſearch for them in abſtract opinion, or in diſtant conjecture.</p>
                  <p>Tueſday next is fixed for the day that is to unite us; the ſhew and ceremony that mingle ſo ill with the feelings of a time like this, our ſituation here renders unneceſſary. A few of thoſe ſimple or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, in which my JULIA meets the gave of the admiring ruſtics around us, are more congenial to her beauty than all the trappings of vanity or magnificence. We propoſe paſſing a week or two
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:017578_0100_0FBA6F838669A1D0"/>
here, before removing to Montauban, where I muſt then carry my wife, to ſhew my people their miſtreſs, and receive that ſort of homage, which I hope I have taught them to pay from the heart. Thoſe relations of my family, who live in that neighbourhood, muſt come and learn to love me better than they did. Methinks I ſhall now be more eaſily pleaſed with them than I formerly was. I know not if it is nobler to deſpiſe inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant people, than to bear with them coolly; but I believe it is much leſs agreeable. The aſperities of our own mind recoil on itſelf. JULIA has ſhewn me the bliſs of loſing them.</p>
                  <p>Could I hope for my Segarva at Montauban?—Much as I doat on my lovely bride, there wants the laſt approval of my ſoul, till he ſmiles on this marriage and bleſſes it. I know, there needs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his coming thither to grant this.—I antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate your anſwer, that now it is impoſſible; but let it be a debt on the future, which <hi>the firſt</hi> of your leiſure is to pay. Meantime believe me happy, and add to my happineſs by telling me of your own.</p>

                  <p>WHY ſhould I teaze you by writing of thoſe little things which teaze me in the doing? They teaze, yet perhaps they are uſeful. At this time, I am afraid of a moment's leiſure to be idle, and am even pleaſed with the happy imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence of Liſette, whoſe joy, on my account, gives her tongue much freedom. I call her often, when I have little occaſion for her ſervice, merely that I may have her protection from ſolitude.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame reaſon, I am ſomehow afraid of writing to you, which is only another ſort of thinking. Do not therefore expect to hear from me again till after Tueſday at ſooneſt.—MARIA! you remember our fancy at ſchool of ſhewing our friendſhip, by ſetting down remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able days of one another's little joys and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.—Set down <hi>Tueſday</hi> next for your JULIA—but leave its property blank.—Fate will fill it up one day!</p>

                     <salute>MADAM,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HOPE my lady and you will both excuſe my writing this, to give you notice of the happy event, which has happened in our family. I made ſo bold as to aſk her if ſhe intended writing to you. "Liſette, (ſaid ſhe) I cannot write, I cannot indeed," So I have taken up the pen, who am a poor unworthy correſpondent; but your ladyſhip's goodneſs has made allowances for me in that way before, and, I hope, will do ſo ſtill.</p>
                  <p>The ceremony was performed yeſterday. I think I never ſaw a more lovely figure than my lady's; ſhe is a ſweet angel at all times, but I wiſh your ladyſhip had ſeen how ſhe looked then. She was dreſſed in a white muſlin night-gown, with ſtriped lilac and white ribbands: Her hair was kept in the looſe way you uſed to make me dreſs it for her at <hi>Belville,</hi> with two waving curls down one ſide of her neck, and a braid of little peals, you made her a preſent of then. And to he ſure, with her dark brown locks reſting upon it, her boſom looked as pure white as the driven
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:017578_0103_0FBA6F8D82592688"/>
ſnow.—And then her eyes, when ſhe gave her hand to the Count! they were caſt half down, and you might ſee her eye-laſhes, like ſtrokes of a pencil, over the white of her ſkin—the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt gentleneſs, with a ſort of a ſadneſs too, as it were, and a gentle heave of her boſom at the ſame time;—O! Madam, you know I have not language, as my lady and you have, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch things; but it made me cry, in truth it did, for very joy and admiration. There was a tear in my maſter's eye too, though I believe two happier hearts were not in <hi>France,</hi> than his and the Count de Montauban's. I am ſure, I pray for bleſſings on all three, with more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I do, than for myſelf.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, it is ſettled that the new married couple ſhall not remain long here, but ſet out in a week or two hence, for the Count's principal ſeat, about ſix leagues diſtant from his houſe in our neighbourhood, which is not large enough for entertaining the friends, whoſe viſits they muſt receive on this joyful occaſion. I fancy Monſ. de Roubigné will be much with them, though, I underſtand, he did not chooſe to accept of the Count's preſſing invitation to live with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and him; but an elderly lady, a relation of my dear miſtreſs that is gone, is to keep houſe for him.</p>

                     <pb n="97" facs="unknown:017578_0104_0FBA6F8F7647B0E0"/>
I muſt break off now, for I hear my lady's bell ring, and your ladyſhip may believe we are all in a ſort of buz here. I dare to ſay, ſhe will not fail to write to you ſoon; but mean time, hoping you will accept of this poor ſcrawling let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mine, I remain, with due reſpect,</p>

                  <p>MY friend will, by this time, be chiding me for want of attention to her; yet, in truth, ſhe has ſeldom been abſent from my thoughts. Were we together but for a ſingle hour, I ſhould have much to tell you; but there is an intricacy in my feelings on this change of ſituation, which, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> as I write to you, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not manage on paper. I can eaſily imagine what you would firſt deſire to know, though perhaps it is the laſt queſtion you would put. The <hi>happineſs</hi> of your JULIA, I know, is ever the warmeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your wiſhes.—Aſk me not, why I cannot anſwer even this directly—Be ſatisfied when I tell you, that I ought to be happy.—Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban has every deſire to make me ſo.—</p>
                  <p>One thing I wiſh to accompliſh towards his peace and mine. The hiſtory of this poor heart I have entruſted only to your memory and my own: I will endeavour, though I know with how much difficulty, henceforth to forget it forever. You muſt aſſiſt me, by holding it a blank, which recollection is no more to full up. I know the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:017578_0106_0FBA6F92B330B898"/>
weakneſs of my ſex; myſelf of that ſex the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: I will not run the riſk of calling up ideas, which were once familiar, and may not now be the leſs dangerous, nor the leſs readily liſtened to, for the pain they have cauſed. My huſband has now a right to every better thought; it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to embitter thoſe hours, which are but half the property of JULIA DE MONTAUBAN, with the remembrance of former ones, which belonged to ſadneſs and JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ.</p>
                  <p>We are on the eve of our departure for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily caſtle of Monſ. de Montauban. My father, whoſe happineſs, at preſent, is a flattering teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as well as a ſupport to my piety, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies us thither, but is ſoon to return home, where our couſin, La Pelliere, whom you may remember having ſeen with my mother in <hi>Paris</hi> is to keep houſe for him. This ſeparation I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help looking to as a calamity; yet, I believe, his reaſons for it are juſt. What a change in a woman's ſituation does this momentous connexion make?—I will think no more of it.—Farewell.</p>
                  <p>Yet a few words, to own my folly at leaſt, if I cannot amend it. I went to aſſort ſome little articles of dreſs for carrying home with me;
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:017578_0107_0FBA700DA377AA88"/>
while I was rummaging out a drawer to find one of them, a little picture of Savillon, drawn for him when a boy, by a painter who was accidentally in our neighbourhood, croſſed me in the way. You cannot eaſily imagine how this circumſtance diſconcerted me. I ſhut the drawer as if it had contained a viper; then opened it again; and again the countenance of Savillon, mild and thoughtful, (for even then it was thoughtful) met my view!—Was it a conſciouſneſs of <hi>guilt</hi> that turned my eye involuntarily to the door of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment?—Can there be any in accidentally thinking of Savillon!—Yet I fear I looked too long, and too impaſſionedly on this minature. It was drawn with ſomething ſorrowful in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and methought it looked then more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful than ever.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion comes ſtrong upon me, how I ſhould like that my huſband had ſeen this.—In truth, MARIA, I fear my keeping this picture is improper; yet at the time it was painted, there was one drawn for me by the ſame hand, and we exchanged reſemblances without any idea of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety. Ye unfeeling decorums of the world!—Yet it is dangerous; is it not, my beſt monitor to think thus?—Yet, were I to return the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would it not look like a ſuſpicion of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?—I will keep it, till you convince me I ſhould not.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXIV. JULIA TO MARIA.</head>
                  <p>MY father was with me this morning, in my chamber, for more than an hour. We ſat, ſometimes ſilent, ſometimes ſpeaking inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſentences, and tears were frequently all the intercourſe we held. Liſette coming in, to acquaint us that Montauban was in the parlour, waiting us, at length put an end to our interview. "JULIA, (ſaid my father) I imagined I had much to ſay to you; but the importance of my thoughts, on your behalf, ſtifles my expreſſion of them. There are moments when I cannot help looking to that ſeparation, which your marriage will make between us, as if it were the loſs of my child; yet I have fortitude enough to reſiſt the impreſſion, and to reflect that ſhe is going to be happy with the worthieſt of men. My inſtruction for your conduct in that ſtate you have juſt entered
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:017578_0109_0FBA7012B0DBC830"/>
into, your own ſentiments, I truſt, would render unneceſſary, were they in no other way ſupplied, but I diſcovered lately in your mother's bureau, a paper which ſtill farther ſuperſedes their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. It contains ſome advices, which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and obſervation had enabled her to give, and her regard for you had prompted her to write down. 'Tis, however, only a fragment, which accident or diffidence of herſelf has prevented her completing; but it is worthy of your ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, and you will read it with more warmth than if it came from a general inſtructor." He left the paper with me; I have read it with the care, with the affection it deſerves; I ſend a copy of it now, as I would every good thing, for the participation of my friend. She cannot read it with the intereſt of a daughter; but ſhe will find it no cold, nor common lecture. It ſpeaks, if I am not too partial to the beſt of mothers, the language of prudence, but not of artifice; it would mend the heart by ſentiment, not cover it with diſſimulation. She, for whoſe uſe it was written, has need of ſuch a monitor, and would liſten to no other; if ſhe has paid any debt to prudence, it was not from the obligation of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but the impulſe of feeling.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:017578_0110_0FBA7013E8691BA8"/>
                  <p>"For my Daughter JULIA.</p>
                  <p>"Before this can reach you, the hand that writes it and the heart that dictates, ſhall be mouldering in the grave. I mean it to ſupply the place of ſome cautions, which I ſhould think it my duty to deliver to you, ſhould I live to ſee you a wife. The precepts it contains, you have often heard me inculcate but I know that general obſervations on a poſſible event, have much leſs force than thoſe which apply to our immediate condition. In the fate of a woman, marriage is the moſt important criſis: It fixes her in a ſtate, of all others the moſt happy, or the moſt wretched; and though mere precept can perhaps do little in any caſe, yet there is a natural propenſity to try its efficacy in all. She who writes this paper, has been long a wife, and a mother; the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one, and the anxiety of the other, prompt her inſtructions; and ſhe has been too happy in both characters to have much doubt of their truth, or fear of their reception.</p>
                  <p>"Sweetneſs of temper, affection to a huſband, and attention to his intereſts, conſtitute the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a wife, and form the baſis of matrimonial felicity. Theſe are indeed the texts, from which every rule for attaining this felicity is drawn. The
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:017578_0111_0FBA70153A6422A8"/>
charms of beauty, and the brilliancy of wit, though they may captivate in the miſtreſs, will not long delight in the wife: They will ſhorten even their own tranſitory reign, if, as I have ſeen in many wives, they ſhine more for the attraction of every body elſe than of their huſbands. Let the pleaſing of that one perſon be a thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abſent from your conduct. If he loves you as you would wiſh he ſhould, he would bleed at heart ſhould he ſuppoſe it for a moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn: If he does not, his pride will ſupply the place of love, and his reſentment that of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
                  <p>"Never conſider a trifle what may tend to pleaſe him. The great articles of duty he will ſet down as his own; but the leſſer attentions he will mark as favours; and truſt me, for I have experienced it, there is no feeling more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to one's-ſelf, than that of turning thoſe little things to ſo precious a uſe.</p>
                  <p>"If you marry a man of a certain ſort, ſuch as the romance of young minds generally paints for a huſband, you will deride the ſuppoſition of any poſſible decreaſe in the ardour of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. But wedlock, even in its happieſt lot, is not exempted from the common fate of all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary bleſſings; there is ever a deluſion in hope
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:017578_0112_0FBA7016C411A428"/>
which cannot abide with poſſeſſion. The rapture of extravagant love will evaporate and waſte; the conduct of the wife muſt ſubſtitute in its room other regards, as delicate, and more laſting. I ſay, the conduct of the wife; for marriage, be a huſband what he may, reverſes the prerogative of ſex; his will expect to be pleaſed, and ours muſt be ſedulous to pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>"This privilege a good natured man may wave. He will feel it, however, due; and third perſons will have penetration enough to ſee, and may have malice enough to remark, the want of it in his wife. He muſt be a huſband unworthy of you, who could bear the degradation of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering this in ſilence. The idea of power on either ſide, ſhould be totally baniſhed from the ſyſtem: It is not ſufficient that the huſband ſhould never have occaſion to regret the want of it; the wife muſt ſo behave, that he may never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of poſſeſſing it.</p>
                  <p>"But my JULIA, if a mother's fondneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives me not, ſtands not much in need of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like theſe. I cannot allow myſelf the idea of her wedding a man, on whom ſhe would not wiſh to be dependent, or whoſe inclinations a temper like hers would deſire to controul. She will be more in danger from that ſoftneſs, that
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:017578_0113_0FBA701B9FD2BE68"/>
ſenſibility of ſoul, which will yield perhaps too much for the happineſs of both. The office of a wife includes the exertion of a friend: A good one muſt frequently ſtrengthen and ſupport that weakneſs, which a bad one would endeavour to overcome. There are ſituations, where it will not be enough to love, to cheriſh, to obey: She muſt teach her huſband to be at peace with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be reconciled to the world, to reſiſt mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, to conquer adverſity.</p>
                  <p>"Alas! my child, I am here an inſtructreſs but too well ſkilled! Theſe tears, with which this paper is ſoiled, fell not in the preſence of your father, though, now, they but trace the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what, then, it was my lot to feel. Think it not impoſſible to reſtrain your feelings, becauſe they are ſtrong. The enthuſiaſm of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will ſometimes overcome diſtreſſes, which the cold heart of prudence had been unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
                  <p>"But <hi>misfortune</hi> is not always <hi>miſery.</hi> I have known this truth; I am proud to believe, that I have ſometimes taught it to Roubigné. Thanks be to that power, whoſe decrees I reverence! He often tempered the anguiſh of our ſufferings, till there was a ſort of luxury in feeling them. Then is the triumph of wedded love!—the tie that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:017578_0114_0FBA701CAA4C6268"/>
binds the happy may be dear; but that which links the unfortunate is tenderneſs unutterable.</p>
                  <p>"There are afflictions leſs eaſy to be endured, which your mother has not experienced: Thoſe which a huſband inflicts, and the beſt wives feel the moſt ſeverely. Theſe, like all our ſharpeſt calamities, the fortitude that can reſiſt, can only cure. Complainings debaſe her who ſuffers, and harden him who aggrieves. Let not a woman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look for their cauſe in the injuſtice of her lord: They may proceed from many trifling errors in her own conduct, which virtue cannot blame, though wiſdom muſt regret. If ſhe makes this diſcovery, let them be amended without a thought, if poſſible, at any rate without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of merit in amending them. In this, and in every other inſtance, it muſt never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the only government allowed on our ſide, is that of gentleneſs and attraction; and that its power, like the fabled influence of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary beings, muſt be inviſible to be complete.</p>
                  <p>"Above all, let a wife beware of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to others any want of duty or tenderneſs, ſhe may think ſhe has perceived in her huſband. This untwiſts, at once, thoſe delicate cords, which preſerve the unity of the marriage-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:017578_0115_0FBA701E3484A420"/>
Its ſacredneſs is broken forever, if third parties are made witneſſes of its failings, or um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of its diſputes. It may ſeem almoſt profane in me to confeſs, that once, when, through the malice of an enemy, I was made, for a ſhort time, to believe, that my Roubigné had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, I durſt not, even in my prayers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven petition for a reſtoration of his love; I prayed to be made a better wife: When I would have ſaid, a more beloved one, my utterance failed me for the word."</p>

                  <p>WE have got to the end of our journey; and I am now the miſtreſs of this manſion. Our journey was too ſhort and too ſlow; I wiſhed for ſome mechanical relief from my feelings in the rapidity of a poſt-chaiſe; our progreſs was too ſtately to be expeditious, and we reached not this place, though but ſix leagues diſtant, till the evening.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I have ſuffered a good deal; but my heart is not callous yet; elſe wherefore was it wrung ſo, at leaving my father's peaceful retreat;
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:017578_0116_0FBA7022AF843AF8"/>
I did not truſt myſelf with looking back; but I was too well acquainted with the objects, not to recollect every tree from the ſide window as we paſſed. A little ragged boy, who keeps ſome ſheep of my father's opened the gate for us at the end of the furthermoſt incloſure; he pulled off his hat, which he had adorned with ſome gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured ribands in honour of the occaſion; Montauban threw money into it, and the boy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us, for ſome time, with a number of bleſſings. When he turned back, methought I envied him his return. The full picture of the place we had left, roſe before me; it needed all my reſolution, and all my fears of offending, to prevent my weeping outright. At our dinner on the road, I was very buſy, and affected to be very much pleaſed; La Peiliere was a lucky com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for me; you know how full ſhe is of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation on trifles. When we approached the houſe, ſhe ſpoke of every thing, and praiſed every thing; I had nothing to do but to aſſent.</p>
                  <p>We entered between two rows of lime-trees, at the end of which is the gate of the houſe, wide and rudely magnificent; its large leaves were opened to receive us by an old but freſh-looking ſervant, who ſeemed too honeſt to be polite, and did not ſhew me quite ſo much curteſy as ſome
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:017578_0117_0FBA70242A4A10A8"/>
miſtreſſes would have expected. All theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances however were in a ſtile, which my friend has heard me commend; yet was I weak enough, not perfectly to reliſh them when they happened to myſelf. There was a preſaging gloom about this manſion which filled my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with terror; and when Montauban's old domeſtic opened the coach-door, I looked upon him as a criminal might do on the meſſenger of death, My dreams ever ſince have been full of horror; and while I write theſe lines, the creaking of the pendulum of the great clock in the hall, ſounds like the knell of your devoted JULIA.</p>
                  <p>I expect you to rally me on my ideal terrors. You may remember, when we uſed to ſteal a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night hour's converſation together, you would laugh at my foreboding of a ſhort period to my life, and often jeeringly tell me, I was born to be a great-grandmother in my time. I know the fooliſhneſs of this impreſſion, though I have not yet been able to conquer it. But to me it is not the ſource of diſquiet; I never feel more poſſeſſed of myſelf than at thoſe moments when I indulge it the moſt. Why ſhould "I wiſh for long life? Why ſhould ſo many wiſh for it? Did we ſit down to number the calamities of this world; did we think how many wretches there are of diſeaſe, of poverty, of oppreſſion, of vice, (alas! I fear

                  <p>MY readers will eaſily perceive ſomething particular, in the place where the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letters of <hi>Savillon</hi> are found, as they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly of a date conſiderably prior to many of the preceding. They came to my hands, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in the manner I have now publiſhed them, probably from a view in my young friend, who had the charge of their arrangement, of keeping the correſpondence of JULIA, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the great train of her feelings on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects contained in them, as much undivided as poſſible. While I conjectured this reaſon for their preſent order, I was aware of ſome advantage, which theſe papers, as relating a ſtory, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from an alteration in that particular; but, after balancing thoſe different conſiderations, without coming to any deciſion, my indolence,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:017578_0121_0FBA702EA427E7B8"/>
perhaps (a ſtronger motive with moſt men than they are diſpoſed to allow) at length prevailed, and I reſolved to give them to the public in the order they were tranſmitted to me from <hi>France.</hi> Many of the particulars they recount are antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by a peruſal of the foregoing letters; but it is not ſo much on ſtory, as ſentiment, that their intereſt with the reader muſt depend.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXVI. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</head>
                  <p>AFTER a very unfavourable paſſage, we are at laſt arrived at our deſtined port. A ſhip is lying along-ſide of us, ready to fail for <hi>France,</hi> and every one on board, who can write, is now writing to ſome relation or friend the hardſhips of his voyage, and the period of his arrival. How few has Savillon to greet with ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings! to Roubigné I have already written; to Beauvaris I am now writing; and when I have excepted theſe, there is not in <hi>France</hi> a ſingle man, to whom I am entitled to write. Yet I mean not to claſs them together: To Roubigné
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017578_0123_0FBA70329FE67548"/>
I owe the tribute of eſteem, the debt of gratitude; for you I feel ſomething tenderer than either. Roubigné has been the guide, the father of my youth, and him I reverence as a parent: You have been the friend, the brother, of my ſoul, and with yours it mingles as with a part of itſelf.</p>
                  <p>You remember the circumſtances of our parting. You would not bid me adieu till the ſhip was getting under way: I believe you judged aright, if you meant to ſpare us both: The buſtle of the ſcene, the rattling of the ſails, the noiſe of the ſailors, had a mechanical effect on the mind, and ſtifled thoſe tender feelings, which we indulge in ſolitude and ſilence. When I went to bed, I had time to indulge them. I found it vain to attempt ſleeping, and ſcarcely wiſhed to ſucceed in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it. About midnight I aroſe, and went upon deck. The wind had been fair all day, and we were then, I ſuppoſe, more than thirty leagues from the ſhore. I looked on the arch of Heaven, where the moon purſued her courſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded; and my ear caught no ſound, except the ſtilly noiſe of the ſea around me. I thought of my diſtance from <hi>France</hi> as of ſome illuſive dream, and could not believe, without an effort, that it was not four and twenty hours ſince we parted. I recollected a thouſand things which I
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017578_0124_0FBA7033E6DA3A60"/>
ſhould have ſaid to you, and ſpoke them, involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily in the ear of night.</p>
                  <p>There was, my friend, there was one thing, which I meant to have told you at parting. Had you ſtaid a few moments longer in the room after the ſeamen called us, I ſhould have ſpoken it then; but you ſhunned being alone with me, and I could not command even words enough to tell you, that I wiſhed to ſpeak to you in private Hear it now, and pity your Savillon.</p>
                  <p>JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ!—Did you feel that name as I do!—Even traced with my own pen, what throbbing remembrances has it raiſed!—You are acquainted with my obligations to her father: You have heard me ſometimes talk of her; but you know not, for I tremble to tell you, the power ſhe has acquired over the heart of your friend.</p>
                  <p>The fate of my father, as well as mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, made Roubigné his friend; for this laſt is of a temper formed rather to delight in the pride of aſſiſting unfortunate worth, than in the joy of knowing it in a better ſituation. After the death of my father, I became the ward of his friend's generoſity: A ſtate I ſhould have brooked ill, had not JULIA been his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017578_0125_0FBA70385F3B21E8"/>
From thoſe early days, when firſt I knew her, I remember her friendſhip as making part of my exiſtence: Without her, pleaſure was vapid, and ſorrow, in her ſociety, was changed into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. At that time of life, the mind has little reſerve. We meant but friendſhip, and called it ſo without alarm. The love, to which at length I diſcovered my heart to be ſubject, had conquered without tumult, and become deſpotic under the ſemblance of freedom.</p>
                  <p>The misfortunes of her family firſt ſhewed me how I loved.—When her father told them the ruined ſtate of his fortune, when he prepared them for leaving the now alienated ſeat of his anceſtors, I was a ſpectator of the ſcene. When I ſaw the old man, with indignant pride, ſtifling the anguiſh of his heart, and pointing to the chaiſe that was to carry them from <hi>Belville,</hi> his wife, with one hand claſping her huſband's, the other laid on her boſom, turning up to Heaven a look of reſignation; his daughter, ſtriving to check her tears, kneeling before him, and vowing her duty to his misfortunes; then did I firſt curſe my poverty, which prevented me from throwing myſelf at her feet, and bidding her parents be happy with their JULIA!—The luxury of the idea ſtill ruſhes on my mind!—to heal the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of my father's friend; to juſtify the ways
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017578_0126_0FBA703970642348"/>
of Heaven to his ſaint-like wife; to wipe the tears from the eyes of his angel daughter!—Beauvaris, our Philoſophy is falſe: Power and wealth are the choiceſt gifts of Heaven: To poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them indeed, is nothing, but thus to uſe them, is rapture!</p>
                  <p>I had them not thus to uſe; but what I could, I did. I attended his family to that antient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was now the ſole property of the once opulent Roubigné. With unwearied attention I ſoothed his ſorrows, and humbled myſelf before his misfortunes, as much as I had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted dependence on his proſperity.</p>
                  <p>He felt the aſſiduity of my friendſhip, and I ſaw him grateful for its exertion; yet would the idea of being obliged, often rankle in his mind; and I have ſeen him frequently look at me with an appearance of anger, when he thought I was conſcious of obliging him.</p>
                  <p>Far different was the gentle nature of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. She thanked me with unfeigned gratitude for my ſervices to her father, and ſeemed ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to compenſate with her ſmiles, for that wan of acknowledgment ſhe obſerved in him.</p>
                  <p>Had my heart been free before, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to preſerve its freedom now. A ſpectator of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017578_0127_0FBA703AAF59A888"/>
all thoſe excellencies which, though ſhe ever poſſeſſed, her preſent ſituation alone could give full room to exert; all that ſublimity of mind, which bore adverſity unmoved; all that gentleneſs, which contrived to lighten it to her father, and ſmooth the rankling of his haughty ſoul! I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the election I had made, and looked on my love as a virtue.</p>
                  <p>Yet there were moments of anxiety, in which I feared the conſequences of indulging this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. My own ſituation, the ſituation of JULIA, the pride of her father, the pride which it was proper for herſelf to feel: All theſe were preſent to my view, and ſhewed me how little I could build on hope; yet it cheated me, I know not how, and I dreamed from day to day, of bleſſings, which every day's reflection told me were not to be looked for.</p>
                  <p>There was, indeed ſomething in the ſcene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us, formed to create thoſe romantic il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions. The retreat of Roubigné is a venerable pile, the remains of ancient Gothic magnificence, and the grounds adjoining to it are in that ſtile of melancholy grandeur, which marks the dwellings of our forefathers. One part of that ſmall eſtate, which is ſtill the appendage of this once-reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manſion, is a wild and rocky dell, where taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017578_0128_0FBA703E5E696298"/>
wealth has never warred on nature, nor even elegance refined or embelliſhed her beauties. The walks are only worn by the tread of the ſhepherds, and the banks only ſmoothed by the feeding of their ſtocks. There, too dangerous ſociety! have I paſſed whole days with JULIA: There, more dangerous ſtill! have I paſſed whole days in thinking of her.</p>
                  <p>A circumſtance, trifling in itſelf, added not a little to the faſcination of the reſt. The ſame good woman who nurſed me was alſo the nurſe of JULIA. She was too fond of her foſter-daughter, and too well treated by her, ever to leave the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of her family. To this reſidence ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them when they left <hi>Belville,</hi> and here too, as at that place, had a ſmall houſe and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den allotted her. It was ſituated at the extreme verge of that dell I have deſcribed, and was often the end of thoſe walks we took through it together. The good Laſune, for that is our nurſe's name, conſidered us her children, and treated us, in thoſe viſits to her little dwelling, with that ſimplicity of affection, which has the moſt powerful effect on hearts of ſenſibility. Oh! Beauvaris! methinks I ſee the figure of Laſune, at this moment, pointing out to your friend, with rapture in her countenance, the beauties of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017578_0129_0FBA703FB45A7740"/>
her lovely daughter! She places our ſeats to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſhe produces her ſhining platters, with fruit and milk, for our repaſt; ſhe preſſes the ſmiling JULIA, and will not be denied by Savil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon!—Am I then a thouſand leagues diſtant?</p>
                  <p>Does JULIA remember Savillon?—Should I hope that ſhe does? My friend, I will confeſs my weakneſs; perhaps, it is worſe than weakneſs; I have wiſhed—I have hoped, that I am not indifferent to her. Often have I been on the point of unloading my throbbing heart, of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her how paſſionately I loved, of aſking her forgiveneſs for my preſumption. I have thought, perhaps, it was vanity, that at ſome ſeaſons ſhe might have anſwered and bleſſed me; but I ſaw the conſequences which would follow to both, and had fortitude enough to reſiſt the impulſe.—A time may come, when better fortune ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title me to ſpeak; when the pride of Roubigné may not bluſh to look on Savillon as his ſon.</p>
                  <p>But this is the language of viſionary hope! In the mean time, I am torn from her, from <hi>France,</hi> from every connection my heart had formed; caſt, like a ſhip wrecked thing, on the other ſide of the Atlantic, amidſt a deſert, of all others, the moſt dreadful, the deſert of ſociety, with which no ſocial tie unites me! Where now are Roubigné's
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017578_0130_0FBA7040B1997E98"/>
little copſes, where his winding walks, his name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rivulets? Where the ivy'd gate of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable dwelling, the Gothic windows of his echoing hall?—That morning, on which I ſet out for <hi>Paris,</hi> is ſtill freſh on my memory. I could not bear the formality of parting, and ſtole from his houſe by day-break. As I paſſed that hall, the door was open; I entered to take one laſt look, and bid it adieu! I had ſat in it with JULIA the night before; the chairs we had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied were ſtill in their places; you know not, my friend, what I felt at the ſight: There was ſomething in the ſilent attitude of thoſe very chairs, that wrung my heart beyond the power of language; and I believe, the ſervant had told me that my horſes waited, five or ſix times over, before I could liſten to what he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman has ſent to aſk, if my name is Savillon: If it is, he deſires his compliments, and will do himſelf the pleaſure of waiting of me. I ſtarted to hear my name thus aſked for in <hi>Martinique.</hi>

This gentleman is a ſea-captain, a particular acquaintance of my uncle: He is more, Beauvaris he is an acquaintance of Roubigné, has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at <hi>Belville,</hi> has ſometimes ſeen my JULIA,—We are intimate already, and he has offered to conduct me to my uncle's houſe: His horſes, he ſays, are in waiting.</p>
                  <p>Adieu, my deareſt friend! think of me often; write to me often; though you ſhould ſeldom have an opportunity of conveying letters, yet write as if you had; make a journal of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and let it come when it may. Tell me every thing, though I ſhould aſk nothing. Your letters muſt give me back my country, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a trifle that belongs to her.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXVII. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</head>
                  <p>IT is now a week ſince I reached my uncle's, during all which time I have been ſo much occupied in anſwering queſtions to the curioſity of others, or aſking queſtions for the ſatisfaction of my own, that I have ſcarce had a moment left for any other employment.</p>
                  <p>I have now ſeized the opportunity of the reſt of the family being ſtill a-bed, to write to you on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this uncle, of him under whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection I am to riſe into life, under whoſe guidance I am to thrid the mazes of the world. I fear I am unfit for the taſk: I muſt unlearn feelings in which I have long been accuſtomed to delight: I muſt accommodate ſentiment to conveniency, pride to intereſt, and ſometimes even virtue itſelf to faſhion.</p>
                  <p>But is all this abſolutely neceſſary?—I hate to believe it. I have been frequently told ſo indeed, but my authorities are drawn either from men who have never entered the ſcene at all, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017578_0133_0FBA704950560D78"/>
it, reſolved to be overcome, without the trouble of reſiſtance. To think too meanly of mankind is dangerous to our reverence of virtue.</p>
                  <p>It is ſuppoſed, that in theſe wealthy iſlands, profit is the only medium of opinion, and that morality has nothing to do in the ſyſtem; but I cannot eaſily imagine that, in any latitude, the boſom is ſhut to thoſe pleaſures which reſult from the exerciſe of goodneſs, or that honeſty ſhould be always ſo unſucceſsful as to have the ſneer of the million againſt it. Men will not be depraved beyond the perſuaſion of ſome motive, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt will often be the parent of ſocial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
                  <p>My uncle is better fitted for judging of this queſtion; he is cool enough to judge of it from experience, without being miſled by feeling.—He believes there are many more honeſt dealings than honeſt men, but that there are more honeſt men than knaves every where; that common ſenſe will keep them ſo, even excluſive of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; but that all may be vanquiſhed by adequate temptation.</p>
                  <p>With a competent ſhare of plain uſeful parts, and a certain ſteady application of mind, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into commerce at an early period of life.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017578_0134_0FBA704A660A7EB0"/>
Not apt to be ſeduced by the glare of great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent advantage, nor eaſily intimidated from his purpoſes by accidental diſappointment, he has held on, with ſome viciſſitude of fortune, but with uniform equality of temper, till, in virtue of his abilities, his diligence and his obſervation, he has acquired very conſiderable wealth. He ſtill, however, continues the labour of the race, though he has already reached the goal; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is covetous of greater riches, but becauſe the induſtry, by which greater riches are acquired, is grown neceſſary to his enjoyment of life. "I have been long, ſaid he yeſterday, a very happy man; having has a little leſs time, and a little more money, than I know what to make of."</p>
                  <p>The opinion of the world he truſts but little, in his judgment of others; of men's actions he ſpeaks with caution, either in praiſe or blame, and is commonly moſt ſceptical, when thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him are moſt convinced: For it is a maxim with him, in queſtions of character, to doubt a ſtrong evidence, from the very circumſtances of its ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>With regard to himſelf, however, he accepts of the common opinion, as a ſort of coin, which paſſes current, though it is not always real, and often ſeems to yield up the conviction of his own
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017578_0135_0FBA704ED7E33FE8"/>
mind in compliance to the general voice. Ever averſe to ſplendid project in action or ſplendid conjecture in argument, he contents himſelf with walking in the beaten track of things, and does not even venture to leave it, though he may, now and then, obſerve it making ſmall deviations from reaſon and juſtice. He has ſometimes, ſince our acquaintance began, tapped me on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the midſt of ſome ſentiment I was uttering, and told me with a ſmile, that theſe were fine words, and did very well in the mouth of a young man. Yet he ſeems not diſpleaſed with my feeling what himſelf does not feel; and looks on me with the more favourable eye, that I have ſomething about me for experience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to prune.</p>
                  <p>His plan of domeſtic economy is regular, but nobody is diſturbed by its regularity; for he is perfectly free from that rigid attention to method, which one frequently ſees in the houſes of old batchelors. He has ſenſe, or <hi>ſang froid</hi> enough, not to be troubled with little diſarrangements, and bears, with wonderful complacency, and conſequently with great eaſe to gueſts, thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which diſturb the peace of other entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Since my arrival we have had every day ſomething like a feaſt, probably from a ſort of compliment which his friends meant to pay to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017578_0136_0FBA704FFAFE4798"/>
him and to me; but at his table, in its moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſtyle, the government is nearly republican; he aſſumes very little, either of the trouble, or the dignity of a landlord, ſatisfied with giving a general aſſurance of welcome and good-humour in his aſpect.</p>
                  <p>At one of thoſe dinners was a neighbour and intimate acquaintance of my uncle, a Mr. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, with his wife and daughter. The young lady was ſeated next me, and my uncle ſeemed to incline that I ſhould be particularly pleaſed with her. He addreſſed ſuch diſcourſe to her as might draw her forth to the greateſt advantage; and, as he had heard me profeſs myſelf as lover of muſic, he made her ſing, after dinner, till, I believe, ſome of the company began to be tired of their entertainment. After they were gone, he aſked my opinion of Mademoiſelle Dorville, in that particular ſtyle by which a man gives you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that his own is a very favourable one. To ſay truth, the lady's appearance is in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but there is a jealous ſort of feeling, which ariſes in my mind, when I hear the praiſes of any woman but one; and, from that cauſe perhaps, I anſwered my uncle rather coldly. I ſaw he thought ſo, from the reply he made; I offered ſome awkward apology; he ſmiled, and ſaid, I
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017578_0137_0FBA70514D0A2280"/>
was a philoſopher. Alas! he knows not how little claim I have to philoſophy in that way; if, indeed, we are ſo often to profane that word, by affixing to it the idea of inſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>To-day I begin buſineſs. My uncle and I are to view his different plantations, and he is to ſhew me, in general, the province he means to allot me. I wiſh for an opportunity to be aſſiduous in his ſervice: Till I can do ſomething on my part, his favours are debts upon me. It is only to a friend, like my Beauvaris, that one feels a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in being obliged.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXVIII. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</head>
                  <p>A THOUSAND thanks for your laſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When you know how much I enjoyed the unwieldy appearance of the packet, with my friend's hand on the back of it, you will not grudge the time it coſt you. It is juſt ſuch as I wiſhed: Your ſcene-painting is delightful. No man is more ſuſceptible of local attachments than I; and, with the Atlantic between, there is not a ſtone in <hi>France,</hi> which I can remember with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.</p>
                  <p>Yet I am happier here than I could venture to expect. Had I been left to my own choice, I ſhould probably have ſat down in ſolitude, to think of the paſt, and enjoy my reflections; but I have been forced to do better. There is an active duty, which rewards every man in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and my uncle has ſo contrived mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I have had very little time unemployed. He has been liberal of inſtruction, and, I hope, has found me willing to be inſtructed. Our <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

circumſtances, which experience alone can teach us. In certain departments, however, I have tried projects of my own: Some of them have failed in the end, but all gave me pleaſure in the purſuit. In one I have been ſucceſsful beyond expectation; and in that one I was the moſt deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſted, becauſe it touched the cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                  <p>To a man not callous from habit, the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the negroes, in the plantations here, is ſhocking. I felt it ſtrongly, and could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear expreſſing my ſentiments to my uncle. He allowed them to be natural, but pleaded neceſſity, in juſtification of thoſe ſeverities, which his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers ſometimes uſed towards his ſlaves. I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to doubt this propoſition, and begged he would ſuffer me to try a different mode of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in one plantation, the produce of which he had already allotted to my management. He conſented, though with the belief that I ſhould ſucceed very ill in the experiment.</p>
                  <p>I began by endeavouring to ingratiate myſelf with ſuch of the ſlaves as could beſt ſpeak the language of my country; but I found this was a manner they did not underſtand, and that, from a white, the appearance of indulgence carried the ſuſpicion of treachery. Moſt of them, to whom
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017578_0140_0FBA7058A9FCF660"/>
ſuffered it to drop to its former poſture. "Can this man have been a prince in Africa?" ſaid I to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—I reflected for a moment.—"Yet what ſhould he now do, if he has?—Juſt what I ſee him do. I have ſeen a depoſed-ſovereign at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> but in Europe, kings are artificial beings, like their ſubjects.—Silence is the only throne which adverſity has left to princes."</p>
                  <p>"I fear, (ſaid I to him) you have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times treated <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> by the overſeen; but you ſhall be treated ſo no more: I wiſh all my people to be happy." He looked on me now for the firſt time.—"Can you ſpeak my language, or ſhall I call for ſome of your friends who can explain what you would ſay to me?—"I ſpeak no ſay to you," he replied in his broken French.—"And you will not be my friend?"—"No."—"Even if I ſhould deſerve it."—"You a white man."—I felt the rebuke as I ought.—"But all white men are not overſeers. What ſhall I do to make you think me a good man?—Uſe men goodly."—I mean to do ſo, and you among the firſt, Yambu."—"Be good for Yambu's people; do your pleaſe with Yambu."</p>
                  <p>Juſt then the bell rung as a ſummons for the negroes to go to work: He made a few ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017578_0141_0FBA705A25CD3F00"/>
the door. "Would you now go to work (ſaid I) if you were at liberty to avoid it?—"You make go for whip, and no man love go."—"I will go along with you, though I am not obliged; for I chuſe to work ſometimes, rather than be idle."—"Chuſe work, no work at all, ſaid Yambu.—'Twas the very principle on which my ſyſtem was founded.</p>
                  <p>I took him with me into the houſe when our taſk was over. "I wrought chuſe-work (ſaid I) Yambu, yet I did leſs than you?"—"Yambu do chuſe-work then too?"—You ſhall do ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, anſwered I: From this moment you are mine no more!"—"You ſell me other white men then? No, you are free, and may do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pleaſe!—Yambu's pleaſe no here, no this country?" he replied, waving his hand, and looking wiſtfully towards the ſea.—"I can not give you back your country, Yambu; but I can make this one better for you. You can make it better for me too, and for your people!"—"Speak Yambu that (ſaid he eagerly) and be good man!"—"You would not (ſaid I) make your people work by the whip, as you ſee the overſeers do?"—"Oh! no, no whip!"—Yet they muſt work, elſe we ſhall have no ſugars to buy them meat and clothing with,"—(He put his hand to his brow, as if I had ſtarted
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017578_0142_0FBA705E67BB5748"/>
a difficulty he was unable to overcome.)—"Then you ſhall have the command of them, and they ſhall work chuſe-work for Yambu,"—He looked aſkance, as if he doubted the truth of what I ſaid; I called the negroe with whom I had the firſt converſation about him, and pointing to Yambu, "Your maſter (ſaid I) is now free, and may leave you when he pleaſes!"—Yambu no leave you," ſaid he to the negroe warmly.—"But he may accompany Yambu if he chuſes."—Yambu ſhook his head.—"Maſter, (ſaid his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſubject) where we go? leave good white man, and go to bad; for much bad white men in this country."—Then if you think it better, you ſhall both ſtay; Yambu ſhall be my friend and help me to raiſe ſugars for the good of us all: You ſhall have no overſeer but Yambu, and ſhall work no more than he bids you?—The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe fell at my feet and kiſſed them: Yambu ſtood ſilent and I ſaw a tear on his cheek.—"This man has been a prince in Africa!" ſaid I to myſelf.</p>
                  <p>I did not mean to deceive them. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I called thoſe negroes who had formerly been in his ſervice together, and told them that, while they continued in the plantation, Yambu was to ſuperintend their work; that, if they choſe to leave him and me, they were at liberty to go;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017578_0143_0FBA705F679433C0"/>
and that, if found idle or unworthy, they ſhould not be allowed to ſtay. He has, accordingly, ever ſince had the command of his former ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſuperintended their work in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar quarter of the plantation; and, having been declared free, according to the mode preſcribed by the laws of the iſland, has a certain portion of ground allotted him, the produce of which is his property. I have had the ſatisfaction of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thoſe men under the feeling of good treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the idea of liberty, do more than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt double their number ſubject to the whip of an overſeer. I am under no apprehenſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion or mutiny; they work with the willingneſs of freedom, yet are mine with more than the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>I have been often tempted to doubt whether there is not an error in the whole plan to negro ſervitude, and whether whites, or creoles born in the Weſt-Indies, or perhaps cattle, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of European huſbandry, would not do the buſineſs better and cheaper than the ſlaves do. The money which the latter coſt at firſt, the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (often owing to deſpondency of mind) to which they are liable after their arrival, and the proportion that die in conſequence of it, make the machine, if it may be ſo called, of a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation extremely expenſive in its operations. In
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017578_0144_0FBA7060E3A48EB8"/>
the liſt of ſlaves belonging to a wealthy planter, it would aſtoniſh you to ſee the number unfit for ſervice, pining under diſeaſe, a burden on their maſter.—I am talking only as a merchant: But as a man—good Heavens! when I think of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of my fellow creatures groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſervitude and miſery!—Great God! haſt thou peopled thoſe regions of thy world for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of caſting out their inhabitants to chains and torture?—No; thou gaveſt them a land teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with good things, and lighted'ſt up thy ſun to bring forth ſpontaneous plenty; but the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of man, ever at war with thy works, have changed this ſcene of profuſion and luxuriance, into a theatre of repine, of ſlavery and of murder.</p>
                  <p>Forgive the warmth of this apoſtrophe: Here it would not be underſtood; even my uncle, whoſe heart is far from a hard one, would ſmile at my romance, and tell me that things muſt be ſo. Habit, the tyrant of nature and of reaſon, is deaf to the voice of either; here ſhe ſtifles huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and debaſes the ſpecies—for the maſter of ſlaves has ſeldom the ſoul of a man.</p>
                  <p>This is not difficult to be accounted for; from his infancy he is made callous to thoſe feelings, which ſoften at once and ennoble our nature. Children muſt of neceſſity firſt exert thoſe towards
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017578_0145_0FBA706568F3D360"/>
domeſtics, becauſe the ſociety of domeſtics is the firſt they enjoy; here they are taught to command for the ſake of commanding, to beat and torture for pure amuſement;—their reaſon and good nature improve as may be expected.</p>
                  <p>Among the legends of a European nurſery, are ſtories of captives delivered, of ſlaves releaſed who had pined for years in the durance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful enemies. Could we ſuppoſe its infant audience tranſported to the ſea-ſhore where a ſhip laden with ſlaves is juſt landing; the queſtion would be univerſal, "Who ſhall ſet theſe poor people free?"—The young Weſt-Indian aſks his father to buy as boy for him, that he may have ſomething to vent his ſpite on when he is peeviſh.</p>
                  <p>Methinks too, theſe people loſe a ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which is of more importance in life than moſt of the relationſhips we enjoy. The antient, the tried domeſtic of a family, is one of its moſt uſeful members, one of its moſt aſſured ſupports. My friend, the ill-fated Roubigné, has not one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation who has ſtood by him in the ſhipwreck of his fortunes; but the ſtorm could not ſever from their maſter his faithful Le Blanc, or the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Laſune.</p>

                  <p>SINCE the date of my laſt is a longer period than you allow between my letters; but my time has been more than commonly occupied of late. Among other employments was that of acquiring a friend. Be not however, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: My heart cannot own a ſecond in the ſame degree with Beauvaris; yet is this one above the level of ordinary men. He enjoys alſo that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017578_0147_0FBA7067A370AD78"/>
which misfortune beſtows on the virtuous.</p>
                  <p>Among thoſe, with whom my uncle's extenſive dealings have connected him, he had mentioned with particular commendation, one Herbert, an Engliſhman, a merchant in one of the Britiſh Weſt-India Iſlands. Chance brought him lately to <hi>Martinique,</hi> and I was ſolicitous to ſhew every poſſible civility to one, who, to the claim of a ſtranger, added the character of a worthy and amiable man. Prepoſſeſſed as I was in his favour, my expectations fell ſhort of the reality. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in him a delicacy and fineneſs of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſomething beyond the education of a trader muſt have inſpired; and I looked on him perhaps with the greater reverence, from the circumſtance of having found him in a ſtation where I did not expect he would be found. On a cloſer inveſtigation, I preceived tincture of melancholy enthuſiaſm, in his mind, which, I was perſuaded, was not altogether owing to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character, but muſt have ariſen from ſome particular cauſe. This increaſed my regard for him; and I could not help expreſſing it in the very ſtyle which was ſuited to its object, a quiet and ſtill attention, ſympathetic but not intruſive. He ſeemed to take notice of my behaviour, and looked as if he had found a perſon, who gueſſed him to be unhappy, and to whom he could talk
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017578_0148_0FBA70692706B900"/>
of his unhappineſs. I encouraged the idea with that diffidence, which I believe, is of all manners the moſt intimate with a mind of the ſort I have deſcribed; and, ſoon after, he took an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of telling me the ſtory of his misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>It was ſimple, but not the leſs pathetic. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting a conſiderable fortune from his father, he ſet out in trade with every advantage. Soon after he was ſettled in buſineſs, he married a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and excellent woman, for whom, from his infancy, he had conceived the tendereſt attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, about a year after their marriage, ſhe bleſſed him with a ſon. But love and fortune did not long continue to ſmile upon him. Loſſes in trade, to which, though benevolence like his be more expoſed, the moſt prudent and unfeeling are liable, reduced him, from his former affluence, to very embarraſſed circumſtances; and his diſtreſs was aggravated from the conſideration, that he did not ſuffer alone, but communicated misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to a woman he paſſionately loved. Some very conſiderable debts remained due to him in the Weſt-Indies, and he found it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for their recovery, to repair thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, however terrible might be a ſeparation from his wife, now in a ſituation of all others the moſt ſuſceptible. They parted, and ſhe was, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017578_0149_0FBA706E293CB788"/>
delivered of a girl, whoſe promiſing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as well as that of her brother, was ſome conſolation for the abſence of their father.</p>
                  <p>His abſence, though cruel, was neceſſary and he found his affairs in ſuch a ſituation, that it promiſed not to be long. Day after day, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, elapſed, without their final ſettlement. The impatience both of his wife and him was increaſed, by the appearance of a concluſion, which ſo repeatedly diſappointed them; till, at laſt he ventured to ſuggeſt, and ſhe warmly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, the expedient of coming out to a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whoſe circumſtances prevented him from meeting her at home. She ſet ſail with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but wife nor children ever reached the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Herbert! They periſhed in a ſtorm ſoon after their departure from England.</p>
                  <p>You can judge of the feelings of a man, who upbraided himſelf as their murderer. An inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of madneſs, he informed me, ſucceeded the account he received of their death. When his reaſon returned, it ſettled into a melancholy, which time has ſoothed, not extinguiſhed, which indeed ſeems to have become the habitual tone of his mind. Yet is it gentle, though deep, in its effects; it diſturbs not the circle of ſociety around him, and few, except ſuch as are formed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017578_0150_0FBA706FED4CFC20"/>
and to pity it, obſerve any thing peculiar in his behaviour. But he holds it not the leſs ſacred to himſelf; and often retires from the company of thoſe, whom he has entertained with the good humour of a well-bred man, to arrange the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of his much loved Emily, and call up the ſad remembrance of his former joys.</p>
                  <p>Having acquired a ſort of privilege with his diſtreſs, from my acquaintance with its cauſe, I entered his room yeſterday, when he had thus ſhut out the world, and found him with ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the table before him, on which he looked, with a tear, not of anguiſh, but of tenderneſs. I ſtopped ſhort on perceiving him thus employed; he ſeemed unable to ſpeak, but making a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if he deſired that I ſhould come forward, put two of thoſe letters ſucceſſively into my hand. They were written by his wife: The firſt, ſoon after their marriage. When ſome buſineſs had called him away from her into the country; and the ſecond, addreſſed to him in the Weſt-Indies, where, by that time, their ill-fortune had driven him. They pleaſed me ſo much, that I aſked his leave to keep them for a day or two. He would not abſolutely refuſe me; but ſaid they had never been out of his poſſeſſion. I preſſed him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I could only read them over repeatedly, and ſome parts, that ſtruck moſt forcibly on my
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017578_0151_0FBA7071927DE300"/>
memory, which you know is pretty tenacious, I can recollect almoſt <hi>verbatim.</hi> To another, it might ſeem odd to write ſuch things as theſe; but my Beauvaris is never inattentive to the language of nature, or the voice of misfortune.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt letter were the following expreſſions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>You know not what feelings are here, at thus, for the firſt time, writing to my Henry under the name of a huſband.—A mixture of tenderneſs, of love, of eſteem, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. A ſomething, never experienced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is ſo warm in my heart, that ſure it is, at this moment, more worthy of his love than ever.—Shall not this laſt, my Harry, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what I have heard from the ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers among you men?

It is not a tumultuous tranſport, that muſt ſuddenly diſappear; but the ſoft, ſtill pleaſure of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py mind, that can feel its happineſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in its cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I have had little company ſince you left me, and I wiſh not for much. The idea of my Henry is my beſt companion. I have figured out your journey, your company, and your buſineſs, and filled up my hours with the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of what they are to you.</p>

The poor fellow looked ſo happy—"My maſter will ſoon return," ſaid he, by way of accounting for my puny dinner. He ſet the wine upon the table: I filled out half a glaſs, and began to think of you; but, in carrying it to my lips, I reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf that it was not a bumper: That was remedied as it ſhould be. John, I believe, gueſſed at the correction.—"God bleſs him!" I heard him ſay, muttering as he put up the things in his baſket.—I ſent him down with the reſt of the bottle, and they are now drinking your health in the Kitchen.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017578_0153_0FBA7076BA432D28"/>
the luxury of making up a cap to pleaſe the huſband one loves.—This is all very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh: Is it not? But I love to tell you thoſe trifles: It is like having you here. If you can, write me juſt ſuch a letter about you.</p>

                     <p>Captain Lewſon has juſt now been with me, but has brought no letter; and gives for reaſon, your having written by a ſhip that left the iſland but a few days before him, meaning the Triton, by which I got your laſt; but I beg to hear from you by every opportunity, eſpecially by ſo friendly a hand as Lewſon; it would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear a man, to whom I have reaſon to be grateful, much more to me, that he brought a few lines from you. Think, my deareſt Harry, that hearing from you is all that your Emily has now to expect, at leaſt for a long, long time.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps, (as you ſometimes told me, in former days, when, alas! we only talked of misfortunes) we always think our preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity

the bittereſt; yet, methinks, our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is the only evil, for which I could not have found a comfort. In truth, we were not unhappy: Health and ſtrength were left us: We could have done much for one another, and for our dear little ones. I fear, my love, you thought of me leſs nobly, than I hope I deſerved: I was not to be ſhocked by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment from our former way of living: I could have borne even the hardſhips of poverty, had it left me my Harry.</p>

                     <p>Your ſweetmeats arrived very ſafe under the care of Captain Lewſon: The children have profited by them, particularly Billy, who has ſtill ſome remains of the hooping-cough. He aſked me, if they did not come from papa; and when, ſaid he, will papa come himſelf? "papa," cried my little Emmy, who has juſt learned to liſp the word. "She never ſaw papa, (replied her brother) did ſhe mamma?"—I could not ſtand this prattle; my boy wept with me for company's ſake!</p>

                     <p>Emmy, they tell me, will be a beauty. She has, to ſay truth, lovely dark blue eyes and a charming complexion. I think there is ſomething of melancholy in her look; but this may be only my fancy. Billy is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, a bold ſpirited child; yet he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably attentive to every thing I endeavour to teach him, and can read a little already, with no other tutor than myſelf. I choſe this taſk, to amuſe my lonely hours; for I make it a point of duty, to keep up my ſpirits as well as I can. Sometimes, indeed, I droop in ſpite of me, eſpecially when you ſeem to waver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of your return. Think, my love, what riſks your health runs for the ſake of thoſe riches, which are of no uſe without it; and, after all, it is chiefly in opinion, that their power of beſtowing happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. I am ſure, the little parlour, in which I now write, is more ſnug and comfortable, than the large room we uſed to receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in formerly; and the plain meal, to which I ſit down with my children, has more reliſh than the formal dinners we were obliged to invite them to. Return then, my deareſt Harry, from thoſe fatigues and dangers, to which, by your own account, you are obliged to be expoſed. Return to your Emily's love,

                  <p>Such was the wife whom Herbert loſt; you will not wonder at his grief; yet ſometimes, when the whole ſcene is before me, I know not how, I almoſt envy him his tears.</p>
                  <p>It is ſomething to endeavour to comfort him. 'Tis perhaps a ſelfiſh movement in our nature, to conceive an attachment to ſuch a character; one that throws itſelf on our pity by feeling its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, is ever more beloved than that which riſes above them.—I know, however, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry, that I feel myſelf pleaſed with being the friend of Herbert; would we were in <hi>France,</hi> that I might make him the friend of Beauvaris!</p>
                  <p>Your laſt mentions nothing of Roubigné, or his family. I know he diſlikes writing, and therefore am not ſurpriſed at his ſilence to myſelf. You ſay, in a former letter, you find it difficult to hear of them; there is a young lady in <hi>Paris,</hi> for whom the lovely JULIA has long entertained a very uncommon friendſhip; her name is Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilles, daughter of the preſident Roncilles.—Yet, on ſecond thoughts, I would not have

you viſit her, on purpoſe to make inquiry as from me; but you may fall on ſome method of getting intelligence of them in this line.</p>
                  <p>Do not let ſlip the opportunity of this ſhip's return to write me fully; ſhe is conſigned to a correſpondent of ours, and particular care will be taken of my letters. I think, if that had been the caſe with the laſt that arrived here, I ſhould have found one from you on board of her. Think of me frequently, and write me as often as our ſituation will allow.</p>

                  <p>I BEGIN to ſuſpect that the ſenſibility, of which your minds are proud, from which they look down with contempt on the unfeeling mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ordinary men, is leſs a bleſſing than an inconvenience.—Why cannot I be as happy as my uncle, as Dorville, as all the other good people around me?—I eat, and drink, and ſing, nay I can be merry, like them; but they cloſe the account, and ſet down this mirth for happineſs; I retire to the family of my own thoughts, and find them in weeds of ſorrow.</p>

Herbert left this place yeſterday! the only man beſides thee, whom my ſoul can acknowledge as a friend. And him perhaps, I ſhall ſee no more: And thee! my heart droops at this moment, and I could weep without knowing why.—Tell me, as ſoon as poſſible, that you are well and happy; there is, methinks, a languor in your laſt letter—or is it but the livery of my own imagination, which the objects around me are conſtrained to wear?</p>
                  <p>Herbert was a ſort of proxy for my Beauvaris; he ſpoke from the feelings of a heart like his. To him I could unboſom mine, and be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for the ſpeaking of a common language, is but one requiſite towards the deareſt intercourſe of ſociety. His ſorrows gave him a ſacredneſs in my regard, that made every endeavour to ſerve or oblige him, like the performance of a religious duty; there was a quiet ſatisfaction in it, which calmed the rufflings of a ſometimes troubled ſpirit, and reſtored me to peace with myſelf.</p>
                  <p>He is ſailed for England, whither ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs material to a friend of his much loved Emily, obliges him to return. He yields to this, I perceive, as a duty he thinks himſelf bound to diſcharge, though the ſight of his native country, ſpoiled as it is of thoſe bleſſings which it once
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017578_0159_0FBA7082B3DCEAA0"/>
poſſeſſed for him, muſt be no eaſy trial of his fortitude. He talks of leaving it as ſoon as this affair will allow him, not to return to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies (for of his buſineſs there he is now inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent) but to travel through ſome parts of Europe, which the employments of his younger years prevented him from viſiting at an early period of life. If he goes to <hi>Paris</hi> he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me to call on you.—Could I be with you!—What a thought is there!—but I ſhall not be forgotten at the interview.</p>
                  <p>I have juſt received yours of the third of laſt month. I muſt ſtill complain of its ſhortneſs, though I dare not quarrel with it as it aſſures me of your welfare. But get rid, I pray you, of that very bad practice, of ſuppoſing things unimportant at <hi>Martinique,</hi> becauſe you think them ſo at <hi>Paris.</hi> Give me your intelligence, and allow me to be the judge of its conſequence.</p>
                  <p>You are partial to your friend, when you write in ſuch high terms, of his treatment of Yambu. We think but ſeldom of thoſe things which habit has made common, otherwiſe we ſhould correct many of them; there needed only to give one's feelings room on this theme, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017578_0160_0FBA708773949318"/>
they could prompt no other conduct than mine. Your approbation, however, is not loſt upon me; the beſt of our reſolutions are bettered, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the ſuffrage of good men in their favour; and the reward is ſtill higher, when that ſuffrage is from thoſe we love.</p>
                  <p>My uncle has ſent for me, to help him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſome company who are juſt arrived here. He knows not what a train of thinking he calls me from—I have a little remembrancer, Beauvaris, a picture which has hung at my boſom for ſome years paſt, that ſpeaks ſuch things!—</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXI. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</head>
                  <p>YOU ſay the letter, to which your laſt was an anſwer, was written in low ſpirits; I confeſs I am not always in high ones; not even now, though I am juſt returned from a little feaſt, where there was much mirth, and excellent wine. It was a dinner given by Dorville, on occaſion of his daughter's birth-day, to which my uncle and I, among other of his friends, had been long invited. The old gentleman diſplayed all his wealth, and all his wit, in entertaining us; ſome of us thanked him for neither, though every one's complaiſance obliged them to eat of his dainties, and laugh at his jeſts.</p>
                  <p>It is after ſuch a ſcene, that one is often in a ſtate the moſt ſtupid of any. The aſſumption of a character, in itſelf humiliating, diſtreſſes and waſtes us, while the loſs of ſo much time, like the bad fortune of a gameſter, is doubly felt, when we reflect that fools have won from us. Yet it muſt be ſo in life, and I wiſh to overcome the ſpleen of repining at it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:017578_0162_0FBA708A27F629E0"/>
I was again ſet next Mademoiſelle Dorville, and had the honour of accompanying ſome of the ſongs ſhe ſung to us. A vain fellow, in my circumſtances, might imagine that girl liked him. I believe there is nothing ſo ſerious in her mind, and I ſhould be ſorry there were. The theft of a woman's affections is not ſo atrocious as that of her honour; but I have often ſeen it more terrible than that of her life; at leaſt, if living wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs be worſe than death: Yet is it reckoned a very venial breach of confidence, to endeavour to become more than agreeable, where a man feels it impoſſible to repay what he may receive. Her father I am apt to believe, has ſomething of what is commonly called a plot upon me; but as to him my conſcience is eaſy, becauſe, the coffers of my uncle being his quarry, it matters not much if he is diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>Were it not from a point of delicacy, not to run the ſmalleſt riſk of being thought particular, I could, ſometimes, be very well entertained with the ſociety of Mademoiſelle Dorville. There is a ſprightlineſs about her, which amuſes, though it is not winning, and I ever found it ſo eaſy to talk nonſenſe to any other woman. I fancy this is always the caſe, where there is no chance of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017578_0163_0FBA708BCDC1B2B0"/>
the heart being intereſted: It is perfectly ſo in the preſent inſtance with me.—Oh! Beauvaris! I have laid out more ſoul in ſitting five minutes with JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ in ſilence, than I ſhould in a year's converſation with this little Dorville.</p>
                  <p>The Converſation of women has perhaps a charm from its weakneſs; but this muſt be, like all their other weakneſſes that pleaſe us, what claims an intereſt in our affections, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending our reaſon. I know not if there is really a ſex in the ſoul: Cuſtom and education have eſtabliſhed one, in our idea; but we wiſh to feel the inferiority of the other ſex, as one that does not debaſe but endear it.</p>
                  <p>To their knowledge, in many things, we have ſet limits, becauſe it ſeems to encroach on the ſoftneſs of their feelings, which we ſuppoſe of that retiring kind, that ſhuns the keenneſs of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument or enquiry. Knowledge or learning has often this effect among men: It is even ſometimes fatal to taſte, if by taſte is meant the effect which beauties have on ourſelves, rather than the power of criticiſing on that which they ought to have on others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:017578_0164_0FBA70912DEC7840"/>
There is a little world of ſentiment made for women to move in, where they certainly excel our ſex, and where our ſex, perhaps, ought to be excelled by them. This is irreſiſtibly engaging, where it is natural; but of all affectations, that of ſentiment is the moſt diſguſting. It is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, more common in <hi>France</hi> than any where elſe; and I am not ſure, if it does not proceed from our women poſſeſſing the reality leſs. The daughter of Monſ. Dorville, when ſhe would be great, is always ſentimental. I was forced to tell her to-day, that I hated ſentiments, and that they ſpoiled the complexion. She looked in the glaſs, and began to aſk ſome queſtions about the Italian comedy.</p>
                  <p>My uncle, who had ſtaid ſome time behind me with Dorville, came in. He was very copious on the ſubject of Mademoiſelle. I was perfectly of his opinion in every thing, and praiſed her in echo to what he ſaid, but he had diſcernment enough to ſee an indifference in this, which I was ſorry to find he did not like. I know not how far he meant to go, if we had been long together; but he found himſelf ſomewhat indiſpoſed, and was obliged to go to bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="unknown:017578_0165_0FBA70926EEFEE20"/>
I ſat down alone, and thought of JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ.</p>
                  <p>My uncle is, this morning, really ill. I owe him too much, not to be diſtreſſed at this. He is uneaſy about his own ſituation, though, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, without reaſon; but men, who like him, have enjoyed uninterrupted health, are apt to be apprehenſive. I have ſent for a phyſician with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting him know; for it was another effect of his good conſtitution, to hold the faculty in contempt. At preſent, I am ſure, he will thank me, in his heart, for my precaution.</p>
                  <p>The doctor has been with him, and talks doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; that, perhaps, is unavoidable in a ſcience, from its nature, ſo uncertain; for this man has really too much knowledge to wiſh to ſeem wiſer.</p>
                  <p>I find I muſt conclude this letter, as the ſhip, by which I am to ſend it, is within a quarter of an hour of ſailing. Would it had been a few days later! a few days might do much in a fate like mine.—I cannot expreſs that ſort of doubt and fear which the look of futurity, at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives me.</p>

Do not, for Heaven's ſake, do not fail to write me about the ſituation of Roubigné and his family. I know his unwillingneſs to write, and decorum prevents (is it vanity to think ſo?) his daughter; therefore I addreſſed my laſt letter to Madame de Roubigné; but even when I ſhall receive her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it will not ſay enough. You know what my heart requires; do not diſappoint it.<note n="*" place="bottom">There are no letters in this collection, of a later date, from Savillon to Beauvaris.

                  <head>LETTER XXXII. JULIA DE MONTAUBAN, TO MARIA DE RONCILLES.</head>
                  <p>YOU muſt not expect to hear from me ſo often as formerly; we have, here, an even tenor of days, that admits not of much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Comedies and romances, you know, always end with a marriage, becauſe after that, there is nothing to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But I have reaſon to be angry with you for finding ſo little to ſay at <hi>Paris,</hi> though I believe, the fault is in myſelf, or rather in your idea of me. You think I am not formed to reliſh thoſe articles of intelligence, which are called news in your great town; the truth is, I have often heard them with very little reliſh; but I know you have wit enough to make them pleaſant if you would; and even if you had not, do but write any thing, and I ſhall read it with an intereſt.</p>
                  <p>You flatter me by your praiſes of the <hi>naiveté,</hi> in the picture I drew of our party of pleaſure. GOD knows, I have no talent that way; yet the groupe was fantaſtic enough, and, though I felt quite otherwiſe than merry next morning, when
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017578_0168_0FBA709922F5D058"/>
I wrote to you, yet I found a ſort of pleaſure in deſcribing it. There is a certain kind of trifling, in which a mind not much at eaſe can ſometimes indulge itſelf. One feels an eſcape, as it were, from the heart, and is fain to take up with lighter company. It is like the theft of a truant boy, who goes to play for a few minutes while his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is aſleep, and throws the chiding for his taſk upon futurity.</p>
                  <p>We have very different company at preſent. Madame de Sancerre has been here theſe three days. Her huſband was an acquaintance of Monſ. de Montauban in <hi>Spain,</hi> and, you will remember, we uſed to be of her parties in town; ſo ſhe is a gueſt of both ſides of the houſe, though I believe no great favourite of either. She is a wit, you know, and ſays abundance of good things; and will ſay any thing, provided it be witty. Here, indeed, we give her ſo little opportunity, that her genius is almoſt famiſhed for want of ſubject. At <hi>Paris,</hi> I remember her ſurrounded with men of letters; they praiſed her learning, and to us ſhe ſeemed wonderful both as a ſcholar and a critic; but here when I turn the diſcourſe on books, ſhe chuſes to talk of nothing but the <hi>beau monde.</hi> Her deſcriptions, however, are diverting enough, and I believe ſhe is not the worſe pleaſed with me, that I can only hear them without being
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017578_0169_0FBA709AA389ABE8"/>
able to anſwer; for I think, if there is a member of our ſociety ſhe diſlikes, it is that relation of the Count, whom I mentioned to you in my laſt, Monſ. de Rouillé, who is come to ſpend ſome weeks here. From the account of his vivacity which I received from his kinſman, I thought Madame de Sancerre would have thought it a piece of high good fortune to have met him here; but, I ſee, I miſtook the thing; and that ſhe would reliſh his company better, if he were as ſtupid as the reſt of us. I am of a different opinion, and begin to like him much; the better, that I was prepared to be ſomewhat afraid of him; but I find in him nothing to be feared; on the contrary, he is my very ſafeſt barrier againſt the ſometimes too powerful brilliancy of the lady.</p>
                  <p>Rouillé is conſtitutionally happy; but his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, though it ſeems to be conſtant, does not appear to be unfeeling. It is not the cheerfulneſs of an unthinking man, who is ready to laugh, on all occaſions, without leave of his reaſon, or what is worſe, of his humanity; ſome ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I have ſeen, whoſe mirth, was like the pranks of a madman, and, if not of conſequence enough to excite anger or fear, was entitled to our compaſſion. Rouillé has the happy talent of hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that point where ſentiment mingles with good humour. His wit, except when forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017578_0170_0FBA709AA389ABE8"/>
to oppoſition by the petulance of others, is ever of that gentle kind from which we have nothing to dread; that ſports itſelf in the level of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary underſtandings, and pleaſes, becauſe it makes no one diſpleaſed with himſelf. Even the natural gravity of Montauban yields to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning livelineſs of Rouillé, and though the firſt ſeems to feel a little aukwardneſs in the attempt, yet he often comes down from the loftineſs of his own character, to meet the pleaſantry of the other's.</p>
                  <p>Do not rally me on the favour of matrimony in the obſervation, if I venture to ſay, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban ſeems to have reſumed ſomewhat of his former dignity. Think not that I ſuſpect the ſmalleſt diminution of his affection; but now, when the eaſe of the huſband has reſtored him to his native character—I know not what I would ſay—Believe me, I mean nothing at all—I have the greateſt reaſon to be ſatisfied and happy.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, I believe, he is now and then out of humour with this viſitant of ours, Madame de Sancerre; and, it may be, thrown into ſomewhat of a ſeverity in his manner, from the obſervation of an oppoſite one in her. When ſhe utters, as ſhe does pretty often, any joke at which ſhe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:017578_0171_0FBA709FE4FB4900"/>
laughs heartily herſelf, I laugh, ſometimes with good will, but oftener (out of complaiſance) without; Rouillé laughs, and is ready with his jeſt in return; but Montauban looks graver than ever. Indeed, there is no reſource for one who cannot laugh at a jeſt, but to look grave at it.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh my MARIA could have accepted of the invitation he communicated by me ſome time ago. I think I ſhould have ſhewn him, in my friend, a livelineſs that would not have diſpleaſed him. Could you ſtill contrive to come, while Rouillé is here, you muſt be charmed with one another. It would give me an opportunity of making up to you, for the many dull letters I have obliged you to read; but you taxed yourſelf early with my correſpondence; it was then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, tolerable; it has, of late, been a mere col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of egotiſms, the egotiſms too of a mind ill at eaſe—but I have given up making apologies or acknowledgements to you; they are only for common obligations: mine is a debt beyond their quittance.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXIII. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</head>
                  <p>I AM now three letters in your debt; yet the account of correſpondence uſed formerly to be in my favour. The truth is, that of facts I have nothing to write, and of ſentiments almoſt as little. Of the firſt, my ſituation here in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try deprives me; and of the laſt, that quiet ſort of ſtate I have got into is little productive. When I was unhappy as the lover of JULIA, or firſt happy as her huſband, I had theme enough, and to ſpare. I can tell you, that I am happy ſtill; but it is a ſort of happineſs that would not figure in narration. I believe my JULIA is every thing that a good wife ſhould be: I hope I am a good huſband. I am neither young nor old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a doating one.</p>
                  <p>You will ſmile and look back to certain letters and notes of mine, written ſome four or five months ago. I do not know why I ſhould be aſhamed of them. Were Segarva to marry, he would write ſuch letters for a while, and there never was a man who could write ſuch letters
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:017578_0173_0FBA70A2E20BD9D0"/>
long. If there were, I am not ſure if I ſhould wiſh to be that man. When we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quite ſo happy as others, our pride na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally balances the account: It ſhews us that we are wiſer.</p>
                  <p>Rouillé, who has been here for a week or two, is of a different opinion: He holds the happieſt man to be ever the wiſeſt. You know Rouillé's diſpoſition, which was always too much in the ſun for us; but the goodneſs of his heart, and the purity of his honour, are above the reſt of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. With this prepoſſeſſion in his favour, I hear him laugh at me, without reſentment; and by and by he ſteals upon me, till I forget myſelf, and laugh with him. I am ſometimes gay; but I feel a ſort of trouble in gaiety. It is exactly the reverſe with Rouillé: He can be ſerious, when he means to be ſo; but, if we mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he is gay, and I am ſerious.</p>
                  <p>My wife is neither one nor t'other: There is ſomething about her too gentle for either; but I think, her penſive ſoftneſs deſerts more readily to Rouillé's ſide than to mine, though one ſhould imagine his manner the more diſtant from hers of the two. Rouillé jokes me on this: He calls her the middle ſtage between us; but ſays, it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017578_0174_0FBA70A7F52F99C0"/>
towards my ſide. "A ſolitary caſtle, and a ſtill evening (ſaid he) would make a JULIA of me; but to be Montauban, I muſt have a fog and a priſon."</p>
                  <p>Perhaps if we conſider matters impartially, theſe men have the advantage of us: The little cordialities of life are more frequently in uſe than its greater and more important duties. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, I think, has compared them to ſmall pieces of coin, which, though of leſs value than the large, are more current amongſt men; but the parallel fails in one reſpect: A thouſand of theſe <hi>livres</hi> do not conſtitute a <hi>louis;</hi> and I have known many characters poſſeſſed of all that the firſt could give, whoſe minds were incapable of the laſt. In this number, however, I mean not to include Rouillé.</p>
                  <p>We have another gueſt, who illuſtrates my meaning better, the widow of Sancerre, whom you introduced to my acquaintance, a long time ago, in <hi>Spain.</hi> She was then nothing; for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre conſidered all women nothing, and took care that, during his life, ſhe ſhould be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the rule. He died; ſhe regained her freedom; and ſhe uſes it as one to whom it had long been denied. She is juſt fool enough to be a wit, and carries on a perpetual cruſade againſt
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:017578_0175_0FBA70A900D7CA30"/>
ſenſe and ſeriouſneſs. I bear with her very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently: She plagues me, I believe, the more. My wife ſmiles, Rouillé laughs at me; I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to laugh, and aſhamed to be angry; ſo I remain ſilent and ſtupid.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I ceaſe to think of her, and blame myſelf. Why ſhould I allow this ſpleen of ſenſe to diſqualify me for ſociety?—Once or twice I almoſt muttered things againſt my preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—JULIA loves me; I know ſhe does: She has that tenderneſs and gratitude, which will ſecure her affection to a huſband, who loves her as I do; but ſhe muſt often feel the difference of diſpoſition between us. Had ſuch a man as Rouillé been her huſband—not Rouillé neither, though ſhe ſeems often delighted with his good humour, when I cannot be pleaſed with it.—</p>
                  <p>We are neither of us ſuch a man as the writer of a romance would have made a huſband for JULIA.—There, is indeed, a pliability in the minds of women in this article, which frequently gains over opinion to the ſide of duty.—Duty is a cold word.—No matter, we will canvas it no farther. I know the purity of her boſom, and I think, I am not unworthy of its affection.</p>
                  <p>Her father I ſee much ſeldomer than I could wiſh; but he is greatly altered of late, Since the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:017578_0176_0FBA70AA653F9D30"/>
time of his wife's death, I have obſerved him droop apace; but JULIA ſays, that the diſtreſs of their circumſtances kept up in him a ſort of falſe ſpirit, which, when they were diſembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, left him to ſink under reflection. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, I can eaſily perceive, are not in that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour they were wont to be; yet his bodily ſtrength does not much decline, and he ſeems more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with himſelf, than he was when in full poſſeſſion of his abilities. We wiſh him to live with us; but he has conſtantly refuſed our requeſt, and it is a matter of delicacy to preſs him on that point. We go to ſee him ſometimes: He receives us with ſatisfaction, not ardour: Violent emotions of every kind appear to be quenched in him. It creates, methinks, a feeling of mingled com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and ſadneſs, to look on the evening of a life and of a character like Roubigné's.</p>
                  <p>Shall I not ſee you here ſome time this autumn? You gave me a ſort of promiſe, and I need you more than ever. I want the ſociety of ſome one, in whoſe company I can be pleaſed, without the tax of thinking that I am filly for being ſo.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE juſt now received a piece of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which I muſt beg my MARIA inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfy me about. Le Blanc, my father's ſervant, was here a few hours ago, and among other news, informed Liſette, that a nephew of his, who is juſt come with his maſter from <hi>Paris,</hi> met Savillon there, whom he perfectly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, from having ſeen him in his viſits to his uncle at <hi>Belville.</hi> The lad had no time for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, as his maſter's carriage was juſt ſetting off, when he obſerved a chaiſe drive up to the door of the hotel, with a gentleman in it, whom he knew to be Savillon, accompanied by a valet de cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, and two black ſervants on horſeback.</p>
                  <p>Think, MARIA, what I feel at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence!—Yet why ſhould it alarm me?—Alas! you know this poor, weak, throbbing heart of mine! I cannot, if I would, hide it from you.—Find him out, for Heaven's ſake, MARIA; tell me—yet what now is Savillon to your JULIA?—No matter—do any thing your prudence may ſuggeſt; only ſatisfy me about the fate of

this once dear—Again! I dare not truſt myſelf on the ſubject—Monſ. de Montauban! Farewell!</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXV. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</head>
                  <p>MY wife (that word muſt often come acroſs the narration of a married man) has been a good deal indiſpoſed of late. You will not joke me on this intelligence, as ſuch of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours whom I have ſeen have done; it is not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever what they ſay, or you may think; her ſpirits droop more than her body; ſhe is thoughtful and melancholy when ſhe thinks ſhe is not obſerved, and, what pleaſes me worſe, affects to appear otherwiſe, when ſhe is. I like not this ſadneſs which is conſcious of itſelf. Yet, perhaps, I
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:017578_0179_0FBA70B1F93BCB60"/>
have ſeen her thus before our marriage, and have rather admired this turn of mind than diſapproved of it; but now I would not have her penſive—nor very gay neither—I would have nothing about her, methinks, to ſtir a queſtion in me whence it aroſe. She ſhould be contented with the affection ſhe knows I bear for her. I do not expect her to be romantically happy, and ſhe has no cauſe for uneaſineſs—I am not uneaſy nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—yet I wiſh her to conquer this melancholy.</p>
                  <p>I was laſt night abroad at ſupper: JULIA was a-bed before my return. I found her lute lying on the table, and a muſic-book open by it. I could perceive the marks of tears ſhed on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the air was ſuch as might encourage their falling: Sleep however had overcome her ſadneſs, and ſhe did not awake when I opened the curtains to look on her. When I had ſtood ſome moments, I heard her ſigh ſtrongly through her ſleep, and preſently ſhe muttered ſome words, I know not of what import. I had ſometimes heard her do ſo before, without regarding it much; but there was ſomething that rouſed my attention now. I liſtened; ſhe ſighed again, and again ſpoke a few broken words; at laſt I heard her plainly pronounce the name <hi>Savillon,</hi> two or three times over, and each time it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſighs ſo deep, that her heart ſeemed
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:017578_0180_0FBA70B378A5A1F8"/>
burſting as it heaved them. I confeſs the thing ſtruck me, and, after muſing on it ſome time, I reſolved to try a little experiment this day at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to diſcover whether chance had made her pronounce this name, or if ſome previous cauſe had impreſſed it on her imagination. I knew a man of that name at <hi>Paris,</hi> when I firſt went thither, who had an office under the intendant of the marine. I introduced ſome converſation on the ſubject of the fleet, and ſaid, in an indifferent manner, that I had heard ſo and ſo from my old acquaintance Savillon. She ſpilt ſome ſoup ſhe was helping me to at the inſtant; and, ſtealing a glance at her, I ſaw her cheeks fluſhed into crimſon.</p>
                  <p>I have been ever ſince going the round of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture on this incident. I think I can recollect once, and but once, her father ſpeak of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon called Savillon reſiding abroad, from whom he had received a letter; but I never heard JULIA mention him at all. I know not why I ſhould have forborn aſking her the reaſon of her being ſo affected at the ſound; yet at the moment I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, the queſtion ſtuck in my throat. I felt ſomething like guilt hang over this incident alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether—it is none of mine then—nor of JULIA'S neither, I truſt—and yet, Segarva, it
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:017578_0181_0FBA70B5580EA548"/>
has touched me nearer—much nearer than I ſhould own to any one but you.</p>

                     <hi>Nine at night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon looking over what I had written in the afternoon, I had almoſt reſolved to burn this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and write another; but it ſtrikes me as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity to a friend like Segarva, not to truſt him with the very thought of the moment, weak as it may be.</p>
                  <p>I begin now to be aſhamed of the effect that trifle, I mentioned above, had upon me. JULIA is better and has been ſinging to me the old Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ballad, which you ſent us lately. I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with thoſe antient national ſongs, becauſe there is a ſimplicity, and an expreſſion in them, which I can underſtand. Adepts in muſic are pleaſed with more intricate compoſitions; and they talk more of the pleaſure than they feel; and others talk after them, without feeling at all.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXVI. SAVILLON TO HERBERT.</head>
                  <p>I AM here in <hi>Paris,</hi> and fulfil the promiſe, which your friendſhip required of me, to write to you immediately on my arrival.</p>
                  <p>Alas! my reception is not ſuch as I looked for. He, whom alone my arrival ſhould have intereſted my ever faithful Beauvaris!—he meets me not—we ſhall never meet—he died, while I was imagining fond things of our meeting!</p>
                  <p>Gracious GOD! what have I done, that I ſhould be always thus an outcaſt from ſociety? When <hi>France</hi> was dear to me as life itſelf, my deſtiny tore me from her coaſt; now, when I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated the pleaſures of my return, is this the welcome ſhe affords me?</p>
                  <p>Forlorn and friendleſs as my early days were, I complained not while Beauvaris was mine: He was wholly mine, for his heart was not made for the world. Naturally reſerved, he ſhrunk early from its notice; and, when he had lived to judge of its ſentiments, he wiſhed not to be in the liſt of its friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="unknown:017578_0183_0FBA70BA81A2BB50"/>
His extreme modeſty, indeed, was an evil in his fate; becauſe it deprived him of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and aſſiſtance, which his ſituation required. Thoſe who might have been patrons of his merit, had not time to ſearch for talents his baſhfulneſs obſcured. His virtues even ſuffered imputation from it: Shy, not only of intimacy, but even of opinion and ſentiment, perſons whoſe ſituation ſeemed to entitle them to his confidence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his coldneſs and indifference, and he was accuſed of want of feeling, from what, in truth, was an exceſs of ſenſibility. This jewel, undiſcovered by others, was mine. From infancy, each had accuſtomed himſelf to conſider his friend but a better part of himſelf; and, when the heart of either was full, talking to the other was but unloading it in ſoliloquy.</p>
                  <p>Forgive me, my dear Herbert, for thus dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſubject. The only ſad comfort I have now left me, is to think of his worth: It is a privilege I would not waſte, on common minds, to hear me on this theme; yours can underſtand it.</p>
                  <p>Why was I abſent from <hi>Paris?</hi> Too much did the latter days of Beauvaris require me! They ſaw him ſtruggling with poverty as well as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet the laſt letter he wrote me confeſſed neither; and ſome little preſents, the produce of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:017578_0184_0FBA70BBC1ABBFE8"/>
                     <hi>Martinique,</hi> which I ſent him, he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert into money, becauſe they came from me.</p>
                  <p>I am now ſitting in the room, in which he died!—On that paltry bed lay the head of Beauvaris—on this deſk, whereon I write, he wrote!—Pardon me a while, I am unable to go on.</p>
                  <p>It is from the indulgence of ſorrow, that we firſt know a reſpite from affliction. I have given a looſe to my grief, and I feel the relief, which my tears have afforded me. I am now returned to my hotel, and am able to recollect myſelf.</p>
                  <p>I have not yet ſeen any acquaintance of Monſ. de Roubigné; this blow, indeed, did not allow me leiſure or ſpirits for enquiry; I feel as if I were in a foreign land, and am almoſt afraid of the noiſe and buſtle I hear in the ſtreets. I have ſent, however, offering a viſit to a particular young lady, of whom I ſhall be able to get intelligence of Roubigné's family; but my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger is not yet returned.</p>
                  <p>He has found her, and ſhe has appointed me to come to her to-morrow morning. You cannot
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:017578_0185_0FBA70BD5AFDF150"/>
imagine what a flutter the expectation of this viſit has thrown me into; I am not apt to ſtand in awe of preſages, but I could be very weak that way at this moment. My man who poſſeſſes a happy vivacity, brought me in, after dinner, a bottle of Burgundy, which, he ſaid, the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord aſſured him was excellent. I have drunk three-fourths of it, by way of medicine; it has made my head ſomewhat dizzy, but my heart is as heavy as before.</p>
                  <p>What a letter of egotiſm have I written! but you have taught me to give vent to my feelings, by the acquaintance you have allowed me with yours. To ſpeak ones diſtreſſes to the unfeeling is terrible; even to aſk the alms of pity is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating; but to pour our griefs into the boſom of a friend, is but committing to him a pledge above the truſt of ordinary men.</p>
                  <p>Do not, I beſeech you, forget your deſign of travelling into <hi>France</hi> this ſeaſon;—yet why ſhould I aſk this? I know not where fortune may lead me! it cannot, however, place me in a ſituation, where the friendſhip of Herbert ſhall be forgotten.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXVII. SAVILLON TO HERBERT.</head>
                  <p>BEAR with me, Herbert, bear with me. The firſt uſe I make of that correſpondence which you deſired, is to pour out my miſeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you! but you can hear them.—You have known what it is to love, and to deſpair as I do.</p>
                  <p>When I told you, my Beauvaris was no more, I thought I had exhauſted the ſum of diſtreſs, which this viſit to <hi>Paris</hi> was to give me. I knew not then what fate had prepared for me—that JULIA, on whom my doating hear had reſted all its hopes of happineſs;—that JULIA is the wife of another!</p>
                  <p>All but this I could have borne; the loſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the decay of health, the coldneſs of friends, might have admitted of hope; here only was deſpair to be found, and here I have found it!</p>
                  <p>Oh! Herbert! ſhe was ſo interwoven with my thoughts of futurity, that life now fades into a blank, and is not worth the keeping;—but I have a uſe for it; I will ſee her yet at leaſt—
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:017578_0187_0FBA70C2643B11F8"/>
Wherefore ſhould I wiſh to ſee her?—Yet, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it is now the only object that can prompt a wiſh in me.</p>
                  <p>When I viſited that lady, that MARIA DE RONCILLES, whom I knew to be the deareſt of her friends, ſhe ſeemed to receive me with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; her tongue could ſcarce articulate the words that told me of JULIA'S marriage: She mentioned ſomething too, of having heard of mine.—I am tortured every way with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture—my brain ſcarce holds its recollection.—JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ is married to another!</p>
                  <p>I know not what I ſaid to this friend of her's at firſt; I remember only that, when I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a little, I begged her to convey a letter from me to JULIA; ſhe ſeemed to heſitate in her conſent; but ſhe did at laſt conſent. Twice have I written, and twice have I burnt what I had written—I have no friend to guide, to direct me—not even to weep to!</p>
                  <p>At laſt I have finiſhed that letter; it contains the laſt requeſt which the miſerable Savillon has to make. This one interview paſt, and my days have nothing to mark them with anxiety or hope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="unknown:017578_0188_0FBA70C3E89849C8"/>
I am now more calmly wretched; the writing of that letter has releived for a while my ſwelling heart. I went with it myſelf to Madamoiſelle de Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilles's; ſhe was abroad, ſo I left it without ſeeing her. You can judge of my feelings; I wondered at the indifference of the faces I met with in my way; they had no cares to cloud them, none at leaſt like Savillon's.—Why of all thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands am I the moſt wretched?</p>
                  <p>I am returned to my hotel. I hear the voices of my ſervants below: They are telling, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the adventures of their voyage. I can diſtinguiſh the voice of my man, and his audience are merry around him—Why ſhould he not jeſt! he knows not what his maſter ſuffers.</p>
                  <p>Something like a ſtupid ſleepineſs oppreſſes me: Laſt night, I could not ſleep. Where are now thoſe luxurious ſlumbers, thoſe wandering dreams of future happineſs?—Never ſhall I know them again!—Good night, my Herbert!—It is ſomething ſtill to ſleep and to forget them.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXVIII. JULIA TO MARIA.</head>
                  <p>WHAT do you tell me! Savillon in <hi>Paris!</hi> unmarried, unengaged, raving of JULIA! Hide me from myſelf, MARIA, hide me from myſelf—Am I not the wife of Montauban?—</p>
                  <p>Yes, and I know that character which as the wife of Montauban, I have to ſupport: Her huſband's honour and her own are in the breaſt of JULIA. My heart ſwells, while I think of the ſtation in which I am placed.—Relentleſs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour! thou trieſt me to the uttermoſt; thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joineſt me to think no more of ſuch a being as Savillon.</p>
                  <p>But can I think of him no more?—Cruel remembrances?—Thou too, my friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeſt me; you dare not truſt me with the whole ſcene; but you tell me enough.—I ſee him, I ſee him now! He came, unconſcious of what Fortune had made of me; he came, elate with the hopes of ſharing with his JULIA that wealth, which propitious Heaven had beſtowed on him.—She is married to another!—I ſee him ſtart back in amazement and deſpair; his eye wild and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:017578_0190_0FBA70C9A1716E90"/>
haggard, his voice loſt in the throb of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! He thinks on the ſhadows which his fond hopes had reared—the dreams of happineſs!—Say not that he wept at the thought.—Had thoſe tears fallen upon JULIA'S grave, Memory! thou couldſt not thus have ſtung me. But, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, gentle as his nature is, he was no weak enough to be overcome by the thought. Could he but think of me with indifference—Tell him, MARIA, what a wretch I am: A wife, without a wife's affection, to whom life has loſt its reliſh, and virtue its reward. Let him hate me, I deſerve his ſcorn—yet, methinks, I may claim his pity.—</p>
                  <p>The daughter of Roubigné, the wife of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban! I will not bear to be pitied. No; I will ſtifle the grief that would betray me, and be miſerable without a witneſs. This heart ſhall break, this proud heart, without ſuffering a ſigh to relieve it.</p>
                  <p>Alas! my friend, it will not be.—That picture, MARIA, that picture! Why did I not baniſh it from my ſight? too amiable Savillon! Look there, look there! in that eye there is no ſcorn, no reproach to the unhappy JULIA: Mildneſs and melancholy!—We were born
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:017578_0191_0FBA70CAB89C1C78"/>
to be miſerable!—Think'ſt thou, MARIA, that at this moment—it is poſſible—he is gazing thus on the reſemblance of one, whoſe ill fated raſhneſs has undone herſelf and him!—Will he thus weep over it as I do? Will he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my offences, and thus preſs it?—I dare not! This boſom is the property of Montauban.—Tears are all I have to beſtow. Is there guilt in thoſe tears? Heaven knows, I cannot help weeping.</p>
                  <p>I was interrupted by the voice of my huſband giving ſome orders to his ſervant at the door of my apartment. He entered with a look of gaiety; but I fear by the change of his countenance, that he obſerved my tears. I clapped on my hat to hide them, and told him, as well as I could, that I was going to walk. He ſuffered me to leave him, without any further queſtion, I ſtrolled I knew not whither, till I found myſelf by the ſide of a little brook, about a quarter of a mile's diſtance from the houſe. The ſtillneſs of noon, broken only by the gentle murmuring of the water, and the quiet hum of the bees, that hung on the wild flowers around it; theſe gave me back myſelf, and allowed me the languor of thought; my tears ſell without controul, and almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtreſs. I would have looked again on the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:017578_0192_0FBA70CC449A2960"/>
picture of Savillon, for I could then have truſted myſelf with the ſight of it; but I had left it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in my chamber. The thoughts of its being ſeen by my huſband gave wings to my return. I hope he miſſed it; for I found it lying, as I had left it, on my dreſſing-table, in the midſt of ſome letters of compliment, which had been thrown careleſsly there the day before; and, when I went down ſtairs, I diſcovered nothing in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour that ſhould have followed ſuch a diſcovery. On the contrary, I think, he ſeemed more pleaſed than uſual, and was particularly attentive to me. I felt his kindneſs a reproach, and my endeavours to return it ſat aukwardly upon me. There was a treachery methought, in my attempts to pleaſe him, and, I fear, the greater eaſe I meant to aſſume in making thoſe attempts, I gave them only more the appearance of conſtraint.</p>
                  <p>What a ſituation is mine! to wear the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſerenity, while my heart is wretched, and the diſſimulation of guilt, though my ſoul is unconſcious of a crime!—There is ſomething predictive in my mind, that tells me I ſhall not long be thus; but I am ſick of conjecture, as I am bereſt of hope, and only ſatisfy myſelf with concluding, that, in the moſt fateful lives, there is ſtill a certain point, where the maze of deſtiny can bewilder no more!</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXXIX. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</head>
                  <p>SEGARVA!—but it muſt be told—I bluſh even telling it to thee—have I lived to this?—that thou ſhouldſt hear the name of Montauban coupled with diſhonour!</p>
                  <p>I came into my wife's room yeſterday morning, ſomewhat unexpectedly. I obſerved ſhe had been weeping, though ſhe put on her hat to conceal <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and ſpoke in a tone of voice affectedly indifferent. Preſently ſhe went out on pretence of walking; I ſtaid behind, not without ſurpriſe at her tears, though, I think, without ſuſpicion; when turning over (in the careleſs way one does in muſing) ſome looſe papers on her dreſſing-table, I ſound a picture of a young man in miniature, the glaſs of which was ſtill wet with the tears ſhe had ſhed on it. I have but a confuſed remembrance of my feelings at the time; there was a bewildered pauſe of thought, as if I had waked in another world. My faithful Lonquillez happened to enter the room at that moment; look there! ſaid I, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the picture without knowing what I did; he held it in his hand, and turning it, read on
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:017578_0194_0FBA70D29FD4E530"/>
the back Savillon. I ſtarted at that ſound, and ſnatched the picture from him; I believe he ſpoke ſomewhat, expreſſing his ſurpriſe at my emotion; I know not what it was, nor what my anſwer: He was retiring from the chamber—I called him back.—"I think, (ſaid I) thou loveſt thy maſter, and wouldſt ſerve him if thou couldſt?"—"With my life! anſwered Lonquillez—The warmth of his manner touched me: I think I laid my hand on my ſword. Savillon! I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the name; "I have heard of him," ſaid Lonquillez.—"Heard of him!"—"I heard Le Blanc talk of him a few days ago."—"And what did he ſay of him?"—"And ſaid he had heard of this gentleman's arrival from the Weſt-Indies, from his own nephew, who had juſt come from <hi>Paris,</hi> that he remembered him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly when he lived with his maſter at <hi>Belville,</hi> the ſweeteſt young gentleman, and the handſomeſt in the province."—My ſituation ſtruck me at that inſtant.—I was unable to enquire further.—After ſome little time, Lonquillez left the room; I knew not that he was gone, till I heard him going down ſtairs. I called him back a ſecond time; he came: I could not ſpeak.—My dear maſter!" (ſaid Lonquillez) It was the accent of a friend, and it overcame me.</p>
                  <p>"Lonquillez (ſaid I) your maſter is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy!
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:017578_0195_0FBA6F984AA29860"/>
—Canſt thou think my wife is falſe to me?—"Heaven forbid! ſaid he, and ſtarted back in amazement.—"It may be I wrong her; but to dream of Savillon, to keep his picture, to weep over it,"—"What ſhall I do, Sir?" ſaid Lonquillez.—"You ſee I am calm, I returned, and will do nothing raſhly;—try to learn from Le Blanc every thing he knows about this Savillon. Liſette too is ſilly, and talks much. I know your faith, and will truſt your capacity; get me what intelligence you can, but beware of ſhewing the moſt diſtant ſuſpicion.—We heard my wife below; I threw down the picture where I had found it, and haſtened to meet her. As I approached her, my heart throbbed ſo violently that I durſt not venture the meeting. My dreſſing-room door ſtood a-jar; I ſlunk in there, I believe, unperceived, and heard her paſs on to her chamber. I would have called Lonquillez to have ſpoken to him again; but I durſt not then, and have not found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſince.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw my wiſe ſoon after; I counterfeited as well as I could, and, I think, ſhe was the moſt embarraſſed of the two; ſhe attempted once or twice to bring in ſome apology for her former appearance; complained of having been ill in
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:017578_0196_0FBA6F9BDDD8FDC0"/>
the morning, that her head had ached, and her eyes been hot and uneaſy.</p>
                  <p>She came herſelf to call me to dinner. We dined alone, and I marked her cloſely; I ſaw, (by Heaven! I did) a fawning ſolicitude to pleaſe me, an attempt at the good-humour of innocence, to cover the embarraſſment of guilt. I ſhould have obſerved it, I am ſure I ſhould, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a key; as it was, I could read her ſoul to the bottom.—JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ! the wife of Montauban!—Is it not ſo?</p>
                  <p>I have had time to think.—You will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the circumſtances of our marriage—her long unwillingneſs, her almoſt unconquerable reluctance.—Why did I marry her?</p>
                  <p>Let me remember—I durſt not truſt the honeſt deciſion of my friend, but ſtole into this engagement without his knowledge; I purchaſed her conſent, I bribed, I bought her; bought her, the leavings of another!—I will trace this line of infamy no further: There is madneſs in it!</p>

                  <head>LETTER XL. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</head>
                  <p>LONQUILLEZ has not ſlept on his poſt and chance has aſſiſted his vigilance. Le Blanc came hither the morning after our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: Lonquillez managed his enquiry with equal acuteneſs and caution: The other told every thing as the ſtory of an old man—he ſmiled and told it. He knew not that he was delivering the teſtimony of a witneſs—that the fate of his former miſtreſs hung on it!</p>
                  <p>This Savillon lived at <hi>Belville</hi> from his earlieſt youth, the companion of JULIA, though a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on her father. When they were forced to remove thence, he accompanied their retreat, the only companion of Roubigné, whom adverſity had left him to comfort it—but he had his
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:017578_0198_0FBA6F9EB1B18EC0"/>
reward: The company of the daughter often ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the place of her father's. He was her maſter in literature, her fellow-ſcholar in muſic and painting, and they frequently planned walks in concert which they afterwards trod together.—Le Blanc has ſeen them there, liſtening to the ſong of the nightingale.—</p>
                  <p>I am to draw the concluſion.—All this might be innocent, the effects of early intimacy and friendſhip; and on this ſuppoſition might reſt the quiet of an indifferent huſband. But why was this intimacy, this friendſhip, ſo induſtriouſly concealed from me? The name of Savillon never mentioned, except in guilty dreams; while his picture was kept in her chamber for the adultery of the imagination!—Do I triumph while I puſh this evidence?—Segarva whither will it lead me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth riſes upon me, and every ſucceeding circumſtance points to one concluſion. Liſette was to-day of a junketing party, which Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillez contrived for the entertainment of his friend Le Blanc. Mention was again made of old ſtories, and Savillon was a perſon of the drama. The wench is naturally talkative, and ſhe was then in ſpirits from company and good cheer. Le Blanc and ſhe recollected interviews of their young
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:017578_0199_0FBA6FA4877F1CF8"/>
miſtreſs and this handſome <hi>elève</hi> of her father. They were, it ſeems, nurſed by the ſame woman, that old Laſune, for whom JULIA procured a little dwelling, and a penſion of four hundred livres, from her unſuſpecting huſband. "She loved them (ſaid Le Blanc) like her own children, and they were like brother and ſiſter to each other"—"Brother and ſiſter, indeed!" (ſaid Liſette.) She was more ſagacious, and had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved things better.—"I know what I know, (ſaid ſhe) but to be ſure, thoſe things are all over now, and, I am perſuaded, my miſtreſs loves no man ſo well as her own huſband. What ſignifies what happened ſo long ago, eſpecially while Monſ. de Montauban knows nothing about the matter?"</p>
                  <p>Theſe were her words: Lonquillez repeated them thrice to me.—were I a fool, a driveller, I might be ſatisfied to doubt and be uneaſy; it is Montauban's to ſee his diſgrace, and, ſeeing, to revenge it.</p>
                  <p>Lonquillez has been with me: His diligence is indefatigable; but he feels for the honour of his maſter, and, being a Spaniard, is entitled to ſhare it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="unknown:017578_0200_0FBA6FA636589CE8"/>
He went with Le Blanc to ſee Laſune, whom that old man, it ſeems, never fails to viſit when he is here. Lonquillez told her, that Le Blanc had news for her about her foſter-ſon. "Of my dear Savillion?" cried ſhe. "Yes (ſaid Le Blanc) You will have heard, that he arrived from abroad ſome weeks ago; and I am told, that he is worth a power of money, which his uncle left him in the Weſt-Indies"—"Bleſs him! Heaven's bleſs him! (cried Laſune.) Then I may ſee him once more before I die. You never ſaw him, (turning to Lonquillez) but Le Blanc remembers him well: The handſomeſt, ſweeteſt, beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned—your miſtreſs and he have often ſat on that bench there—Lord pity my forgetfulneſs!—it was far from this place; but it was juſt ſuch a bench—and they would prefer poor Lazune's little treat to all the fine things at my maſter's—and how he would look on my ſweet child! Well, well, deſtiny rules every thing; but there was a time, when I thought I ſhould have called her by another name than Montauban,"—Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillez was too much ſtruck with her words to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unaffected by them: She obſerved his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.—"You think no harm, I hope," ſaid ſhe. He aſſured her he did not. "Nay, I need not care, for that part, who hears me, yet ſome folks might think it odd; but we are all friends
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:017578_0201_0FBA6FA7C2433558"/>
here, as we may ſay, and neither of you, I know, are tale-bearers, otherwiſe I ſhould not prattle as I do; eſpecially as the laſt time I ſaw my lady, when I aſked after her foſter-brother, ſhe told me, I muſt not ſpeak of him now, nor talk of the meetings they uſed to have at my houſe."</p>
                  <p>Such were her words; the memory of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillez is faithful, and he was intereſted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.—I drew my breath ſhort, and muttered vengeance: The good fellow ſaw my warmth, and tried to moderate it. "It is a matter, Sir, (ſaid he) of ſuch importance, that, if I may preſume to a viſe, nothing ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved raſhly. If my miſtreſs loves Savillon, if he ſtill anſwers her fondneſs, they will ſurely write to each other. I commonly take charge of the letters for the poſt: If you can find any proof that way, it cannot lie nor deceive you."</p>
                  <p>I have agreed to his propoſal.—How am I fallen, Segarva, when ſuch artifices are eaſy to me!—But I will not pauſe on trivial objections—the fate of Montauban is ſet upon this caſt, and the leſſer moralities muſt ſpeak unheeded.</p>

                  <p>IT is ſomething to be ſatisfied of the worſt. I have now ſuch proof, Segarva!—Enquiry is at an end, and vengeance the only buſineſs I have left. Before you can anſwer this—the infamy of your friend cannot be eraſed, but it ſhall be waſhed in blood!</p>
                  <p>Lonquillez has juſt brought me a letter from my wife to a Mademoiſelle de Roncilles, a boſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend of hers at <hi>Paris.</hi> He opened it, by a very ſimple operation, without hurting its appearance. It conſiſted only of a few hurried lines, deſiring her to deliver an encloſed letter to Savillon, and to take charge of his anſwer.—That letter now lies before me.—Read it Segarva,—thou wilt wiſh to ſtab her while thou read'ſt it—but Montauban has a dagger too.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I know not, Sir, how to anſwer the letter my friend Mademoiſelle de Roncilles has juſt ſent me from you. <hi>The intimacy of our former days I ſtill recal, as one of the happieſt periods of my life.</hi> The friendſhip of JULIA you are

certainly ſtill entitled to, and might claim, without the ſuſpicion of impropriety, though fate has now thrown her into <hi>the arms of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> There would then be no occaſion for this ſecret interview, which, I confeſs, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help dreading; but, as you urge the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of your viſiting Monſ. de Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, without betraying <hi>emotions, which, you ſay, would be dangerous to the peace of us all,</hi> conjured as I am by theſe motives of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, which my heart is, perhaps, but too ſuſceptible of for my own peace, I have at laſt, <hi>not without a feeling like remorſe,</hi> reſolved to meet you on Monday next, at the houſe of our old nurſe Laſune, <hi>whom I ſhall prepare for the purpoſe, and on whoſe fidelity I can perfectly rely.</hi> I hope you will give me credit for that remembrance of Savillon, which your letter, rather unjuſtly, denies me, when you find me agreeing to this meaſure of imprudence, of danger, <hi>it may be of guilt,</hi> to mitigate the diſtreſs, which I have been unfortunate enough to give him.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I feel at this moment a ſort of determined coolneſs, which the bending up of my mind to
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:017578_0204_0FBA6FB17119C360"/>
the revenge her crimes deſerve, has confered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; I have therefore underlined<note n="*" place="bottom">The paſſages here alluded to are printed in <hi>Italics.</hi>
                     </note> ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in this damned ſcroll, that my friend may ſee the weight of that proof on which I proceed. Mark the air of prudery that runs through it, the trick of voluptuous vice to give pleaſure the zeſt of nicety and reluctance. "It may be of guilt."—Mark with what coolneſs ſhe invites him to participate it!—Is this the hand writing of JULIA?—I am awake and ſee it.—JULIA! my wife! damnation!</p>
                  <p>I have been viſiting this Laſune, whoſe houſe is deſtined for the ſcene of my wife's interview with her gallant. I feel the meanneſs of an inquiſition, that degrades me into the wretched ſpy on an abandoned woman.—I bluſhed and heſitated while I talked to this old doating miniſter of their pleaſures. But the moment comes when I ſhall reſume myſelf, when I ſhall burſt upon them in the terrors of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Whether they have really impoſed on the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of this creature, I know not; but her anſwers
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:017578_0205_0FBA6FB32872DFA8"/>
to ſome diſtant queſtions of mine looked not like thoſe of an accomplice of their guilt.—Or, rather, it is I who am deceived; the cunning of intrigue is the property of the meaneſt among the ſex.—It matters not I have proof without her.</p>
                  <p>She conducted me into an inner room fitted up with a degree of nicety. On one ſide ſtood a bed, with curtains and a bed-cover of clean cotton. That bed, Segarva!—but this heart ſhall down; I will be calm—at the time while I looked on it, I could not; the old woman obſerved my emotion, and aſked if I was ill; I recovered myſelf however, and ſhe ſuſpected nothing; I think ſhe did not—It looked as if the Beldame had trimmed it for their uſe—damn her! damn her! killing is poor—Canſt thou not invent me ſome luxurious vengeance?</p>
                  <p>Lonquillez has reſealed and ſent off the letter to Savillon; he will take care to bring me the anſwer: But I know the anſwer—On Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next—why ſhould I ſtart as I think on it?—Their fate is fixed! mine perhaps—but I will think no more.—Farewell.</p>

                  <p>I HOPE, from the conveyance which Liſette has procured for this letter, it may reach you nearly as ſoon, as that in which I incloſed one for Savillon. If it comes in time, let it prevent your delivering that letter. I have been conſidering of this interview again and I feel a ſort of crime in it towards my huſband, which I dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on. I have treſpaſſed too much againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity already, in concealing from him my former attachment to that unfortunate young man. So ſtrongly indeed did this idea ſtrike me, that I was prepared to tell it him this very day, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from riding, and found me ſcarce recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the emotion which a reperuſal of Savillon's letter had cauſed; but his look had a ſternneſs in it, ſo oppoſite to thoſe feelings which ſhould have
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:017578_0207_0FBA6FB9E5BB0EC0"/>
opened the boſom of your diſtracted JULIA, that I ſhrunk back into ſecrecy, terrified at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on my own purpoſe.—Why am I the wife of this man? but if confidence and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs are not mine to give, there is a duty which is not mine to refuſe.—Tell Savillon I cannot ſee him.</p>
                  <p>Not in the way he aſks—let him come as the friend of JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ—Oh! MARIA! what a picture do theſe words recal! the friend of JULIA DE ROUBIGNÉ!—in thoſe happy days when it was not guilt to ſee, to hear, to think of him—when this poor heart was inconſcious of its little wanderings, or felt them but as harmleſs dreams, which ſweetened the real ills of a life too early viſited by misfortune!</p>
                  <p>When I look back on that life, how fateful has it been! Is it unjuſt in Providence, to make this ſo often the lot of hearts little able to ſtruggle with misfortune? or is it indeed the poſſeſſion of ſuch hearts, that creates their misfortunes? Had I not felt as I have done, half the ills I complain of had been nothing, and at this moment I were happy. Yet to have wanted ſuch a heart, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited as it is to the rude touch of ſublunary things—I think I cannot wiſh ſo much. There will come a time, MARIA, (might I forebode
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:017578_0208_0FBA6FBB4B6B04F8"/>
without your cenſure, I ſhould ſay it may not be diſtant) when they ſhall wound it no longer!</p>
                  <p>In truth, I am every way weak at preſent. My poor father adds much to my diſtreſſes: He has appeared, for ſome time paſt, to be verging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ſtate, which alone I ſhould think worſe than his death. His affection for me is the only ſenſe now quite alive about him, nay it too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of imbecillity. He uſed to embrace me with ardour: He now embraces me with tears.</p>
                  <p>Judge then, if I am able to meet Savillon, at this time, if I could allow myſelf to meet him at all. Think what I am, and what he is. The coolneſs I ought to maintain had been difficult at beſt; at preſent, it is impoſſible. I can ſcarce think without weeping; and to ſee that form—</p>
                  <p>MARIA! when this picture was drawn!—I remember the time well—my father was at <hi>Paris,</hi> and Savillon left with my mother and me at <hi>Belville.</hi> The painter (who was accidentally in our province) came thither to give me a few leſſons of drawing. Savillon was already a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable deſigner; but he joined with me in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſcholar to this man. When our maſter was with us, he uſed ſometimes to guide my hand;

when he was gone, at our practice of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Savillon commonly ſupplied his place. But Savillon's hand was not like the other's: I felt ſomething from its touch, not the leſs delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from carrying a ſort of fear along with that delight: It was like a pulſe in the ſoul!</p>
                  <p>Whither am I wandering? What now are thoſe ſcenes to me, and why ſhould I wiſh to remember them? Am I not another's, irrevocably another's?—Savillon knows I am.—Let him not wiſh to ſee me: We cannot recal the paſt, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherefore ſhould we add to the evils of the preſent?</p>

Chance has been kind to me for the means. Once, in Andaluſia, I met with a Venetian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piric, of whom, among other chymical curioſities, I bought a poiſonous drug, the efficacy of which he ſhewed me on ſome animals to whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered it. The death it gave was eaſy, and altered not the appearance of the thing it killed.</p>
                  <p>I have fetched it from my cabinet, and it ſtands before me. It is contained in a little ſquare phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, marked with ſome hieroglyphic ſcrawls, which I do not underſtand. Methinks, while I look on it—I could be weak, very weak Segarva,—But an hour ago I ſaw her walk, and ſpeak, and ſmile—yet theſe few drops!—I will look on it no more.—</p>
                  <p>I hear the tread of her feet in the apartment above. Did ſhe know what paſſes in my mind!—the ſtudy in which I ſit ſeems the cave of a demon!</p>
                  <p>Lonquillez has relieved me again. He has this moment got from her maid the following let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, addreſſed to her friend Mademoiſelle de Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilles. What a ſex it is! but I have heard of their alliances of intrigue.—It is not that theſe
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:017578_0212_0FBA6FC5B1B0F668"/>
things are uncommon, but that Montauban is a fool—a huſband—a—perdition ſeize her!</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Is my friend too leagued againſt me? Alas! my virtue was too feeble before, and needed not the addition of MARIA'S arguments to be overcome. Savillon's figure, you ſay, aided by that languid paleneſs, which his late illneſs had given it, was irreſiſtible—Why is not JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA ſick?—yet, wretched as ſhe is, irretriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably wretched, ſhe breathes, and walks, and ſpeaks, as ſhe did in her moſt happy days!—</p>
                     <p>You intreat me, for pity's ſake, to meet him.—He hinted his deſign of ſoon leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>France</hi> to return to <hi>Martinique.</hi>—Why did he ever leave <hi>France?</hi> had he remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with love and JULIA, inſtead of this ſtolen, this guilty meeting—What do I ſay?—I live but for Montauban!</p>
                     <p>I will think no longer.—This one time I will ſilence the monitor within me.—Tell him, I will meet him. On Thurſday next, let him be at Laſune's in the evening: It will be dark by ſix.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:017578_0213_0FBA6FCAEAAAA350"/>
I dare not read what I have written. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"It will be dark by ſix"!—Yet I will keep my word, Segarva! they ſhall meet, that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may precede my vengeance; but, when they part, they part to meet no more. Lonquillez's fidelity I know: His ſoul is not that of a ſervant: He ſhall provide for Savillon. JULIA is a victim above him—JULIA ſhall be the charge of his maſter.</p>
                  <p>Farewell! When I write again, it ſhall not be to threaten.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XLIV. SAVILLON TO HERBERT.</head>
                  <p>AFTER an interval of torture, I have at laſt received an anſwer from Madame de Montauban—Have I lived to write that name!—but it is fit that I be calm.</p>
                  <p>Her friend has communicated her reſolution of allowing me to ſee her in the houſe of that good Laſune, whom I have mentioned to you in ſome of our converſations, as the common nurſe of both. Were it not madneſs to look back, and that, at preſent, I need the full poſſeſſion of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the idea of Laſune's houſe would recal ſuch things—but they are paſt, never, never to return!</p>
                  <p>I have recovered and can go on calmly. I ſet out to-morrow morning; Thurſday next is the day ſhe has appointed for our interview. I have but to diſpatch this one great buſineſs, and then depart from my native country for ever. Every tie that bound me to this world is now broken, except that which accident gave me in your
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:017578_0215_0FBA6FCD30AAEC60"/>
friendſhip: Before I croſs the Atlantic, I would once more ſee my Herbert: When I have indulged myſelf in that laſt throb of affection, which our friendſhip demands at parting, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for me to do, but to ſhrink up from all the feelings of life, and look forward, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, to its cloſe!</p>
                  <p>I feel, at this moment, as if I were on my death-bed, the neceſſity of a manly compoſure; that ſtifled ſigh was the laſt ſacrifice of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! I am now thinking what I have to do with the hours that remain: Meet me like a man and help me to employ them as I ought. Nothing ſhall drag me back to Europe, and therefore I would ſhake off every occaſion to reviſit it.</p>
                  <p>Though the externals of place and diſtance are not of much importance to me, yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in large towns that I wiſh to avoid. As you mention a deſign of being in Dorſetſhire ſometime ſoon, may I aſk you to make next week that time, and meet me at the town of Poole in that county? Inconſiderable and unknown as I am, there are circumſtances that might mark me out in Picardy; and therefore I ſhall go by Dieppe to that port of <hi>England,</hi> where I know I ſhall, at this ſeaſon, find an opportunity of getting over the Atlantic.</p>

He will wonder, as others will, at ſo rich a man returning to <hi>Martinique.</hi> If a reaſon is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, invent ſome one; it is peculiar to miſery like mine to be incapable of being told.—I ſhall relapſe, if I continue to write.—You will, if it is poſſible, meet me at Poole; if not, write to me thither, where I ſhall find you.

                  <head>LETTER XLV. JULIA TO MARIA.</head>
                  <p>THE hour is almoſt arrived! My huſband has juſt left me: He came into my room in his riding-dreſs.—"I ſhall not be at home (ſaid he) till ſupper time, and Rouilleé's ſhooting party will detain him till it is late." The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of my purpoſe preſſed on my tongue, while I anſwered him: I faltered and could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak. "You ſpeak faintly (ſaid Montauban) You are not ill, I hope," taking my hand. I told him, truly, that my head ached a good deal, that it had ached all day, that I meant to try if a walk would do it ſervice. "Perhaps it may," anſwered he, and methought he looked ſteadily, and with a ſort of queſtion, at me; or rather my own mind interpreted his look in that manner.—I believe I bluſhed.—</p>
                  <p>How I tremble as I look on my watch! Would I could recal my promiſe!</p>
                  <p>I am ſomewhat bolder now; but it is not from having conquered my fear; ſomething like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:017578_0218_0FBA6FD86B256900"/>
aſſiſts me.—It wants but a few minutes—the hand that points them ſeems to ſpeak as I watch it:—I come, Savillon, I come!</p>
                  <p>How ſhall I deſcribe our meeting? I am unfit for deſcribing—it cannot be deſcribed—I ſhall be calmer by and by.</p>
                  <p>I know not how I got to the houſe. From the moment I quitted my chamber, I was unconſcious of every thing around me. The firſt object that ſtruck my eye was Savillon! I recollect my nurſe placing me in a chair oppoſite to where he ſat—ſhe left us—I felt the room turning round with me—I had fainted, it ſeems. When I recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I found her ſupporting me in her arms, and holding a phial of ſalts to my noſe. Savillon had my hands in his, gazing on me with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of diſtreſs and terror.—My eye met his, and, for ſome moments, I looked on him, as I have done in my dreams, unmindful of our ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.—The preſſure of his hand awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to recollection. He looked on me more earneſtly ſtill, and breathed out the word JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA!—It was all he could utter; but it ſpoke ſuch things, MARIA!—You cannot underſtand its force. Had you felt it as I did!—I could not, indeed, I could not help burſting into tears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="unknown:017578_0219_0FBA6FD9EF1D4780"/>
"My deareſt children," cried the good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſune, taking our hands which were ſtill folded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſqueezing them in hers. The action had ſomething of that tender ſimplicity in it, which is not to be reſiſted. I wept afreſh; but my tears were leſs painful than before.</p>
                  <p>She fetched a bottle of wine from a cupboard, and forced me to take a glaſs of it. She offered another to Savillon. He put it by, with a gentle inclination of his head. "You ſhall drink it, indeed, my dear boy, (ſaid ſhe) it is a long time ſince you taſted any thing in this houſe."—He gave a deep ſigh and drank it.</p>
                  <p>She had given us time to recover the power of ſpeech; but I knew leſs how to begin ſpeaking than before. My eyes now found ſomething in Savillon's, which they were aſhamed to meet.—Laſune left us; I almoſt wiſhed her to ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Savillon ſat down in his former place: He threw his eyes on the ground—"I know not, (ſaid he, in a faltering voice) how to thank you for the condeſcenſion of this interview—our former friendſhip"—I trembled for what he ſeemed about to ſay.—I have not forgotten it," ſaid I, half interrupting him.—I ſaw him ſtart from his former poſture, as if awaked by the ſound of of my voice."—"I aſk not (continued he) to
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:017578_0220_0FBA6FE0534E1F98"/>
be remembered: I am unworthy of your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.—In a ſhort time, I ſhall be a voluntary exile from <hi>France,</hi> and breathe out the remains of life amidſt a race of ſtrangers, who cannot call forth thoſe affections, that would henceforth be ſhut to the world!"—Speak not thus, (I cried) for pity's ſake, ſpeak not thus! Live and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, happy as your virtues deſerve, as JULIA wiſhes you!"—"JULIA wiſh me happy!"—"Oh! Savillon, you know not the heart that you wring thus!—If it has wronged you, you are revenged enough."—"Revenged! revenged on JULIA! Heaven is my witneſs, I intreated this meeting, that my parting words might bleſs her!"—He fell on his knees before me—"May that Power (he cried) who formed this excellence, reward it! May every bleſſing this life can beſtow, be the portion of JULIA! May ſhe be happy, long after the tongue that aſks it, is ſilent for ever, and the heart that now throbs with the wiſh, has ceaſed its throbbing!"—Had you ſeen him, MARIA, as he uttered this!—What ſhould I have done?—Weeping, trembling, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, as it were, of myſelf, I ſpoke I know not what—told him the weakneſs of my ſoul, and lamented the deſtiny that had made me another's. This was too much. When I could recollect my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I felt that it was too much. I would have
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:017578_0221_0FBA6FE16C6A8390"/>
retracted what I had ſaid: I ſpoke of the duty I owed to Montauban, of the eſteem which his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues deſerved.—"I have heard of his worth (ſaid Savillon) I needed no proof to be convinced of it; he is the huſband of JULIA."—There was ſomething in the tone of theſe laſt words, that undid my reſolution again.—I told him of the falſe intelligence I had received of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, without which no argument of prudence, no paternal influence, could have made me the wife of another.—He put his hand to his heart, and threw his eyes wildly to Heaven.—I ſhrunk back at that look of deſpair, which his countenance aſſumed.—He took two or three hurried turns through the room; then, reſuming his ſeat, and lowering his voice, "It is enough (ſaid he) I am fated to be miſerable! but the contagion of my deſtiny ſhall ſpread no farther.—This night I leave <hi>France</hi> forever!"—"This night!" I exclaimed. "It muſt be ſo (ſaid he, with a determined calmneſs) but before I go, let me depoſit in your hands this paper. It is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of that Savillon, who was the friend of JULIA!"—I opened it: It was a will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing his fortune to me. "This muſt not be (ſaid I), this muſt not be. Think not, I conjure you, ſo deſpairingly of life; live to enjoy that fortune, which is ſo ſeldom the reward of merit like thine. I have no title to its diſpoſal." "You
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:017578_0222_0FBA6FE32176DD30"/>
have the beſt one (returned Savillon, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his compoſure) I never valued wealth, but as it might render me in the language of the world, more worthy of thee. To make it thine, was the purpoſe of my wiſhing to acquire it; to make it thine, is ſtill in my power." "I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive this, indeed I cannot. Think of the ſituation in which I ſtand." I preſſed the paper upon him: He took it at laſt, and pauſing, as if he thought, for a moment—"You are right, there may be an impropriety in your keeping it.—Alas! I have ſcarce a friend, to whom I can intruſt any thing; yet I may find one, who will ſee it faithfully executed."</p>
                  <p>He was interrupted by Laſune, who entered ſomewhat hurriedly, and told me, Liſette was come to fetch me, and that ſhe had met my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in her way to the houſe. "We muſt part then (ſaid he) for ever!—let not a thought of the unfortunate Savillon diſturb the happineſs which Heaven allots to JULIA; ſhe ſhall hear of him but once again—when that period arrives, it will not offend the happy Montauban, if ſhe drops a tear to the memory of one, whoſe love was expiated by his ſufferings!"—MARIA! was it a breach of virtue, if then I threw myſelf on his neck, if then I wept on his boſom? His look, his laſt look! I ſee it ſtill! never ſhall I forget it!—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="unknown:017578_0223_0FBA6FE7F531CC40"/>
Merciful GOD! at whoſe altar I vowed fidelity to another! impute not to me as a crime the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Savillon;—thou canſt ſee the purity of that heart, which bleeds at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleven at night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You know my preſentiments of evil; never did I feel them ſo ſtrong as at preſent. I tremble to go to bed—the taper that burns by me is dim, and methinks my bed looks like a grave!</p>
                  <p>I was weak enough to call back Liſette. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome little buſineſs for her; the poor girl obſerved that I looked ill, and aſked if ſhe ſhould ſit by me: I had almoſt ſaid Yes, but had courage enough to combat my fears in that inſtance. She bid me Good-night—there was ſomewhat ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn in her utterance of that Good-night; I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy mine was not without its particular emphaſis, for ſhe looked back wiſtfully as I ſpoke.—</p>
                  <p>I will ſay my prayers and forget it; pray for me too, my friend.—I have need of your prayers, indeed I have—Good-night to my deareſt MARIA!</p>

If I have recollection enough—Oh! my MARIA!—I will be calm—it was but a dream—will you bluſh for my weakneſs? yet hear me—If this ſhould be the laſt time I ſhall ever write—the memory of my friend mingles with the thought!—yet methinks I could, at this time, beyond any other, die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
                  <p>My fears had given way to ſleep; but their impreſſion was on my fancy ſtill. Methought I ſat in our family monument at <hi>Belville,</hi> with a ſingle glimmering lamp, that ſhewed the horrors of the place, when, on a ſudden, a light like that of the morning, burſt on the gloomy vault, and the venerable figures of my fathers, ſuch as I had ſeen them in the pictures of our hall, ſtood ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benignity upon me! The attitude of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt was that of attention, his finger reſting upon his lip.—I liſtened—when ſounds of more than terreſtrial melody ſtole on my ear, borne, as it were on the diſtant wind, till they ſwelled at laſt to muſic ſo exquiſite, that my raviſhed ſenſe was ſtretched too far for deluſion, and I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woke in the midſt of the intrancement!</p>
                  <p>I roſe, with the memory of the ſounds full upon my mind; the candle I had ordered to ſtand by me was ſtill unextinguiſhed. I ſat down to the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:017578_0225_0FBA6FEB690C2DC0"/>
organ, and, with that ſmall ſoft ſtop you uſed to call ſeraphic, endeavoured to imitate their beauty. And never before did your JULIA play an air ſo heavenly, or feel ſuch extaſy in the power of ſound! When I had catched the ſolemn chord that laſt aroſe in my dream, my fingers dwelt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily on the keys, and methought I ſaw the guardian ſpirits around me, liſtening with a rapture like mine!—</p>
                  <p>But it will not laſt—the bliſsful deluſion is gone, and I am left a weak, an unhappy woman ſtill!</p>
                  <p>I am ſick at heart, MARIA, and a faintneſs like that of death—</p>
                  <p>The fit is over, and I am able to write again; and I will write while I am able. Methinks, my friend, I am taking farewell of you, and I would lengthen out the lingering words as much as I can. I am juſt now recalling the ſcenes of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful happineſs we have enjoyed together.—I imagine I feel the arm of my MARIA thrown round my neck—her tears fall on my boſom!—Think of me when I am gone—This faintneſs again.—Farewell! farewell! perhaps—</p>

                  <p>IT is done, Segarva, it is done!—the poor unthinking—Support me, my friend, ſupport me with the thoughts of that vengeance I owe to my honour—the guilty JULIA has but a few hours to live.</p>
                  <p>I did but liſten a moment at the door; I thought I heard her maid upon the ſtairs—it is not yet the time.—Hark!—it was not my wife's bell—the clock ſtruck eleven—never ſhall ſhe hear it ſtrike that hour again!—</p>

illneſs ſeemed of the mind, and when ſhe ſpoke to me, ſhe betrayed the embarraſſment of guilt. I gave her the drug as a cordial. She took it from me, ſmiling, and her look ſeemed to loſe its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. She drank my health! She was dreſſed in a white ſilk bed-gown, ornamented with pale pink ribbands. Her cheek was gently fluſhed from their reflection; her blue eyes were turned upwards as ſhe drank and a dark brown ringlet lay on her ſhoulder.—Methinks I ſee her now—how like an angel ſhe looked! Had ſhe been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, Segarva!—You know, you know, it is impoſſible ſhe can be innocent.</p>
                  <p>Let me recollect myſelf—a man, a ſoldier, the friend of Segarva!—</p>
                  <p>At the word <hi>innocent</hi> I ſtopped; I could ſcarce hold my pen; I roſe from my ſeat, I know not why. Methought ſome one paſſed behind me in the room. I ſnatched up my ſword in one hand and a candle in the other.—It was my own figure in a mirror that ſtood at my back.—What a look was mine!—am I a murderer?—Juſtice cannot murder, and the vengeance of Montauban is juſt.</p>

Lonquillez has been with me.—I durſt not queſtion him when he entered the apartment—but the deed is not done: he could not find Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon. After watching for ſeveral hours, he met a peaſant, whom he had ſeen attending him the day before, who informed him, that the ſtrange gentleman had ſet off, ſome time after it grew dark, in a poſt-chaiſe, which drove away at full ſpeed. Is my revenge then incomplete?—or is one victim ſufficient to the injured honour of a huſband?—What a victim is that one!</p>
                  <p>I went down ſtairs to let Lonquillez out by a private paſſage, of which I keep the key. When I was returning to my apartment, I heard the ſound of muſic proceeding from my wife's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; there is a double door on it; I opened the outer one without any noiſe, and the inner has ſome panes of glaſs a-top, through which I ſaw a part of the room. Segarva! ſhe ſat at the organ, her fingers preſſing on the keys, and her look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſed with enthuſiaſtic rapture!—the ſolemn ſounds ſtill ring in my ear! ſuch as angels might play, when the ſainted ſoul aſcends to Heaven!

It is now that I feel myſelf a coward; the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid draught has begun to operate!—She thinks herſelf in danger; a phyſician is ſent for, but he lives at a diſtance; before he arrives—Oh! Segarva!</p>
                  <p>She begged I would quit the chamber; ſhe ſaw my confuſion, and thought it proceeded from diſtreſs at her illneſs.—Can guilt be thus miſtreſs of herſelf?—let me not think that way—my brain is too weak for it!—Liſette again.</p>
                  <p>She is guilty, and I am not a murderer! I go to—</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>MADAM,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE writer of this letter has no title to addreſs you, except that which common friendſhip and common calamity may give him.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt the fatal ſcenes, which he has lately witneſſed, his recollection was loſt; when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, it ſpoke of Mademoiſelle de Roncilles, the firſt, he believes, and deareſt friend of the moſt amiable, but moſt unfortunate Madame de Montauban The office he now undertakes is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; but it is neceſſary.—You muſt ſoon be told, that your excellent friend is no more! Hear it then from one, who knew her excellence, as you did; who tells the horrid circumſtances of her death with a bleeding heart.—Yes, Madam, I muſt prepare you for horrors; and while the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance tears my own boſom, aſſume the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is neceſſary for yours.</p>
                  <p>On the evening of Thurſday laſt, I was told Madam de Montauban was a good deal indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and had gone to bed before her uſual time.
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:017578_0231_0FBA6FFB7112AEE0"/>
At a very ſhort and ſilent ſupper, I perceived her huſband uncommonly agitated, and, as ſoon as decency would allow me, withdrew and left him. Betwixt eleven and twelve o'clock. (I had not gone to bed) one of the maid-ſervants came to my room, begging I would inſtantly attend her to the chamber of her miſtreſs, who was ſo extremely ill, that without immediate aſſiſtance, they feared the very worſt conſequences. I had formerly ſtudied a little phyſic, and been in uſe to practice it in ſome particular campaigns, when abler aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance could not be had. I ran down ſtairs with the ſervant, deſiring my own man to ſeek out a little caſe of lancets and follow us. The girl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her miſtreſs of my being at the door of her apartment. She deſired I might come in, and with that ſmile, which ſickneſs could not quench, ſtretched out her hand to me. I found her pulſe low and weak, and ſhe complained of a ſtrange fluttering at her heart, which hardly allowed her to ſpeak. I was afraid to venture on bleeding, and only gave her a little of ſome common reſtoratives that were at hand. She found herſelf ſomewhat relieved, and ſat up in her bed ſupported by her maid. Montauban entered the room: His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſurpriſed me: It was not that of diſtreſs alone, it was marked with turbulence and horror. It ſeemed to hurt his wife. At that moment ſhe
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:017578_0232_0FBA6FFC706501F0"/>
was ſcarce able to ſpeak; but ſhe forced out a few broken words, begging him to leave the room, for that her illneſs affected him too much. He withdrew in ſilence. In a little time ſhe ſeemed a good deal eaſier; but her pulſe was ſtill lower than before. She ordered her maid to call Monſ. de Montauban again: "I dare not truſt to future moments (ſaid ſhe) and I have ſomething im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to reveal to him."—I offered to leave the room as he entered.—"His friend may hear it"—ſhe ſaid, in a faltering voice. She fixed her eye languidly, but ſteadily on Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban. He advanced towards her with an eager gaze, without uttering a word. When ſhe would have ſpoken, her voice failed her again, and ſhe beckoned, but with a modeſty in her action, ſignifying her deſire that he ſhould ſit down by her. She took his hand; he ſeemed unconſcious of her taking it, and continued to bend a look of earneſtneſs upon her.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe had recovered the power of utterance, "I feel, Sir, (ſaid ſhe) ſomething in this illneſs predictive of the worſt; at any rate, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it. If I am now to die, I hope (lifting up her eyes with a certain meek aſſurance which it is impoſſible to paint) I die in peace with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! there is one account which I wiſh to ſettle with you. Theſe moments of eaſe, which I enjoy,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:017578_0233_0FBA70009656AC78"/>
are allowed me to confeſs my offence, and intreat your forgiveneſs."</p>
                  <p>"Thou wert guilty then?"—exclaimed her huſband, ſtarting from his ſeat. She pauſed in aſtoniſhment at the impaſſioned geſture he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed—"Speak!" cried Montauban, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himſelf a little, his voice ſuffocated with the word.</p>
                  <p>"When you have heard me (ſaid JULIA), you will find I am leſs guilty than unfortunate; yet I am not innocent, for then I ſhould not have been the wife of Montauban."</p>
                  <p>"When I became yours, my heart owned you not for the lord of its affections; there was an attachment—yet look not ſo ſternly on me.—He, in whoſe favour that prepoſſeſſion was formed, would not have wronged you if he could. His virtues were the objects of my affection; and had Savillon been the thing you fear, JULIA had been guiltleſs even of loving him in ſecret. Till ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday he never told me his love; till yeſterday he knew not I had ever loved him."—</p>
                  <p>"But yeſterday," cried Montauban, ſeeming to check the agitation he had ſhewn before, and lowering his voice into a tone of calm ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="unknown:017578_0234_0FBA70026BDE6860"/>
"For the offence of yeſterday, (ſaid ſhe) I would obtain your pardon, and die in peace. I met Savillon in ſecret; I ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, and pitied it.—Was it a crime thus to meet him? Was it a crime to confeſs my love, while I received the laſt farewell of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Savillon? This is my offence—perhaps the laſt that JULIA can commit, or you forgive!"</p>
                  <p>He claſped his hands convulſively together, and throwing up to Heaven a look of deſpair, fell ſenſeleſs into my arms. JULIA would have ſprung to his aſſiſtance, but her ſtrength was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the effort: Her maid ſcreamed for help, and ſeveral of the ſervants ruſhed into the room. We recovered the hapleſs Montauban; he looked round wildly for a moment, then faſtening his eye on JULIA—"I have murdered thee, he cried; that draught I gave thee—that draught was death!" He would have preſſed her to his boſom; ſhe ſunk from his embrace—her cloſing eye looked piteous upon him—her hand was half ſtretched to his—and a ſingle ſigh breathed out her ſoul to Heaven!</p>
                  <p>"She ſhall not die," he cried, eagerly catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of her hand, and bending over her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs body with a glare of inconceivable horror in his aſpect. I laid hold of his arm, endeavouring
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:017578_0235_0FBA700408490478"/>
to draw his attention towards me; but he ſeemed not to regard me, and continued that frightful gaze on the remains of his much injured wife. I made a ſign for the ſervants to aſſiſt me, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his hand began to uſe a gentle ſort of violence to lead him away. He ſtarted back a few paces, without, however, altering the direction of his eye. "You may torture me (cried he, wildly), I can bear it all—Ha! Segarva there!—let them prove the hand-writing if they can—mark it, I ſay, there is no blood in her face—let me aſk one queſtion of the doctor—you know the effects of poiſon—her lips are white—bid Savillon kiſs them now—they ſhall ſpeak no more, JULIA ſhall ſpeak no more!"</p>
                  <p>Word was now brought me, that the phyſician, who had been ſent for to the aſſiſtance of JULIA, was arrived. He had come, alas! too late for her; but I meant to uſe his ſkill on behalf of Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban. I repeated my endeavours, to get him away from the dreadful object before him; and at laſt, though he ſeemed not to heed the intreaties I made uſe of, he allowed himſelf to be conducted to his own apartment, where the doctor was in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There were marks of confuſion in this man's countenance which I wiſhed to diſſipate. I made uſe of ſome expreſſive looks to ſignify that he ſhould appear more eaſy; and, aſſuming that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:017578_0236_0FBA700621A7EBC8"/>
myſelf, begged Montauban to allow him to feel his pulſe.—"You come to ſee my wife, (ſaid he, turning towards him)—tread ſoftly—ſhe will do well enough when ſhe wakes. There!—(ſtretching out his arm)—your hand trembles ſadly; I will count the beatings myſelf—here is ſomething amiſs; but I am not mad.—Your name is Arpentier, mine is Montauban—I am not mad."—The phyſician deſired him to get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and go to bed. I mean to do ſo, for I have not ſlept theſe two nights—but it is better not. Give me ſome potion againſt bad dreams—that's well thought on, that's well thought on."</p>
                  <p>His ſervant had begun to undreſs him. He went for a few minutes into his cloſet; he returned with his night-gown on, and his look appeared more thoughtful and leſs wild than formerly. He made a ſlight bow to the phyſician: "I ſhall ſee you when I riſe, Sir.—Rouillé, is it not? (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to me, and ſqueezing my hand)—I am not fit for talking juſt now, I know I am not.—Good-night!" I left him, whiſpering his ſervant to ſtay in the room, unperceived, if he could; but, at any rate, not to leave his maſter alone.</p>
                  <p>I know not how I was ſo long able to command
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:017578_0237_0FBA700AD3676C28"/>
reflection. The moment I left Montauban, the horror of the ſcene I had witneſſed ruſhed upon my mind, and I remember nothing of what paſſed, till I found myſelf kneeling before the breathleſs remains of the ill-fated JULIA. The doctor was ſtanding by me with a letter in his hand: It was written by Montauban, and had been found open on the table of his ſtudy. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentier gave it me, ſaying, it contained things which ſhould be communicated only to the friends of the Count. From it I diſcovered the dreadful certainty of what I had before gathered from the diſtracted words of Montauban. He had ſuppoſed his wife faithleſs, his bed diſhonoured, and had revenged the imagined injury by poiſon.—My GOD! I can ſcarce, at this moment, believe that I have waked and ſeen this!</p>
                  <p>But his ſervant now came running into the room, calling for us to haſten into his maſter's chamber, for that he feared he was dead. We ruſhed into the room together—it was too true Montauban was no more! The doctor tried, he confeſſed, without hope, ſeveral expedients to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive him; but they failed of ſucceſs. I hung over the bed, entranced in the recollection of the fate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful events I had ſeen. Arpentier, from the habit of looking on the forms of death, was more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of himſelf; after examining the body, and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:017578_0238_0FBA700C2C6CD168"/>
pondering a little on the behaviour of the count, he went into the cloſet, where he found, on a ſmall table, a phial uncorked, which he brought to me. It explained the fate of Montauban; a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel faſtened to it, was inſcribed LAUDANUM; its deadly contents he had ſwallowed in his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, before he went to bed.</p>
                  <p>Such was the concluſion of a life diſtinguiſhed by the exerciſe of every manly virtue, and, except in this inſtance, unſtained with a crime. While I mourn the fate of his moſt amiable wife, I recal the memory of my once dearly-valued friend, and would ſhelter it with ſome apology if I could. Let that honour which he worſhipped plead in his defence.—That honour we have worſhipped together, and I would not weaken its ſacred voice; but I look on the body of Montauban—I weep over the pale corpſe of JULIA!—I ſhudder at the ſacrifices of miſtaken honour, and lift up my hands to pity and to juſtice.</p>
