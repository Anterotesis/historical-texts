            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT was an ancient Cuſtom not only among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but even among the Gentiles, long before <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to <hi>Separate</hi> from common Uſe, by certain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Rites of <hi>Dedication,</hi> their Temples, Altars and Places of religious Worſhip. And we find God himſelf expreſſly approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Cuſtom in Reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> (who were his peculiar People, and bleſſed with a more adequate Knowledge of his Name) inaſmuch as he vouchſafed his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Preſence in the Places ſo ſeparated and dedicated by them. Of this, the Chapter, from which the Text of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is taken, furniſhes ſufficient Evidence; and in the <hi>third</hi> Verſe of the ſucceeding Chapter God expreſſly tells <hi>Solomon</hi>—<q>I have heard thy Prayer and thy Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—I have hallowed this Houſe which
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:009011_0004_10306824EDADC960"/>
thou haſt built, to put my Name there for ever; and mine Eyes and mine Heart ſhall be there continually.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AGREEABLE to this, the primitive <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> even in the moſt difficult Times (as we have the utmoſt Reaſon to believe) did not reſort to any Place for ſtated Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, till they had firſt <hi>ſeparated</hi> or <hi>ſet it apart,</hi> if not by public Rites, yet at leaſt by peculiar Thankſgivings, and Prayers for a ſanctified Uſe thereof. And in the more proſperous Days of Chriſtianity, when Kings and Potentates became Converts to its Truths, theſe <hi>Separations</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with far greater Ceremony, and diſtinguiſhed by the more pompous Names of <hi>Dedications, Conſecrations,</hi> and the like; in all which acts, <q>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers of the Church were not looked upon as ſufficient, without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Panegyrical Orations, and Forms of Adoration and Praiſe more peculiar to the Occaſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">SEE <hi>Bingham</hi>'s Eccles: Antiquities, who gathers this from <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who has preſerved an Oration delivered on one of theſe Occaſions.</note>

               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:009011_0005_10306826A4EA6C98"/>THIS Cuſtom was very early introduced into our Mother-Country; for we find <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> himſelf, who has been ſtyled the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of our Anceſtors, agreeable to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, converting ſuch <hi>Idol-temples,</hi> as were fit for Uſe, into Chriſtian Churches, by the Rites of <hi>Conſecration.</hi> And in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it was expreſly provided, that all Churches <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be <hi>conſecrated</hi> within two Years after they were finiſhed; <note n="*" place="bottom">—ut omnes Cathedrales Eccleſiae, et Conventuales, ac Parochiales, a tempore Perfectionis ipſarum, inſia Dien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuem, per Dioeceſanos ad quos pertinent, vel eorum Auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritate per alios, <hi>Conſecrationes</hi> acciperent.</note> nor do our <hi>Laws</hi> take any Notice of Churches or Chapels, as ſuch, till they are formally conſecrated. <note n="‡" place="bottom">V.

            </p>
            <p>NOW, it is to be preſumed that, in theſe Laws and Regulations, our Fore-fathers were actuated by the ſame pious Motives that influenced the primitive Chriſtians; namely the Hopes (grounded on the <hi>old</hi> Teſtament, and more particularly on the <hi>new</hi>) that God would be ſpecially preſent with them, to hear their Prayers and pardon their Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in thoſe Places thus <hi>ſeparated</hi> to his Service, and <hi>dedicated</hi> to his Name. And
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:009011_0006_103068285E674F58"/>
thus run the Preambles of theſe very Laws themſelves—"<hi>Domus Dei, materiali Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto non differens a privatis, per Myſterium Dedicationis inviſibile, fit Templum Domini, ad expiationem Delictorum &amp; divinam Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiam implorandam</hi>—"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Vid De Conſecr. &amp; Reform.

            <p>IN this Country, then, where our Church is far removed from the Government of her Biſhops, and where it hath not yet been the Method (nor indeed would Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances always admit) before a ſtated Uſe of our newly-erected Places of Worſhip, to ſollicit a ſpecial Authority for <hi>Separating</hi> them to God's Service, in the expreſs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of any approved Ritual; all we can do is to preſerve ſo much of the original De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Thing as <hi>Preſbyters</hi> may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably perform, and which, in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:009011_0007_1030682C09D56520"/>
may be thought more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately neceſſary for Edification. We may meet on a fixt Day; and, in Conjunction with the common Service of the Church, may uſe ſuch particular Forms of Prayer, and Sermons, as may be ſuitable to the Occaſion; profeſſing before God and the World, our humble Deſire of <hi>ſetting apart</hi> ſuch Places to his Service, and keeping them continually ſacred to that pious End.</p>
            <p>THUS much is in the Power of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society; and thus much, at leaſt, as Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it is our particular Duty to do, with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Solemnity, Gravity, and Love to God, whenſoever we <hi>devote</hi> any particular Place to his Service; in Order that for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when we enter therein, we may conſider ourſelves as entering into the Place where hath promiſed to manifeſt his more immediate Preſence, and behave ourſelves when there (as the primitive Chriſtians are <note n="*" place="bottom">Chryſoſtom.</note> ſaid to have done in their Places of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) with the utmoſt Reverence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as in the <hi>Palace of the</hi> GREAT KING.</p>

            <p>TO this ſucceeded the following SERMON; and if a Judgment might be formed from the Attention wherewith it was received by a very crouded Audience, and even by ſome who have given but few other Inſtances of their PARTIALITY in the Author's favour; he may flatter himſelf that now, when it appears from the Preſs, and ſollicits a candid Peruſal in the Cloſet, it may be of ſome Service.

            <p>ALTHOUGH I have only read to you the foregoing Verſes, as being thoſe which I am more immediately to inſiſt upon, yet the greateſt Part of the Chapter from which they are taken, containing the Hiſtory of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Dedication</hi> of the Temple, and which has been already read to you as the firſt Leſſon for this Day's Service, will be the Subject of my following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>BUT, before I proceed, it may perhaps be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that I ſhould carry you back into remote
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009011_0012_1030683A0909EF30"/>
Antiquity, to inveſtigate the Origin and ſhew the Reaſonableneſs of CONSECRATING, DEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATING, or SETTING APART, particular Places for the more immediate and public Worſhip of the ſupreme God. And ſuch an Enquiry, it muſt be confeſs'd, would furniſh out a moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Detail; no way unſuitable to this Day's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. But the Time being ſhort, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Plan in View, I ſhall touch but ſlightly on theſe Matters.</p>
            <p>THE great Progenitors of our Race, ADAM and EVE, when they firſt ſprung from the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand of their munificent Creator, no doubt, felt their Hearts bound with Joy and Gratitude unutterable. Every Thing within and without them contributed to heighten this Joy into the moſt tranſcendent Extaſy. The Curioſity of their own Structure, the Paradiſe that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, the unfading Beauty, the' eternal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and yet continual Novety, of its Scenes (while they continued in their State of Innocence) led them, doubtleſs, at all Times and in all Places, into the moſt fervent Acknowledgments of that Goodneſs from whence the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Nevertheleſs, it is no way improbable but that they had ſome <hi>conſecrated</hi> Place, ſome choſen Bower, by Brook or by Fountain, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the bloomy Honors of Paradiſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009011_0013_1030683BCB27F8E8"/>
(at ſtated Times, and at proper Intervals) they might retire from the Heat of the Day, to offer up their more immediate Praiſes for <hi>creating</hi> Love and <hi>preſerving</hi> Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever may be in this, one of the firſt Things we find their Deſcendents employed in, after the Fall, was their ſolemn offering up "the Fruits of the Earth, and the Firſtlings of their Flocks", in Places ſet apart for that End; and, after the Flood, NOAH no ſooner deſcends from the Ark than he is found erecting an Altar unto the Lord. <hi>Abraham</hi> too planted a Grove in <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> where he called on the Name of the everlaſting God; and this God himſelf, thro' four whole Chapters of <hi>Exodus,</hi> is found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing <hi>Moſes</hi> how to erect and adorn that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tabernacle that we read of there.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe Places of Worſhip were agreeable to the State of a People, in thoſe early Ages, migrating from Place to Place. But when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſettled, and diſtinct Societies formed, in the Place of Groves and temporary Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſuperb Temples were erected, And thus it was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the Time of errecting that Temple of unparallel'd Magnificence and Architecture divine, whoſe <hi>Dedication</hi> or <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration</hi> my Text refers to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009011_0014_10306841BB19F1A0"/>AFTER journeying for many Years thro' the Wilderneſs, after ſuſtaining many bloody Wars with their fierce Enemies, that People had now got full Poſſeſſion of the Land of Promiſe, and enjoy'd that happy Tranquility, which their Souls had long and earneſtly wiſh'd for.</p>
            <p>AND now what Improvement doth their illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Monarch make of this Occaſion? Doth he forget the GOD OF ISRAEL, that had led his People thro' ſo many Dangers? Doth he turn the Fruits of PEACE entirely to Works of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Import, or of low ſelfiſh Enjoyment? No! But he remembers the Intimation given by the <hi>Prophet Nathan</hi> to his Father <hi>David,</hi> how that his Son after him ſhould build an <hi>Houſe</hi> (not a moveable and temporary <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> but a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſettled <hi>Houſe</hi>) to the Name of the Lord for ever.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. vii. 13.</note> Accordingly, with his whole Heart and Spirit, he ſets about this divine Work, and writes to diſtant Places, for an amazing Store of Materials of every Sort.

And now the Lord hath given me Reſt on every Side, ſo that there is neither Adverſary nor evil Occurrent: And behold, I purpoſe to build an Houſe to the Name of the Lord my God; as he ſpake unto <hi>David</hi> my Father, ſaying, Thy Son, whom I will ſet upon thy Throne in thy Room, he ſhall build an Houſe unto my Name.

            <p>ON that memorable Day, the Elders and Judges of Cities, the Heads of Tribes and Chiefs of Families, aſſembled themſelves before King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and began the Solemnity with a grand Proceſſion from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> in Order to bring from thence the ARK OF THE COVENANT, containing the two TABLES of the LAW; which had been depoſited there by <hi>David</hi> (when he brought it from the Houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. vi. 12, 17.</note> of <hi>Obed, Edom</hi>) in a temporary Tabernacle, until a fix'd Houſe ſhould be prepar'd for its Reception.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:009011_0017_10306849395A7308"/>IN the like ſolemn Manner did they return from <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> to the Mount of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Prieſts bearing the ARK with the LAW, and the <hi>Levites</hi> the TABERNACLE in which it had been placed, with all the Holy Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Sanctuary;<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Kings, Ch. viii.</note> that there might remain, no Occaſion for <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor Pretence for Schiſm, or Worſhip in any other Place ſave that which was now dedicated to the Lord.</p>
            <p>SOLOMON and his grand Retinue being now arrived at the Temple, in the midſt of Sacrifices of Sheep and Oxen innumerable; the Prieſts, whoſe Privilege it was (leaving their Attendants in the outer Courts, and before the Houſe) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered firſt into the holy Place, and then into the <hi>moſt Holy,</hi> and there with ſolemn Awe they depoſited the Ark in the Place prepared for it, under the Wings of the Golden Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, that expanded themſelves from Wall to Wall, ſhading the MERCY-SEAT and the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT behold now a moſt ſtupendous Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance!

of Muſic, to be heard in praiſing and thanking God, than lo! a Cloud of thick Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, declaring the immediate preſence of the Glory of the Lord fill'd the whole Houſe; ſo that the Prieſts durſt not ſtand to miniſter by Reaſon thereof, but retreated to the outer Courts with the utmoſt Conſternation.</p>
            <p>AND here let us pauſe, ponder and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, on the Nature and Meaning of this wonderful Phaenomenon. Strange it may ſeem that a GOD who is LIGHT itſelf ſhould appear in thick Darkneſs. But let us not miſtake the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Darkneſs as any way ſimilar to what we vulgarly call ſo. Nor let us think that it was nothing more than the Pillar of Cloud, in which the SCHECHINAH, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>AS the SON of GOD, when he came into the World to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem Mankind, did, of his infinite Condecenſion, take upon him their Nature as a Veil to his Divinity, that he might thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them Face to Face; ſo the great JEHOVAH, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> did it by his divine SCHECHINAH, or the Preſence of his <hi>Glory,</hi> abiding under the Form of a Pillar of Cloud and Pillar of Fire.</p>
                  <p>THIS well-known Appearance it was that went before the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs; that called <hi>Moſes</hi> up into the Mount; that ſpoke to <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> in the Door of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and that finally reſted "over the moſt holy Place within the Veil; and thence ſpoke from off the Mercy-Seat, that was upon the Ark of the Teſtimony, from between the two Cherubims." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb. vii. 8.</note> And this former Dwelling of God among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the SCHECHINAH, was all along a moſt luminous Type of his Son's future Dwelling in human Nature.</p>
                  <p>NOW, outwardly this Habitation of the Preſence of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity looked as a Cloud, but inwardly as a FIRE; and the <hi>Fire,</hi> or inward Part, was that which was more immediately termed the GLORY, and put on different Appearances according to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Circumſtances. Sometimes it ſhone thro the Cloud in ſuch ſerene and ſoften'd Luſtre that it might be looked upon by common Eyes. Sometimes it prevailed ſo much over the Cloud, that only the Eyes of a favoured few could behold it, and that too by repeated Efforts and by gradual Approaches. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it broke out ſo intenſely ſtrong, eclipſing the Sun, the Cloud and the whole Face of Things, that no human Eye could behold it, or any Thing elſe that fell within its overwhelming Splendors.</p>
                  <p>BEAUTIFULLY has the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbi, <hi>Jehudah,</hi> expreſſed himſelf on this Subject, as he is quoted by Bp. <hi>Patrick.</hi> 
                     <q>Of the GLORY mentioned in Scripture, there is one (ſaith he) which all the ISRAELITES ſaw, ſuch as the CLOUD and conſuming FIRE; another of ſuch a Nature that [only] the Eyes of the Prophets could ſuſtain it; but another ſo pure, and bright to ſuch a Degree, that no Prophet is able to apprehend it, but if he venture too look on it, his Compoſition is diſſolved.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſublime Paſſages of Scripture, beautifully deſcriptive of theſe ſeveral GLORIES. Of the FIRST, where the Cloud and Glory appear together, in mild and ſoften'd Luſtre, I have already mentioned ſundry Inſtances; and this it is which the Pſalmiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, in Pſalm xcvii. 2, 3. <q>CLOUDS and DARKNESS the round about him, and FIRE goeth before him.</q>—Of the SECOND Kind, where the FIRE or GLORY ſo far prevailed over the VEIL or CLOUD, that only a favored <hi>Few</hi> could behold it and that at a Diſtance, or by gradual Approaches, we have a moſt grand Deſcription in <hi>Exodus</hi> xxiv. 10. as it was ſeen by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abibu,</hi> and the ſeventy Elders— <q>And they ſaw the GOD OF ISRAEL, and there was under <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as it were a paved Work of Sapphire-Stone, and as it was the Body of Heaven in his Clearneſs</q>—or the united Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of all the heavenly Luminaries. And when <hi>Moſes</hi> was to be called nearer to this glory, ſix Days was he in his Approach to it, while the Lord kindly veiled it before him, nor was it till the ſeventh Day that he was taken into the midſt of it.</p>
                  <p>BUT as to the THIRD GLORY, which in its unveiled Splendor eclipſes all the created Luminaries of the Univerſe, ſeeing no human Eye has been able to behold it, ſo no human Language has been able to deſcribe it, otherwiſe than by the Negative Terms of DARKNESS, or <q>Light which no man can approach, or behold and live.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 16. <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiii. 18.</note>
                     </q> For that which overwhelms and hides the view of all things elſe, and yet is itſelf beyond the Power of all View, muſt, in reſpect to us, be the ſame as total DARKNESS.</p>
                  <p>THIS high Degree of GLORY is that in which the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence of the Godhead ſeems to have appeared on all ſpecial Occaſions. This it was that broke in upon St. <hi>Paul</hi> at Noon-Day, ſo intenſely ſtrong, that the Sun ſhone to him in vain; for "he could not ſee for the Glory of that Light, but was led by the Hand of thoſe that were with him," who, it is preſumed, ſaw only a leſſer Degree of this aſtoniſhing and overwhelming Light. This too it was that filled the whole Body of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, at the <hi>Conſecrating</hi> thereof, ſo that <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had entered into the ſecond Glory and beheld it, was not able to enter into this.</p>
                  <p>CAN we doubt, then, but that it was the ſame Superior GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, dazzling and overwhelming, even to thick DARKNESS itſelf, that aſtoniſhed the Prieſts at the Conſecration of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Had it been the more uſual Appearance of the Cloud and the Glory together, it is not to be imagined that they would have been driven by it from the Service at the Altar as they now were;—with a View, no doubt, in the Conduct of Providence, to "intimate that their Miniſtry and Way of Worſhip ſhould ceaſe when the Meſſiah came, in whom the Fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelt bodily." Indeed, we are expreſly told that the Glory did, on this Occaſions, break entirely out of the Cloud; and after it had filled the whole Houſe, <q>dazzling rather than enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening (ſaith the learned Bp. <hi>Patrick</hi>) ſo that nothing elſe could be ſeen</q> while it continued there, it ſettled at laſt in the moſt holy Place.</p>
                  <p>THESE Remarks I thought neceſſary, in order to juſtify the Explanation that I have ventured to give of the Phaenomenon that aſtoniſhed the Prieſts, at the Dedication of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple.</p>
                  <p>NO Perſon ſeems to have and more beautiful and accurate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptives on this Subject than our ſublime Poet <hi>Milton,</hi> in the Paſſage already referred to—

Circumſtances would admit, I come now to make an Application of the whole to the Purpoſe of this Day's Solemnity.</p>
            <p>WE too, my Brethren, have been building a HOUSE to the Lord; not a ſuperb and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ONE, fitted to the oſtentatious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the LAW; but a HOUSE decently neat and elegantly plain, <note n="*" place="bottom">The Houſe here ſpoken of well deſerves the above Character, being a very elegant Building, executed in the beſt Taſte.

We too are here aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in the Preſence of Almighty God, and in the Sight of Men and Angels, to make a ſolemn OFFERING of THIS HOUSE to the Name of the Lord; and to <hi>ſet it apart</hi> to the Purpoſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for ever.</p>
            <p>BY this Work of ours, we pretend not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any peculiar Sanctity on particular Places, or Portions of inanimate Nature. What we do is only declarative of our own fixt Intention of endeavouring, thro' God's Grace, to ſanctify ourſelves in this Place, in the full Hopes of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpiritual Conſolation of his divine Preſence therein; and entering into a ſolemn Engagement, for ourſelves and our Poſterity, of keeping it for ever ſacred to theſe pious Uſes,

agreeable to the pure Model of that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Church, whereof we are Members.</p>
            <p>THIS Labor of our Love, however unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily performed, and by however mean Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we hope will be accepted in and thro' the Mediation of Chriſt Jeſus. A Sign from Heaven to confirm this Hope, we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect! a CLOUD OF GLORY, declaring the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Preſence of God among us, we look not to ſee! Types and Shadows and the Burden of Ceremonies are done away. But behold, a greater Evidence is here! The Son of God himſelf hath been among us, and hath left in our Hands the GOSPEL of Salvation, the Words of eternal Truth, declaring that—"Where two or three are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in God's Name, there will he be in the midſt of them." By the Eye of Scripture Faith, that faſt Anchor of the Soul, we can ſee him, we can feel him vitally preſent with us! we can enjoy Union and Communion with him; and, in our <hi>moſt holy Placee,</hi> we can behold him ſeated on another <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi> than that of the Temple and the <hi>Law,</hi> and hear him ſpeaking in another Manner than from within the <hi>Vail!</hi> We can behold him ſeated on the <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi> of REDEEMING LOVE, and hear him ſpeaking in the comfortable Overtures of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace!</hi>

            <p>AND firſt, then, if we, as a religious Society, would hope that God would continue among us in this Place which we have <hi>dedicated</hi> to his Name, we muſt be careful to improve ourſelves in "all Manner of holy Converſation and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, not forgetting the <hi>Aſſembling</hi> ourſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the Manner of ſome is."<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. x. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND here, as this Neglect of "Aſſembling together," in the Place where God's Honour more immediately dwells, is an Evil of the moſt ungrateful kind, and which cannot but provoke him above any other, to withdraw his more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Preſence from a People, it may not be amiſs, with all Candor and Affection, to addreſs a few Things to thoſe whoſe "Manner" this is; altho' it muſt be confeſs'd that it is hard even for <hi>Charity</hi> herſelf to imagine any plauſible Pretext for their Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:009011_0028_10306869E92B6DC0"/>THERE is not, I am certain, a Perſon among us that will not acknowledge ſome Sort of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to be due to the ſupreme Lord of Heaven and Earth. Even the DEIST himſelf will be fond of owning this to be a natural Dictate of eternal Reaſon, founded on the immutable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between the <hi>Creature</hi> and its <hi>Creator.</hi> But then he will ſay that this Homage is a Tribute of the Heart, better to be perform'd in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements of the Cloſet, than amidſt the Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a public Aſſembly. And the kindeſt Thing we can ſuggeſt is, that this Sentiment (it is to be feared) is too much adopted by many Men, in other reſpects of ſtrict Honour, fair Morals and uſeful Members of Society, who, altho' they profeſs to believe in the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, and would ſcorn the Imputation of <hi>Deiſm,</hi> yet ſtill continue in the Neglect of that public Worſhip and thoſe ſacred Ordinances which this Religion hath enjoined. Inſtead of approaching the Courts of the Lord, with their reſpective Families, on thoſe Days that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to his more immediate Service, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſequeſter themſelves from the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in unſocial Retirements; or, if <hi>Decency</hi> obliges not to this, "one goes to his Farm, and another to his Merchandize."</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:009011_0029_1030686CEE8CFE00"/>NOW, we will allow ſuch Perſons, all that they themſelves can aſk. We will in Charity ſuppoſe that they are as regular and fervent in private Devotion as they can poſſibly pretend to be. Yet ſtill we ſay that the Neglect of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip contradicts their Profeſſion of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and is a public Breach of Duty to God, to Society and to their own Souls. And would to Heaven that what may be offered on this Head might gain their Attention; ſeeing no Terms of Aſperity and Reproach ſhall be uſed, unbecoming the Spirit and Temper of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to the public Exerciſe of which, we would woo and win them.</p>
            <p>AND firſt they are intreated to conſider that, from the whole Tenor of Scripture, the public Obſervance of a Sabbath, in Places ſet apart for that Purpoſe, appears to have been God's own Appointment, and has the Promiſe, both of this Life, and that which is to come, annexed to it. Eternal Wiſdom gave an early Intimation of it, while our firſt Parents were yet in Paradiſe, by bleſſing the Seventh Day. Our firſt Parents delivered it in Tradition to their Poſterity, who (as we have ſeen) had their Places of public Worſhip, approved by God's immediate appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among them; and at Length when theſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009011_0030_10306870C6ECCBF0"/>
Traditions were either darkened or deſtroyed, the Lord ſolemnly republiſhed the ſame Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Ordinance from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> ſaying—"Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy."</p>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST, who came not to deſtroy but to fulfil the <hi>Law,</hi> frequented the Places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip, and ſanctified the Sabbath by his Example. The very Form of Prayer, given by him to Mankind, at the Inſtance of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is a public Form. Nay the great Deſign of his Coming into this World and leaving his Goſpel behind him, was to accompliſh a Plan of Redemption for loſt Mankind, to plant a CHURCH for himſelf upon Earth, and form his Diſciples into one public Body, whereof himſelf is the Head.</p>
            <p>BUT how can there be a CHURCH, where there is no Memberſhip, no Communion, no "<hi>Aſſembling</hi> ourſelves together," agreeable to his appointment? How can thoſe be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples now, who do not imitate his firſt Diſciples, and join together "in <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 42.</note> Doctrine, in Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in Breaking of Bread, and in Prayers?" Theſe firſt Diſciples certainly knew their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Will as well as we do now; and if one Sett of Men, who call themſelves Chriſtians, may

            <p>WE do moſt readily allow the private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a Man's own Heart, its full Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and God forbid that any Thing here ſaid ſhould be underſtood as derogatory from that Worſhip, or tending to ſet in Oppoſition to that which is public. It is moſt ſincerely to be wiſhed that no Man ever pretended to it, who did not heartily practiſe it. All true Devotion muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the Heart; but then it muſt not end there. God not only calls us to acknowlege him in our own Minds, but openly and avowedly to acknowlege him before Men; that they, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our good Works, may be ſtirred up to give him the greater Glory.</p>
            <p>OPENLY do the CELESTIAL CHOIRS pour forth their triumphant HALLELUJAH'S to his adorable Name! <hi>Openly</hi> do they caſt their Crowns at his Feet, ſaying—"Worthy art thou, O Lord! to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:009011_0032_103068763180CE48"/>AND ſhall MAN be ſilent, or wholly ſelfiſh, in his Worſhip? Man, ſo highly favoured! Man, the REDEEM'D OF GOD! Man, made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in his Nature; endued with Voice articulate, and appointed to lead the Chorus of this lower World! Shall he forſake his Poſt, and neglect thoſe public Praiſes, which his Tongue was framed to utter? Should he do this, the very <hi>Brute,</hi> and even the <hi>inanimate</hi> Creation, openly and inceſſantly declaring God's Glory Day and Night, would ſhame him for his ſad Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—And ſhame him they do, while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines himſelf to a Worſhip merely ſelfiſh or ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, hides himſelf from the <note n="*" place="bottom">THERE have been Inſtances, where ſome of God's Servants have been ſuffered to withdrawn from the World to a Life, merely ſolitary. But theſe are rare Caſes. not intended for common Uſe, or common Example: nor do we ſpeak to any who pretend to a Life of that Sort.</note> World, abſents himſelf from the <hi>great Congregation</hi> of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bluſhes to utter forth his Maker's Praiſes before Heaven and Earth!</p>
            <p>BY a Worſhip merely ſolitary, a Man may perhaps ſomewhat improve the State of his own Mind, and ſerve himſelf; but, by public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, a Man not only ſerves himſelf, but, as far as poor Duſt and Aſhes can, promotes God's Glory alſo, by acknowledging him before the whole World. The Height of religious Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009011_0033_10306877E775A770"/>
is when both Sorts of Worſhip have their due Place; and however much a Man may boaſt of the Devotion of the Heart, if he keeps it there, the World will be apt to ſuſpect him, and to aſk of him a Sign for the Edification of others.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole then, it appears that a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the public Ordinances of Religion, in one profeſſing to believe the Goſpel, is a plain Contradiction of that Profeſſion, and a Breach of that Duty which we owe to God. And Oh! That it might never be forgotten by any one who <hi>names the Name of Chriſt,</hi> that it is only to thoſe who "confeſs him before Men," that he hath given the moſt comfortable Promiſe of "confeſſing them before his heavenly Father," in that awful Day of Accounts, when he is to ſit abſolute Judge of their Conduct.</p>
            <p>AND yet ſtill, if ſuch be the Caſe in Reſpect to thoſe who, tho' they neglect the public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, nevertheleſs pretend to a more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſpiritual Worſhip of him; what muſt it be with them who are avowed Enemies to both? Would to God that they would put the Matter to their own Souls in their ſerious Moments; if, peradventure, they ever leave themſelves Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be ſerious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:009011_0034_1030687B97DE6D88"/>BUT, to proceed—we were next to ſhew that the Neglect of public Worſhip is alſo a Breach of Duty to Society. Much of what might be offered on this Head is anticipated on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for ſo kind hath God been to us, that whatever he hath commanded us to do for his Glory, is alſo for our own Good. Many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might alſo be drawn from the Nature of Society; our common Wants, our common Dangers, our common Redemption, and our common Dependance for Happineſs here and hereafter, on the ſame Parent-God. But theſe may be paſſed over at preſent; it being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged that Government and Society cannot be maintained on any other Principles than Juſtice, Sobriety and Obedience. And theſe Principles cannot be maintained, in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Degree, but "for the Lord's Sake," and by Means of Religion and its divine Sanctions. And Religion cannot be maintain'd without a due Regard to its public Ordinances,</p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething as lovely and venerable, as it is truly ancient, in the Appointment of a Sabbath, or one Day in Seven, for aſſembling ourſelvs together. By this Means, People are brought forth and aſſociated in their moſt decent Attire. They are humanized and poliſhed and made better acquainted. They provoke one
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009011_0035_1030687F5E008AC0"/>
another, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, to Love and good Works. Nay, as the ſame Apoſtle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtifies, much greater Fruits than theſe may be expected. For, "if <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 23</note> the whole Church be come together in one Place, and there come in one that believeth not, or one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned; he is convinced of all, he is judged of all; and ſo, falling down on his Face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is of a Truth" in that Place.</p>
            <p>WHENCE it appears that the Neglect of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip is alſo a Breach of Duty to Society, and a Bar to the Reformation and good Order of Mankind. It was next to be proved a Breach of Duty to our own Souls. And here little need be ſaid.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER is a Neglect of Duty to God, whatever obſtructs the good of Society, muſt neceſſarily be prejudicial to the Individual. Were Men wholly compoſed of Soul and made entirely for themſelves, a refined ſelfiſh and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Religion might poſſibly ſuit them. But, as the Matter now is, they ſtand in Need of all ſocial Helps to enflame their Devotion; and it is found by Experience that the Exerciſes of Religion are greatly quickened by friendly Communion with our fellow Creatures.

ſuch Occaſions, when all Things are conducted with Decency and Order, a kind of holy Fervor is apt to catch from Boſom to Boſom, riſing to Heights which the ſolitary Worſhipper cannot eaſily reach or conceive. In a Word, 'tis to ſocial and public Worſhip, as hath been already hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our bleſſed Saviour hath given many of the Goſpel-Promiſes. For he hath aſſured us that if even ſo ſmall a Number as "two ſhall agree on Earth, as touching any Thing that they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be done for them of his Father who is in Heaven." <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xviii. 10.</note>

            <p>THESE Arguments, 'tis to be hoped, may convince thoſe who neglect or ſcorn our <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>public Meetings,</hi> that they are, in Reality, acting contrary to their Duty to God; to Society, and to themſelves; and that if it were not for the wiſe Ordinance of a Sabbath, true Religion would ſcarce be found upon Earth. And if Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were gone, Society could not long ſubſiſt, or at leaſt it could not ſubſiſt on the Principles of Virtue, Freedom and Safety.</p>
            <p>AND this leads me to one Argument more, which, as it is of a worldly Nature, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be better heard. If we would wiſh to live happy and ſee good Days; if we would wiſh to ſee our Children dutiful, and our Families in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009011_0037_1030688429118CC0"/>
Subordination round us; if we would wiſh to have our Property ſafe, and our Perſons free from Violence; we ought to ſupport the Credit of Religion, and ſet forward the public Worſhip of God, by our whole Influence, our example, and every other Means in our Power.</p>
            <p>SO far in general. As to you, my Brethren, to whom this Diſcourſe is more particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, it is to be hoped that you will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to conſcientious attendance upon the public Worſhip, the Prayers, the Feſtivals and the Sacraments of our Church, not only from the above Motives, but from the nobler Motives firſt mentioned to you, namely as a Means of continuing the divine Preſence among you, and obtaining that ſpiritual Conſolation and Fellowſhip with God, which, it is to be believed, were your ſincere Deſire in contributing of your Subſtance to the Erection of this Place.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Thing I muſt recommend to you, if you would expect God to dwell among you, as a religious Society. 'Tis UNION and CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY with one Another. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that where Diviſions are among a People, they will come together in the Church, "not for the better, but for the worſe."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xi. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> It is impoſſible, indeed, in this World, while Men
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009011_0038_10306887EAA52CE0"/>
have their Paſſions, their Vanities, their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and their Ambitions, but ſuch Offences will come; and a good Man will be apt to cry out—"Is there no Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi>" no ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Method to prevent or heal theſe painful Wounds? The beſt Way, indeed, is to practiſe all Chriſtian <hi>Forbearance,</hi> and to leave the Reſt to God's Providence; ever bearing in Mind that the Glory of a Church conſiſts not in the Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Numbers, but in the ſtrict Union and Fellowſhip of its Members.</p>
            <p>THE ſame Charity, Love and Candor, that you extend to one another, let me beſeech you, in a particular Manner, to extend to thoſe who are appointed to miniſter among you. Judge of them with Impartiality. Bear in Mind the Difficulties of their Office. Conſider that they are Men of like Infirmities with yourſelves, placed by their Station in a very public Point of View; and thereby what Failings they may have are rendered the more conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>WHEN you enter God's Houſe, let your Minds be impreſſed with deep Senſe of his awful Preſence, and "keep your Feet with all Diligence." Examine carefully into the Motives of your Appearing there; whether it be from an idle Curioſity, or to have a momentary Warmth raiſed in you merely by <hi>Preaching;</hi> or
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009011_0039_1030688B96C400C0"/>
whether it be, in good Earneſt, to humble your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Throne of God, and to join with your fellow Chriſtians in the Solemn Acts of Devotion; "in Supplications, Prayers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions, and giving of Thanks for all Men," agreeable to the moſt compleat Form of our excellent Liturgy?</p>
            <p>PREACHING, my Brethren, was originally a wiſe Inſtitution, to inſtruct the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> to rouſe the <hi>Dull,</hi> to confirm the <hi>Wavering,</hi> and to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>all</hi> in the Diſcharge of their Duty; and, as ſuch, is ſtill retained by our Church as a very neceſſary Addition to her public Service, and is moreover warranted by the Example of our Saviour and his Apoſtles. But then, here lies the Fault, that many will conſider this <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as the principal Part of the public Worſhip itſelf; and no Preaching will be acceptable to them that does not, as it were, hurry them out of themſelves, by captivating the Paſſions, as if that was a nobler and more uſeful Work than to convince the Judgment. Preachers there are, indeed, who can do both in an eminent Degree; and their Succeſs in this Reſpect is a Bleſſing to the Societies to which they belong. But what we complain of is this—that the excellent Liturgy of our Church ſhould be no Motive, or only a ſecondary Motive, for frequenting her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009011_0040_1030688E4CBBC018"/>
and that this wrong Taſte of Hearers is apt to lead to a wrong Taſte in Preaching, and draws Men of warm Tempers, ſmall Abilities, and fond of Pleaſing, into Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of Heat and Zeal, which Reaſon cannot juſtify, and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> requires not at their Hand.</p>
            <p>AS the Reſult, therefore, of what has been ſaid, let me, in the next Place entreat you, as a religious Society, to "hold faſt the Profeſſion of your Faith without Wavering," without Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and without being "blown about by every Wind of Doctrine." I mean not, on this Occaſion, the leaſt Reflection againſt any of thoſe who differ from us in their Perſuaſion. They have, no Doubt, fully examined and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced themſelves in the Faith they hold; and the ſame Indulgence which we freely extend to them, we only crave for ourſelves. Seeing we alſo, as well as they, have embraced the Faith of a particular Church, we alſo, muſt be allowed to have ſufficient Conviction in our own Minds for the Choice we have made. We muſt be allowed to think the Faith of our Church the ſame that "was once delivered to the Saints." We muſt be allowed to conſider her Worſhip as ſocial in its Nature; plain yet ſolemn, and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009011_0041_10306891018B9970"/>
keeping the golden Mean betwixt thoſe idle Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantries that diſtract the Attention to Things purely ſenſible, and thoſe illuſive Reveries that pretend to Refinements which human Nature cannot reach. We muſt be allowed to pay a due Regard to her ancient Diſcipline, her vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Order and her wiſe Conſtitutions, that were planned by Men of ſuperior Eminence, and have ſtood the Teſt of Ages. And, laſtly, we muſt be allowed to look upon theſe Things as Matters, not lightly, wantonly, or raſhly to be given up.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only detain you while I recommend one thing more to you, as a religious Society; and that is, a liberal and beneficent Spirit in contributing to all Works of <hi>Charity</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Concern. And, on this Head, it is with Pleaſure that I confeſs myſelf almoſt abſolved from the Neceſſity of ſaying any Thing. I am rather called to congratulate you on the excellent Spirit that hath already been ſhewn, than to doubt of its Continuance.</p>
            <p>THIS Houſe hath been almoſt wholly built within yourſelves; by the free, voluntary and chearful Contributions of your own Members. Some have ſpared in their Exigence, and ſome out of their Abundance, and that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AND now, O thou moſt holy and ever-adorable LORD GOD omnipotent! our GOD and our Fathers GOD—who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteſt Eternity, and art the Life and Light of the World! What ſhall we render unto thee for ten thouſand times ten thouſand Mercies, which Language would fail us to expreſs, and the whole Period of our Lives to recount!

               <p>IT is good for us, O Almighty Father, that thou haſt called us to this Knowledge, and haſt vouchſafed us theſe Privileges! It is good for us that thou didſt put it into our Minds <hi>to build thee an Houſe to dwell in,</hi> and haſt permitted us to <hi>dedicate</hi> and ſet it apart (as we hope) to the Glory of thy Name for ever! Yet, inaſmuch as we are taught not to put our Truſt in theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marks of Devotion, but that each of us muſt prepare for thee an Habitation inwardly, and a <hi>Temple</hi> in our Hearts; we do, therefore, now come to make a nobler and more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant DEDICATION unto thee! We come, as is our bounden Duty, thro' the Merits and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of our bleſſed REDEEMER, to <hi>dedicate</hi> OURSELVES, our Souls and Bodies, our whole Lives, to thy Service. And, O thou who art the Hearer of Prayer, "to whom Mercies and Forgiveneſſes belong, tho we have rebelled againſt thee," we moſt earneſtly pray that our paſt Offences may be blotted out, that we may be waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt, and that the

               <p>For this End, O merciful God, let the Grace of thy holy Spirit aſſiſt and ſtrengthen us in all our Supplications and Prayers that we ſhall thenceforward offer up to thee in this Place; and be thou graciouſly pleaſed to vouchſafe us thy Preſence therein continually. <hi>As thou wert with</hi> our Fathers, <hi>O Lord our God, ſo be thou with us.</hi> As thy mighty Power brought them (like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old) thro' the Perils of another raging Sea; as thou didſt ſupport them in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Land, while it was yet another Wilderneſs; as thou didſt at Length give them goodly Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations therein, and, in thy divine Favour, made Choice of them and their Children after them, to plant and propagate thy everlaſting Goſpel thro' Regions that ſat in Darkneſs and the Shadow of Death—as thou wert with them in theſe Things, ſo be thou with us. Let not our Unworthineſs provoke thee to <hi>leave us nor forſake us;</hi> but let our Light ſhine continually forth, <hi>till all the People of the Earth ſhall know</hi>—till the HEATHEN around us know—<hi>that the Lord is God, and there is none elſe;</hi> till they know and confeſs that the Gods whom they have ſerved are no Gods; that they and their

               <p>AND in Order to haſten this happy time, when all the Ends of the Earth ſhall bow down before thee, and Kings and Princes caſt their Crowns before the Throne of the Lamb, we pray that thou would give Succeſs to all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of uſeful Knowledge, and to the bleſſed GOSPEL, whereſoever and by whomſoever it is truly <hi>preached.</hi> In a particular Manner, be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give continual Succeſs to the <hi>Preaching</hi> thereof in this Houſe, which we have now openly and ſolemnly <hi>ſet apart</hi> to that ſacred Purpoſe.
