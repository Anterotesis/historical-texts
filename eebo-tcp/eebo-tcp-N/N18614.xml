            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE following Sermon which was primarily deſigned for your private uſe, at your requeſt, is made public by the preſs; whereby it is hoped (that by the bleſſing of God) it will become uſeful to others, as well as to you. I ſuppoſe one reaſon why you have deſired its publication, may be for the purpoſe of tranſmitting down to the riſing generation, ſome ſignal diſpenſations of divine Providence and grace in your day: Alſo, in part, in that 'tis a Half Century Sermon, it being rare that ſuch an one is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I myſelf never heard, nor ſaw one: Partly, alſo, as I hope, for your own inſtruction and edification. Although I was twice, or more than twice as long as common in the delivery, (being two hours) yet I obſerved that your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was kept up and increaſing to the end. Under each branch of my diſcourſe I ſtudied preciſion and brevity, ſuppreſſing a flow of thought that I might avoid prolixity; but I found I could not poſſibly do juſtice in any tolerable degree, to ſuch a variety of intereſting</hi> topics, <hi>and avoid being lengthy. As to this little piece of mine, I queſtion not, but like the generality of ſingle ſermons, after it has had a peruſal for once, it will, by</hi> ſome, <hi>be laid aſide as worn out and forgotten; but "as your times are in the hand of the Lord," I truſt you will find ſomething here, that may be uſeful in all the times that paſs over you; that it will eſpecially be uſeful for Communicants to read after they come from the Lord's-Table; and when you are called to elect a Paſtor, if I am then dead, I ſhall hereby ſpeak to you.—May the Lord continue to own and bleſs you—and inrich you with all the graces of his Spirit—And may we rejoice together in the preſence of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his appearing. To this end may He bleſs the following ſermon to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <head>Anniverſary, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I AM come into this awful and delightful deſk at this time with a view to deliver you an Anniverſary Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical and Half-Century Sermon. This three-fold occaſion will neceſſarily invite your mediation upon a variety of topics. I ſhall not undertake that which is beyond the compaſs of my power, <abbr>viz.</abbr> fully to aſcertain how far forth we ſtand connected with things paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to come, but I ſhall lead you to ſee, that as call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into exiſtence, "your times are in the hand of God"—That you are acting a part upon the ſtage of life, as in a probationary ſtate for an endleſs eternity—That you will ſoon exchange worlds, and meet the auguſt realities of an everlaſting ſtate—That preparation therefor, is of the higheſt poſſible importance—That you are under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite obligations to live to God, and to acknowledge Him in all that variety of diſpenſation, wherein he paſſes before you; ſuffice it to ſay, at preſent, I ſhall invite your run of meditation correſpondent to the three-fold occaſion of my preaching at this time. While a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of texts have been revolved in my mind, adapted to the preſent purpoſe, I have elected thoſe words which you may read in
<q>
                  <bibl>PSALM xxxi. 15.</bibl>
                  <hi>My Times are in thy Hand.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Pſalm was pen'd by the Royal Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his advanced age, and when expoſed to the loſs of life. In this ſituation he had recourſe by faith to his God, and ſoon became the ſubject of apprehended ſafety, triumphant joy, and divine gloriation in Him. He had juſt ſaid, "thou art my God," my God in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with me, and then adds, "my times are in thy Hand." The Pſalmiſt makes uſe of the plural number,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024155_0004_0FC3C87E323A8D10"/>
"my times," that is, all the events of time, and the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; proſperity, adverſity, life and death, all the changing ſcenes of life from the firſt aera or beginning of time, to the end thereof with us, are in God's hand. That is, in the hand of divine power, and under the all-diſpoſing providence of God: for this figurative mode of expreſſion, aſcribing a hand to God, who is a Spirit, and hath not bodily parts, is to be underſtood only as expreſs'd by way of analogy or alluſion, and principally imports divine power and providential influence, or the exertment of God's power and perfections on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 59. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Job 2. 10. &amp;c.</note> The words of our text contain an excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, made by the "man after God's own heart:" A confeſſion highly worthy of our imitation, both as to the matter and manner thereof; truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that "our times are in the hand of God." In as much as we <hi>all</hi> give our aſſent to this intereſting truth, the proof thereof at this time may be the leſs needful.</p>
            <p>Therefore in diſcourſing further upon the words, it is propoſed by the aſſiſtance of divine grace,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. In the firſt place then, I am to point out ſome ſignal times and capital events, to which the words of our text may refer, or will aptly apply. Here we may firſt obſerve, that the firſt exiſtence of man and beginning of time with him is in the Lord's hand. Let philoſophers diſpute about the origin, nature and eſſence of the ſoul of man—when firſt formed by the creating power of the Father of Spirits, and when firſt united to the body; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> divines determine with St. Auguſtin, that the ſoul is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024155_0005_0FC3C87F8BF87400"/>
created in infuſing, and in infuſing it is created, <hi>all</hi> muſt agree that there is the beginning of time with man. Self-exiſtence, independency and eternity, as being from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting, is peculiar to the great I AM, or Jehovah. As to man, a creature of time, in connexion with eternity, he is called into exiſtence and is born in the ſet time that God deſigned and ordered, as doing all things "according to the counſel of his will:" Hence the royal inſpir'd Preacher tells us, "there is a time to be born." Thus it hath been with reference to <hi>all</hi> that have come into exiſtence and been born in the old or new world; or that ſhall till time will be no more. God "hath made of one blood <hi>all</hi> nations of men for to dwell upon the face of the earth, and hath determined"—or <hi>hath marked out</hi> in his eternal and unerring counſel <hi>the times</hi> fore allotted [to each] in their reſpective order, and appointed the ſeveral boundaries of their <hi>habitation</hi>—to this one great end, that they might be excited to ſeek after the Lord their maker.</p>
            <p>I proceed—the time of the new birth, and for the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual application, or actual beſtowment of ſalvation <hi>which is by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is in the Lord's hand. This implies the miſſion of the Holy Spirit, his preparatory work, (in the adult)—his regenerating act, or his implanting a principle of ſpiritual life and grace—and effectual calling by his powerful efficiency:—by all which, the happy ſubjects thereof, are now made <hi>partakers of Chriſt,</hi> and brought into the <hi>fellowſhip of the Son of God:</hi> they are now <hi>in him,</hi> "who of God is made unto <hi>them</hi> wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption." They now through faith receive the <hi>atonement,</hi> and are not only juſtified and ſanctified, but have alſo "power given them to become the children of God; and if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Jeſus Chriſt. The Holy Spirit is given to them to dwell in them, as his proper laſting abode, and as a divine ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſpring of life and action. They ſhare in all the benefits of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, and are crowned
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024155_0006_0FC3C8810AC2BED8"/>
with the loving-kindneſs of God, in the life which now is, but moſt eminently in the life which is to come.—Now the time for <hi>all this,</hi> is in the Lord's hand. He hath his ſet time therefor, "a day of power," "the day of eſpouſal," of joy and gladneſs, "the accepted time, the day of ſalvation:" the hour now comes, in which the dead are made to hear and live. They muſt have preſervation in life, till the happy moment of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual marriage with Jeſus Chriſt. The Lord ſaid unto them when in their blood live: (Heb.) "I ſaid unto thee live in thy blood."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. 16. 6.</note> They muſt live until the fixed time for God to manifeſt his infinite love to them. Then the decree brings forth by all-powerful and all-glorious operation. A work this is of equal neceſſity as that of impetration or procurement of redemption. This work of application, is therefore a work of the laſt importance:—What is Chriſt to me, unleſs he is mine?</p>
            <p>Again, Times of increaſing light, for transformation—for the formal ſealing the Holy Spirit, and thereby aſſurance of divine love—and for ſenſible nearneſs to, and ſolemn, delightful fellowſhip and communion with the divine Trinity—and for abounding ſolid joy and peace divine, are in the Lord's hand. Theſe ſpiritual bleſſings, theſe divine beatitudes lie inwrap'd in precious promiſes, as rich veins of gold and ſilver do in a mine, and by the experiment or power of faith, become inlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cluſtered together in the heart of the real Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Every true convert as the ſubject of divine illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, has a ſpiritual knowledge of the glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of divine faith and love; and poſſeſſes ſome degree of peace and joy divine, at leaſt, ſome times, or if under deſertion, is mourning the want thereof. For otherwiſe, how can it be, that "old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new?" Every true believer is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>object ſeal</hi> of the Holy Spirit, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the perſon from others, as now ſanctified and ſet apart for God and his ſervice.

the Holy Spirit, is, his giving a ſure and certain teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to the reality of that work of grace He hath wrought in our ſouls, and to our intereſt in Chriſt, and our eternal ſalvation, according to the promiſes, "that are yea and amen in him, to the glory of God." Now fears and doubts are exiled, and the love of God ratified and cleared up to the ſoul. This certificate brought from the throne of mercy, by the bleſſed Spirit ſealed with Chriſt's blood, uſhers into the heart light and life, joy and peace divine, and even heaven upon earth. This formal ſeal of the Holy Spirit never preceeds, but is conſequent upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> "after ye believed, ye were ſealed by the Holy Spirit of promiſe."<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 1. 13.</note> Sometimes it follows immediately upon the ſoul's firſt cloſing with Chriſt. The happy young convert hath ſuch powerful illumination, clear views of divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, viſible actings of grace, and ſenſibility of divine love as give a comfortable or full aſſurance of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt, and the promiſes. Unutterably happy the portion of ſuch converts, if they never loſe their firſt love—perſevere in a walk under the cloudleſs ſhines of Jehovah's precious countenance, poſſeſſing the power and comfort of religion, till time with them is no more. But commonly young converts are the ſubjects of light and darkneſs hopes and fears, and are often well nigh, or quite giving up their hope of a ſaving change, after their firſt light and comfort. If for a time they think their mountain ſtands ſtrong, they ſhall never be moved, yet preſently they are in darkneſs and trouble again. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can, or ought to give ſatisfaction in this caſe, ſhort of increaſing light and ſenſible actings of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That which is now wanting is the formal ſealing of the Holy Spirit, which is frequently given after exerciſes have run high, and the ſoul has followed hard after God.—"Then ſhall we know, when we follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is prepared as the morning;"<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoſea, 6. 3.—Pſalm 30. 5.</note> that after

a night of darkneſs, perplexity and weeping, the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes with beams of light and joy, leading on to meridian ſplendor, and fulneſs of bliſs, in duration eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The Lord's people who make buſineſs of religion, and keep up a cloſe walk with Him, find more ſenſible nearneſs to him, and more intimate communion with him at ſome particular ſeaſons than they enjoy in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way. Times in which, comparatively, (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) they only hear with the ear, and times in which they ſee with the eye.<note n="*" place="bottom">Job 42. 5.</note> The Father of mercies and of lights raying into their ſouls, they have encreaſing, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual knowledge; and thereby increaſing views of the true moral beauty and infinite amiableneſs of divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and divine things. They behold the moral perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the infinite excellency and amiableneſs of his perſon, and his ſufficiency as mediator; and under clear and lively views of his divine and mediatorial glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they find and feel a divine gloriation in him, and raviſhing ſweetneſs, and heavenly joy in his excellent and tranſcendent love. They behold him as "altogether lovely," having all deſirable excellencies in him. The Lord's people now behold his glory ſhining in all his works; in ſpecial the harmony and infinite glory of his redeeming attributes as manifeſted in the face, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and mediation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing work of man's redemption by him. They ſee "that mercy and truth have met together; that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and peace have embraced each other.—In Chriſt all the divine attributes appear united in the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner. When mercy ſhines and triumphs in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace and glory; when love divine ſtoops down to the deeps of miſery to fetch poor, loſt, juſtly condemned ſinners to the heights of eternal glory, inflexible, ſevere and awful juſtice, and abſolute purity and holineſs ſit on the throne of glory, and triumph in infinite eternal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. If a Saint were to ſpeak out and tell us his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences at ſuch an hour as this, might we not expect to hear

He appears in the glory of his infinite and adorable ſovereignty; the ſupreme of Beings, ſitting on a throne of grace, in the glory of his holineſs. The ſight of his ſeveral awful endearing glories ſink me into deep ſelf-abaſement, I ſhrink, as it were, into nothing before Him, and feel myſelf leſs than an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. In the view of the infinite inflexible juſtice of God, and his abſolute and glorious holineſs, I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the bright, the pure and blended flame, and feel abaſhed and confounded at my own infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſs to that ſpotleſs rectitude and perfection. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a flame of ſupreme love to divine objects, yet I find myſelf far, very far from perfection in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any one grace. I never ſaw ſo much of my own infinite vileneſs, and the want of conformity to the moral excellencies of God; nor did I ever loath myſelf for ſin as I now do. I never ſaw ſin ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all that is in God; to his juſtice, to his holineſs, to his grace, and to his glory. In the view of the boundleſs goodneſs, love, and grace of God, I am filled with an overflowing admiration and amazement, that he ſhould open the inexhauſtible ſtores and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of that goodneſs to inrich and bleſs forever ſuch an infinitely vile ſinner. I ſtand ſpeechleſs, and am ready, as it were, to fall dead at the ſight of my own vile ingratitude and baſe returns to Him: That the great I AM looks down from the height of his ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary upon me, as with a look of love and compaſſion, and that I have ſo much overlooked ſuch ſtoops and reaches of boundleſs love and mercy.</q> The ſoul now under realizing views of the glorious wiſdom and holineſs of God, and his tranſcendent and infinite goodneſs, his love and grace in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, feels an unutterable joy and ſatisfaction in that boundleſs ocean of good and perfection, and does, as it were, open, expand and ſtretch

itſelf to graſp as much of it, as it can receive for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The light which now transforms the ſoul into the moral or holy image of God, and bows it low, as ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to his ſovereign will, elevates it to the top of <hi>mount Piſgah;</hi> ſo that all the world becomes but a dark valley below the feet: And the ſoul now dwells on high, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the poſſeſſion of an all-ſufficing good, for time and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, while it ſeems ſwallowed up in God, as in an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ocean of bleſſedneſs. The ſoul is now inſpired with undiſſembled gratitude, adoration and praiſe; but it ſeems to be a ſort of raſhneſs and boldneſs for a creature ſo vile, ſo feeble and inſufficient therefor, to attempt the celebration of the praiſes of a Being ſo infinitely great and glorious in holineſs, as Jehovah now appears to the view of the ſoul; yet a ſight of the moral beauty and infinite amiableneſs of his perfections, ſenſibility of his infinite love, and of infinite obligation to Him, ſeem to have a ſort of an omnipotent efficacy and ſweet conſtraint in them, ſo that the ſoul cannot refrain "crying, Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah! For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth." The ſoul wiſhes the whole creation fired with praiſe, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in ſome of his laſt Pſalms, is ready to, or does call upon the holy angels to afford their welcome aſſiſtance in this joyful work. At the ſame time it appears to the ſoul a reality, that a whole eternity of the ſublimeſt prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes raiſed and offered by countleſs millions of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt exalted intelligences that do or can exiſt, would be perfect ſilence before Jehovah, compared with his infinite incomprehenſible greatneſs and glory. <q>Now (ſays the ſoul) I dwell at home in God, and dwell in love divine. Now I become the ſubject of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſealing of the Holy Spirit: I now have a new name in a white ſtone, which no man knoweth, ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that receiveth it: Now I have the witneſs of my own ſpirit or conſcience and the teſtimony of the Divine Spirit joined therewith, giving aſſurance that I am an adopted child of God, and an heir of eternal glory.</q> How much ſo ever there may be of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024155_0011_0FC3C888870F9A18"/>
or a mediate witneſs, it now at leaſt, ſeems to the ſoul that there is an immediate teſtimony of the Holy Spirit, giving full aſſurance of the love of God. I need not light a candle to behold the ſun-ſhines; nor will I admit that to be the effect of the Holy Spirit's opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will not bear the trial of the written word of God. <q>Never had I before this happy hour (ſays the ſaint) ſuch clear light, and ſolid permanent comfort, ſuch a ſabbath of reſt and perfection of peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ſuch a ſolemn and delightful gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the divine Trinity. I find a new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagedneſs of heart and diſpoſition therefor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate myſelf afreſh to the ſervice and glory of the adorable TRINITY forever and ever.</q> Whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may imagine, the Lord's people well know, that <hi>theſe</hi> divine manifeſtations and operations, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and prelibations of future immenſe and immortal glory, are of and from the Lord; and that the timing thereof is in his ſovereign hand.</p>
            <p>I add, thoſe changes and viciſſitudes of time which take place among men, with reference to proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity are ordered by, and are in the hand of God.—The Pſalmiſt makes uſe of the plural number <hi>times,</hi> as expreſſive of viciſſitudes.—The world is a rolling wheel, and every thing in it, even thoſe things that appear moſt ſtable, may ſuffer change and mutation. Nobles, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, States, Kingdoms and Empires; Cities, Towns, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Individuals may appear for the preſent in a flouriſhing ſituation, and ſeem to ſwim on the ſmooth face of pleaſure; wait but a little while and the ſcene is all changed; the Lord, in whoſe hand our times are, turns a leaf in the volume of his decrees, and thoſe who ſung for joy of heart, are ſuddenly plunged in miſery and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.—Others that have long groaned under burdens, ſighed in miſery under painful ſufferings, as haſtily leap from them to liberty, light and comfort. The Lord's people have new ſcenes almoſt continually opening to view; all cannot exhibit viſibility of change as <hi>Job, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:024155_0012_0FC3C88A1A5126F0"/>
and many others have done; but all are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with viciſſitudes.—Happy they who are habitually and actually prepared to meet all the changing ſcenes of life, "and ſtand ſecure amidſt a falling world:" And who can truly ſay,
<q>
                  <l>Through all the changing ſcenes of life,</l>
                  <l>In trouble and in joy,</l>
                  <l>The praiſes of my God ſhall ſtill</l>
                  <l>My heart and tongue employ.</l>
               </q>
All this ſtrange variety of changes rolling on in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſucceſſion, is the work of God; He forms the light of proſperity, and creates the darkneſs of adverſity; good and evil come from his hand.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the time of deliverance from trials and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive ills is in God's hand. The Lord's people in this their ſtate of probation often ſhare in heavy trials; ſometimes they are grievouſly perſecuted; ſometimes they have to conflict with terrible temptations, keen priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under the loſs of their deareſt outward comforts; and ſometimes are lamenting the abſence of the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Their exerciſes often run high in a great variety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; they learn that in the "world they ſhall have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble," and the croſs is the way to the crown. The kind, the degree, and the duration of their ſuffering afflictive ill is in the Lord's hand, and he hath a ſet time for their deliverance as really as for Zion's proſperity; and as he had for the liberation of his people from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I add, the time for a perſon to exerciſe faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is in the Lord's hand. Sinners under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are called upon to exerciſe repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they eſcape eternal death, and poſſeſs eternal life. For this infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly important purpoſe the Lord allows ſinners a ſpace of time, as he gave <hi>Jazabel</hi> a ſpace to repent. The day of grace hath differing periods; is ſometimes longer and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024155_0013_0FC3C88F5EDC73A0"/>
ſometimes ſhorter, as the day of life is. We ſay the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's time for faith and repentance is in the hand of God, not eternity in the hand of God for this purpoſe; for beyond time, in eternity, there is no repentance unto life; inſpiration aſſures us that all beyond time is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; therefore if the ſinner goes into the eternal ſtate without grace, he will abide without grace forever. Here it may be obſerved, that our day of grace may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire before the day of life; as the <hi>ſtalk</hi> may continue after the <hi>flower</hi> be dropt off. There may be a judicial weighing of the ſinner, a <hi>mene t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kal,</hi> that puts an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal period to his day of grace. God in juſt and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous judgment may give up diſobedient ſinners to a ſtate of blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, and by oath bar them out of reſt forever. Hence then how exceedingly precious is <hi>time,</hi> an happy or miſerable eternity may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the good or ill improvement of the preſent fleeting moments.</p>
            <p>Moreover the time for a perſon's uſefulneſs on the ſtage of life is in the Lord's hand. Every perſon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially every one that lays claim to the chriſtian character, is indiſpenſably obligated to live to God, and to be uſeful to ſociety. Obligation is increaſed by the powers, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, talents and ſtations, with which perſons are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted for the purpoſe of ſerving God, and their gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Very various are the ſtations aſſigned mankind, and as various the ſervices called for; ſervices to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the glorifying of God, and innumerable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to be done for the bodies and ſouls of men; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their ſecular and civil intereſts, and their eternal ſalvation. Some are advanced to the moſt honorable and important ſtations in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of uſefulneſs. Many are uſeful in the humble walk of private life. Others in a two-fold capacity at the ſame time, or at divers times in different ſtations. The ſovereign Lord of the univerſe can with infinite eaſe raiſe up, qualify and eminently improve a man for a time in a ſtation high, intereſting and vaſtly important,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024155_0014_0FC3C890D671F0F0"/>
and ſoon improve him in a ſphere of action equally high and important. Surpriſing and inconceivable as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial conſequences are, and will be, we may behold the ſame extraordinary perſon endowed with rare mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of military ſkill and proweſs, acting the <hi>Hero</hi> in the military line, "for our people, and for the cities of our God," and by his bleſſing, ſucceſs, and in conſequence crowned with the laurels of victory and triumph over mighty forces, raſhly acting the part of oppoſition to the free enjoyment of liberty and property. We may ſoon thereupon fix the eye on the ſame extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and view his as enriched with a fund of political knowledge, wiſdom and fidelity; elected by a united free people to preſide in the chief Chair of <hi>State,</hi> which he fills with honor, adequate to the merit of his reputation, tho' ſtanding ſo high in national fame, as well as by the juſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of an univerſal <hi>Plaudit</hi> by millions in <hi>United States,</hi> which conſtitute an extenſive and growing empire. The late revolution in our own country exemplifies our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, as affording witneſs to it by preſent living exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>If a perſon exalted ſo high on the ſtage of honor, acts the chriſtian <hi>Hero</hi> ſo as to overcome the mighty force of temptation to ſelf-exaltation, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> victory and triumph will be immenſely more noble and honorable than can poſſibly be obtained in the military <hi>line</hi> or chair of <hi>State,</hi> although the whole world were to be the field of conqueſt, or the ſeat of empire.</p>
                  <p>The victory and triumph of the real chriſtian over death, is infinitely more magnificent, gainful and honourable than all the triumphs ordained by the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in honor to their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Generals.</p>
               </note> The Lord often conveys incomprehenſible bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to men, by the inſtrumentality of man. Miniſters of the goſpel have deſignation to office in a ſtation <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honourable</hi> and immenſely important, for the grand deſign of uſefulneſs. They have "the glorious goſpel of the bleſſed God commited to their charge," and are made <hi>guardians of ſouls</hi> which muſt exiſt eternally. They bear <hi>an office</hi> which was ſanctified by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who himſelf bore it, and thereby dignified it forever. The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024155_0015_0FC3C8926160E430"/>
purpoſes we ſerve are high and God-like. We are to "gather fruit unto life eternal." If <hi>ſome</hi> moſtly employ their time and talents in the lower ſphere of ſcaffolding work; there are <hi>others</hi> more highly and happily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as at work upon the Temple, as inſtrumental in ſquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laying the ſtones in the ſpiritual building, "the church of the living God." They are enabled to improve their gifts and exerciſe their graces with a wiſe reference to promoting the Redeemer's kingdom among men:—and by the co-operation of the Holy Spirit with their miniſtrations they "turn ſinners to righteouſneſs, and build up ſaints in faith, holineſs and comfort:" and as a gracious reward ſhall ſhine as ſtars of the firſt magnitude in the kingdom of glory forever. Now the duration of time for uſefulneſs in any ſtation whatſoever is in the Lord's hand. Some have but a ſhort ſpace of time and opportunity allowed them for uſefulneſs in the world; others a longer ſpace.—Some have a long run and ſeries of opportunity for ſpecial ſervice, and are eminently uſeful to a good old age. More eminent uſefulneſs may ceaſe before the expiration of life; yet are the Lord's people uſeful as long as they can pray and exhibit praiſe-worthy example. With reſpect to degrees of uſefulneſs, and the duration of time therefor, the glorious and adorable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of God is moſt eminently diſplayed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly here, the duration and end of a man's time is in God's hand. "There is a time to die," as well as to be born, and the one, and the other abide unalterably fixed in the vaſt volume of the divine decrees. We are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal till the appointed time comes, for the end of time with us, beyond that we cannot poſſeſs life for a moment, whether elder or younger. "Man knoweth not his time;" but God as the ſovereign Lord of life and death, "hath appointed his bounds that he cannot paſs," and hath <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the final hour and moment, when time with us, "ſhall be no more." Henceforth, all will be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eternity!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:024155_0016_0FC3C893C191AC20"/>
Thus have we taken a brief ſurvey of the times of men as in the hand of God, and ſeen how the text will apply: We now proceed,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to conſider the import of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

To profeſs that the times of men are in the hand of God, and yet not to believe the exiſtence of a God, is infinitely abſurd. That there is a ſupreme and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Being, and that he is poſſeſſed of all infinite perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, are truths ſo viſible by the light of nature, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares the <hi>heathen</hi> inexcuſable that call theſe truths in queſtion.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </gap>.</note> Every thing in the natural and moral world—the effects of the exertion of infinite attributes, and the viſible accompliſhment of the prophecies and promiſes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aint that there is a ſupreme eternal Being, poſſeſſed of an aſſemblage of all infinite poſſible perfections. Superadded to <hi>all this</hi> the true believer has a ſpiritual ſupernatural knowlege of God in Chriſt, by divine illumination, and a feeling ſenſe of the preſence of God; of his divinity, and the divinity of bible truth; as every one has that is the happy ſubject of ſaving faith.</p>
            <p>We proceed, this confeſſion as made by the ſaint acting in character, implies regeneration, the infuſion of grace, and exerciſe of ſaith, by the energy of the Holy Spirit. No unregenerate perſon can make this confeſſion both as to matter and manner, as it ought to be made; for it ſuppoſes the exerciſe of ſaith. The pſalmiſt in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſaith, ſaid, "my God," and in the exerciſe of that ſaith, he adds, "my times are in thy hand."</p>
            <p>I add, this confeſſion, "my times are in thy hand," implies a firm belief and full perſuaſion of the governing providence of God. The ſaint has full aſſurance from divine revelation that the ONE ſupreme God, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> great Creator, is alſo the governor of the univerſe: that his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024155_0017_0FC3C8955F6A4450"/>
providence is <hi>univerſal,</hi> and extends to every individual in the whole ſyſtem of beings. The ſaint knows and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that the divine pages plainly teach us, that God is qualified, by his infinite perfections, for the government of the world; that 'tis neceſſary that he ſhould govern it, and that he therefore does. "The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all:"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm 103. 19.</note> over all things in the natural world; and he is governor and judge alſo of the moral world, angels and men,—"and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth."<note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. 4. 35.</note> The ſaint believes and confeſſes, that every thing which comes to paſs is by the ordinative or permiſſive provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
            <p>Again, this confeſſion implies, that the time allowed us here is God's time, and man's talent. To confeſs that our times are in God's hand, is to acknowledge that we are not lords of the time allowed us; but ſtewards under him, intruſted by him with time, as a moſt precious tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the improvement of which we are accountable to him. Time ought to be conſidered as one of the moſt important betruſtments committed to us, to be employed, in the ſervice of God; and in a way of preparation for eternity. Precious and important we call the talent of time, for the man is yet unborn that can fully weigh and comprehend the worth of it; while on it hangs ſuſpended the weight of worlds eternal: yet there is no one talent ſo miſuſed and ſo univerſally, wretchedly abuſed by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as the talent of time. Shall death-beds tell us what it is to murder time? time that is God's, and in his hand.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this confeſſion—as connected with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words implies a firm belief of protection and ſafety. The <hi>pſalmiſt</hi> had ſaid in the preceding verſe, his enemies had deviſed to take away his life, he adds, "but I truſted in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> O Jehovah: I ſaid thou art my God:" Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah imports being and eternity, and his name [FL.] that

follows, tranſlated [GOD] notes forth his power: Now this "Jehovah, my God," who is Being from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to everlaſting, poſſeſſed of omnipotent, ſupreme and eternal power is become engaged for my protection and ſafety. His Name is the aſylum or tower to which I have recourſe by ſaith, and am entirely ſafe. Jehovah, God, is my <hi>ſhield,</hi> as well as "my exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:" I ſhall abide ſafe and comfortable "under the ſhadow of the Almighty, in the ſecret place of the Moſt HIGH:" His infinite attributes aſcertain my ſafety and felicity for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Again, this confeſſion—as in connexion with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words, implies ſight and ſenſibility of infinite diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance between God and man, the Creator and the creature. "Jehovah my God," "my times are in thy hand," all ſtand connected together, but imply infinite diſproportion between the beings ſpoken of. Jehovah ſpeaks being itſelf, a fulneſs of being, an immenſe ſea of being, and in whole very being itſelf. Self-exiſting, independent, fountain of all being, eternal, immutable, infinite in power and all perfections. Now if we ſet this acknowledgement in contraſt with the confeſſion the pſalmiſt makes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the diſtance and diſproportion will appear as it really is infinite. <hi>Jehovah,</hi> thou art being itſelf, very being; I am but ſhew, little more than a ſhew, a mere ſhadow, a ſemblance of being: Thou haſt an infinitude of being, which I have not; I am nearer to nothing than fulneſs of being: Thou art ſelf-exiſtent and independent; what little of being I have is derived; I am a created, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant creature: "my times are in thy hand," thou art eternal, from eternity to eternity unchangeably the ſame. I have juſt come into exiſtence, am but of yeſterday, a creature of time; thou art eternal, what thou now art thou ever haſt been, and what thou ever haſt been, and now art, thou forever muſt needs be. Thus we ſee the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the confeſſion in our text.</p>
            <p>I again add—this confeſſion, "my times are in thy
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024155_0019_0FC3C8A04B811180"/>
hand," implies a neceſſary dependance upon God, and acquieſcence in it, as ſubmiſſive to the divine will, as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſhould be ſo. The dependance of the ray upon the ſun, of the ſtream upon the fountain, can be but a faint emblem of the neceſſary dependance of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aint upon God for being and well-being. This the <hi>pſalmiſt</hi> well knew, when he made the confeſſion in the text; he ſaw the events of time were in the hand of his God, and that it was fitting it ſhould be ſo, he therefore ſubmitted to him as on the throne of government and grace. He now did that which the Lord's people can when they have a right frame of heart, <abbr>viz.</abbr> ſign a blank and leave it with the Lord to fill up: knowing that his power is immenſe and uncontrollable, his ſovereign will abſolutely good and infinitely perfect, and that the ſupreme wiſdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this confeſſion, "my times are in thy hand," implies ſpiritual joy and divine gloriation. The words evidently carry in them an air of joy and triumph. My times, all the events of time, are in the hand of Jehovah, who is my God, who will order all things for me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to covenant engagement. In Jehovah, my God, I boaſt all the day long, my ſoul goes to him as to my "exceeding joy," my God in Chriſt. I am the ſubject of ineffable joy and divine gloriation, and ſhall be forever, for "my times are in the hand of Jehovah my God."</p>
            <p>We may hence ſee and learn, that there is much inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſaint's confeſſion rightly made.—That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to be looking and preparing for changes.—That it becomes us to be reconciled to our own deceaſe, and the deceaſe of relatives and friends; for our, and their times, are in the Lord's hand.—That to ſee all things and events in the hand of God, and to acquieſce therein, is the one only certain way for reſt and comfort in the world.—But we muſt not dwell here at preſent.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here this <hi>ſermon</hi> may be divided.</note>

Thus we have taken a brief ſurvey of the <hi>times</hi> of men as in the Lord's hand: and conſidered the import of the ſaint's confeſſion of this <hi>truth.</hi> If we reflect for a few moments upon the preceding <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> we may obſerve that 'tis adapted and will fitly apply to the threefold occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of delivering a ſermon at this time, as advertiſed in the <hi>exordium,</hi>

               <p>This firſt part, which is deſigned to be the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an anniverſary Sermon, may perhaps, occaſion a query with <hi>ſome,</hi> why this ſermon (in part) has the <hi>title</hi> of an anniverſary ſermon; the reply is, becauſe, that for the ſpace of forty-five years I have annually or every year preached a <hi>new-year's</hi> ſermon to my <hi>people.</hi> During this ſpace of time, it has been the practice of miniſter and people in this place, to take ſome ſpecial notice of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year, by meeting in this <hi>houſe</hi> on every new year's day, for ſolemn meditation and religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. Careful to avoid every thing of a ſuperſtitious aſpect, yet employing common time to holy purpoſes, as we have opportunity; from a principle of zeal toward God, and of care for our ſouls: wiſhing to redeem time, and to begin the year with God, by the exerciſes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſolemn devotion. I would juſt premiſe and obſerve, that to commemorate the works of God, is a duty of perpetual, as well as univerſal obligation, and can never be out of <hi>ſeaſon:</hi> but there are times in which it appears eminently in <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> and ſeems the ſpecial duty of the day: and moſt eminently ſo, is the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> and a <hi>New-Year's day.</hi> Upon <hi>theſe days</hi> eſpecially, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant

duty to be exerciſed in meditating on, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating God's wonderful works of <hi>creation, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>providence.</hi> To call into view, to commemorate and celebrate the diſplay of the glory of God's creating <hi>perfections,</hi> the glory of his power, and wiſdom, and goodneſs, ſovereignty and alſufficiency.

It is alſo eminently in <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> on the Lord's day, and on a New-Year's day, to commemorate God's wonderful works of Providence, and the diſplay of the glory of his governing perfections. It is therefore natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to obſerve, that we have now a double call to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duty of commemorating God's wonderful works of <hi>creation, redemption,</hi> and <hi>providence:</hi> For this is the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> and a <hi>New-Year's-day;</hi> they are now aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, and unitedly invite us to commemorate <hi>thoſe</hi> works of God, ſo glorious, inexhauſtable and eternal!

                     </gap>.</note> Let me now invite you to call into view ſome ſingular tokens of God's infinite kindneſs toward you, and thereby your infinite obligations to praiſe him, and to be conſecrated to his ſervice and glory. How very ſingular and important our exiſtence here in this world: formed with ſuch an alliance to angel and ſpirit as to take rank above all the creatures on this ſide the ſtars! From the noble ſtructure and powers of the human mind, it appears that we were formed with a ſubjective capacity, capable of the everlaſting fruition of God. Such is our kind of being, as declares <hi>our</hi> author <hi>God,</hi> the Father of our ſpirits, and that we are bound to him; as manifeſting ſuch ſingular kindneſs unto us. Let us now for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment look back to the aera of our exiſtence and the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and the manifeſtation of the ſingular kindneſs of God <hi>therein.</hi> Our God, in whoſe hand "our times are," in his deep counſel and infinite wiſdom fixed upon the time for our exiſtence and coming into the world. Not in the period of time aſſign'd the <hi>antediluvian world,</hi> "when all fleſh had corrupted his way,"—nor in the <hi>new world,</hi> before, nor under the <hi>law</hi> given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which had only "the ſhadow of good things to come;" but under the <hi>chriſtian diſpenſation;</hi> when "the wall of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is taken down"—that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be <hi>preached</hi> to the <hi>gentiles."</hi> Not in the time of the bloody perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>church,</hi> in the three firſt centuries of the chriſtian <hi>aera,</hi> under <hi>Roman pagan:</hi> nor in the dark and idolatrous time of anti-chriſtian tyranny and ſuperſtition; "when all the world wandered after the beaſt;" but ſince the glorious reformation from <hi>popery,</hi> and the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>proteſtant religion:</hi> now near two thouſand years ſince the coming of Chriſt our Lord;—and in a day of copious effuſions of the Holy Spirit, and of marvellous grace: ſo as that we ſee the preludes to, and even the firſt dawnings of the <hi>latter-day glory.</hi> Nor is it to be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024155_0023_0FC3C8A5DC19D130"/>
paſſed over in ſilence, that in conſequence of the late wonderful revolution in <hi>America</hi> we hope to enjoy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual freedom from <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> tyranny: which, with the enjoyment of all goſpel privileges give us occaſion to adopt the language of inſpiration, "The lines are fallen to us in pleaſant places." How hath the Lord opened the treaſures of his goodneſs and pour'd his bleſſings in upon you on all ſides, and followed you with his rich, various, free and repeated mercies from the firſt commencement of your exiſtence to the preſent moment. In the days of helpleſs infancy, and through every ſtage of life, how hath he provided for you, and conferred the bleſſings of health, food and raiment upon you? The luminaries of heaven ſhine, the earth labours, and all the (otherwiſe diſcordant) elements conſpire to promote your comfort. Power and goodneſs divine have accompanied every moment of life, equally ſwift in approach, for your conſervation and conſolation. If the ſeries of mercies ſeem'd for a time in a meaſure interrupted, by afflictive ills, this manner of diſpenſation, was wiſely and well and even kindly calculated to afford you leſſons of uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. When ſickneſs and death have invaded your neighbours, your friend; or relative, and ſpread havock and deſolation around you, and it may be have taken away a member of the family in which you live, you have eſcaped; and this day appear as monuments of God's ſparing mercy. How great the preventing and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goodneſs of God! What numerous ſeen, and yet more unſeen dangers have been eſcaped? What numberleſs poſitive bleſſings, temporal, ſpiritual, perſonal and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, public and private, have been confer'd upon you by the <hi>immediate</hi> hand of God, your bountiful benefactor. Permit me to remind you yet more fully of the infinite kindneſs of God toward you, manifeſted by the various means he makes uſe of to promote your eternal ſalvation. In conſequence of the <hi>donation,</hi> the <hi>mediation,</hi> the <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you are invited, and urged by
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024155_0024_0FC3C8A80370A550"/>
motives that have ſanctions of infinite weight, to make ſure of an intereſt in Him by faith, and thereby of eternal bleſſedneſs. By an early education you have been taught "man's chief end;" divine providence has ſmiled or frowned to draw or drive; bibles have been put into your hands; friends counſel you; thouſands of ſaints are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you; for this purpoſe holy angels attend our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping aſſemblies while the goſpel is preached to you, and holy ordinances adminiſter'd; miniſters of the goſpel "knowing the terrors of the Lord perſuade you;"—they ſet life and death eternal before you, in all their glories and terrors; they proclaim your guilt, miſery and danger—and exhibit to view the unſearchable riches of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Emmanuel:</hi> his ſuitableneſs as a Saviour, and his infinite ſufficiency to ſave, and his gracious readineſs.—For this purpoſe, heaven darts down its ſplendors to attract—<hi>Sinai</hi> thunders wrath divine; hell flaſhes forth flaming ruin, to the end you may be excited "to flee from the wrath to come;" conſcience admoniſhes you; the Holy Spirit co-operates with providences and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to excite you to make ſure of an intereſt in the Lord Chriſt, and eternal ſalvation by him. In the view of theſe numerous and mighty efforts of divine goodneſs to promote your <hi>well-being</hi> in both <hi>worlds,</hi> may it not be ſaid, "what could have been done more, that has not been done?"—Surely ſuch an amazing ſeries of ſingular unmerited favours ought to inflame your gratitude, and to excite entire conſecration to the ſervice and glory of God, your, ſupreme benefactor. But if you refuſe,—hear O earth, with horror; be aſtoniſhed, O ye heavens, that God the fountain of being and all good, has ſo little gratitude from our ſtupid world! Here I might naturally addreſs the Lord's people, who hope they have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally known his love; but this will ſoon come in of courſe. I might alſo take ſpecial notice of the ſignal ſalvations of our God the year paſt, how he has ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with his goodneſs, and enriched us with his mercy,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024155_0025_0FC3C8A98C70E7F0"/>
and crowned the year with numerous ſalvations; but the time would fail. In the view of ſuch a profuſion of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings let me call upon you cautiouſly to avoid vile and horrid ingratitude; ingratitude that may juſtly ſhock and confound—while it is enough to ſink the whole world into the depths of hell! To be every moment receiving bleſſings from God, and yet perpetually offending him to his face; can <hi>infernal ſpirits</hi> in everlaſting chains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of ſuch aſtoniſhing ingratitude! Let me invite you to abound in the duty of commemorating glorious divine operations, relative to God's wonderful works of <hi>creation, redemption,</hi> and <hi>providence:</hi> and take heed that you don't content yourſelves with a mere <hi>hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orical</hi> and <hi>ſuperficial</hi> commemoration; but ever look that your <hi>remembrance</hi> of theſe high and mighty events be attempered to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>importance</hi> of them, and applied to <hi>experimental, devotional</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> purpoſes in religion. Our remembrance muſt be attended with the exerciſe of particular graces and virtues—with aſſent and perſuaſion—with approbation and wonder—with humility and reverence—with contrition and penitence—with affection and complacence—with thankſgiving and praiſe—with faith, hope, prayer, frequency and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence—and with correſpondent life and courſe of action.—Thus let us enter upon a new revolution of time; and as knowing our "times are in the Lord's hand." I have only to add here, as in the view of ſuch peculiar diſtinguiſhing favours as we all ſhare in; and of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable obligations we are all under,—"I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice. And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable, and perfect will of God."</p>

               <head>SECOND PART.</head>
               <p>Foraſmuch as a large number of this large auditory have this day partaken of the commemorating ordinance of the <hi>Lord's ſupper,</hi> this hath given occaſion for this part of my diſcourſe, which is called <hi>Euchariſtical.</hi> The ſacrament of the Lord's-ſupper hath ſeveral <hi>names</hi> by which it is known. It is frequently called the <hi>euchariſt;</hi> ſo the <hi>Greek church</hi> called it, and we from them give it the ſame name, which properly ſignifies a thankſgiving; and it is ſo called in the firſt place, becauſe our Lord in the inſtitution of it, <hi>gave thanks,</hi> (1 Cor. 11. 24.) In the next place it is ſo called, becauſe we in partaking thereof ought to give thanks. It is an ordinance of thankſgiving, appointed for the joyful celebrating of the Redeemer's praiſes. The cup of <hi>ſalvation</hi> muſt be "the cup of bleſſing:" the high praiſes of God ſhould be in our mouths and in our hearts.<note n="†" place="bottom">It hath been the practice of many churches of Chriſt to have a thankſgiving day, following the <hi>euchariſt</hi>—others have a euchariſtical ſermon, exhorting to give thanks, and to walk with God.</note> To attend the euchariſt or holy ſacrament, is to take an oath of allegiance unto the Lord. God doth in and by this ordinance ſeal to us, "to be to us a God:" and herein we ſeal to him "to be to him a people." We reſign and give up our whole ſelves, body, ſoul, and ſpirit to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; covenanting and promiſing to walk cloſely with him in all manner of goſpel obedience all our days.—Therefore it will be natural upon this occaſion to exhort the Lord's people to thankſgiving—and conſecration to the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>I therefore now make an addreſs in particular to you my fellow-communicants, and fellow-candidates for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory. That I may inflame your love, increaſe your gratitude, and excite you to give thanks and praiſe to the Divine Trinity, "and to walk as you have received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt," anſwerable to the deſign of this <hi>eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:024155_0027_0FC3C8ABD7A0DBD0"/>
part of my diſcourſe, it may be uſeful to exhibit to your view the infinite obligations you are under to the performance of <hi>theſe</hi> and all other duties; and the exerciſe of <hi>theſe</hi> and all other graces: obligations reſulting from the infinite perfections of God, and his communicative goodneſs, and ſingular kindneſs toward you. But here let me juſt obſerve, that whatever my charitable perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ward you may be in general, by that which I may now ſay, I do not mean to give my ſanction to your hope that you have received the grace of God. If in our Lord's little family of twelve, there was a <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him under the maſk of friendſhip, it will be marvellous indeed, if there be not a <hi>traitor</hi> found among hundreds. But as knowing that thoſe who come to the <hi>Lord's-ſupper</hi> in this place, come with a prevailing hope that they have experienced a ſaving change, I now meet and addreſs you on your own ground.—Ye children of God, his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar favourites, you have heard "that your times" in every point of view, are in "the hand of your God," therefore make confeſſion of this truth with thankſgiving and praiſe. View the kindneſs of your God in your admirable formation; "there is a ſpirit in man, and the inſpiration of the Almighty giveth him underſtanding." You will view the timing of your exiſtence and coming into the world, and with gratitude acknowledge the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your God: your lot is caſt in a land of marvellous light, and in a day of abounding grace, by plentiful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of divine influence. You will often recognize with gratitude the infinite kindneſs of the Lord toward you in that he preſerved you in life amidſt perils of death, from the moment of your exiſtence, for a number of years "when lying in your blood" and guilt, until the fixed time came for your effectual calling. You will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when the Holy Spirit firſt took hold of your heart by way of powerful conviction of your ſin, guilt, and miſery, he found you ruſhing on toward deſtruction, and that even <hi>then</hi> when "the arrows of the Almighty
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024155_0028_0FC3C8B11A5DC950"/>
were within you; and his terrors took hold of you," ſo that in the view of your guilt you were trembling every moment with fears of juſt and ſpeedy damnation eternal, I ſay even then ſuch was the reigning power of enmity in your heart; and ſuch the pride, the daring and horrid pride of your heart, that you obſtinately oppoſed the ſoul humbling method of ſalvation by the goſpel: and you would have reſiſted 'till dead, and damned forever, had not your oppoſition been conquered by the irreſiſtible energy of divine and ſovereign grace, in the day of the Lord's power, when you became the willing ſubjects of the Lord Chriſt your King Redeemer. You will often review the more ſignal tokens of the Lord's infinite lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindneſs towards you through all the viciſſitudes of life ſince your firſt ſaving acquaintance with him. How you have been aſſiſted by the holy Spirit to exert your graces, and to perform duties ſpiritually and evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; and to conform to the divine will, providential and revealed, with a ſacred pleaſure. How you have by the power of divine grace repelled and broke the force of temptation, by ſatan, the world and the fleſh. How when diſmal gloom by deſertion over-ſpread your mind, and tormenting doubts and fears ruſhed in upon you, the Lord diſpelled your darkneſs, and revived your hope and comfort by light divine. How he often enabled you "to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi>" and often appeared for you as a prayer-hearing God. How he hath upheld and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported you under trials and afflictive <hi>ills,</hi> and hath cauſed your conſolation to exceed your tribulation. How ſome events moſt unpromiſing and adverſe in themſelves, have by the over-ruling power and love of God ſerved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your temporal and ſpiritual felicity. How when your graces and virtues withered, he noticed your ſighs for want of the abſent <hi>Comforter,</hi> and granted you "freſh anointings, ſo that your ſouls became "as a watered garden."—How hath the Lord, from time to time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to converſe with him in public ordinances,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024155_0029_0FC3C8B2FA6F07B8"/>
and alſo met with you in your retirements, both by day and night, in the houſe and by the way, and held divine communion with you. In a word, how have you found upon all occaſions a ſufficiency in the grace of God, for doing and ſuffering his will: ſo that you have been ready to ſay a thouſand times, "ſurely God is good to Iſrael." Eſpecially when he hath, as it were, unlocked his peculiar treaſures to inrich you with light, love and peace divine, and even cauſed you to rejoice with "joy unſpeakable and full of glory."</p>

You will now reflect, that this is the Lord's Day, our communion Day, and a new-year's Day.—Have we not to day, as it were, heard the Lord of love ſaying unto us, "Come ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of my love, I will begin this <hi>new year</hi> with you at a love feaſt: as inviting you to behold the Lamb of my election and affection in ſufferings, even unto death for the purpoſe of your eternal ſalvation. Here at <hi>my board,</hi> richly furniſhed, in and through the Mediator the <hi>Son</hi> of my love, I make over my ſelf to you in all my infinite perfections, and all my moſt glorious ſubſiſtences, I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people. By faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch me to be your God, and the promiſes and bleſſings of the new covenant are ratified to you by ſolemn oath, and ſealed by ſacred blood. Thus begin this year with me, perform your vows, walk with me, and I, who <hi>Am</hi> that <hi>I Am,</hi> will be your confederate God for ever and ever."—With holy joy and admiration we ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> we give thanks, and let the high praiſes of the adorable TRINITY be in our mouths and in our hearts, henceforth forever. If any of you have not had that ſenſible near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord, and that delightful communion with him, that you longed and prayed for, ſearch after the cauſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024155_0030_0FC3C8B40553C118"/>
why you have not, and be humble. Learn the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God in timing his communications, and the neceſſity of the divine influences in order to exerciſe graces, and to perform duties as you ought:—mourn your deficiences—perſevere in thirſting after and praying for nearneſs to God—and improve this holy ordinance for the purpoſe of a purifying effect upon the heart and life, and it will not be a loſt, but gainful opportunity.—If the Lord in infinite condeſcending love and grace hath admitted you to delightful converſe and communion with him;—if he has brought you "into his banqueting houſe, and his banner over you has been love," and his love has been ſhed abroad in your hearts;—if by faith you have fed on the bread of life from heaven, and drunk of the ſoul-refreſhing waters of eternal life—you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite occaſion to give thanks and to ſing unto the Lord. We have all indeed occaſion ſo to do, who are truly the Lord's people and have had ſuch marvellous ſights exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to view to day. In the holy ſacrament is to be ſeen the <hi>Lamb</hi> of God ſlain, and as both able and worthy to open the ſeals of the everlaſting goſpel, the book of light and life eternal.—Here we ſee the infinite evil of ſin in the red glaſs of Chriſt's ſufferings, and by his atonement made for it, even by blood and death:—here we ſee his free, diſtinguiſhing, condeſcending, expenſive, ſtrong and everlaſting love; and all needful bleſſings for time and eternity flowing to us, as believers, in the ſtream of his precious blood as incarnate God. Here we ſee the harmony of the redeeming attributes of God as meeting in Chriſt, relative to the ſalvation of fallen man, ſhining forth in their united full blaze of infinite everlaſting glory. Theſe marvellous things apprehended by faith are enough to whelm the ſoul as in an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable, ſhoreleſs ocean of love, grace, and glory!—and to excite the angelic ſong, "glory to God in the higheſt." And now, ye ſaints of the moſt high God, who has loved you with an everlaſting love, everlaſting
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024155_0031_0FC3C8B5D8E4F0A8"/>
in its counſels, effects and conſequences, and therefore with loving-kindneſs has he drawn you; drawn you by his arm exerted by infinite love, and ſprinkled with the blood of his co-equal, co-eternal, "well beloved Son," when driving back the devouring flame, and ſnatching you "as brands out of the burning," and drawing you near to <hi>himſelf.</hi> Making you the monumental pillars and trophies of his boundleſs power, love and grace; thereby intending to ſhew to all worlds what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of his perfections can produce out of the ruined maſs of mankind. And having loved you, "he will rejoice over you, and reſt in his love for ever." For you he hath opened the inexhauſtible fountain of his goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conferred upon you an affluence of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings in Chriſt;—bleſſings moſt excellent in their nature and quality, the ſure pledges of infinite love, and eternal in duration:—And let me now add a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which gives an amazing emphaſis to all now ſaid, <abbr>viz.</abbr> all this profuſion of ſingular, immortal, infinite, god-like bleſſings muſt be reſolved into the rich, free, ſovereign, overflowing, infinite and unmerited goodneſs of God. If the queſtion ſhould be aſked, Why are we <hi>thus bleſſed?</hi> this is the only ſolution, that can be given to all eternity, "even ſo Father for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight!" The demerit of our crimes was infinitely the reverſe.—We deſerved not the leaſt mercy—but to be made miſerable, perfectly and eternally. Now in ſuch a view of things, what ſay you, my fellow candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for eternal glory, ye favourites of heaven, can ye refrain from praiſing God for what he is in himſelf, and from giving thanks to him, for the overflowings of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs to you. Is it poſſible for you to keep ſilence, that the poſts of the houſe, and ſtones of the wall may utter their voice, and cry, Ingratitude, aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing ingratitude! What evidence can you have that every evil ſpirit is caſt out of your heart, while a dumb ſpirit holds poſſeſſion? Can it ever be, that you who
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024155_0032_0FC3C8B710DA8F58"/>
are the ſubjects of ſuch a profuſion of bleſſings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miracled with mercies, ſhould be the ſubjects of ſuch vile and ſhocking ingratitude? Surely, in as much as you enjoy bleſſings as great as the infinite goodneſs of God can beſtow, and as great as the infinite merit of Chriſt could purchaſe, you will reſolve with the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> "every day will I bleſs thee, and I will praiſe thy name for ever and ever."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 145. 2.</note> And again, "while I live I will praiſe the Lord; I will ſing praiſes unto my God, while I have any being."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 146. 2.</note> You will ſing "the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> ſaying, "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty."—You will every day join the everlaſting ſong of ſaints, and ſing—"Unto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood; and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his Father; to him be glory, and dominion, forever and ever, Amen."</p>
               <p>What remains now, but to teſtify your gratitude, and ſenſibility of obligation to praiſe and give thanks, by holy admiration, holy joy, and ſelf-dedication to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and glory of God. You come from the holy <hi>eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> full of abiding holy admiration. That "God is mindful of man," vile man: that he will dwell with man on earth, and hold communion with him—'tis a truth, but an aſtoniſhing one!—You will come from this holy ordinance rejoicing in God, as your exceeding joy; in all his infinite attributes; attributes which gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty your eternal ſalvation; and rejoicing in the whole of his will as abſolutely good and infinitely perfect.—Rejoicing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his <hi>perſon</hi>—in all his offices—in the benefits of redemption by him—in his high exaltation and univerſal government—in all his promiſes and all his precepts: Rejoicing in the Holy Spirit, in all his infinite perfections, and glorious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: Rejoicing in the proſperity of <hi>Zion,</hi> and in the

word and ordinances of God, and in his people as the excellent of the earth. Let me exhort you to ſee to it that your rejoicing in theſe glorious topics remains in you; and that your joy in them is the death of all joy in ſin.—At the ſame time interſperſe lamentations with your joy, in the view of your numerous deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and offences.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>You will alſo ſee to it that you come from the Lord's table with firmneſs of reſolution made in the ſtrength of the Lord, that you ſerve him, honour Chriſt, cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly avoid all evil; and perſevere in the practice of every chriſtian duty and virtue. You profeſs experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental religion, and that you will endeavour the practice of univerſal holineſs. Without chriſtian practice and an holy life, you will lack ſcripture evidence that you have grace and holy affections; for they directly, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tend to, and have their exerciſes and fruit in holy practice. In order to your being univerſally holy and obedient, your obedience muſt conſiſt not only in <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> univerſally avoiding wicked practices; but alſo you muſt be univerſal in the <hi>poſitives</hi> of religion. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity requires that you not only ſhun the very appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all evil; and that as having named the name of Chriſt, you depart from iniquity in love and practice, totally and finally; but alſo that you become fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord; and holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. You muſt not only be blameleſs and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but ornaments to chriſtianity. "Shining in the beauties of holineſs;" "your light ſo ſhining before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." Let it appear that you have been with the Lord Jeſus; and that his life is manifeſt in you: in that, as branches ingrafted in him by faith, as the true vine, you bring forth evangelical fruits of heart, lip, and life; having your converſation
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024155_0034_0FC3C8BA07A5A440"/>
as becometh his goſpel: Let his love conſtrain you to live to him, who you hope, has died for you. It is true, that all perſons under the goſpel diſpenſation, are under infinite obligation to ſerve God and their generation; obligation reſulting from the infinite perfections of God, his commanding authority, and his communicative good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The violation of infinite obligation is iniquity infinite. You hope the Lord hath done ſingular things for you, that he hath dealt more kindly with you than others; may he not then expect you will do more for him than others? Others ſhare in the good things of the kingdom of common providence, and in the good things of the kingdom of the goſpel, they enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of bibles, miniſters and ordinances; but you ſhare not only in <hi>theſe,</hi> but in the ſpecial ſpiritual bleſſings of the kingdom of grace; and have a firm title to the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs bleſſings of the kingdom of eternal glory. Surely all poſſible infinite obligation is devolved upon you to exert yourſelves in your ſeveral proper ſtations to glorify God, to honour Chriſt, and to do all the good you can to others.—Teach the world by your practice that the ſcripture doctrine of ſalvation by free and ſovereign grace, is a doctrine according to godlineſs: "as a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people ſhewing forth the praiſes of your God, who hath called you forth out of darkneſs into marvellous light:" with full purpoſe of heart cleaving to him, by faith, love, and obedience; "walking in his fear," as you would walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt." Reſt not in paſt experiences and preſent attainments; but "go on to perfection." Chriſtians that find they are under neceſſity of having recourſe to paſt experience for evidence of their gracious ſincerity and comfort, have not at preſent that exerciſe of grace and nearneſs to God they ought to have: if they had, light of evidence and comfort would ariſe from the preſent exerciſe of grace, as it always ſhould. The more frequently the exerciſes of grace are renewed, the more abiding and confirmed

our aſſurance will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, "forgetting thoſe things which are behind,"—"Preſs toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus."—"Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if you do theſe things you ſhall never be moved."—Stand upon your watch tower, at all times, watching againſt ſin and temptation; watching unto duty—the matter of it, the timing of it, and the manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Pray and praiſe without ceaſing—converſe much with God every day in your cloſets—and every day, and every hour in the day by ejaculatory or mental prayer. Chriſtians that do not abound in ejaculatory prayer and praiſe, do not live near to God; they neglect a duty and mean eminently uſeful to ſupport and promote the vigor and vitality of grace in the heart, and that by which the ſoul of the real chriſtian is much fed and nouriſhed.—Pray with an importunity that ſhall pierce even heaven, that the work of God among us, and where ever it is begun, may go on, and make glorious progreſs.

You received him as your ſupreme felicity and all-ſufficing portion for time and eternity, preferring of him above all other things, either in heaven or on earth, ſo walk as living to him, and upon him.—You received him as your teaching prophet to enlighten you by his word and ſpirit, that by his divine inſtruction you might become wiſe to eternal ſalvation; ſo walk.—You received him as your great high-prieſt, and interceſſor in the preſence of God; as having made complete atonement for ſin, and brought in a law-fulfilling, everlaſting righteouſneſs, rejecting your own righteouſneſs, you depended entirely

I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you by all the honor, glory and praiſe that is, and ever will be due to him, as God, man and mediator.—I beſeech you by the infinite perfections and dignity of the Holy Spirit; by his ſaving influences given for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, for ſanctification, for conſolation; and for edification, until you arrive at perfection in glory. I beſeech you by the love and compaſſion you have, (or ought to have) to the faithful miniſters of Chriſt, and to the friends and divine lovers of Jeſus, and of <hi>Zion's</hi> proſperity, as you would not cauſe their hearts to bleed, and their eyes to weep.

I beſeech you by your, ſacramental vow and oath of allegiance you have taken over the broken body and ſhed blood of your Redeemer, that you will walk with him, and as his people walk.—I beſeech and intreat you by the eternal agonies of the damned, which you hope to eſcape, and by all the joys and beatitudes of the ſanctuary of immortality and glory that you hope to poſſeſs, "that you walk as you have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord."</p>

He was pleaſed "to ſhine into my heart to give the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jeſus Chriſt." I now beheld the infinite amiable glory and all ſufficiency of Chriſt, as God, man mediator, and felt my heart go forth to him in acts of truſt and ſupreme love: I now ſaw the infinite excellence and ſafety of the goſpel method of ſalvation, and found my whole heart gained over to an approbation of, and an entire acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence in that divine <hi>plan</hi> as the device of infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and boundleſs love.—From that <hi>hour</hi> to <hi>this,</hi> (through infinite riches of ſovereign grace) I have found a new temper of heart, and tenor of life. At this <hi>time</hi> reigning benevolence toward fellow-men took poſſeſſion of my heart, and has been kept up to this hour. Here let me obſerve, that if my miniſtry has been uſeful to you, or others, the Lord was <hi>now</hi> preparing the way therefor, even before moſt of you were born.—In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe divine manifeſtations, for about the ſpace of two years I was held before the throne of grace daily praying for the knowledge of duty with reſpect to my ſeeking a liberal education; and obtaining ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this point, ſoon after the 20th year of my age I fixedly entered upon ſtudies, that prepared the way for taking my firſt degree at Yale-College in 1741.

Making my tours in various parts of theſe northern ſtates. Preaching almoſt every day, and often two and three times in a day; and often to very large congregations. I journey'd about two thouſand miles, and preached ſeveral hundred times in the ſpace of a year. I preached in many congregations where the work of God had made great and glorious progreſs: In ſome places it had juſt begun.—In ſome places I ſaw much oppoſition made to the work:—In ſome obſerved many imprudences chargeable upon the friends of the work.—Many congregations (and ſome numerous ones,) I found under the power of awful ſecurity in ſin: ſome of which, were ſoon univerſally awakened by the preaching of the word, and plentiful effuſion of the Holy Spirit; ſo that in a few weeks ſeveral ſcores of perſons were in thoſe places hopefully converted from ſin to God. Thus amidſt abounding labours and an amazing run of ſervices, I had the pleaſure of ſeeing the work of God going on and proſpering gloriouſly.—Thus I continued itinerating and preaching for about four years. But here it may be noted, that during this ſpace of time, I was twice ſeized with a fever, which each time ſat heavy upon me, eſpecially the laſt; ſo that my life was given over by myſelf and friends: But it pleaſed the ſovereign Lord of life, "in whoſe hand our times are," to reſtore me again to health and uſefulneſs.—Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forementioned ſpace of time, your fathers in this

I proceeded as far as the <hi>Jerſeys</hi> on my way; where meeting with the Rev. Meſſi.

                  <abbr>viz.</abbr> "I determine to know nothing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified." When I came into town I was fully reſolved to leave it in a few months; but ſpending the winter here, the people in the ſpring gave me a very unanimous call to ſettle in the miniſtry with them. I was thereupon for ſeveral months much exerciſed as to my duty; but finally accepted the call; and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled <hi>here</hi> September 19th, 1746. Preſident Edwards preached upon this occaſion from a text that ſome have ſince thought almoſt prophetical.<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai.</note> The Rev. Mr. Hunting being very infirm was diſmiſſed from his paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oral relation to this people upon my inſtalment. In his day, in the years 1741 and 42, there was a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work of God in this place.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the time of vacation at College, May, 1741, Mr. David Brainard and myſelf, having heard of the work of God as going on at <hi>Southold,</hi> and in this place, came upon the Iſland to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint ourſelves with it. I had then much ſatisfaction, not only in hearing the Rev. Mr. Burr preach ſeveral ſermons in this place, but alſo in converſation with many of the ſubjects of this work.</note> It was ſuppoſed, that
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024155_0042_0FC3C8CDBB948870"/>
upwards of a hundred perſons were then ſavingly wrought upon: In conſequence of which, about three ſcore perſons were added to the church ſoon after my inſtalment. In 1749 the work of God's grace was carried on powerfully in our <hi>eaſtern</hi> and weſtern <hi>villages:</hi> a conſiderable number of young people were wrought upon in each. The work was not ſo powerful in the body of the town at that time. But in the ever me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable year 1764, the work of God became general and univerſal: perſons of every age, from five or ſix years to eighty, were the ſubjects of the work. This work of God was the moſt powerful, the moſt genuine and evangelical that ever I knew. My printed Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this work in ſome of your hands, may inform you more fully. In conſequence of this glorious work, in a few months after it began, I propounded for full communion 99 perſons at one time, who were added to the church; and ſoon after a large number more.—There were a great number of children, ſome youth, and many that wanted more aſſurance, who were hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the ſubjects of a ſaving change, that did not offer themſelves to join the church at this time. This work brought ſome of the ſubjects of it to the poſſeſſion of the latter day glory to an eminent degree, in which they lived and died. In the year 1785, it pleaſed a ſovereign God to grant again another plentiful effuſion of the Holy Spirit upon us.—The work of God at this time was carried on with amazing power in the midſt of us. As many as ſix or eight every week for the ſpace of three months, were hopefully ſavingly wrought upon. As faſt as ſome met with light and comfort, others were awakened; yet the work was not ſo univerſal as in 1764: yet in a few months above an hundred were added to the church; profeſſing experimental and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024155_0043_0FC3C8CF7196C360"/>
religion. Others at this time became the ſubjects of ſome hope of a ſaving change. In the laſt year, 1791, the work of God among us, claims our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance "as one of the years of the right hand of the moſt high." The Lord "with whom is the reſidue of the ſpirit" has been pleaſed to viſit us again with the divine influences. Between thirty and forty have been lately added to the church, more we truſt are on their way about to come, in that many hope they have been the ſubjects of this work. The ſubjects of this work have been very powerfully wrought upon; and ſeem to have been uncommonly ſelected out from among others. This late work has not been ſo general among ſinners as uſually we have known. But for a univerſal viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and freſh anointings of the Lord's people and their increaſing light and comfort, I never know a revival of religion among us equal thereto ſince I have been your paſtor.—It is to be noted and remember'd, that in the intermediate ſpaces of theſe plentiful effuſions of the Holy Spirit from firſt to laſt there have been ſome hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtances of ſaving converſion to God. We have during the whole time enjoyed ſome ſpecial tokens of the Lords gracious preſence with us. Thus have we ſeen and known ſince I have been your paſtor, (exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of 41-2) four harveſt times and ſeaſons of the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful out pouring of the Holy Spirit, and times of the flocking of ſouls to Chriſt, and of acceſſions thereupon to his church. I have not heard or known of a people in any department of <hi>Zion</hi> that within the ſpace of fifty years, have been ſo frequently favoured with ſuch plentiful "out pourings of the Holy Spirit" upon them; infinitely vile, unworthy and ungrateful as we are! Having thus briefly reminded you of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite kindneſs of the glorious and eternal Trinity toward us, you will naturally reflect that our obligations to thoſe <hi>divine perſons</hi> riſe anſwerably high; and that our ingratitude will be proportionably aggravated, baſe, and vile.</p>

I have now to obſerve, that the Rev. Mr. Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my predeceſſor, and myſelf, have between us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated 92 years in the goſpel-miniſtry in this <hi>place.</hi> That ſince my inſtalment in the year 1746, nine hundred eighty nine perſons have departed life, that belonged to this town—thirteen of them the year paſt. In the ſame ſpace of time I have baptized in this place ſixteen hundred—45 of them the year paſt: near two hundred more than there are inhabitants at preſent. When I received this church, it conſiſted of 81 members, but three of which are now living. During this time, we have been called to part with many excellent chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, rich in experience of divine grace; many of them died in the triumphs of faith, others comfortably. Many valuable chriſtians have removed from us into various parts of the country, where, as we hear, they are uſeful.—Numerous heavy breaches and mournful vacancies have been made in this our <hi>Zion;</hi> but the Lord, from time to time, hath filled them all, and more than filled them; "and cauſed joy, rejoicing, thankſgiving, and the voice of melody to be heard in this city of our God." We have had the acceſſion of hundreds to the church: and perhaps the number of communicants was never larger than at the preſent time. It muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered in the catalogue of divine favours that I have enjoyed ſuch a ſeries of health, that for 44 years I was not ſo much as once prevented preaching by indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor had I a ſick day or hour during the whole ſpace of time. Forty-three of thoſe years I ſpent in your ſervice; and never to this day have I been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented—except when for a few ſabbaths I was debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the <hi>influenza.</hi> Such an uncommon meaſure of health, but little broke in upon for fifty years, hath been improved for the purpoſe of abounding miniſterial ſervices: I have preached in this ſpace of time, above ten thouſand times. Deſignation to office, opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities for miniſterial labours, gifts, graces, abilities
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024155_0045_0FC3C8D20CBF7D20"/>
more or leſs, aids, aſſiſtances and ſucceſſes, are all of and from the Lord; to whom be all the glory. "A man can receive nothing (of this kind), except it be given him from heaven." The Lord as an infinite ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign upon his throne, in raiſing up inſtruments for his ſervice, can take them from the ruſhes, the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, or fiſh-nets, qualify them for uſefulneſs, and by them "confound the wiſdom of the mighty." If He crowns our feeble attempts in his ſervice with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſucceſs, we wiſh to ſpeak of it with undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled gratitude, and with deep abaſement, as conſcious of our unworthineſs, of our deficiences, and our ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs intermixed with all our performances; and with a ſpring of joy, that yet a little while, and He will have all the glory of our uſefulneſs.</p>
               <p>Although I have preached abundantly in other places, ſince my connexion with you, yet moſtly with you, the people of my ſpecial charge. With you, my dear peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I have laboured and travelled in the work of the goſpel miniſtry, for a long courſe of years; I may ſay it without oſtentation, that "I have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful: I have made it my conſtant endeavour and buſineſs to gain ſouls to Chriſt, and build them up in faith and holineſs: principally inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſuch truths as expreſs the ſpirit of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and tending to direct, quicken and encourage you in the way to eternal life. I eſteem it as one of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mercies of the Lord towards me, that I have not "run in vain nor laboured in vain." I have abundant cauſe to bow my knee to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and bleſs his name that I have grounds to hope that he hath made me inſtrumental of bringing many among you into a ſaving acquaintance with himſelf.—Although you can eaſily recollect many of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant capital doctrines which I have mainly inſiſted upon in the courſe of my preaching; yet I have prepared therefor, and deſigned now to have given you a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024155_0046_0FC3C8D74186BB58"/>
account of them, but the time is elapſed.—I muſt only ſay, "I have not ſhunned to declare to you the whole counſel of God;" "and have kept back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is profitable unto you." The apoſtolic doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines I have preached to you are your crown and glory, as <hi>St. John</hi> ſpeaks, "your crown of twelve ſtars:" If ever you depart from ſuch doctrines and let theſe truths go, the "crown falls from your head," and the glorious God himſelf will depart and be gone; yea, be gone far from a forſaken ſanctuary; and you will ſee an <hi>Ichabod</hi> upon the miniſtry! It is the more needful that I give you warning, and exhort you to become rooted and eſtabliſhed in the faith, and belief of the truth at preſent, and thereby become guarded and fortified againſt error, becauſe you live in a day in which errors abound.</p>
               <p>There are preachers and writers in this day, who boldly and freely ſpeak out and publiſh errors and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, pernicious to the ſouls of men: and ſome, ſo artfully, under the ſpecious ſhew of ſanctity, that they would deceive the elect, if that were poſſible. The moſt artful ſeducers are thoſe who aſſert many goſpel doctrines, which they ſuppoſe will be pleaſing to ſuch as are ſound in the faith, concealing their corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, until they ſuppoſe they have ſufficiently gain'd intereſt in the affections of their hearers, and then they will gradually give vent to them with as much plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility as poſſible. You will watch againſt verging to "another goſpel." and contend earneſtly for the ſaith once delivered to the ſaints; as knowing that the Holy Spirit co-operates with truth; "and makes the goſpel the power of God to every one that believeth."—But as having preach'd the grand principles of the everlaſting goſpel to you, I might now naturally put you upon examination and enquiry how you have received and improved them: And obſerve to you, that if any of you continue finally to ſlight and neglect them, your eternal condemnation will be amazingly aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024155_0047_0FC3C8D8C42DFA10"/>
"your blood will not be required of me;" I ſhall appear as a witneſs againſt you before the awful bar of Chriſt, our final judge: But the time will not admit to dwell here.—If it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to prolong my life I ſhall count it worth while to ſpend the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of my days in promoting the welfare and proſperity of your ſouls. Although I do not perceive that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervices are now more weariſome than they were thirty years ago, yet, if no acute diſeaſe invades accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a courſe of nature I cannot continue your paſtor much longer. For length of time we have had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd connection as <hi>one,</hi> mutually rejoicing in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſympathetic in adverſity. I preſume I am not now preaching my valedictory ſermon, however, I take this opportunity to thank you for all your benevolence and kindneſſes expreſſed towards me and mine.—Who will be my ſucceſſor I know not; though I know what he ought to be in character. I hope, "no grievous wolves will enter in among you, not ſparing the flock:" Nor "ſubtle foxes that ſpoil the tender vines which have grapes:" Nor any that will dare "to liſt up their axes upon the carved work of the temple."—I pray the Lord in infinite mercy to preſerve you from the greateſt outward judgment and calamity that can befal you, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that of an unconverted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry! I have often thought, that could I know this would be your awful <hi>doom,</hi> from love to your ſouls, and the ſouls of your dear children, I ſhould grieve myſelf down into the grave. I ſpeak the truth, the very thought thereof, gives me a more ſenſible ſhock, than the thought of death itſelf.—I ſhould account it one of the choiceſt favours in life to ſee an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion gift of our enthroned Saviour Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, conferred upon you, before my departure hence.—Now you obſerve that all is harmony, love and good-will—that there is not a ſeparate, a ſectarian, or any one of a different denomination from us in
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024155_0048_0FC3C8DAE9D409D0"/>
the boundaries of the town:—but who can ſay it will be <hi>thus,</hi> if after my departure, you are called to the re-ſettlement of the goſpel miniſtry among you?—There may be that concealed in the heart, which as yet is not acted out in the life, for want of time and anſwerable temptation to draw it forth. Your preſent outward viſible harmony, by reaſon of an internal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent taſte and reliſh, may be broken in upon, when you come to elect a paſtor, and diſcord unhappily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Although I thus ſpeak (with a degree of fear) "yet I hope better things." I preſume you will not take up ſatisfied with a flouriſh of words, and the art of oratory in ſpeaking, if there be wanting, ſolidity of thought, and apparent ſolemnity of ſpirit: Nor with an unconnected, undigeſted, and confuſed manner of ſpeaking, with much apparent fervency and little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. You will wiſh to have a miniſter that is "both a burning and ſhining light;" having knowledge and zeal proportionably aſſociated, and both riſing to a degree of eminency;—a man of ſolid judgement, of a fruitful invention, of learned acquirements, and <hi>Paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> in principle;—endowed with gifts and graces, and furniſhed with a fund of doctrinal and experimental knowledge; not preaching up all his divinity in a few ſermons; but bringing out of his treaſures things new and old—"feeding you with knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;"—rightly dividing, and cloſely applying the <hi>word,</hi> giving to ſinners their portion; and "feeding the ſheep and lambs of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as a workman that need not be aſhamed:"—a preacher that does not <hi>divine</hi> for money, (though to be honorably ſupported) preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, and wiſe to win ſouls to him—powerfully preſſing upon you faith and repentance, and ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to all divine precepts; but always with evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical references.—You will aſſuredly ſee to it, that your elect paſtor, both in praying and preaching gives due honour to the Holy Spirit;—that he frequently
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024155_0049_0FC3C8DBC24A26B0"/>
reminds you of the neceſſity, the excellency, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Spirit's</hi> miſſion—that his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is the moſt neceſſary, vital, and fundamental good;—that where He ſuſpends his influence there will be weakneſs, darkneſs, and deadneſs,—that where He divinely exerts the powers of his office and the perfections of his nature, there will be light, ſtrength, and life divine.—And that as a preacher he comes to you in the demonſtration of the Spirit and of power.—May the aſcended and exalted Saviour, from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſted ſtores and immenſe fulneſs, confer upon you the royal donative of a ſpiritual paſtor and teacher, "that the Lord God may meet with you in every place, where He has recorded his Name," bleſs you, and dwell with you forever!</p>
               <p>Finally, brethren, pray for me, (as I hope to for you, 'till my expiring breath) and when I have gotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of your prayers, I hope you will have occaſion to praiſe the Lord for ever, that I was once for a time your miniſter.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now conclude in few words.</p>
               <p>Having this day entered upon the threſhold of a new year, let us now unite in making the ſaint's confeſſion, Jehovah, "my times are in thy hand."—Let us offer undiſſembled praiſe to God, that we have life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to this day.—Let us alſo enter upon this new revolution of time under realizing views of the brevity and uncertainty of life. Nothing is more certain than that our time here will be ſhort; nothing more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than how ſhort it will be.</p>

                  <l>" Of man's too rapid race!</l>

                  <l>" They who the longeſt leaſe enjoy,</l>
                  <l>" Have told us with a ſigh,</l>
                  <l>" That to be born, ſeems little more</l>
                  <l>" Than to begin to die."</l>

It ſeems that neither revelation, nor providence will let us live long in this world. How ſhort a duration is there for us on this ſide the grave? It is not only poſſible, but highly probable, that death may meet ſome of us within the compaſs of this year. If we could look into the volume of the divine decrees, no doubt, one and another of us would there ſee our ſentence, and the time of its execution fixed—"this year thou ſhalt die."—Surely it infinitely concerns each and every one of us to be found in readineſs for an exchange of worlds:—without interpoſing delay to tranſact with God through Chriſt the divine Mediator relative to our eternal ſalvation. Suffice it to ſay, my dear hearers, (or readers) you muſt remember, always remember, that you were made for God, religion and eternity; and that you muſt have a religion that will befriend you in life, at death, at judgment, and be as laſting as eternity.</p>
               <p>In fine—"whether we live, may we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, may we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, may we be the Lord's."</p>
