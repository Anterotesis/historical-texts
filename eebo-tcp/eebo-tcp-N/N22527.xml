            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HIS Britanic Majeſty, and the United States of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, being deſirous, by a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, to terminate their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſuch a manner, as, without reference to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their reſpective complaints and pretentions, may be the beſt calculated to produce mutual ſatisfaction and good underſtanding: And alſo to regulate the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Navigation between their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Territories and People, in ſuch a manner as to render the ſame reciprocally beneficial and ſatisfactory; they have reſpectively named their Plenipotentiaries, and given them full powers to treat of, and conclude the ſaid Treaty: that is to ſay: His Britannic Majeſty has named for his Plenipotentiary, the Right Hon. William Wyndham Baron Grenville, of Wotton, one of his Majeſty's privy council, and his Majeſty's principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate thereof, have appointed for their Plenipotentiary, the Hon. John Jay, Chief Juſtice of the ſaid United States, and their Envoy Extraordinary to his Majeſty, who have agreed on and concluded the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing articles:</p>
            <p>ARTICLE I. There ſhall be a firm, inviolable and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal peace, and a true and ſincere friendſhip, between his Britanic Majeſty, his heirs and ſucceſſors, and the
<pb facs="unknown:029747_0003_0FE2511255A01260"/>
United States of America; and between their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countries, territories, cities, towns and people of every degree, without exception of perſons or places.</p>
            <p>ART. II. His Majeſty will withdraw all his troops and garriſons from all poſts and places within the boundary lines, aſſigned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation ſhall take place on or before the firſt day of June one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-ſix, and all the proper meaſures ſhall in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval be taken by concert between the government of the United States, and his Majeſty's Governor General in America, for ſettling the previous arrangemnets which may be neceſſary reſpecting the delivery of the ſaid poſts: The United States in the mean time at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, extending their ſettlements to any part within the ſaid boundary line, except within the precincts or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of any of the ſaid poſts. All ſettlers and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, within the precincts or juriſdiction of the ſaid poſts ſhall continue to enjoy, unmoleſted, all their property of every kind, and ſhall be protected therein. They ſhall be at full liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; and it ſhall alſo be free to them to ſell their lands, houſes, or effects, or to retain the property thereof, at their diſcretion; ſuch of them as ſhall continue to reſide within the ſaid bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lines ſhall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oath of allegiance to the government thereof, but they ſhall be at full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſo to do, if they think proper, and they ſhall make and declare their election within one year after the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation aforeſaid. And all perſons who ſhall continue there after the expiration of the ſaid year, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared their intention of remaining ſubjects of his Britanic Majeſty, ſhall be conſidered as having elected to become citizens of the United States.</p>
            <p>ART. III. It is agreed that it ſhall at all times be free for his Majeſty's ſubjects, and to the citizens of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029747_0004_0FE2515195B9DBF0"/>
States, and alſo to the Indians dwelling on either ſide of the ſaid boundary line, freely to paſs and repaſs by land or inland navigation, into the reſpective territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and countries of the two parties on the continent of America [the country within the limits of the Hudſon's Bay Company only excepted] and to navigate all the Lakes, Rivers, and Waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that this article does not extend to the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of veſſels of the United States into the Sea Ports, Harbours, Bays, or Creeks of his Majeſty's ſaid territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as are between the mouth thereof, and the higheſt port of entry from the Sea, except in ſmall veſſels trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec, under ſuch regulations as ſhall be eſtabliſhed to prevent the poſſibility of any frauds in this reſpect. Nor, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Britiſh veſſels from the Sea into the Rivers of the United States, beyond the higheſt ports of entry for foreign veſſels from the Sea. The River Miſſiſippi ſhall however, according to the Treaty of Peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its Eaſtern ſide, to whichſoever of the parties belonging, may freely be reſorted to, and uſed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his Majeſty in Great Britain.</p>
            <p>All goods and merchandize whoſe importation into his Majeſty's ſaid territories in America, ſhall not be entirely prohibited, may freely, for the purpoſes of commerce, be carried into the ſame in the manner aforeſaid, by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the United States, and ſuch goods and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize ſhall be ſubject to no higher or other duties than would be payable by his majeſty's ſubjects on the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſame from Europe into the ſaid territories. And in like manner, all goods and merchandize whoſe importation into the United State ſhall not be wholly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029747_0005_0FE2511B372C92A0"/>
prohibited, may freely, for the purpoſes of Commerce, be carried into the ſame, in the manner aforeſaid, by his Majeſty's ſubjects, and ſuch goods and merchandize ſhall be ſubject to no higher or other duties than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the ſame in American veſſels into the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ports of the ſaid States. And all goods not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to be exported from the ſaid territories, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, may in like manner be carried out of the ſame by the two parties reſpectively, paying duty as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
            <p>No duty of entry ſhall ever be levied by either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into the ſaid territories reſpectively, nor ſhall the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans paſſing or re-paſſing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever nature, pay for the ſame any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large packages unuſual among Indians ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians.</p>
            <p>No higher or other tolls or rates of ferriage than what are or ſhall be payable by natives, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on either ſide; and no duties ſhall be payable on any goods which ſhall merely be carried over any of the portages or carrying places on either ſide; for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of being immediately reimbarked and carried to ſome other place or places. But as by this ſtipulation it is only meant to ſecure to each party a free paſſage accroſs the portages on both ſides, it is agreed, that this exemption from duty ſhall extend only to ſuch goods as are carried in the uſual and direct road acroſs the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner ſold or exchanged during their paſſage acroſs the ſame, and proper regulations may be eſtabliſhed to prevent the poſſibility of any frauds in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>As this article in intended to render in a great degree, the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a diſpoſition favourable to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029747_0006_0FE2515326B8C010"/>
and good neighbourhood, it is agreed, that the reſpective Governments will mutually promote this amicable intercourſe, by cauſing ſpeedy and impartial juſtice to be done, and neceſſary protection to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all who may be concerned therein.</p>
            <p>ART. IV. Whereas it is uncertain whether the River Miſſiſippi extends ſo far to the Northward as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſected by a line to be drawn due Weſt from the Lake of the Woods in the manner mentioned in the Treaty of Peace between his Majeſty and the United States, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that meaſures ſhall be taken in concert between his Majeſty's government in America and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States for making a joint ſurvey of the ſaid river from one degree of latitude below the Falls of St. Anthony, to the principal ſource or ſources of the ſaid river, and alſo of the parts adjacent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and that if on the reſult of ſuch ſurvey, it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the ſaid river would not be interſected by ſuch a line as is above-mentioned, the two parties will thereupon proceed by amicable negociation to regulate the boundary line in that quarter, as well as all other points to be adjuſted between the ſaid parties, according to juſtice and mutual convenience, and in conformity to the intent of the ſaid Treaty.</p>
            <p>ART. V. Whereas doubts have ariſen what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſaid Treaty of Peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein deſcribed, that queſtion ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the final deciſion of Commiſſions to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following manner, viz.</p>
            <p>One Commiſſioner ſhall be named by his Majeſty and one by the Preſident of the United States, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate thereof, and the ſaid two Commiſſioners ſhall agree on the choice of a third; or if they cannot ſo agree, they ſhall each propoſe one perſon, and of the two names ſo propoſed, one ſhall be drawn by lot in the preſence of the two original Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029747_0007_0FE2511D460A14E0"/>
And the three Commiſſioners ſo appointed, ſhall be ſworn impartially to examine and decide the ſaid queſtion according to ſuch evidence as ſhall reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively be laid before them on the part of the Britiſh Government and of the U. States. The ſaid Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſhall meet at Halifax, and ſhall have power to adjourn to ſuch other place or places as they ſhall think fit. They ſhall have power to appoint a Scretary, and to employ ſuch ſurveyors or other perſons as they ſhall judge neceſſary. The ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration under their hands and ſeals decide what river is the River St. Croix intended by the treaty. The ſaid declaration ſhall contain a deſcription of the ſaid river and ſhall particularize the latitude and longitude of its mouth and of its ſource. Duplicates of this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of the ſtatements of their accounts, and of the journal of their proceedings ſhall be delivered by them to the Agent of his Majeſty and to the Agent of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States who may be reſpectively appointed and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to manage the buſineſs on behalf of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Governments. And both parties agree to conſider ſuch deciſion as final and concluſive, ſo as that the ſame ſhall never thereafter be called into queſtion, or made the ſubject of diſpute or difference between them.</p>
            <p>ART, VI. Whereas it is alledged by divers Britiſh merchants and others his Majeſty's ſubjects, that debts to a considerable amount, which were bona fide contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the peace, ſtill remain owing to them by citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens or inhabitants of the United States, and that by the operation of various lawful impediments ſince the peace not only the full recovery of the ſaid debts has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, but alſo the value and ſecurity thereof have, in ſeveral inſtances, impaired and leſſened, ſo that by the ordinary courſe of judical proceedings, the Britiſh cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors cannot now obtain, and actually have and receive full and adequate compenſation for the loſſes and dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they have thereby ſuſtained: It is agreed, that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029747_0008_0FE2515B883FB990"/>
complaints, as under the ſaid article ſhall be preferred to the ſaid Commiſſioners; and that I will forbear to act as a Commiſſioner in any caſe in which I may be perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intereſted.</p>
            <p>Three of the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall conſtitute a board, and ſhall have power to do any act appertaining to the ſaid commiſſion, provided that one of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners named on each ſide, and the fifth commiſſioner ſhall be preſent, and all deciſions ſhall be made by the majority of the voices of the Commiſſioners then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; 18 months from the day on which the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſhall form a board, and be ready to proceed to buſineſs, are aſſigned for receiving complaints, and applications; but they are nevertheleſs authorized in any particular caſes in which it ſhall appear to them to be reaſonable and juſt, to extend the ſaid term of eighteen months for any term not exceeding ſix months, after the expiration thereof. The ſaid Cemmiſſioners ſhall <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rſt meet at Philadelphia, but they ſhall have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to adjourn from place to place as they ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Commiſſioners in examining the complaints and applications ſo preferred to them, are empowered and required, in purſuance of the true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this article, to take into their conſideration all claims, whether of principal or intereſt, or balances of principal and intereſt, and to determine the ſame reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, according to the merits of the ſeveral caſes, due regard being had to all the circumſtances thereof, and as equity and juſtice ſhall appear to them to require. And the ſaid commiſſioners ſhall have power to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all ſuch perſons as ſhall come before them on oath or affirmation touching the premiſes; and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evidence according as they may think moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with equity and juſtice, all written depoſitions, or books, or paper, or copy, or extract being duly authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated, either according to the legal forms now reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively exiſting in the two countries, or in ſuch other

            <p>ART. VII. Whereas complaints have been made by divers merchants and others, citizens of the United States, that during the courſe of the war in which his Majeſty is now engaged, they have ſuſtained conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loſſes and damage, by reaſon of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of their veſſels other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty under colour of authority or commiſſions from his Majeſty, and that from various circumſtances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaid baſes, adequate compenſation for the loſſes and damages ſo ſuſtained cannot now be actually obtained, had and received by the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings; it is agreed, that in all ſuch caſes where adequate compensation cannot, for whatever reaſon, be now actually obtained, had and received by the ſaid merchants and others in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, full and complete compenſation for the ſame will be made by the Britiſh Government to the ſaid complainants. But it is diſtinctly underſtood that this proviſion is not to extend to ſuch loſſes or damages as

            <p>ART. VIII. It is further agreed, that the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mentioned in this and in the two preceding articles ſhall be reſpectively paid in ſuch manner as ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed between the two parties? ſuch agreement being to be ſettled at the time of the exchange of the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of this Treaty.

Neither the debts due from individuals of the other, for ſhares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks ſhall ever in any event of war or national differences be ſequeſtered or confiſcated, it being unjuſt and impolitic that debts and engagements contracted and made by individuals having confidence in each other and in their reſpective governments ſhould ever be deſtroyed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by national authority on account of national dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and diſcontents.</p>

            <p>ART. XII. His Majeſty conſents that it ſhall and may be lawful during the time herein after limited for the citizens of the United States to carry to any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's iſlands and ports in the Weſt-Indies from the United States, in their own veſſels, not being above the burthen of 70 tons, any goods or merchandiſes being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the ſaid States, which is or may be lawful to carry to the ſaid Iſlands or Ports from the ſaid States in Britiſh veſſels; and that the ſaid American veſſels ſhall be ſubject there to no other or higher tonnage duties or charge than ſhall be paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Britiſh veſſels in the ports of the United States; and that the cargoes of the ſaid American veſſels ſhall be ſubject there to no other or higher duties or charges than ſhall be payable on the like articles if imported there from the ſaid States in Britiſh veſſels.</p>

            <p>It is agreed that this article and every matter and thing therein contained ſhall continue to be in force du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the continuance of the war in which his Majeſty is now engaged; and alſo for two year from and after the day of the ſignature of the preliminary other articles of peace by which the ſame may be terminated.</p>
            <p>And it is further agreed, that at the expiration of the ſaid term the two contracting parties will endeavour further to regulate their commerce in this reſpect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

            <p>ART. XIII. His Mejeſty conſents that the veſſels belonging to the citizens of the U S. of America ſhall be admitted and hoſpitably received in all the ſea-ports and harbours of the Britiſh territories in the Eaſt Indies. And that the Citizens of the ſaid United States may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on a Trade between the ſaid territories and the ſaid United States in all articles of which the Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Exportation reſpectively to or from the ſaid Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, ſhould not be entirely prohibited.

The award of the ſaid Commiſſioners, or any ſuch three of them as aforeſaid, ſhall, in all caſes be final and concluſive, both as to the juſtice of the claim, and the amount of the ſum to be paid to the claimant; and his Britannic Majeſty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to cauſe the ſame to be paid to ſuch claimant in ſpecie, without any deduction, at ſuch place or places, and at ſuch time or times as ſhall be awarded by the ſaid Commiſſioners, and on condition of ſuch releaſes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is agreed that in all ſuch caſes where reſtitution ſhall not have been made agreeably to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferſon to Mr. Hammond, dated at Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1793, a copy of which is annexed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029747_0015_0FE2512D2FB63FA8"/>
to ſome port or place in America, where the ſame ſhall be unladen, and ſuch regulations ſhall be adopted by both parties, as ſhall from time to time be found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enforce the due and faithful observance of this ſtipulation. It is alſo underſtood that the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion granted by this article is not to extend to allow the veſſels of the United States to carry on any part of the coaſting trade of the ſaid Britiſh territories; but veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels going with their original cargoes, or part thereof, from one port of diſcharge to another, are not to be conſidered as carrying on the coaſting trade. Neither is this article to be conſtrued to allow the citizens of the ſaid States to ſettle or reſide within the ſaid territories, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Britiſh Government eſtabliſhed there; and if any tranſgreſſion ſhould be attempted againſt the regulations of the Britiſh government in this reſpect, the obſervance of the ſame ſhall and may be enforced againſt the Citizens of America in the ſame manner as againſt Britiſh ſubjects or others tranſgreſſing the ſame rule. And the citizens of the United States whenever they arrive in any port or harbour in the ſaid territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or if they ſhould be permitted in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to go to any other place therein, ſhall always be ſubject to the laws, government and juriſdiction of what nature eſtabliſhed in ſuch harbour, port or place, according as the ſame may be: The citizens of the United States, may alſo touch for refreſhment at the iſland of St. Helena, but ſubject in all reſpects to ſuch regulations as the Britiſh Government may from time to time eſtabliſh there.</p>
            <p>ART. XIV. There ſhall be between all the dominions of his majeſty in Europe and the territories of the U. ſtates a reciprocal and perfect liberty of commerce and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The people and inhabitants of the two countries ſhall have liberty freely and ſecurely and without hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and moleſtation to come with their ſhips and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029747_0016_0FE24BA79E6DDB20"/>
to the lands, countries, cities, ports, places and rivers within the dominions and terrories aforeſaid, to enter into the ſame, to reſort there and to remain and reſide there, without any limitation of time: Alſo to hire and poſſeſs houſes and warehouſes for the purpoſes of their commerce, and generally the merchants and traders on each ſide ſhall enjoy the moſt complete protection and ſecurity for their commerce; but ſubject always as to what reſpects this article, to the laws and ſtatutes of the two countries reſpectively.</p>
            <p>ART. XV. It is agreed that no other or higher du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall be paid by the ſhips or merchandize of the one party in the ports of the other, than ſuch as are paid by the like veſſels or merchandize of all other nations. Nor ſhall any other or higher duty be impoſed in one country on the importation of any articles the growth, produce or manufacture of the other than are or ſhall be payable on the importation of the like articles being of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor ſhall any prohibition be impoſed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties reſpectively, which ſhall not equally extend to all other nations.</p>
            <p>But the Britiſh Government reſerves to itſelf the right of impoſing on American veſſels entering into the Britiſh ports in Europe a tonnage duty equal to that which ſhall be payable by Britiſh veſſels in the ports of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: And alſo ſuch duty as may be adequate to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the difference of duty now payable on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of European and Aſiatic goods when imported into the United States in Britiſh or in American veſſels.</p>
            <p>The two parties agree to treat for the more exact equalization of the duties on the reſpective navigation of their ſubjects and people in ſuch manner as may be moſt beneficial to the two countries. The arrangements for this purpoſe ſhall be made at the ſame time with thoſe mentioned at the concluſion of the 12th article of this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029747_0017_0FE2512EC3A3E280"/>
treaty, and are to be conſidered as a part thereof. In the interval it is agreed, that the United States will not impoſe any new or additional tonnage duties on Britiſh veſſels, nor increaſe the now ſubſiſting difference between the duties payable on the importation of any articles in Britiſh or American veſſels.</p>
            <p>ART. XVI. It ſhall be free for the two contracting parties, reſpectively to appoint conſuls for the protection of trade, to reſide in the dominions and territories afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and the ſaid conſuls ſhall enjoy thoſe liberties and rights which belong to them by reaſon of their function. But before any conſul ſhall act as ſuch he ſhall be in the uſual forms approved and admitted by the party to whom he is ſent; and it is hereby declared to be lawful and proper, that in caſe of illegal or improper conduct towards the laws or government a Conſul may either be puniſhed according to law, if the laws will reach the caſe nor be diſmiſſed, or even ſent back, the offended government aſſigning to the other their reaſons for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Either of the parties may except from the reſidence of conſuls ſuch particular places as ſuch party ſhall judge proper to be ſo excepted.</p>
            <p>ART. XVII. It is agreed, that in all caſes where veſſels ſhall be captured or detained on juſt ſuſpicion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy any of the articles which are contraband of war, the ſaid veſſel ſhall be brought to the neareſt or moſt convenient <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and if any property of an enemy should be found on board ſuch veſſel, that part only which belongs to the enemy ſhall be made prize, and the veſſel ſhall be at liberty to proceed with the remainder without any impediment And it is agreed, that all proper meaſures ſhall be taken to prevent delay, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding the caſes of ſhips or cargoes ſo brought in for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udication; and in the payment or recovery of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029747_0018_0FE251700CF31BF8"/>
adjudged or agreed to be paid to the maſters of owners of ſuch ſhips.</p>
            <p>ART. XVIII. In order to regulate what is in future to be deemed contraband of war, it is agreed that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid denomination ſhall be comprized all arms and implements ſerving for the purpoſes of war, by land or ſea, ſuch as cannon, muſkets, mortars, petards, bombs, grenadoes, carcaſſes, ſauciſſes, carriages for cannon, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket reſts, bandoliers, gunpowder, match, ſalt-petre, ball pikes, ſwords, head pieces, cutlaſſes, halberts, lances, javelins, horſe furniture, holſters, belts, and generally other implements of war; as alſo timber for ſhip building, tar or rozin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may ſerve directly to equipment of veſſels, unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted; and all the above articles are hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be juſt objects of confiſcation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to an enemy.</p>
            <p>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the preciſe caſes in which alone proviſions and other articles not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally contraband may be regarded as ſuch, renders it expedient to provide againſt the inconveniences and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings which might thence ariſe: It is further agreed, that whenever any ſuch articles ſo becoming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband according to the exiſting laws of Nations, ſhall for that reaſon be ſeized, the ſame ſhall not be confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, but the owners thereof ſhall be ſpeedily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely indemnified; and the captors, or in their default the government under whoſe authority they act, ſhall pay to the maſters or owners of ſuch veſſels the full value of all articles, with a reaſonable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and alſo the demurrage inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſuch detention.</p>
            <p>And whereas it frequently happens that veſſels ſail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the ſame is either beſieged, blockaded or inveſted, it is agreed, that every veſſel ſo circumſtanced may be

turned away from ſuch port or place, but ſhe ſhall not be detained not her cargo, if not contraband, be conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unleſs after notice ſhe ſhall again attempt to enter, but file ſhall be permitted to go to any other port or place ſhe may think proper: Nor ſhall any veſſel or goods of either party. that may have entered into ſuch port or place, before the ſame was beſieged, block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded or inveſted by the. other, and be ſound therein after the. reduction or ſurrender of ſuch place, be liable to confiſcation, but ſhall be reſtored to the owners or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors thereof.</p>
            <p>ART. XIX. And that more abundant care be taken for the ſecurity of the reſpective ſubjects and citizens of the contracting parties, to prevent their ſuffering injuries by the men of war, or privateers of either party, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of ships of war and privateers and all others the ſaid ſubjects and citizens ſhall forbear doing any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to thoſe of the other partys or committing any outrage againſt them, and if they act to the contrary they ſhall be puniſhed, and ſhall alſo be bound in their perſons and eſtates to make ſatisfaction and reparation for all damages, and the intereſt thereof, of whatever nature the ſaid damages may be.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe all commanders of privateers before they receive their commiſſions ſhall hereafter be obliged to give before a competent judge, ſufficient ſecurity by at leaſt two reſponſible ſuretica, who have no intereſt in the ſaid privateer each of whom, together with the ſaid commander, shall be jointly and ſeverally bound in the ſum of fifteen hundred pounds ſterling, or if ſuch ships be provided with above one hundred and fifty ſeamen or ſoldiers, in the ſum of three thouſand pounds ſterling, to ſatisfy all damages and injuries, which the ſaid privateer or her officers or men, or any of them may do or commit during their cruize, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, or to the laws and inſtructions for regulating their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029747_0020_0FE251719EDE2538"/>
and further that in all caſes of aggreſſions the ſaid commiſſions shall be revoked and annulled.</p>
            <p>It is alſo agreed that whenever a judge of a court of admiralty of either of the parties, shall pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt any veſſel or goods or property belonging to the ſubjects or citizens of the other party a formal and duly authenticated Copy of all the proceedings in the cauſe, and of the ſaid ſentence, ſhall if required be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the commander of the ſaid veſſel, without the ſmalleſt delay, he paying all legal fees and demands for the ſame.</p>
            <p>ART. XX. It is further agreed that both the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties, ſhall not only refuſe to receive any pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into any of their ports, havens, or towns, or permit any of thair inhabitants to receive, protect, harbour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal or aſſiſt them in any manner, but will bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign punishment all ſuch inhabitants as shall be guilty of ſuch acts or offences. And all their ships with goods or merchandizes taken by them and brought into the port of either of the ſaid partie, shall be ſeized as far as they can be diſcovered and shall be reſtored to the owners or their factors or agents duly deputed and authorized in writing by them [proper evidence being firſt given in the Court of Admiralty for proving the property] even in caſe ſuch effects should have paſſed into other hands by ſale, if it be proved that the buyers knew or had good reason to believe, or ſuſpect that they had been piratical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken.</p>
            <p>ART. XXI. It is like wiſe agreed, that the ſubjects and citizens of the two nations, shall not do any acts of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or violence againſt each other, nor accept commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or inſtructions ſo to act from any foreign prince or ſtate, enemies to the other party; nor ſhall the enemies of one of the parties be permitted to invite, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to enliſt in their military ſervice any of the ſubjects or citizens of the other party; and the laws againſt all ſuch offences and aggreſſions ſhall be punctually execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029747_0021_0FE2513C9423F9B0"/>
And if any ſubject or citizen of the ſaid parties reſpectively shall accept any foreign commiſſion, or letters of marque, for arming any veſſel to act as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer againſt the other party, and be taken by the. other party, it is hereby declared to be lawful for the ſaid party to treat and puniſh the ſaid ſubject or citizen having ſuch commiſſion or letters of marque, as a pirate.</p>
            <p>ART. XXII. It is. expreſsly ſtipulated that neither of the ſaid contracting parties will order or authorise any acts of reprizal againſt the other, on complaints of injuries or damages until the ſaid party ſhall firſt have preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the other a ſtatement thereof, verified by compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent proof and evidence, and demanding juſtice and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and the ſame ſhall either have been refuſed or unreasonably delayed.</p>
            <p>ART. XXIII. The ſhips of war of each of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racting parties ſhall, at all times, be hoſpitably receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ports of the other, their officers and crews pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng due reſpect to the laws and government of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The officers ſhall be treated with that reſpect which is due to the commiſſions which they bear and if any inſult ſhould be offered to them by any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, all offenders in this reſpect ſhall be puniſhed, as diſturbers of the peace and amity between, the two countries. And his majeſty conſents that in caſe an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican veſſels ſhould by ſtreſs of weather, danger from enemies or other misfortunes be reduced to the neceſſity of ſeeking ſhelter in any of his majeſty's ports, into which ſuch veſſel could not in ordinary caſes claim to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſhe ſhall on manifeſting that neceſſity, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the government of the place, be hoſpitably received and permitted to refit and to purchaſe at the market price ſuch neceſſaries, as ſhe may ſtand in neeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, conformably to ſuch orders and regulations as the government of the place, having reſpect to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of each caſe, ſhall preſcribe. She ſhall not be

allowed to break bulk or unload her cargo, Unleſs the ſame ſhall be bona fide neceſſary to her being refitted; nor ſhall be permitted to ſell any part of her cargo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo much only as may be neceſſary to defray her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and then not without the expreſs permiſſion of the government of the place; nor ſhall ſhe be obliged to pay any duties whatever, except only on ſuch articles as ſhe may be permitted to ſell for the purpoſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
            <p>ART. It ſhall not be lawful for any foreign privateers (not being ſubjects or citizens of either of the ſaid parties) who have commiſſions from any other prince or ſtate in enmity with either nation, to arm their ſhips in the ports of either of the ſaid parties, nor to ſell what they have taken, nor is any other manner to exchange the ſame; nor ſhall they be allowed to purchaſe more proviſions than ſhall be neceſſary for their going to the neareſt port of that prince or ſtate from whom they obtained their commiſſions.</p>
            <p>ART. XXV. It ſhall be lawful for ſhips of war and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, belonging to the ſaid parties reſpectively, to carry whitherſoever they pleaſe the ſhips and goods taken from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any fee to the officers of the admiralty, or to any judges Whatever; nor ſhall the ſaid prizes, when they arrive at end enter the ports of the ſaid parties, be detained or ſeized, neither ſhall the ſearchers or other officers of thoſe places viſit ſuch prizes (except for the purpoſe of preventing the carrying of any part of the cargo thereof on more, in any manner contrary to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed laws of revenue, navigation or commerce) nor ſhall ſuch officers take cognizance of the validity of ſuch priz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but they ſhall be at liberty to hoiſt ſail, and depart as ſpeedily as maybe, and carry their ſaid prizes to the place mentioned in their commiſſions or patents, which the commanders of the ſaid ſhips of war or privateers ſhall be obliged to ſhew. No ſhelter or refuge ſhall be given in their ports to ſuch as have made a prize upon the ſubjects or citizens of either of the ſaid parties; but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029747_0023_0FE2513E242CC9B8"/>
if forced by ſtreſs of weather, or the danger of the ſea, to enter therein, particular care ſhall be taken to haſten their departure, and to cauſe them to retire at ſoon as poſſible. Nothing in this treaty contained ſhall howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be conſtrued or operate contrary to former and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting public treaties with other ſovereign ſtates. But the two parties agree, that while they continue in amity, neither of them will in future make any treaty that ſhall be inconſiſtent with this or the preceding article.</p>
            <p>Neither of the ſaid parties ſhall permit the ſhips or goods belonging to the ſubjects or citizens of the other to be taken within cannon ſhot of the coaſt, nor in any of the bays, ports or rivers, of their territories, by ſhips of war, or others, having commiſſion from any prince, republic, or ſtate whatever. But in caſe it ſhould ſo happen, the party whoſe territorial right ſhall thus have been violated, ſhall uſe his utmoſt endeavors to obtain from the offending party full and ample ſatsfaction for the veſſel or veſſels ſo taken, whether the ſame be veſſels of war or merchant veſſels.</p>
            <p>ART. XXVI. If at any time a rupture ſhould take place (which God forbid) between his Majeſty and the United States, the merchants and others of each of the two nations reſiding in the dominions of the other ſhall have the privilege of remaining and continuing, their trade, ſo long as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence againſt the laws; and in caſe their conduct ſhould render them ſuſpected, and the reſpective governments ſhould think proper to order them to remove, the term of twelve months from the publication of the order ſhall be allowed them for that purpoſe, to remove with their families, effects and property; but this favor ſhall not be extended to thoſe who ſhall act contrary to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed laws; and for greater certainty it is declared, that ſuch rupture ſhall not be deemed to exiſt while negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for accommodating differences ſhall be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor until the reſpective ambaſſadors or miniſters, if ſuch there ſhall be, ſhall be recalled, or ſent home,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029747_0024_0FE2517E45741670"/>
on account of ſuch differences, and not on account of perſonal miſconduct, according to the nature and degrees of which both parties retain their rights, either to requeſt the, recal, or immediately to ſend home the ambaſſador of miniſter of the other; and that without prejedice to their mutual friendſhip and good underſtanding.</p>
            <p>ART. XXVII. It is further agrreed, that his Majeſty and the United States, or mutual requſition by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively; or by their reſpective miniſters or officers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to make the ſame, will deliver up to juſtice all perſons, who being charged with murder or forgery, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited within the juriſdiction of either, ſhall ſeek an aſylum within any of the countries of the other, provided that this ſhall only be done on ſuch evidence of cirminality as, according to the laws of the place, where the fugative or perſon ſo charged ſhall be found, would juſtify his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and commitment for trial, if the offence had there been committed. The expence of ſuch apprehenſion and delivery ſhall be borne and defrayed by thoſe who make the requiſtion, and receive the fugitive.</p>
            <p>ART. XXVIII. It is agreed, that the firſt ten articles of this treaty ſhall be permanent, and that the ſubſequent article, except the twelfth, ſhall be limited in their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to twelve years, to be computed from the day on which the ratification of this treaty ſhall be exchanged; but ſubject to this condition that whereas the ſaid twelfth article will expire, by the limitation therein contained, at the end of two years from the ſigning the preliminary or other articles of peace, which ſhall terminate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war in which his Majeſty is engaged; it is agreed, that proper meaſures ſhall by concert be taken for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubject of that article into amicable treaty and diſcuſſion, ſo early before the expiration of the ſaid term, as that new arrangements on that head may by that time bo perfected and ready to take place. But if it ſhould unfortunately happen, that his Majeſty and the United States ſhould not be able to agree on ſuch new arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029747_0025_0FE2513FB81A51E8"/>
in that caſe all the articles of this treaty, except the firſt ten, ſhall then coaſe and expire together.</p>
            <p>Laſtly. This treaty, when the ſame ſhall have been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by his Majeſty, and by the Preſident of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and the reſpective ratification mutually exchanged, ſhall be binding and obligatory on his Majeſty and on the ſaid States, and ſhall be by them reſpectively executed and obſerved with punctuality, and the moſt ſincere regard to good faith. And whereas it will be expedient, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the better to facilitate intercourſe and obviate diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that other articles be propoſed and added to this treaty which articles, for want of time and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, cannot now be perfected—it is agreed, that the ſaid parties will, from time to time, readily treat of and concerning ſuch articles, and will ſincerely endeavour ſo to form them, as that they may conduce to mutual convenience, and tend to promote mutual ſatisfaction and friendſhip; and that the ſaid articles, after having been truly ratified, ſhall be added to, and make a part of this treaty. In faith whereof, we, the underſigned Miniſter Plenipotentiary of his majeſty the King of Great-Britain, and the United States of America, have ſigned this preſent Treaty, and have cauſed to be fixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeal of our arms.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I am honored with yours of Auguſt 30. Mine of the 7th of that month aſſured you that meaſures were taken for excluding from all further aſylum in our ports veſſels armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace and for the reſtoration of the prizes the Lovely Laſs, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that ſhould the meaſures for reſtitution fail in their effect, the Preſident considered it as incumbent on the U. S. to make compenſation for the veſſels.</p>
               <p>We are bound by our Treaties with three of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligerent nations, by all the means in our power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend their veſſels and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the ſeas near our ſhores, and to recover and reſtore the ſame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are uſed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with thoſe nations to make compenſation.</p>
               <p>Though we have no ſimilar Treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of the Preſident, that we ſhould uſe towards that nation the ſame rule, which under this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, was to govern us with the other nations; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to extend it to captures made on the high ſeas, and brought into our ports; if done by veſſels which had been armed within them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:029747_0027_0FE251414CDA15B8"/>Having for particular reaſons, forbore to uſe all the means in our power for the reſtitution of the three veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels mentioned in my letter of Auguſt 7th, the Preſident thought it incumbent on the U. S. to make compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them: And though nothing was ſaid in that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of other veſſels taken under like circumſtances and brought in after the fifth of June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the forbearance had taken place it was and is his opinion that compenſation would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually due.</p>
               <p>As to prizes make under the ſame circumſtances, and bro't in after the date of that letter the Preſident deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that all the means in our power ſhould be uſed for their reſtitution. If theſe ſaid, as we ſhould not be bound by our treaties to make compenſation to the other powers in the analogous caſe, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But ſtill if any caſes ſhall ariſe ſubſequent to that date, the circumſtances of which ſhall place them on ſimilar ground with thoſe before it, the Preſident would think compenſation equally incumbant on the United States.</p>
               <p>Inſtructions are given to the governors of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates to uſe all the means in their power for reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prizes of this laſt deſcription found within their ports. Tho' they will of courſe take meaſures to be informed of them, and the general government has given them the aid of the Cuſtom Houſe officers for this purpoſe, yet you will be ſenſible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as ſhall depend on yourſelf, or any perſon under your direction, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the governors may uſe the means in their power for making reſtitution.</p>
               <p>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it. It will always be beſt to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you ſhall be pleaſed to ſend to me alſo at any time, ſhall be forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them quickly as diſtance will permit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:029747_0028_0FE25181B17489A8"/>Hence you will perceive ſir, that the Preſident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates reſtitution or compenſation in the caſes before the ſeventh of Auguſt: and after that date reſtitution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you ſhould ſubſtantiate the fact, that ſuch prizes are in our ports or waters.</p>
               <p>Your liſt of the privateers illicitly armed in our port is, I believe, correct.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to loſſes by detention, waſte, ſpoilation ſuſtained by veſſels taken as before-mentioned between the dates of June 5th and 7th, it is propoſed as a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional meaſure, that the Collector of the cuſtoms of the diſtrict, and the Britiſh Conſul, or any other perſon you pleaſe, ſhall appoint perſons to eſtabliſh the value of the veſſel and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which ſhe is brought, according to their value in that port. If this ſhall be agreeable to you, and you will be pleaſed to ſignify it to me, with the names of the prizes underſtood to be of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſtructions will be given accordingly to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the cuſtoms where the reſpective veſſels are.</p>

               <p>That the Preſident of the United States be informed, that the Senate will not conſent to the ratification of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and his Brittannic Majeſty, concluded at London on the 19th of November, 1794, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>l. Becauſe ſo much of the treaty as was intended to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the complaints, flowing from the inexecution of the treaty of 1783, contains ſtipulations that were not rightfully or juſtly requirable of the United States, and which are both impolitic and injurious to their intereſt: and becauſe the treaty hath not ſecured that ſatisfaction from the British government, for the removal of negroes in violation of the treaty of 1783, to which the citizens of the United States were juſtly entitled.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe the rights of individual States are, by the 9th article of this treaty, unconſtitutionally invaded.</item>
                  <item>3. Becauſe however impolitic or unjuſt it may gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be, to exerciſe the power prohibited by the 10th article, yet it reſts on legiſlative diſcretion, and ought not to be prohibited by treaty.</item>
                  <item>4. Becauſe ſo much of the treaty as relates to commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial arrangements between the parties, wants that reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity, upon which alone ſuch like arrangements ought to be founded, and will operate ruinouſly to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can commerce and navigation.</item>
                  <item>5. Becauſe the treaty prevents the United States from the exerciſe of that controul over their commerce and navigation, as connected with other nations, which might better the condition of their intercourſe with friendly nations.</item>
                  <item>6. Becauſe the treaty aſſerts a power in the Preſident and Senate, to controul and even annihilate the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional right of the congreſs of the United States over their commercial intercourſe with foreign nations.</item>
