            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE diſtreſs and perplexity attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trade of the Province in general, but more eſpecially this Town, in which is carried on ſo much Buſineſs, is now become the common talk of all People: and if ſomething be not done to ſupply the Place with a Medium to paſs from man to man in the way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, in a little time the Trade will be all a Bartar, or exchanging one Commodity for another, and it is eaſy to foreſee the vaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and Miſchiefs ſuch a Trade will be attended with. Men will live by preying upon one another; like the Fiſh in the Sea, the greater will devour the leſs; the whole Trade will get into a few Hands in a ſhort time, and the middling ſort of People who are the chief Support of any Place, will ſoon come (many of 'em) to Poverty, and inſtead of Supporting Church and State, will become a burden to both. It will appear very plain to any who will but look back a few Years, that our Province Bills iſſued out by the Government from time to time, have been very ſervicable to the Trade, &amp; have kept it alive, &amp; ſaved many Families from Ruine; whilſt others by their Induſtry, &amp; by the help of that Medium (how contemptuouſly ſoever they may now talk of it) have arrived to very
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003450_0003_0ff84486f0583498"/>
conſiderable Eſtates, ſuch as never were known in this Country before it was projected. But now His Excellency the GOVERNOUR is forbid to Emit any more Bills except for the bare Support of the Government from year to year, and that to be drawn in again in a very ſhort time by a Tax, that it can be little or no Service to the Trade; and there being no proſpect of our having a Silver Medium to paſs among us, and it being impoſſible for the People to ſubſiſt without ſome ſort of Money, if it were only to purchaſe the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life from day to day; ſurely it is high time for us to contrive ſomething to anſwer the Ends of Money: Several ways have been propoſed to bring in Silver, but all Attempts that way have proved fruitleſs, and thro' the diverſity of Opinions in men, none of thoſe Schemes have yet been put in practice: All Men ſeem to be agreed in the main Point; that ſomething ought to be done ſpeedily, but the way how, is the grand Queſtion before us.</p>
            <p>Well then, if this be the Caſe, none ſurely will blame any Man, who endeavours to ſave his Country from the Ruine which threatens it; for be his Performance never ſo weak, Charity obliges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s to caſt a vail on the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of others, and to put the moſt favourable Conſtructions on their Actions. I am not inſenſible that what I am about to propoſe, will meet with Oppoſition from, and perhaps be Ridiculed by ſome, who
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003450_0004_0ff84488783a5d08"/>
are out of Trade, and ſo don't feel the want of Money ſo much as others: But Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants &amp; Traders who are daily complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Difficulties they meet with to carry on their Affairs, are the Men, who I hope and expect will countenance &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage this Projection, if they think the thing practicable; if not, I ſhall never think the worſe of any man for differing from me in opinion, provided he who diſapproves hereof, do but project ſomething elſe to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the End propoſed. I confeſs, I think we do not act like rational Creatures, to lye down &amp; dye, when the means is in our own hands to ſave our ſelves and our Poſterity from Ruine. And therefore I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to make the following Propoſal, and leave it to the Conſideration of my Friends and Neighbours, being firmly perſwaded, that all Eſſays made to bring in Silver ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer the Ends of a Medium of Exchange, will prove ineffectual; and that we ſhall never have Silver paſs again in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, until by going more into Manufactures among our ſelves, we come to live more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of others; and that muſt be the Work of ſucceeding Generations. I would then propoſe as followeth, Viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Number of Merchants &amp; Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, enter into Copartnerſhip for the Iſſuing out Bills or Notes to circulate in lieu of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as a Medium of Exchange, &amp; oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to give the ſame Credit to the ſaid Bills
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003450_0005_0ff8448a2d1d9750"/>
or Notes, as they now do to the Bills Iſſued out by the Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to gain the ſaid Notes Credit with others, what if the Partners concerned ſhould oblige themſelves not to deal with or buy of any (no more than was abſolutely neceſſary) who will not accept the ſaid Bills or Notes in Payment on equal terms with the Province Bills? This will doubtleſs gain the Bills a Univerſal Credit, and make 'em as Current as the Province Bills in a very ſhort time: For if but One Hundred Men of Trade, and any conſiderable Buſineſs in this Town, ſhould engage in ſuch a manner, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any Man in the Place to carry on his Affairs without being concerned with ſome of thoſe Partners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Medium ſo iſſued out be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved at Intereſt and no otherways. This hath been formerly objected againſt a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bank, that the Bankers will monopolize particular Commodities, and ſo hurt their Neighbours in their Trade; tho' I confeſs I never could ſee any weight in that Argument: but by this Article I think that Objection is anſwered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That no Money or Bills be let out by the Bank but on a ſufficient Security. Now nothing can be ſafer than a Land Security: The Earth endures for ever: all other things are more uncertain, more liable to caſualties and accidents: And indeed had we Gold and Silver among us, which we have not,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003450_0006_0ff8448bb8cbcf68"/>
there would be more danger of their falling in value, than there is of our Lands falling in value: But had we Gold &amp; Silver, there would not be occaſion for a Land Bank, or any other at preſent; but it is the want of ſuch a Medium, obliges us to this Method; and no doubt whoever are the Directors and Managers, will take care the Lands which are put in for Securities are not over-valued.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That for the eaſe &amp; ſafety of Trade, and to prevent Counterfeits, People may keep their Caſh at the Bank, &amp; may have Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the Books, for what they leave there, and ſo may draw Notes on the Bank for whatever is due to them, payable on demand, to whomſoever they are Indebted. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing can be ſo ſhort; eaſy, and ſafe, as this way of Negotiating Payments by the Bank; &amp; this makes all the World fond of them: (for 1.) If a man hath Stock in the Bank, he may Sell and Transfer his Stock to his Creditor, and buy again of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who want to Sell, whenever he is mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be concerned; for this will ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as common as to Buy and Sell any Merchandize. (2.) If a man receive a Note of hand from his Debtor, payable in two or three Months, if his preſent occaſions call for the Money, it is but going to the Bank and Indorſing his Note, and they will let him have the Money, allowing the Diſcount, and when it becomes due, they will ſend the Note to the Drawer and receive it; if he
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003450_0007_0ff8448dd25a22a8"/>
refuſe to pay it, it is carried to the Indorſer, and he pays it; what a mighty advantage and conveniency is here. The Drawer hath paid his Debt to his Creditor, the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of him who received the Note is anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered; the Bank gains the Intereſt of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, &amp; is ſafe, having both the Drawer and Indorſer of the Note for Security, it ſhortens Credit, makes every body eaſy, and who that hath ſuch a Note, would not allow the Intereſt of the Money to have the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; and thus it will be with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to foreign Bills; as ſoon as a man hath got his Bill accepted, if he wants the Money, he will go &amp; leave it Indorſt with the Bank, and take his Money, allowing the Diſcount, and he may have his Money to anſwer his preſent occaſions. (3.) It will be a means to ſhorten Credit, which is a burthen the Trade at preſent groans under, &amp; which will ever attend a Truck Trade: Men are kept out of their Money unreaſonably; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the mouths of every body being, there is no Money ſtirring, and by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they weary out their Creditors, and even oblige them to draw Notes on them to their great diſadvantage; and this puts it in the power, and I wiſh their Debtors do not too often make uſe of ſuch opportunities to opreſs their Neighbours in their payments; but this Method of a Bank will take away that pretence, and it will ſoon appear who trade with their own, and who with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003450_0008_0ff84490927524b8"/>
of others. (4.) By a mans keeping his Caſh at the Bank, he ſaves the Riſque of Fire and Thieves, and yet it is as ready to anſwer his occaſions, as if it were in his own houſe; this is a common Cuſtom in <hi>London,</hi> if a man be going a Journey into the Country but for a fortnight, he will carry his Caſh to the Bank, and take a Receipt for it, accounting it ſafer than in his own Houſe, &amp; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eady to anſwer his occaſions. (5.) If a man be bound a Voyage to Sea, and have Money he don't improve with him, he can't leave it no where ſo ſafe as in the Bank, he may at his Return receive it at a days warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or if he ſend an Order for it from abroad, at will be always ready on demand; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he leave it in the hands of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he may meet with many lets and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances in his way to obtain it, either by the death of the perſon he left it with, or by their having met with Misfortunes, and being thereby rendred uncapable to pay.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That what loſſes may happen by ill people counterfeiting the Bills or Notes, ſhall be made good to the ſufferers out of the Profits; this will make the Bank Bills preferr'd before the Province Bills, for all men ſeek to improve their Eſtates in ſuch ways, which they apprehend leaſt Riſque, &amp; the Riſque men run of receiving Counterfeits I am of opinion, hath been a means of ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the value of our Province Bills: This is a common complaint among even Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003450_0009_0ff84492acbfb428"/>
who are moſt converſant amongſt them, that they know not but great part of them may be Counterfeits, &amp; therefore are deſirous to be rid of them again, as ſoon as they can conveniently, leaſt there ſhould happen a loſs on them; but if there be any inconveniencies attending our Province Bills in this reſpect, how great is it with reſpect to the Bills of other Provinces; our own Bills are ſigned by Gentlemen well known to us, and our Neighbours to whom we can inſtantly apply our ſelves, on the leaſt ſuſpicion of any Bill to know whether they ſigned it or no; but if we receive Counterfeits of the Bills of the other Provinces, the Signers live ſo Remote, that we can't come at them, &amp; this makes our own Bills preferr'd by us before theirs, and were there a ſufficiency of our own to carry on the Trade, I queſtion whether men would receive the others in payment; but the neceſſity of the times is ſuch, that men are glad to catch at any thing that hath but the name of Money, if it will but paſs away again, and ſo anſwer their preſent occaſions in buying, or to pay their Debts; but here the Bank obliging themſelves to make good the Counterfeits, the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Bills will be eaſy, becauſe ſafe on that head, and this will certainly make the Bank Bills eſteemed and valued above the Province Bills. I believe all men will joyn with me in this, That if a Bank of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003450_0010_0ff8449491d5faa0"/>
               <hi>One hunded Thouſand Pounds</hi> be made in this way, the Province is ſo much the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for it: whereas all Bills iſſued out by the Government are a Debt due from 'em, and muſt terminate ſooner or later: and therefore the Province is not one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the richer for them; indeed the Profits ariſing by ſuch a Bank will come to the Founders of the Bank, and ſuch others as in time may come to be concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet I ſay the Province is the Richer, becauſe there is ſo much the more Money in it, and the Province not Indebted any thing for it, neither is any private man hurt who borrows of the Bank, any more than he is by borrowing Money of any private perſon, ſince the Bank Bills anſwer his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in all reſpects as much as the other; and as to the Bankers, if any begrutch 'em the profit, it muſt proceed from Envy, for no man is hurt by it, Trade is eaſed, every man ſerved, and the Province in general, as well as private men ſerved, and gain by it.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but obſerve how tho't<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Indolent we are about our Trade, on the flouriſhing whereof our worldly happineſs ſo much depends: How have our Neighbours at <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> a ſmall Government, a handful of people, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with us, eat us out of it. It is but a few years ſince they were ſupplied from hence with almoſt every thing, but we by burthening Trade with heavy Duties, drove

it away to them &amp; other places; they wiſely ſaw it, and cheriſht their Trade, by making every thing eaſy to the Importer, and continue ſo to do, and now ſupply us with many things they uſed to buy of us; nay, to our ſhame be it ſpoken, we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by them with great, if not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Medium of Exchange now paſſing among us; and they now talk of Emitting a large Sum more, whilſt we ſit idle and unconcern'd, every man's tho'ts being taken up, how he ſhall advance his own private Intereſt, none ſeeking the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of the Community; were we not both dependant Governments, Subjects to one and the ſame Prince, they would ſoon become the Head, and we the Tail, &amp; as they find us Money, would give us Laws alſo. Surely no man can think but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod here propoſed, will be much ſafer &amp; better for us than their Bills, or the Bills of any of the other Governments: That the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills ſhould be accepted by us in payment ſeems ſtrange, when we know that many of 'em are counterfeits, and that no Bills but our own will anſwer for Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties, or in any publick payments; but the neceſſity of the Times is ſuch, that for want of a ſufficient Medium of our own to buy with, theirs are become as currant as ours, &amp; will buy any thing on equal terms with our Province Bills; would any people but we, ſuffer our ſelves to be thus uſed;

what can be more diſhonourable to us, and how eaſy is it for us to put a ſtop to this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; it is but for us to unite among our ſelves, and refuſe to take their Bills, the buſineſs is done at once, &amp; the Bank here propoſed may ſupply its place. And now I am upon this head, let me mention another Evil we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into, which will in the end prove more pernicious to us than any thing that hath ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> befallen us; thoſe People now let out their Money at Intereſt to our Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ple of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, &amp; pay 'em in the Bills of their Province, &amp; take their Bonds to pay again in the Bills of our Province, &amp; an exorbitant Intereſt alſo, and avoid as much as may be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their own Bills in payment for the Goods they ſell us, chuſing as any wiſe men wou'd, to lay up our Province Bills: Who can be ſo blind as not to ſee their drift in this matter; they know that nothing but our Province Bills, will anſwer for the Bonds and Mortgages made to the Government, nor indeed for thoſe made to private perſons, if the Mortgagee will inſiſt on it; &amp; I preſume no body thinks there are near enough of our Province Bills abroad to diſcharge thoſe Bonds and Mortgages: Well then, our only Remedy is, we muſt go to <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> &amp; give thoſe people what advance they are pleaſed to ask, for our Province Bills to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe Occaſions. But ſuppoſe the <hi>Rhode-Iſlanders</hi> ſhould come into a private Bank, as they begin to talk they will, if their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003450_0013_0ff8449bac03cab0"/>
do not ſupply 'em in a publick way, &amp; ſuppoſe that their Bills ſhould gain a currency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as they doubtleſs will in a very little time; for mens neceſſities will bring 'em to take 'em; what then will be the conſequence, in a few years great part of this Government will be Mortgaged to them; which puts me in mind of what I have heard ſome of 'em ſay in a way of deriſion, if you'l find us good Security, you ſhall not want Money; may I not then very properly ſay, we are ſelling our ſelves to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and ſhall ſee our Error, and repent when it is too late to remedy it; it's certain that we by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a currency to their Bills, have made them Rich in a few Years. But ſome will anſwer me, that if we refuſe their Bills, they will do the ſame by our's. To that I anſwer, Did we ſtand in the ſame need of them that they do of us, there would be ſome weight in that Objection; but the Caſe is quite otherwiſe: What would they do with all their Moloſſes, Sugar, Logwood, &amp; other Goods they purchaſe abroad, if it were not for our Market. How many Thouſands of Pounds in Money do they carry from hence to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> every year for theſe Commodities; do they not order their Ships abroad, to come direct to this Port, for want of a Market for them in their own Government: and yet we tamely ſuffer 'em to make Bills, &amp; ſupply the Trading Men therewith, and they pay 'em into the Treaſury, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, Ten per Cent. for Ten Years, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies both for Principal &amp; Intereſt. With this Money they fitted out at leaſt Thirty Sail of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels for Martineco, Surranam, Jamaica, &amp; our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Iſlands, bring their Moloſſes, Sugar, &amp; other Goods from thoſe Places direct hither. Here they fell them for ready Money, &amp; carry it away to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi>; this keeps their Trade going to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003450_0014_0ff8449d35a575a0"/>
the beſt advantage, while for want of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney our Trade languiſhes, &amp; labours under the greateſt difficulties; whereas if we had not given their Bills a Currency, but had made a private Bank among our ſelves, the advantages they have reapt by the Trade abovementioned, would have fallen moſtly into our own Hands. Thus for want of a good harmony &amp; agreement among our ſelves, we have given the Bread out of our own mouths and enrich'd them; who now diſpiſe us for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And indeed, all indefferent Men will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for our ill Conduct in ſuffering our ſelves to be thus bubbled by them. I am well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are now deſigning to Emit <hi>One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pounds</hi> more, with which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to go upon the Cod &amp; Whale Fiſhery, and upon Manufacturing their own Wool; &amp; thoſe who will improve it in theſe ways, it is propoſed ſhall have the Money, giving Security in Lands for what they receive, to pay it into their Treaſury in Twenty Years, viz. Five per Cent. per Annum in Siver at 15 s. per Ounce, and that is to ſatisfy for the Principal &amp; Intereſt; if this will not awaken us out of the Lethargy we ſeem to be fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp; make us beſtir our ſelves, ſurely nothing will.</p>
            <p>But ſome men are of Opinion that we in this Province ſhall refuſe accepting thoſe Bills, &amp; ſo their Project will ſink, as indeed it certainly will if we refuſe to accept them in Payments: But I can't ſee any reaſon why we ſhould refuſe thoſe Bills any more than what they have now out, they will be as good as what they have now paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and that day they make their new Emiſſion, they will certainly be received by us, as freely as the others; the neceſſities of the times will even force men to take 'em; and I can ſee no way to prevent it but by making a Bank among ourſelves. But it is the opinion of many that this will be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003450_0015_0ff844a079957868"/>
by ſome among us who have Bonds &amp; Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, which muſt be redeemed they will ſay with our Province Bills, or in Silver at Seventeen penny weight for <hi>ſix ſhillings,</hi> and they ſee that it will be impoſſible to get our Bills, to anſwer thoſe Occaſions, &amp; conſequently that their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Eſtates will fall into their hands for much leſs than the value of them. But will any man who calls himſelf a Chriſtian be ſo cruel &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to take that advantage, &amp; allowing that there are ſome ſuch People who would take ſuch an advantage of their Neighbours, <hi>which I would charitably ſuppoſe, very few would</hi>; can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the Government will ſuffer ſuch an ill uſe to be made of what was deſigned by them for a common good, in making thoſe Bills, and letting 'em out to the people in order to ſave them from Ruine; No, ſuch men, (if any ſuch there be) will moſt certainly be diſappointed in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, &amp; the Government will contrive ſome way to prevent ſuch a piece of Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Moſt certainly if ſomething be not done, and that without delay, many People will be Ruined, for thoſe who have their Eſtates Mortgaged are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up the Bills of this Province to Redeem them, and indeed the time is ſo near expired in which they are to pay their Money into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, that it highly concerns 'em to prepare for it. And as I hinted before the <hi>Rhode-Iſlanders</hi> are hoarding 'em up, in order to make a Prey of us. Theſe things in a little time will leave us few or none of our own Province Bills abroad. Surely then theſe Conſiderations ſhould unite us, &amp; make us joyn heart &amp; hand in bringing forward this, or contriving ſomething elſe which may extricate us out of our Difficulties.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude without ſaying this word, if ſomething be not done, what will become of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003450_0016_0ff844a298f37b50"/>
the Riſing Generation? how is it poſſible that they entring upon the Stage of Action, unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſhould carry on a truck Trade, unleſs they have very large Stocks to begin with, which very few have, (for what have the beſt men in the place to boaſt of that was left 'em by their Fathers: Their Eſtates were ſmall to what their Children have attained to, and every man of any conſiderable Intereſt among us, his Eſtate hath been got by himſelf or Father ſince the Paper Medium was projected;) and again, every Young man hath not a head turned to manage a truck Trade; It requires a plodding head, application, diligence, and induſtry, &amp; great caution &amp; circumſpection, that they are not over-reacht by the Crafty; he that hath his Money or Bills to buy with, hath a far better chance by going &amp; trying the Market every where; whereas he that deals but in a few Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, is obliged to buy of them, &amp; them only, who want the Commodities he deals in; and in ſuch a caſe the Seller always hath the advantage of the man who comes to buy of him, and it is very much in his power to ſet the price of his Chap-mans Goods as well as his own; ſurely this Conſideration ought to have its weight with us, for we are but Stewards for our Children, &amp; muſt in a little time go off the Stage, &amp; it is our duty as far as we are able, to leave things ſo circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that they may be able to improve what by the bleſſing of Heaven we leave them.</p>
            <p>If what I have offered may be of Service, or if others are led into more juſt &amp; proper tho'ts, I ſhall be very glad, for I would not be tho't fond of my own notions, but am very deſirous to ſee ſomething put on foot, which may give us a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of things coming to Rights again in the days of our Children, for I ſee little proſpect of it in our days.</p>
