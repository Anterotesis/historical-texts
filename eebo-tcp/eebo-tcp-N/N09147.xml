            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PERMIT me to lay at the foot of Your Throne this volume, which is an attempt to tranſlate from Your Native Language, a work deſervedly admired. I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is but a faint repreſentation of the glowing beauties of the excellent original; yet I flatter myſelf I have, in ſome meaſure, preſerved the ideas, eſpecially thoſe which fill and warm the heart with the love of Virtue. On this account, and on this only, I preſume to hope for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's favourable acceptance of the work.</p>
            <p>Placed, by the hand of Providence, at an humble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Great, my cares and pleaſures are concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered within the narrow limits of my little family, and it is in order to contribute to the ſupport and education of my children, I have taken up the pen.

If I have attempted a taſk for which nature never deſigned me, it is juſt that diſappointment ſhould teach me humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wiſdom, and I bow without repining to the ſtroke.</p>
            <p>Confined as my ſituation is, I ſhared in the univerſal joy viſible in every countenance on your Majeſty's ſafe arrival. This general ſatisfaction was a moſt auſpicious omen in the beginning of your happy reign.

            <head>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I NOW venture on a more ſublime ſubject than has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to employed my pen, from a deſire of knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my abilities will bear a farther trial. This is a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which ought to influence every man. The public are too apt to diſcourage a young poet who has ſucceeded in one branch of poetry, and are for confining him to that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in which he has been once ſucceſsful, as his <hi>ne plus ultra;</hi> as if that alone was the very thing in which he could ſhow the whole ſtrength of his genius, when, perhaps, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal circumſtance, or a mere accident, rather than any particular impulſe, determined his choice.</p>
            <p>Though a poet who attempts the ſublimer parts of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry were not entitled to regard from the public, he would find himſelf amply rewarded in the happy execution of his voluntary taſk. To revolve a vaſt variety of things, to trace the motives of actions to their original ſource, to draw characters, and through intricate occurrences gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to open intereſting events, is attended with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pleaſures Nature is to him an inexhauſtible maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, whence true genius collects every material that can ornament or embelliſh his favourite object: then is the whole mind in action, and talents are awakened which would very probably have otherwiſe lain dormant and unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011667_0005_0F87CC9835FE6B10"/>
But it will be ſaid, At this rate, we ſhall have nothing to read but epic poems and tragedies. They who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſuch a misfortune ſhould know, that when I ſay ſuch compoſitions will give greater and more various pleaſures than little pieces to the poet, I mean, it will alſo be the ſame with the reader. However, few have leiſure or inclination for large performances: moſt men are taken up with occupations of a different nature, many will chuſe to pay their addreſſes to a leſs coy miſtreſs than the epic muſe; and I dare prophecy, we ſhall never be without maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pieces in every branch of poetry. Far be it from me to depreciate the light and ſportive works of fancy: for though I wiſh for more Homers, I yet think Aeſop and Anacreon cannot be too much admired.</p>
            <p>Some will be aſtoniſhed, and others offended, that I have taken for my ſubject a Scripture hiſtory. The latter, I will ſuppoſe, are ſomewhat advanced in years, and have, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immerſed in buſineſs, and the arduous taſk of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich, been prevented from looking into new books: theſe have a zeal for the honor of their religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the prejudices they imbibed in their youth againſt poetry, having drawn their knowledge of that divine art from ſpecimens, which, a very few excepted, were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthy to be known or valued. A poet, in the times of their youth, was eſteemed, even by ſenſible Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, only as a droll fellow, a kind of buſſoon. But to thoſe who have peruſed the Bible with ſo little ſenſe of its beauties, as to make a ſin of this undertaking, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay. They muſt be void of taſte; and to reaſon with them would be as ridiculous as to carry a lantern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blind. It is to thoſe who are capable of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would now addreſs myſelf. I would wiſh theſe to obſerve, that the works which made poets be conſidered in a contemptible light, were wrote in an age when poetry was in its wretched declenſion, and far from its original and genuine dignity. It has always been in the retinue of religion, and is of no ſmall ſervice to it, being the moſt energic method of conveying of virtue and devotion. It affords a noble delight to the underſtanding, it improves the heart, and excites to whatever is becoming and praiſe-worthy. But to anſwer theſe ſalutary purpoſes, even when it relaxes
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011667_0006_0F87CC98E9D526F8"/>and ſports, its wit muſt be decent and pure, and have a tendency to create a contempt for ribaldry and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Poetry of the looſe kind I deſpiſe and deteſt from my very ſoul.</p>
            <p>Under the conduct of prudence, virtue and good manners, poetry may be allowed to take its ſubject from the great truths of our holy religion. What can be more proper for the exerciſe of genius than the ſacred hiſtory? As Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians we aſſent to its truths; as Chriſtians we are all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in its important events. The poet if he has the happy art of illuſtrating the characters he draws from divine hiſtory, with what is probable and pleaſing, and placing them in an inſtructive view, will have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conveying in the cleareſt, and moſt ſtriking manner, the ſalutary influences of religion and piety into the hearts of all claſſes of men, and will be read with pleaſure by people in every ſituation. If this be attempted by a head unequal to the taſk, ſuch compoſitions, I allow, may do more harm than good: but is not this equally the caſe, with all injudicious expoſitions?</p>
            <p>This liberty with the ſacred hiſtory has been uſed in all nations; and among us, even at the time of the reformation, none took umbrage at the dramatic pieces taken from the ſcriptures: theſe were publicly allowed, though their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal merit was the good intention of their authors, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry being far from elegant.</p>
            <p>But a new objector ſtarts up, and cries, at this rate the bible will become a mere ſable. I would aſk him, if this has been the fate of profane hiſtory? Homer and Virgil took the ſubject of their poems from ancient hiſtory; but who ever thought of adjuſting thoſe hiſtories by their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems? or who ever in reading their works, imagined them to be hiſtorians, or conſidered them in any other light than as poets?</p>
            <p>There is yet another numerous claſs of people to whom I muſt pay my court: theſe are they who are too exceſſively polite to reliſh heroes who have a ſenſe of piety, who talk of religion, who are ſerious, and affect neither raillery nor wit. Characters drawn from thoſe exhibited in the days of thinking, muſt make a ſtrange appearance to theſe ſons of faſhion. Such manners! ſuch converſation! to them my
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:011667_0007_0F87CC99A91AA0F8"/>heroes will appear as odd creatures, as thoſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>omer did to the French, who were offended that they were not Frenchmen. To theſe ſlaves of mode I would whiſper it as a ſecret, that being myſelf young, and, like them fond of applauſe, I will, in order to obtain their ſuffrages, which are of mighty importance to my happineſs, give this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a new dreſs. I will introduce an amorous intrigue, for what is an epic poem without a love adventure? Abel ſhall be a languiſhing petit maitre; Cain, a rough captain of the Coſſacks, and nothing ſhall come from the lips of Adam, that is not in character from an hoary Frenchman, hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney'd in the ways of the world.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE work from which this is attempted, is wrote by Mr. Geſſner, of Zurich, in Swiſſerland. The rapidity of the ſale does honour to the taſte of the Swiſs and the Germans, it having paſſed through three editions in one year.</p>
            <p>The ſubject is the death of Abel, which is the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable event recorded in ſacred hiſtory, from the fall to the deluge. The poet has had the art to augment our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the diſtreſſes of our primaeval parents, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate defendants, by the lively and affecting manner in which he manages the paſſions, and by the graces and truth he throws into his paintings, while he deſcribes the ſimple manners of the firſt inhabitants of the earth.</p>
            <p>All our author's works, of which this is the firſt that has been tranſlated into Engliſh, are wrote in a kind of looſe poetry, unſhackled by the tagging of rhimes, or counting of ſyllables. This method of writing ſeems perfectly ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the German language, and is of a middle ſpecies between verſe and proſe: it has the beauties of the firſt, with the eaſe of the laſt. It is not however peculiar to Mr. Geſſner; for in this manner the great Fenelon wrote his Telemachus, of which the public will ſoon be favoured with an elegant tranſlation by the able hand of Dr. Hawkeſworth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:011667_0009_0F87CC9E689CB2B0"/>
Of this attempt I am not qualified to ſpeak; were I to decry it, I ſhould be deemed guilty of affectation; if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, I ſhould be certainly arrogant and rude in offering it to the public, and to praiſe it would be preſumption. But I will venture to ſay, that I flatter myſelf my picture has eſcaped any glaring deformity, though it may want many of the almoſt inimitable graces of the charming original. That painter muſt indeed be a dauber who could make a diſagreeable picture, while he attempted to copy a Raphael or a Titian. Such as it is I leave it to the candor of the reader, believing, that notwithſtanding the loud cry of univerſal depravity, no one will, without juſt cauſe, and in mere wantonneſs of cruelty, condemn the aſſiduous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of a female pen.</p>

               <p>The tranquil hours had juſt given to Aurora the tint of the roſe, and diſpell'd the vapours of night that had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over the ſhadowy earth, while the ſun beginning to dart his firſt rays behind the black cedars of the mountain, ting'd with radiant purple the half-enlighten'd clouds; when Abel and his beloved Thirza left their leafy couch, and repair'd to a neighbouring bower compoſed of interwoven jeſſamine and roſes. The tendereſt love and the pureſt virtue ſhone with mildeſt beams in the fine blue eyes of Thirza, and gave attractive graces to the carnation of her cheeks: while her fair locks waving in ringlets on her ſnowy neck, and hanging with a becoming negligence down her back, added to the beauty of her fine and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate form. Thus ſhe walked by the ſide of Abel, whoſe high forehead was ſhaded with ringlets of the paleſt brown, reaching no lower than his ſhoulders. An air of thought and reflection was agreeably mix'd with the ſweet ſerenity of his looks, and he mov'd with the eaſy grace of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, who charged with the gracious beheſts of the Moſt High, becomes viſible to the raptur'd ſaint in an human form; but the veil be aſſumes is of ſuch raviſhing beauty, that through it ſhines the angel. Thirza, with a look of affection, and a tender ſmile, cry'd, O my love now the birds awake, and begin to chant their morning ſong, let me hear the hymn thou yeſterday ſung in theſe ſmiling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and let me join alſo in the rapturous employment of praiſing the Lord. The melody of thy lips inſpires my heart
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011667_0012_0F87CCA134BC3A98"/>with an holy tranſport, and nothing can charm me more than to hear thee utter in proper terms the ſenſations I feel, but am unable to expreſs. Abel tenderly embracing her, reply'd, My lovely Thirza, thy requeſt ſhall be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately granted. I no ſooner read thy wiſhes in thine eyes, than with a lover's haſte, I ſtrive to fulfil them. They then ſeated themſelves in the fragrant bower, whoſe entrance was gilded by the morning ſun, and Abel thus began:</p>
               <p>Retire, O ſleep, from every eye. Fly ye hovering dreams: reaſon again reſumes her throne; again ſhe illumines the mind, as the morning ſun enlightens the fertile earth. We hail thee, reſplendent ſun, who darteſt thy beams from behind the cedars; thy friendly rays give light and colour to re-animated nature, and every beauty ſmiles with new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born graces.</p>
               <p>Retire, O ſleep, from every eye. Fly ye hovering dreams to the ſhades of night. Where are now the ſhades of night? They have fled to the caves of the rocks; they wait us in the thick grove; we ſhall find them there, and be refreſh'd by their coolneſs during the ſultry heat of noon. See where the new-born day firſt wakes the eagle; where, on the glittering ſummits of the rocks and the ſhining ſides of the mountains, the exhalations aſcend and mix with the pure air of the morning, as the ſmoke of burnt offerings ariſe from the altar. Thus nature cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates the returning light, and pays to nature's God the ſacrifice of grateful praiſe. Praiſe him all things that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt; praiſe him whoſe wiſdom and goodneſs produc'd and preſerves all. Ye ſpringing flowers exhale the ſweets he gave you in his praiſe. Ye wing'd inhabitants of the grove, pour forth the warbling of your little throats to his praiſe, who gave you voice and melody; while the majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic lion pays him honor with the terrors of his mouth, and makes the caverns of the rocks re-echo his praiſe. Praiſe God, O my ſoul! praiſe God, the Creator and Preſerver. Let the voice of man reach thy throne, O Lord, before that of thy other creatures: in the grey twilight, at the dawn of the morning, while the birds and beaſts yet ſleep, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011667_0013_0F87CCA1D8A02748"/>goodneſs are ſtamp'd on all. Wherever I turn my eyes, I perceive the traces of Thy bounty; each ſenſe is tranſported and conveys their infinite beauties to my raviſh'd mind. O God! weak and frail as I am, fain would I attempt thy praiſe. What induc'd Thee, Maker Omnipotent! for ever happy in Thyſelf, to call from nothing this gay creation! what induc'd Thee, Thou Self exiſtent, to form man out of the duſt, and to give him the breath of life? It was Thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs. Thou gaveſt him being that Thou mighteſt confer on him happineſs. O ſmiling Morn! in thee I ſee a lively image of the work of the great Creator, when the ſun diſperſes the vapours of the earth, and drives night before his ſteps, all nature revives with renewed luſtre. The Almighty ſpoke! Silence and night heard his voice: he commanded, and miriads of living creatures emerg'd from the teeming earth, flutter'd in the air with variegated plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and render'd the aſtoniſh'd woods vocal with the praiſes of the beneficent Creator. Earth again hears the voice of her Almighty Maker: the heaving clods riſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſhapes and burſt into life and motion. The new form'd horſe bounds o'er the verdant turf, and neighing ſhakes his main, while the ſtrong lion, impatient to free himſelf from the cumbrous earth, attempts his firſt roaring. A hill, teeming with life, appears in motion; it burſts, it ſinks, and from it ſtalks the huge unweildy elephant.— Theſe are thy works, O thou Omnipotent! Each morn thou calleſt thy creatures from ſleep, the image of non-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; they awake ſurrounded by thy bounties, and join unanimous to chant thy praiſe. The time will come when thy praiſe ſhall reſound from every corner of the peopled earth; when thine altars ſhall blaze on every hill, and man ſhall celebrate thy wonderous works from the riſing to the ſetting day.</p>
               <p>Thus ſang Abel, ſeated by his beloved Thirza. He ceas'd; yet ſhe, fill'd with a divine tranſport, ſeem'd ſtill to hear. At length, encircling him in her ſnowy arms, while her eyes beam'd tenderneſs, ſhe cried, O my love! the muſic of thy lips raiſes my mind to God. Thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing care not only protects my feebler body; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy direction my ſoul itſelf takes her flight: thou art her guide amidſt obſcurity of doubt and darkneſs,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011667_0014_0F87CCA2A231D478"/>thy wiſdom diſſipates the clouds, and turns her aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into devout extaſy. How often have I, inſpir'd by gratitude, render'd thanks to God Moſt High for having created me for thee, and thee for me. O my love! una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in every wiſh we were form'd to bleſs each other.</p>
               <p>While ſhe ſpoke, conjugal tenderneſs diffus'd inexpreſſible graces on every word and every geſture. Abel remain'd ſilent; but his ſoften'd look while he ſnatch'd her to his boſom, and the tear juſt ſtarting from his gliſtening eye, ſpoke unutterable love. Thus happy was man, thus pure his delights. The fruitful earth refreſh'd and fitted him for action by her bounties. Contented with neceſſaries, he aſks of Heaven only Virtue and Health. Luxury and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content had not yet fill'd him with inſatiable deſires, which, inventive of numberleſs wants, bury happineſs under a load of ſplendid miſeries. An union of heart then form'd the nuptial tye. No fear of waſting penury, or the frown of a tyrannic parent; no low ambition, no want of lands or gold, then kept the ſoft maid from the fond boſom of the youth ſhe lov'd. Theſe cares are thy gifts, O Luxury!</p>
               <p>Abel and Thirza were ſtill ſeated, when Adam and Eve enter'd the bower. They had liſten'd with delight to the ſong of Abel, and had heard Thirza vent the effuſions of her fondneſs. They now tenderly embraced their children, while their hearts expanded with parental affection, and a lively joy glow'd on their cheeks.</p>
               <p>Mahala, Cain's ſpouſe, had follow'd the footſteps of her mother, and had been witneſs to the happineſs of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter. Her pure mind was free from envy, bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſion! yet dejection ſat on her countenance, a mild languor appear'd in her eyes, ſorrow had faded the bloom once ſeen on her now palid cheek. She had heard Thirza expreſs her gratitude to Heaven, for having been created for Abel, and he for her. Their mutual tenderneſs forc'd tears from her eyes, and ſighs from her pain'd boſom, while ſad remembrance drew the compariſon between the two huſbands. But ſoon ſhe wip'd away the pourly drops, and with a graceful ſmile enter'd the bower, where with cordial affection ſhe ſaluted her brother and ſiſter.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time Cain paſſing by the fragrant ſhade, had heard Abel's melodious voice, and had beheld his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011667_0015_0F87CCA398EB41D8"/>father tenderly embrace him. At this ſight Envy fix'd her envenom'd ſting in his heart, and he, giving a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious look at the bower, cry'd, What ſigns of joy are here! What fond careſſes! I too might ſing were my days, like his, ſpent in idly reclining in the ſhade, while the flocks were ſporting or cropping the green herbage: but I am not made for ſinging. Rugged labour is my inheritance: tho' I turn the glebe; tho' I break the ſtubborn earth, curſt for my father's ſin with barrenneſs, yet my fatigues meet with no ſuch fond rewards: did my ſoft brother but toil, like me, one day beneath the ſcorching ſun, 'twould ſpoil his muſic; he'd trill no ſongs.—What, more embraces! how I hate this effeminate dalliance; but if that fair youth be pleaſed, no matter what I hate.</p>
               <p>Cain then with haſty ſtep walk'd on. He had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and his diſcontent had fill'd the happy family in the bower with deep concern. Mahala became ſtill more pale, and diſſolving in tears ſunk down by the ſide of Thirza; while Eve, reclining on her huſband, lamented the obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of her firſt-born. O, my much lov'd parents, cried Abel, I will follow my unhappy brother. I will embrace him, and ſay whatever fraternal love can dictate, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his affection. I'll try every art of perſuaſion to make him forget his anger. I will not leave him till he promiſes to love me. I have ſearch'd into the very bottom of my ſoul, to know by what means I may regain him, and find a way to his heart. Sometimes I have rekindled his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd love; but alas! too ſoon the gloom returns, and ſullen ſadneſs damps the ſacred flame.</p>
               <p>With troubl'd look Adam anſwer'd, I myſelf, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Abel, will go to your brother. Reaſon and paternal love ſhall unite their force to combat his obduracy; he will not, ſurely, reſiſt the authority and tenderneſs of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted father. O Cain, Cain, with what torturing cares doſt thou fill my heart! The tumult of tyrannic paſſions has chac'd from thy ſoul every ſentiment of benevolence and virtue. O ſin! fatal ſin! terrible is the deſolation thou ſpreadeſt in the human breaſt. What gloomy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages torture my ſad boſom, when I look through fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and behold thy ravages among my unhappy off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. Thus ſpoke the father of mankind. Grief ſat
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011667_0016_0F87CCA4188E54C8"/>heavy on his venerable brow. He left the bower, and, with haſty ſtep, ſought his firſt born. Cain beheld him coming, and, ceaſing from his labour, thus began: What means this ſternneſs in my father's look? It was with no ſuch air of ſeverity thou cam'ſt to embrace my brother.— Why do thine eyes reproach me?</p>
               <p>Thou would'ſt not, my ſon, have read reproach in mine eyes, return'd Adam, wert thou not conſcious thou deſerv'ſt it. Yes, Cain, thou deſerveſt reproach, and thy offended father is come to thee in all the bitterneſs of grief.</p>
               <p>Without any love, interrupted Cain; that ſenſation is reſerv'd for Abel.</p>
               <p>With love alſo, reſum'd Adam, Heaven is my witneſs. I love thee with a father's fondneſs. Theſe tears, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes and anxious cares that agitate me, and no leſs her who brought thee forth with pain, have their ſource in the moſt affectionate love. 'Tis this tender love and concern for thy happineſs, that caſts a gloom over our days. 'Tis this love that cauſes the ſilence of the night to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by our ſighs and lamentations. O Cain, Cain! didſt thou love us, it would be thy moſt earneſt care to dry up our tears, and to diſpel that cloud of grief which darkens our days and fills them with horror. Ah! if thou ſtill retaineſt in thy breaſt any reſpect for the Omniſcient Creator, to whom the inmoſt receſſes of thine heart are open: if the leaſt ſpark of filial love to us, thy parents, ſtill remains in thine obdurate ſoul, I conjure thee by that reſpect, and that love, to reſtore us to our loſt peace.—Reſtore, O my ſon, our extinguiſh'd joy. Nouriſh no longer againſt thy brother, who loves thee with a ſincere affection, this ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hatred. He longs to embrace thee. Gladly would he clear thy mind from the tares of diſcontent with which it is over-run. O Cain! thou wert my firſt-born, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my ſtrength. When thine infant eyes open'd to the light, I beheld thee with all the father in my heart. Wherefore then is thy ſoul diſquieted? why does Envy dwell in thy boſom, becauſe I rejoice too in thy brother? His refin'd and exalted piety drew from us tears of joy, and we in the ſweet tranſport careſs'd him. The angels who ſurround us, applaud every good action; the Almighty himſelf looks down from heaven's high arch, and regards
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011667_0017_0F87CCA7D3B29270"/>with complacency the grateful offerings of a thankful heart. Wouldſt thou change the invariable nature of beauty and goodneſs? This is not in our power, and if it were, Cain, how muſt we be deprav'd before we could wiſh to withſtand the noble joy, the tender, the exquiſite feelings, that high rais'd devotion and exalted virtue create in the enraptur'd ſoul. Darkneſs, ſtorms, and the thunders of heaven call forth no gentle ſmile on the human countenance; as little do the agitation of boiſterous paſſions cauſe joy to ſpring up in the human heart.</p>
               <p>Cain ſternly anſwer'd: Is reproach then all that I am to hear from a father's lips? If my face does not always wear a pleaſing ſmile; if tears of tenderneſs do not follow each other down my cheek, am I for this to be branded with deteſtable vices? Born with more firmneſs, bold enterprizes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere toils have ever been my choice. Nature has ſtamp'd on my forehead a manly gravity. I cannot weep or ſmile at every trifle. Does the towering eagle coo like the timerous dove?</p>
               <p>Adam, with majeſtic gravity, return'd: Thou deceiveſt thyſelf; thou harboureſt in thy boſom horrid ſentiments, that will rankle in thine heart, and render thee wretched if they are not ſtifled. O Cain! it is not manly gravity that is ſtamp'd on thy brow; it is envy, ſorrow, and gloomy diſcontent. Theſe are ſeen in thine eyes; the diſturbance of thy mind is viſible in thy whole deportment. Thine inward dejection, O my ſon! has ſpread a denſe cloud over all thy proſpects. Hence ariſe thy continual mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs, thy peeviſhneſs and paſſion during the labours of the day. Hence thy unſocial averſion to us: hence the black melancholy to which thou art a prey. Tell, oh tell thine affectionate father, what will give thee eaſe. It is his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſh that thy days may paſs ſerene as the vernal morn. What cauſe haſt thou, O Cain! to be diſquieted? are not all the ſprings of happineſs open to thee? Indulgent nature offers to thee all her beauties. The good, the uſeful, the agreeable, are they not thine as well as ours? Why then do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> thou leave the bleſſings of Heaven untaſted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt of wretchedneſs? Is it becauſe thou art diſſatisfy'd with the portion of happineſs the divine bounty has been pleaſed to beſtow on fallen man? Is not every bleſſing the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011667_0018_0F87CCA7E203EA90"/>undeſerved gift of infinite goodneſs? Doſt thou envy the lot of angels? Know that the angels were ſuſceptible of diſcontent, and by aſpiring to become gods, forfeited hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Wouldſt thou arraign the diſpenſations of the Moſt High towards his ſinful creatures? While the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in univerſal concert praiſe the Creator, ſhall guilty man, a worm, ſprung from the mud, dare to lift up the head, and carp at him whoſe infinite wiſdom regulates the wide expanſe of heaven; to whom all futurity is preſent; and who, by His unerring providence, can cauſe evil to be productive of good. Be chearful, O my ſon; caſt far from thee this ſadneſs and diſcontent: let it no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb thy thoughts; no longer throw a frightful gloom over the natural ſerenity of thy countenance. Open thy heart to every ſocial affection, and look with a grateful complacency on all innocent pleaſures which nature diſplays before thee.</p>
               <p>What need of all theſe exhortations? cried Cain. Do I not know, that was my heart at eaſe, every thing around me would give me delight? but can I ſilence the ſtorm, or bid the impetuous torrent flow in a placid ſtream? I am born of woman, and from my nativity ſentenc'd to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. On my unhappy head the Almighty has pour'd forth the cup of malediction. It is not for me nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays her beauties, nor do the ſtreams of bliſs, of which you take ſuch plentiful draughts, flow for me.</p>
               <p>Alas! my ſon, ſaid Adam, with a voice render'd almoſt inarticulate by his ſtrong emotions and his tears; 'tis but too true, that the Divine malediction was pronounc'd on all born of woman, but why, Oh why ſhouldſt thou believe that God has pour'd on thee, our firſt-born, more of his wrath, than on us the firſt tranſgreſſors? No, this is not, this cannot be the caſe: ſovereign goodneſs contradicts it. No, my dear ſon, thou wert not born for miſery; the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Creator never call'd any of his creatures into being to render them unhappy. Man may, indeed, by his own folly make himſelf wretched. If he ſuffers his reaſon to yield to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous paſſions, ignorant of true felicity, he may render his life a burthen, and convert what is naturally good and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary into a deſtructive poiſon.

There was a time, my dear ſon, when I have ſeen even thee ſhed tears: when from the gratulations of conſcience, joy has ſpread itſelf through all thy powers; delightful fruit of virtuous actions! I refer it to thyſelf, Cain, wert thou not then happy? was not thy ſoul like the clear azure of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, unclouded, unſpotted? Recover that beam of the Deity, reaſon: let her clear light direct thy ſteps, and virtue, her inſeparable companion, will reſtore joy and permanent felicity to thy purify'd heart. Liſten, O Cain! and comply with the advice of thy father. The firſt injunction that reaſon lays on thee is, to embrace thy brother. With what joy will he receive thy endearments! with what tenderneſs will he return them!</p>
               <p>Father, replied Cain, when at the heat of noon I reſt from my labour, I will embrace him. I cannot now leave the field. I promiſe I will obey thee and embrace my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but—while I breathe, my firm ſoul will never be diſſolv'd to that effeminate weakneſs, that ſo endears him to you, and makes your eyes run over with tranſport. To a ſoftneſs like this we all owe the curſe denounc'd againſt us, when in paradiſe you weakly ſuffer'd yourſelf to be overcome by a woman's tears.—But what do I ſay? dare I reproach my father? No, my venerable parent, I reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thee, and am ſilent. Thus ſpake Cain, and return'd to his labour.</p>
               <p>Adam remain'd motionleſs with his hands and eyes rais'd to heaven. At length in a tone of deep diſtreſs, he cry'd, O Cain! Cain I have deſerv'd theſe cutting reproaches: but ſhouldſt thou not have ſpar'd thy father? Shouldſt thou not have forborne this cruel charge; which, like a clap of thunder, ſhakes my tortur'd ſoul?

How could I reproach ſo good, ſo tender a parent? How have I loaded him with grief! I ſtill hear his groans.—I ſee him lift up his ſupplicating hands to heaven.—Perhaps, vile as I am, he prays even for me; for me who have torn his heart with keen diſtreſs! Oh that I too could pray! but I am a monſter,—hell is in my boſom, and like a ravaging whirlwind, I deſtroy the peace of all around me. Return, O Reaſon return! Return, O Virtue! chace from my troubled ſoul theſe wild and darkening paſſions.—Still— ſtill he prays. O how his emotions reproach me!—His claſp'd hands are again rais'd in agony.—He ſeems ſpent.— I will at his feet implore his pardon.—O my raſh tongue —my rebellious heart!</p>
               <p>Cain then ran towards Adam, who was leaning againſt a tree, with his weeping eyes fix'd on the ground.

               <p>Adam leaning on Cain, walk'd towards the paſtures. Abel with his mother and ſiſters met them in the grove: they had followed Adam at a diſtance; they had ſeen his emotions, and with delight had beheld the repentance and tears of Cain. Abel, the moment he ſaw his brother, flew to him with open arms: he claſp'd them around him with a ſtrenuous graſp, unable for ſome time to give vent, but from his eyes, to the ſweet effuſions of his heart. At length he cried, O my brother — my dear brother! thou then lov'ſt me!—lov'ſt me with fondneſs! let me hear thy lips pronounce that thou ſtill loveſt me, and my happineſs will be complete. Yes, my brother, anſwer'd Cain, while he preſs'd him with a warm embrace, I do, indeed, ſincerely love thee. May I hope thou wilt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my having ſo long embitter'd thy days by my unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the fury of my boiſterous paſſions. I too, my brother, was unhappy; but reaſon, like the rapid flaſh of heaven, broke through the gloom, and has diſpers'd the baleful tempeſt. Never, Abel, never may'ſt thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my former darkneſs.</p>
               <p>The delighted Abel, with encreas'd rapture reply'd, Never my dear Cain. Be the paſt utterly forgotten: who would dwell on the diſtreſsful illuſions of a morning dream, when they might, like me, awake to real happineſs, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by multiply'd delights. O my dear brother! words have not power to expreſs my tranſports—to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſweet joy with which my ſoul is fill'd, while I thus preſs thee, my brother! my friend! to my throbbing heart.</p>

We'll ſtrip the bending branches of their luſcious load to form the rich repaſt.

The recollection of a good action diffuſes a pleaſing ſerenity through the ſoul. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing my ſons, nothing but the practice of virtue can render us truly happy. Virtue makes us capable of the enjoyments of thoſe pure ſpirits who ſurround the throne of God. While we follow the dictates of reaſon, while we enjoy with gratitude and love the bleſſings of nature, and have humble hope and confidence in God our Maker, we anticipate the delights of heaven; but if we ſuffer our paſſions to degrade and ſubdue us, inquietude, diſtreſs, and miſery will darken our proſpects: in vain will the heavens ſmile, in vain will the fruitful earth pour forth her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Believe me, my dear children! believe a father made wiſe by his own fatal experience, the joys of ſin are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſhame, ſorrow, and bitter repentance. O Eve, continu'd Adam, once the dear partner of my diſtreſs, as now of my happineſs, could we have thought, when with ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes, and hearts torn with anguiſh, we took leave of paradiſe, that ſo much felicity was to be found on earth. Never will the horrors of that dreadful hour be effac'd from my mind. My father, return'd Abel, if the recital of paſt griefs will not be diſpleaſing, if the recollection will not throw a gloom on this hour of reconcilement and joy, gladly would I hear from thee the events of thy life, from that fatal moment to the preſent time.</p>

My tears, return'd our general mother, are now thoſe of devout thankfulneſs and humbre love, not the bitter ones of ſhame, ſorrow and ſad regret.

               <p>The angel of the Lord, on whoſe countenance ſhone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and ſoft compaſſion, was commiſſion'd to drive us out of paradiſe. He ſooth'd us with gentle words, cheer'd us with promiſes, and bid us hope and put our truſt in the clemency of our All-merciful creator: but the ſword, in his hand flam'd terrible.

               <p>We advanc'd, my children, thro' the grove, and found in the rock a cavity that form'd a grotto. See, deareſt Eve, ſaid I, ſee the convenience offer'd us by nature: this grotto will afford us ſhelter, and this pure ſpring that murmuring flows from its ſide, will ſlake our thirſt. We'll here prepare our lodging: but, my deareſt wiſe, before we ſleep I muſt ſecure the entrance, to keep us from being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by nocturnal enemies: What enemies? return'd Eve, with emotion: What enemies have we to fear? Haſt thou not remark'd, my love, ſaid I, that the curſe of our ſin has fallen on the whole creation: the bands of friendſhip are broken between the animals, and the weak are now become the prey of the ſtrong. I have ſeen a young lion purſue with fatal rage a frighted roe. I have beheld a war in the air among the birds. We can no longer claim a right to command the animals: the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted leopard, the brindled lion and fierce tyger no more fawn on us, nor play their wanton gambols in our ſight; but caſt againſt us frightful roarings, while their blazing eyes threaten deſtruction. We will try to gain by our kindneſs thoſe among the beaſts that are moſt tractable, and Providence has given us reaſon which will teach us to ſecure ourſelves from the moſt ſavage.</p>
               <p>Eve, with timid looks, keeping me in her ſight, went to gather flowers and leaves to form our bed, and fruit for our repaſt. In the mean time I ſecur'd the entrance of the grotto with entwin'd brambles. My ſpouſe, haſten'd by fear, quickly perform'd her taſk, and returning, reſted herſelf before me on the tender graſs.</p>
               <p>We ſoon after enter'd the grotto, and ſeating ourſelves on our bed of intermingled leaves and flowers, began our frugal meal; ſeaſon'd, however, with mutual endearments, and grateful converſe; when a gloomy cloud ſuddenly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd the declining ſun. It ſpread over our heads with encreaſing darkneſs, and the black veil which cover'd the earth ſeem'd to preſage the deſtruction of all nature. A tempeſtuous wind aroſe: it bellow'd in the mountains: it overthrew the trees of the foreſt. Flames darted from the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011667_0027_0F87CABE194D5B20"/>clouds, and loud burſts of thunder augmented the horrors of this tremendous ſcene. Eve ſtruck with terror, threw herſelf, ſcarce breathing, into my arms, and clinging to my breaſt, cry'd, He comes!—he comes! in flames he comes to bring the threaten'd death!—How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!—For my ſin he comes to give death to us and to all nature!—O Adam!—O my love!—Here her voice fail'd, and ſhe remain'd trembling and pale on my boſom. Be calm, my love! I cry'd: compoſe thyſelf, we will with bended knees and contrite hearts adore our God, who in terrible majeſty comes riding on the clouds. His thunders proclaim his approach: the darting fires mark his paſſage.

               <p>The clouds now pour'd forth their torrents: livid flames no longer flaſh'd from the heavens, and the thunder roll'd at a diſtance. I rais'd my head from the ground, ſaying, The Almighty, my dear Eve hath paſs'd by. He hath not deſtroy'd the earth: we are yet permitted to live. He hath remember'd his promiſes. Eternal Wiſdom, Everlaſting Truth repenteth not. He will fulfil the deſigns of his mercy; and thy ſeed, O Eve! ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent.</p>
               <p>We aroſe and were comforted. The heavens reſum'd their brightneſs, and the ſetting ſun ſpread a mild radiance thro' the ſky, like the luminous track we uſed to behold in Eden, when legions of angels were carry'd above our heads on the flying clouds. Silence reign'd over the moiſt fields, the herbage and flowers, ſtill glittering with the drops of heaven, glow'd with more than uſual beauty. The depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun darted on us his laſt beams, while we celebrated with reverential awe, and thankful love, the wiſdom, power, and mercy of our Creator.</p>

Thus paſs'd the firſt day after our leaving Paradiſe. The ruddy evening gave place to the grey twilight, and ſoon the earth was only enlighten'd by the moon's feeble rays. We now for the firſt time were chill'd by the cold of the night, though a few hours before we had almoſt faintd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ardent rays of the ſcorching ſun at noon. Our Beneficient Maker had condeſcended to gird our loins with with the ſkins of beaſts before our leaving Paradiſe, to ſhew that he had not withdrawn from us his ſuccouring hand; in theſe we wrapp'd ourſelves, and lying down on our lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy bed, hand in hand, waited the approach of ſleep.</p>
               <p>Sleep, the relief of the weary, at length came; but it was unaccompany'd with that ſoft eaſe, that ſweet delight which bleſt our ſlumbers while innocent: our imagination then preſented none but ſmiling and agreeable images. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, fear and remorſe, did not then keep us waking the tedious hours of darkneſs, nor mingle in our dreams with fantaſtic phantoms. The heavens were however calm, and our reſt was undiſturb'd: but Oh! how different from that delicious night when I led thee, my ſpouſe, for the firſt time, to the nuptial bower! The flowers and odoriferous ſhrubs charm'd with new ſweetneſs. Never was the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the nightingale ſo harmonious; never did the pale moon ſhine with ſuch radiance: But why do I dwell on images that awaken my grief, now huſh'd to ſilence?</p>
               <p>We ſlept till the morning ſun had exhal'd the limpid dew. When we awoke we found ourſelves refreſh'd and fitted for labour, and enjoy'd with delight and gratitude the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the birds, who were celebrating with their ſweeteſt notes the renewed light: their number yet was but ſmall: for there were then no other animals on earth but thoſe who, inſtructed by divine inſtinct, had after the fall, fled from Paradiſe, that the garden of the Lord might not be defil'd by death.</p>
               <p>We offer'd up our adorations at the entrance of the grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; after which, I ſaid to Eve, We will, my love, go farther and view this immenſe country: our All-merciful God has given us liberty of choice. We may fix our abode where the earth is moſt fertile; where Nature is moſt profuſe of her beauties. Seeſt thou, Eve, that river, which, like a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011667_0029_0F87CAC44C428CC0"/>The hill on its bank, ſeems at this diſtance like a garden full of trees, and its top is cover'd with verdure. My dear ſpouſe, return'd Eve, preſſing my hand to her boſom, I ſhall follow with delight the ſteps of thee, my conductor and guard. We will purſue our walks towards the hill.</p>
               <p>We were going on when we ſaw, juſt above our heads, a bird fly with feeble wing: its feathers were rough and diſorder'd: it caſt forth plaintive cries, and, having fluttered a little in the air, ſunk down without ſtrength among the buſhes. Eve went to ſeek it, and beheld another lie without motion on the graſs, which that we had before ſeen ſeem'd to lament. My ſpouſe ſtooping over it, examin'd it with fix'd attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in vain try'd to rouſe it from what ſhe believ'd to be ſleep. It will not wake, ſaid ſhe to me, in a fearful voice, laying the bird from her trembling hand.—It will not wake.—It will never wake more! She then burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears, and ſpeaking to the lifeleſs bird, ſaid, Alas! the poor bird who piere'd my ears with his cries, was perhaps thy mate. It is I!—It is I! unhappy that I am, who have brought miſery and grief on every creature! For my ſin theſe pretty harmleſs animals are puniſhed. Her tears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled. What an event! ſaid ſhe, turning to me. How ſtiff and cold it is! It has neither voice nor motion. Its joints no longer bend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it is.—How I tremble! An icy cold runs thro' my bones. If the death with which we are threaten'd is like this, how terrible!—What deareſt Adam! would become of me, if, like the feather'd mate of this poor bird, I am left behind to mourn? Or what of thee, if death tear me from thy fond arms? Should God create another Eve to fill my forfeit place in thy lov'd boſom, ſhe will not—cannot love like me, thy partner in diſtreſs and baniſhment. Unable to ſay more, ſhe wept, ſhe ſobb'd, and her expreſſive eyes tenderly fix'd on mine, made my feeling heart partake her anguiſh. I preſs'd her to my breaſt: I kiſs'd her cheek, and mix'd my tears with hers. Ceaſe, deareſt Eve, I cry'd, theſe fond complaints. Dry up thy tears. Have confidence in the Supreme Being, who governs all his creatures by his infinite wiſdom. Though we cannot penetrate into the deſigns of his Providence: though his majeſtic tribunal is ſurrounded by darkneſs, we may reſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011667_0030_0F87CAC6423A1950"/>aſſur'd, that Mercy and Love remain near his throne. Why, my love, ſhould we anticipate misfortunes? Why ſhould we, guided by a gloomy imagination, ſeek for them in futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Was our reaſon given us only to make us wretched? Shall we ungratefully turn our eyes from the repeated inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the loving-kindneſs and tender mercy of our God, at the hazard of plunging ourſelves in miſery by our blindneſs? It is his wiſdom, and his goodneſs that regulate and appoint what ſhall befal us. Let us with humble confidence proceed under his direction, and devoutly acquieſce in his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without ſeeking to know what he hath not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to reveal.</p>
               <p>We now advanc'd to the eminence. Its gentle aſcent was almoſt cover'd with buſhes and fertile ſhrubs. On the ſummit, in the midſt of fruit-trees, grew a lofty cedar, whoſe thick branches form'd an extenſive ſhade, which was render'd more cool and delightful by a limpid brook, that ran in various windings among the flowers. This ſpot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a proſpect ſo immenſe, that the ſight was only bounded by the duſky air; the ſky forming a concave around us, that appear'd, wherever we turn'd, to touch the diſtant mountains. Here, ſaid I, my deareſt love, we will fix our abode. This ſpot is a faint ſhadow of Paradiſe, whoſe bliſsful bowers we muſt never more behold. Receive us, majeſtic cedar, under thy ſhade. Ye trees of various taſte and hue, refreſh and ſuſtain us with your delicious fruits: never ſhall we gather the ſweet produce without gratitude: It ſhall be the reward of our attentive care and laborious cultivation. O God Omnipotent, who reigneſt in Heaven! look with a propitious eye on this our dwelling. Lend an ear of compaſſion to the ſupplications, receive with favour the praiſes and thankſgivings which we, Thy frail offending creatures, ſhall never ceaſe to ſend up towards thy celeſſial throne, through the ſpreading branches of theſe trees. Here, my deareſt wife, we ſhall obtain, by the ſweat of our brows, our ſupport. Under theſe ſhades, thou ſhalt bring forth with pain. From hence, will our offspring ſpread themſelves over the wide earth. Here too, death ſhall one day viſit us, and we ſhall be confounded with our original duſt. O Lord God our Maker! ſhower down Thy bleſſings on the profane abode of us ſinners. While I
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011667_0031_0F87CAC743E87918"/>thus utter'd the devout breathings of my ſoul, Eve was proſtrate on the earth by my ſide: her hands were elevated: her eyes ſwam in tears, and were rais'd towards Heaven in holy extaſy.</p>
               <p>I now began to conſtruct our habitation under the ſhade of the ſpreading cedar. I fix'd in the earth a circle of ſtrong ſtakes, and interwove them with ſlexible twigs. While I was thus employ'd, Eve was conveying the ſtream among the flowers; gathering ripe fruits; ſupporting, with ſmall ſticks, the bending ſtalks of the variegated ſhrubs, and pruning their luxuriant branches. Then it was that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to eat our bread by the ſweat of our brows.</p>
               <p>I went to the river to fetch reeds to cover our cottage: there I ſaw five ewes, white as the ſouthern clouds, and with them a young ram, feeding by the ſide of the water. I approach'd them without noiſe, fearing they would fly me, like the tyger and the lion; who, before our fatal tranſgreſſion, us'd to play with the kid or the lamb at our ſeet. But, inſtead of endeavouring to eſcape me, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd me to ſtroke their fleeces, and I drove them before me, with a reed to our hill; where I intended they ſhould, for the future, feed. Eve was buſied in erecting a bower, and did not immediately, on my return, obſerve my little ſtock; but they ſoon diſcover'd themſelves by their bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She ſtarted at the ſound, and dropp'd the boughs from her hand thro' fear: but ſoon recovering, ſhe cry'd, with joy in her countenance, O Adam! they are gentle and fond as in Paradiſe. Welcome, pretty animals, ye ſhall live with us. All you want is here. Ye need not ſtray; for here are flowery paſtures, fragrant herbage, and a clear ſpring. Your innocent ſporting will give us delight, while we attend our trees and flowers. Yes, harmleſs creatures, ſhe continu'd, patting their woolly backs, ye ſhall be my flock, and I will be your indulgent miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Our little dwelling was now completed, and we were enjoying the cool breezes at its entrance, and ſilently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the diſtant country, when Eve ſaid, my deareſt love, how beautifully is the proſpect before us variegated! How fertile, how full of bleſſings is this earth, which we thought ſo barren! Let us to the fruits and flowers, which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011667_0032_0F87CAC7E7172038"/>the hill already yields, add thoſe that grow on its borders, and our abode will have a faint reſemblance of Eden's delightful ſhades. Ah! ſhe added with a ſigh, it will then bear but the ſame proportion of likeneſs to Paradiſe, as that does to the bliſsful ſeats of the angels, which the heavenly meſſengers, who, in our happy days of innocence, condeſcended to viſit us, deſcrib'd in ſuch glowing colours. O thou garden of the Lord, how delightful were thy ſweet retreats! how did thy gay tints charm the eye! how did thy luſcious fruits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy aromatic fragrance feaſt the ſenſes; whatever neceſſity requir'd, all the uſeful, all the agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were there in rich profuſion. O my ſpouſe! com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with that luxuriant ſpot, what is all about us but dry ſterility and barrenneſs? This earth, under the Divine malediction, ſeems unable to produce in the ſame lands that ſweet variety, that happy diverſity that charm'd us in Eden's bowers. We muſt now ſeek the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in diſtant places. I have ſeen too, that not only animals are the prey of death; he ſtretches his wide domain, he tyrannizes over the whole earth, and makes rude havock in the world of vegetation. O Adam! what fruits have I beheld drop from their branches, ſpoilt, and full of black rottenneſs! What flowers wither on their ſtalks! The trees are diſrob'd of their verdure by the diſpoiler, Death. I have obſerv'd too, that young leaves ſupply the place of thoſe that are fallen, and that the ſeeds of dead flowers caſt into the earth, produce new ones. We, Adam, muſt thus, one day, wither and die, and our children ſhall ſucceſſively grow up and flouriſh.</p>
               <p>She ceas'd ſpeaking, and I, deeply affected by her words, made anſwer. Dear Eve, were our loſs only the gay verdure, the fruits and flowers of Paradiſe, it would ſcarce deſerve a ſigh; but, alas! we are expell'd from the ſacred ſpot which our Maker bleſs'd by his immediate preſence. There, veiling his inſupportable radiance, he walk'd among the groves, while all nature celebrated the approach of the Deity in reverential ſilence. Tho' form'd of the duſt, my proſtrations were accepted. The Almighty condeſcended to hear his creature, and vouchſaf'd to anſwer, with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, a frail worm. Alas! we have, by our diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, loſt this privilege; guilty as we are, we can no more
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011667_0033_0F87CAC89C03DC18"/>hope to converſe with infinite purity. This, this calls for our lamentations and our tears. Will the God of Heaven viſit a land under his curſe? Will the Moſt Holy dwell among ſinners? He looks down from the ſeats of bliſs: He regards with an eye of compaſſion our penitence and tears, and his bounties exceed every hope our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs could form. Even the bright ſpirits of Heaven are his Meſſengers; they execute his orders on this dark globe; but, alas! our polluted eyes are now unworthy to behold them: They perform the taſk aſſign'd, without deigning to become viſible to ſinful man, and then ſoar, with haſty wing, from this ſeat of corruption, now fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the reſidence of beings under the curſe of their Sovereign.</p>
               <p>Thus were we holding converſe, and caſting our melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly eyes on the country before us, when a reſplendent cloud deſcending, glided towards us, and reſted on our hill; from it ſtept a radiant form, wearing on his face a majeſtic ſmile. We haſtily aroſe; we bow'd our heads, and the celeſtial meſſenger thus ſpoke: He whoſe throne is in the higheſt Heaven, has heard your complaints. Go, ſaid he, and inform thoſe children of aſſliction, that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is not circumſcribed by the circuit of Heaven, it extends to all the works of my hands.</p>
               <p>Whence has the ſun its invigorating heat? who teaches the ſtars to run their courſes? Why does the earth bring forth its fruits, and day and night regularly ſucceed each other? Who preſerves the various animals? In Me they live, move, and have their being. What keeps thee, Adam, from ſinking into corruption? I am near thee: I ſuſtain thee by my power. I guard thee by my provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and know the ſecret breathings of thy ſoul, and all the purpoſes of thine heart.</p>
               <p>The luminous ſphere, that encompaſs'd the angel, reach'd even to me. Fill'd with devout extaſy, I lifted up to him my dazzl'd eyes. How great beyond conception, ſaid I, are the favours of the Lord! He beholds our wretchedneſs with compaſſion: He ſends his angels to give us comfort. O effulgent ſpirit! I ſtand conſounded and abaſh'd before thee. How ſhall I, ſinful man that I am, dare to ſpeak to thee, the unoffending meſſenger of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011667_0034_0F87CAC96CE608A8"/>array'd in light and purity? Yet, O benevolent angel! permit me to mention the ſad apprehenſions and fears that oppreſs my heart. That God is every where preſent, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily believe. I ſee him in his works. I feel him in his goodneſs and tender mercies. That the Moſt High, a being perfect in purity, ſhould more intimately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Himſelf to a worm defil'd with ſin, I do not preſume to expect. What I dread is, that when man ſhall be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd on the earth, he will be eſtrang'd from God his Maker. I have fallen, my children may alſo fall— fall into more horrid depths, and thus being more and more debas'd, their wretchedneſs will encreaſe. The time will come, when I ſhall be no longer with them, to inform them, and give, in my own perſon, evident proofs of the loving-kindneſs and compaſſion of the Lord. 'Tis true, the ſmalleſt inſect will declare His beneficence: but if God continues to hide His face from man, will not the voice of Nature be too weak to ſtrike his mind? Will not the idea of the Deity be totally loſt, or at leaſt, confounded in darkneſs and obſcurity? This thought gives my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding heart exquiſite anguiſh. I tremble with horror, when my gloomy imagination repreſents to my view mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of creatures ſunk in diſtreſs and guilt, who may execrate me as the cauſe of their blindneſs and miſery.</p>
               <p>Father of men, reply'd the angel, with aſpect benign, He in whom and by whom all things exiſt, will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thine offspring. Often will they, by their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, preſumptuouſly affront the Majeſty of Heaven. Often will their ſins cry aloud for vengeance. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will graſp his thunder, and diſplay the terrors of His judgments. The guilty ſhall tremble in the duſt: the ſinners ſhall cry out in agony, Dreadful is the wrath of God, who can ſtand before it? But more often will He make himſelf known in kindneſs: He will delight to ſhew favour to the repenting children of men. Mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion dwell always with him, Judgment is his ſtrange work. He will raiſe from among thy poſterity men whoſe minds he will enlighten. They, aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, ſhall call their brethren to repentance. Sinners ſhall hearken, and forſaking the ways of ſenſuality and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall worſhip a Being of ſpotleſs purity in ſpirit and in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011667_0035_0F87CACA19BB14F8"/>truth. He will ſend among them prophets and holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe miſſion he will evidence by miracles: theſe choſen of the Lord ſhall cure the diſeas'd, raiſe the dead, and do many wonderful works. Theſe ſhall make known the Judgments of the Moſt High: they ſhall declare his condeſcenſion and grace: they ſhall foretel what will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in diſtant periods of time, and the accompliſhment of their prophecies will teach men, that the Eternal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules and directs according to his good pleaſure, and the merciful deſigns of his providence, events that appear to ſhort-ſighted mortals, the work of a blind chance. Often will he ſpeak to the ſons of men by his angels: frequently in prodigies; and there will be ſome righteous perſons to whom he will, with infinite goodneſs, more intimately ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Himſelf: to them he will ſpeak face to face; till at length ſhall be uſher'd in the great miſtery of the ſalvation of mankind, when the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head.</p>
               <p>The angel was ſilent, and I, encouraged by the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and ſweetneſs of his look, reply'd, O celeſtial friend! if thou wilt yet allow me, frail as I am, to call thee ſo; and why ſhould I doubt it? ſince thou canſt not hate him whom the Eternal does not hate—him for whom the Divine clemency manifeſts itſelf with ſuch ſplendor as ſtrikes the heavenly hoſt with admiration, and ſurpaſſes the power of words to expreſs, when the adoring ſoul, humbled in the duſt, attempts to pour forth its gratitude: Tell me lucid ſpirit, if it be permitted thee to draw from the obſcurity, with which they are ſurrounded, thoſe auguſt myſteries; tell me what is the import of the promiſe, the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head, and what is meant by the curſe denounc'd againſt man, thou ſhalt die. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that the Moſt High permits me to reveal, anſwer'd the angel, will I hide from thee.</p>
               <p>Know then, O Adam, on thy tranſgreſſing the Divine command, God ſaid to the happy ſpirits who worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Man hath diſobey'd me; he ſhall die. A denſe cloud ſuddenly encompaſs'd the eternal throne, and a deep ſilence reign'd thro' the whole expanſe of Heaven; the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial hoſt were fill'd with conſternation; but ſoon the darkneſs diſpers'd, and the praiſes of the Higheſt again
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011667_0036_0F87CACF758EC8F0"/>reſounded from the harps of angels. Never did God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf with ſuch luſtre and magnificence, only in that memorable inſtant when his creative voice called the ſtars from non-exiſtence, and His Almighty fiat went on creating through the immenſity of ſpace. The adoring angels were in eager expectation of what was to follow this unuſual pomp, when the majeſtic voice of God ſounded through the arch of heaven, uttering theſe words of benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and grace; I will not withdraw my favour from the ſinner. To my infinite mercy the earth ſhall bear witneſs. Of the woman ſhall be born an Avenger, who ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent. Hell ſhall not rejoice in this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Death ſhall loſe its prey. Ye Heavens ſhew forth your gladneſs! Thus ſpake the Eternal. The blaze of his glory would have been too ſtrong for even the eyes of arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, had not a thin cloud temper'd its inſupportable radiance. The bleſt inhabitants of Heaven celebrated with joy this great myſtery, and attun'd their golden harps to the praiſes of the Father of Spirits, whoſe tender mercies are over all his works. How God will pardon the ſinner without offending his juſtice, ſurpaſſes conprehenſion; but it is enough, Eternal Truth hath ſaid it. We know, and thou mayſt alſo reſt aſſur'd, that Death, having loſt his power, can only diſengage the ſoul from its bonds. The body, that veſture of earth, ſhall return to the duſt, of which it was form'd, while the immortal ſpirit, refin'd from all defilement, ſhall be rais'd to Heaven, to partake there with angels, archangels, and all the celeſtial hoſt, never ending ſelicity.</p>
               <p>Hear, Adam, the order of thy God, I will be gracious to thee and to thy ſeed. There ſhall be a ſign between me and thee, as the ſeal of this great promiſe: thou ſhalt build an altar on this hill, and offer on it a young lamb. I will, on my part, ſend down fire to conſume the victim. This ſacrifice thou ſhalt renew every year, and the flame ſhall annually deſcend to burn thine offering.</p>
               <p>I have now told thee, firſt of men, continu'd the angel, all that the Moſt High thinks proper to reveal of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable decrees. I am alſo allow'd to ſhew thee, that ye are not ſo ſolitary on this globe as ye imagine. Curſt as this earth is, ye are ſtill ſurrounded by pure ſpirits, who are
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011667_0037_0F87CAD023316E10"/>commiſſion'd to be your guard and defence, and order'd to preſide with watchful care, over the works of nature. The angel then touching our eyelids, we beheld beauties that I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe. No words could give ideas that would do juſtice to the bright magnificence of the ſcene. All the country round us was peopled with the children of Heaven, more beautiful than Eve when ſhe firſt came from the hands of her Creator, and with ſoft reluctance, and modeſt grace, receiv'd her welcome in my arms.</p>
               <p>Some were employ'd in collecting the light miſts that iſſu'd from the moiſt earth: they bore them upwards on their expanded wings, and converted them into mild dews, and fertilizing ſhowers. Others lay reclin'd, near purling brooks, watching leſt their ſources ſhould fail, and the plants they water'd be depriv'd of their humid aliment. Many were diſpers'd through the open country, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided over the growth of fruits, and ſpread on the opening flowers azure, green and red, with every vivid hue, and, by breathing on them, impregnated them with fragrance. Some peopled the groves, employ'd in various offices: from the glittering wings of theſe were wafted gentle breezes, which, paſſing through the foilage of the trees, hover'd over the flowers, and ſkimm'd along the ſurface of the brooks and lakes. Some among theſe celeſtial la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, having perform'd the taſk aſſign'd them, were ſitting in the ſhade, joining in harmonious concert: the melody of their voices accompany'd the ſounding ſtrings of their golden harps, and they ſang, to the praiſe of the Moſt High, hymns, not to be heard by mortal ears. Not a few were walking on our hill, and among our bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: in their gentle looks I beheld commiſeration of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: but now our eyes again became unable to behold the heavenly effulgence, and the rapturous ſcene diſappear'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe, which you have juſt beheld, ſaid the angel, are ſpirits commiſſion'd to watch over the productions of the earth: they are the appointed aſſiſtants of Nature, and help to promote and complete her various works, according to the invariable and immutable laws of the great Firſt Cauſe. The Creator has given exiſtence to innumerable orders of beings. Even this earth, tho' under the curſe of the Moſt
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011667_0038_0F87CAD0E2C57188"/>High, is full of beauty, and the admiring angels behold on this globe, objects too ſublime for mortal ſight. The delightful employment of ſome of theſe children of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is to watch over thy ſafety, O Adam! to avert from thee unforeſeen misfortune. They accompany thee in all thy ways: they aſſiſt thee in thy labours, and often turn even thy diſappointments to thy advantage; bringing from an apparent evil a real good. They, with pleaſure, behold thy domeſtic happineſs. They are witneſſes of thy moſt ſecret actions. A ſmile of benevolence ſhews their joy when man, their charge, acts right: the frown of diſdain and ſorrow ſits on their brow, when he forgets himſelf and his happineſs. Theſe, in future ages, the Lord will employ to diſtribute plenty through the countries he will delight to bleſs, or to carry famine and deſolation among rebellious nations, when it ſhall pleaſe him to recal them by his chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements.</p>
               <p>The angel ceas'd ſpeaking. He caſt on us a look of mild condeſcenſion, and was loſt, to our eyes, in a ſhining cloud. We proſtrated ourſelves on the earth, with devout extaſy, and humbly offer'd up our thankſgivings to our Beneficent and All-merciful Creator.</p>
               <p>I immediately ſet up the altar, as the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, on the ſummit of the hill; Eve employ'd herſelf in conſtructing around it a little paradiſe. She brought from the neighbouring plain the moſt beautiful and odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous flowers: theſe ſhe planted on all ſides of the altar, and, with cheerful labour, water'd them, each morning and evening, from the clear ſtream that flow'd near our dwelling. O tutelar angels! ſaid ſhe, in the midſt of her labour, complete the work of my hands; for without your aid, in vain ſhall I plant, in vain ſhall I water! May your kind cares, bright ſpirits, give theſe flowers more life, more beauty, more fragrance, than they had in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoil, for to the Lord of All this incloſure is conſecrated! I planted a ſpacious circle of trees around the holy altar, and their thick branches ſpread an awful ſhade, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the mind to devout contemplation.</p>
               <p>In theſe occupations we paſs'd the ſummer, expos'd each lay to the ſcorching ſun. Autumn arriv'd, and repaid our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011667_0039_0F87CAD199862E00"/>loud blaſts of the north began to be heard, and the tops of the mountains were cover'd with an hoar froſt. Not then knowing, that the weak earth, which was exhauſted by the profuſe liberality of ſummer and autumn, wanted to recover her ſtrength by the Reſt of Winter, we ſaw, with grief, the ſadden'd face of Nature. In Eden we kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w no change of ſeaſons: mild ſpring, gay ſummer, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Autumn, charm'd there together. As the winter advanc'd, the face of nature wore encreaſing gloom: the flowers wither'd on their ſtalks, and, if any yet ſurviv'd around the altar, they ſeem'd, with drooping head, to mourn their approaching fall. The lateſt fruits fell from the trees, and the ſapleſs branches caſt their leaves. The clouds pour'd down torrents of rain, and the higheſt peaks of the mountains were cover'd with ſnow. We beheld this ſcene of deſolation with fear and anxiety. Should this, my deareſt Eve, ſaid I, be only the firſt effects of the curſe pronounc'd againſt this earth, and God continues to puniſh, ſhe will be ſtripp'd of the ſmall remains of utility and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which her degradation has left her: ſmall were they in compariſon of the delights of Paradiſe; yet they were ſufficient to ſoften our toil, and afforded us many of the conveniences and bleſſings of life; but if the Divine male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction continues to ſpread deſtruction on this earth, how gloomy will be our days? What will become of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd offspring? Thus we mourn'd our melancholy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, encourag'd by the promiſes of our God, we plac'd in him an humble confidence. We endeavour'd to conſole each other, and to drive from our minds every thought of murmuring or diſcontent, and thankfully ador'd the Lord, in the midſt of the dreary horrors, by which we were ſurrounded.</p>
               <p>We laid up for our winter ſupport thoſe fruits that had eſcap'd corruption and rottenneſs, and, that they might be ſtill preſerv'd, we dry'd them by fire.

               <p>Sad and ſlow paſs'd our days, while the clouded ſky pour'd forth rain, and the bleak winds chill'd us with cold. But at length the genial ſun re-animated the earth, and brighten'd the heavens, while gentle winds chac'd the moiſt fogs from the ſummits of the mountains. Reviving Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſmil'd at the return of youth: the fields were again cloath'd in cheerful green: innumerable flowers deck'd the paſtures, and ſeem'd to vie with the ſun in luſtre: the trees again began to ſhoot out their buds, and all nature was full of new born joy. Thus, crown'd with leaves and flowers, came amiable Spring, that delightful morning of the year.</p>
               <p>The trees with which I had ſurrounded the altar were pre-eminent in beauty. Eve ſaw, with inexpreſſible rapture, the flowers ſhe had planted on the holy ſpot, recover'd their bloom. In vain, my children, ſhould I attempt to give you an idea of our joyful extaſy. We ran to the conſecrated circle, fill'd with devout gratitude. The ſun illumin'd the ſacred ſpot with his pureſt radiance. Every creature ſeem'd to join in our praiſes of the Creator. The flowers exhal'd their ſweeteſt odours; the trees extended the ſhade of their bloſſoming branches over the holy altar; the wing'd inſects, that inhabited the tender graſs, chirp'd forth their joy: while the birds, on the ſpreading boughs of the trees, enliven'd our devotion by their mellifluous harmony. We caſt ourſelves on our knees: tears of gratitude and joy burſt from our eyes, fell on the graſſy turf, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the dew of the morning. Our fervid prayer aſcended towards the Lord of Nature, towards the God of Grace and Goodneſs, who had mercifully turn'd, even the effects of his juſt diſpleaſure, to our advantage.</p>
               <p>I now began to cultivate a little field upon the hill. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tate my labour. Often too, ignorance of the ſeaſons, and of the proper ſoils for the different productions, led me into errors. Frequently my imagination deceiv'd me,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011667_0041_0F87CAD6C07AA670"/>and I was diſappointed when I had high hopes that I had found the art of contracting my labours. I ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have been without reſource, had not the gentle ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who watch'd over my happineſs, condeſcended to enlighten me.</p>
               <p>One morning as I caſt my eyes towards the altar, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, with awe, the flame of the Lord burning over it. The riſing ſun gilded with his beams the aſcending ſmoke. Enraptur'd, I call'd to my beloved; See, deareſt Eve, I cry'd; ſee the accompliſhment of the promiſe. Behold, the ſacred flame is come down on our altar. Let us go to it immediately. Every labour muſt now ceaſe. I will, as the Almighty hath commanded, kill a young lamb. Haſte, my love, and chuſe the fineſt flowers to ſtrew the ſacrifice. I took the beſt of my flock: but, my children, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to give you a deſcription of what I felt, when I went to deprive the innocent animal of life. A trembling ſeiz'd my hand; I was ſcarce able to hold the ſtruggling victim, and never could I have brought myſelf to give it death, had not my reſolution been animated by the expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the author of Life. The very remembrance of its endeavours to eſcape gives me pain. When I beheld its quivering limbs in the laſt moments of its exiſtence, an univerſal tremor ſhook my own; and when it lay before me, without ſenſe or motion, dreadful forebodings invaded my troubled ſoul. In obedience to the divine command, I laid the bleeding lamb on the altar, and Eve ſcatter'd on it odoriferous flowers. We then proſtrated ourſelves on the earth before it, with reverence and fear, and offer'd up our humble praiſes to the God of Truth, who had thus ſolemnly verify'd his promiſes. An awful ſilence reign'd around us, as if Nature celebrated the preſence of her God. In this perfect calm our raviſh'd ears were charm'd with the minſtrelſy of Heaven. The angels that hover'd over us, join'd in our devout praiſes. The flames ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the ſacrifice, and on its extinction, which was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, an aromatic odour diffus'd itſelf through the far extended country.</p>
               <p>A little after this ſolemn day of reconciliation, I was going, at ſun-ſet, to reſt myſelf, after the fatigue of the day, near my beloved. I aſcended the hill. I ſought for her in vain,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011667_0042_0F87CAD764C9E478"/>in our cottage. I look'd for her, with anxiety in the ſhady bower. At length I found her, pale, and without ſtrength, at the ſide of the ſpring, and thee, Cain, my firſt-born, lying on her boſom. The pains of child-birth had ſeiz'd her, while ſhe was employ'd in her ordinary labours, near the brook. She was bedewing thine infant face with tears of joy. At ſight of me ſhe cry'd, with a ſmile, I ſalute thee, father of men. The Lord hath aſſiſted me in the hour of diſtreſs: I have brought forth this ſon, to whom I have given the name of Cain. O thou dear firſt-born! ſaid ſhe, the Lord hath favourably regarded the hour of thy birth; may all thy days be conſecrated to his praiſe! how weak, how helpleſs is he that is born of woman? May'ſt thou, dear infant, riſe as a young flower in the ſpring! May thy life be a ſweet preſume offer'd up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! I then took thee, my firſt-born, in my arms. I ſalute thee, ſaid I to Eve, I ſalute thee, mother of men. The Lord be praiſed, who hath aſſiſted thee in thy diſtreſs. I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute thee, Cain, firſt of human beings who gave pain to thy mother: firſt of human race, who entered into life to leave it by death. O God, continued I, look down from thy throne, and regard, with compaſſion, this thy feeble creature. Shed thy gracious benediction on the morning of his life. It ſhall be my delightful taſk to inſtruct his young mind: I will ſhew him the miracles of thy grace: I will teach him the wonders of thy love. Morning and evening his infant lips ſhall be taught to ſound forth thy praiſe. O deareſt Eve, mother of men, I cry'd, in the tranſport of my heart, a race, without number, ſhall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh around thee. This myrtle was, like thee, ſolitary, till the tender ſuccours ſprang from the maternal root. When mild ſprings ſhall clothe it with new ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In the ſame manner, (let this proſpect conſole thee in thy preſent weakneſs) in the ſame manner ſhall our offspring multiply around this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. We ſhall, from its ſummit, ſee their peaceful dwellings adorn the plain: we ſhall ſee them, if death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays its approach long enough to permit us—we ſhall ſee them lend each other mutual aſſiſtance, to gain the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flous, the conveniences, and the ſweets of life. Often will
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011667_0043_0F87CAD79C4FB610"/>we deſcend from this hill to viſit our children's children, and under their fertile ſhades will we recount the wonders of the Lord, and exhort them to piety and gratitude. When they taſte of joy, we will ſhare it with them: We will ſympathize in their griefs, and give them conſolation and advice. From the top of this aſcent we ſhall ſee—with gratitude and joy, we ſhall ſee, a thouſand altars ſmoke around. Their burnt offerings ſhall envelope us in ſacred clouds, through which our fervent prayer ſhall aſcend to the Great Creator, in behalf of the human race. And when the ſolemn day ſhall come, when the flame of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall deſcend upon the firſt and moſt holy altar, they ſhall aſſemble on this hill. We will lead them to ſacrifice, and, in holy tranſport, we ſhall behold the fruit of our loins form around us a vaſt circle of proſtrate worſhippers.</p>
               <p>Thus, O Cain! did I utter the ſweet effuſſions of my heart. I kiſs'd thine infant lips with the moſt tender joy. Thy mother then took thee in her enfeebled arms, when, having aſſiſted her to riſe, I led her to our dwelling.</p>
               <p>Strength and vigour ſoon began to animate thy little members. Laughter and gaiety ſparkled in thine eyes, and mirth play'd upon thy cheeks. Already wert thou able to run, with thy tender feet, on the ſoft graſs, and among the flowers: already thy little lips began to liſp forth thine infant thoughts, when Eve brought into the world Mahala, thy ſpouſe. Full of joy thou ſkipp'd about the new-born, kiſs'd her, and cover'd her with flowers. Eve, at length, brought forth thee, O Abel! and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Thirza, thy companion. With inexpreſſible joy we beheld your innocent pleaſures. Our delight encreas'd as we ſaw your young minds unfold themſelves, and arrive, by little and little, at maturity.

               <p>I have now, my beloved children, the happineſs to ſee you arrived at your full growth, as the tender plants are by the hand of time transform'd into lofty and wide ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trees.

               <p>Adam here finiſh'd his recital. A nymph united by the ſoft bands of hymen to her favourite ſwain, wanders with him in the early dawn. They hear the ſweet notes of the nightingale, while all is ſilence around. Her voice ſeems the echo of their own fond thoughts, and through their ſouls is diffus'd a tender tranſport. The bird ceaſes her melody; but they ſtill liſten, with the ear of expectation turn'd towards the branches from whence ſhe chanted her nocturnal ſong. Thus, though our general father ceas'd to ſpeak, his children remain'd fix'd in mute attention. The different ſcenes he had repreſented gave them various emotions: ſometimes the guſhing tear dropp'd from their eyes, at others a lively joy ſpread itſelf over their features. They all return'd their thanks to the father of men; Cain rendered his as well as the others; but he alone had neither ſmil'd nor wept.</p>

               <p>Anamelech, one of the inferior ſpirits of Hell, had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the behaviour and diſcourſe of Cain.

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011667_0048_0F87CADE8D40D668"/>againſt thoſe innocents. He received an horrid pleaſure, while he beheld their little limbs daſh'd againſt the ſtones, which their ſpouting veins ſtain'd with blood. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to ſee them ſtabb'd and diſmember'd in the arms of their diſtracted mothers. He hover'd, with cruel ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, over that unfortunate city. The cries of theſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der victims were, to him, agreeable melody. He fed, with eager joy, on the heart-rending complaints of their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable mothers. The mangled limbs of infants, trampled under the feet of their ſavage murderers, was to him a pleaſing ſight; and he felt an helliſh tranſport, when he beheld their fond parents proſtrate on the earth, in all the bitterneſs of anguiſh, tearing their hair, and beating their breaſts, diſtain'd with the blood of their guiltleſs offspring.</p>
               <p>This relentleſs fiend, revolving in his gloomy breaſt the actions of Hell's fell monarch, diſdain'd ignoble ſloth. I will aſcend, ſaid he; I will aſcend to earth. I'll know the import of the ſentence. Man ſhall die. I will accelerate his doom—I will kill. He then, with haſty ſtride, paſs'd through the gate of Hell. He mark'd and trod the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps the arthfiend had trac'd through ancient Night, and the tumultuous empire of Chaos. Thus a brigantine, equipp'd for theft, ſteers with full ſail, through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſea, and ſtopping on the coaſt of Heſperia, ſurprizes the tranquil inhabitants of ſome peaceful village; ſeizes the active youth, while fathers, mothers, brothers, ſiſters, and inconſolable wives, lament on the ſhore, purſuing, with their weeping eyes, the raviſhers, who, with out-ſpreading ſails, ſoon eſcape from ſight.</p>
               <p>The deteſtable Anamelech long flew, with rapidity, thro' the gloomy empire of Night, till at length he perceived a faint light on the frontiers of the created univerſe. As a malefactor meditating ſome horrid murder in the ſhade and ſilence of the night, proceeds to execute his bloody pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, through the gloom towards the city, and finds it on all ſides illuminated, is ſtruck with fear, and would gladly hide himſelf from every eye: thus the impure ſpirit was agitated with terror, while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here then, ſaid he, dwells man, Heaven's new favourite. This earth is curs'd, and far unlike the ſmiling garden where he firſt was plac'd! Delightful ſpot! now guarded by the flaming ſword: for I beheld it while I hover'd o'er the earth: This they have loſt; but what is left them is not Hell. Perhaps, by plaintive ſupplications, they have ſoften'd the anger of their God: For did not Hell ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me from place to place: did I not bear within myſelf an Hell, I might, for ought I ſee, be happy here; but poſſibly their groſſer bodies may be ſubject to pains, to griefs unknown to etherial ſubſtances. Ah! I ſee ſome of the heavenly hoſt placed as guardians over man, though under malediction. I muſt elude their care, eſcape their attention, or all my deſigns will be render'd abortive, and I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſport, rather than the admiration of Satan, and the ſycophants who ſurround his throne. Yonder is the family of ſinners: but I ſee no ſigns of miſery: their evils, perhaps, commence not till death. I'll know. If their hearts are open to ſeduction, I will, by my wiles, engage them in new crimes that may accelerate their puniſhment. Satan ſucceeded, by an eaſy artifice, with the chiefs of this family, while they were yet perfect. Now they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by ſin, and the curſe of their God, can it be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſubvert them?

Ah!—I ſee one of them bears on his brow the marks of ſullen diſcontent. He has a ferocity in his looks that gives me hopes. My firſt effort ſhall be on him. His compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weeps—I will learn the cauſe of her tears.</p>
               <p>The malevolent ſpirit, inviſible to human ſight, followed Cain and his ſpouſe, meditating ſeduction and murder. When they were retir'd to their dwelling, the impure daemon repeated after them, in malicious mockery: Riſe ſuperior to the vexations that intrude themſelves into thine heart! Drive far from thee theſe clouds of melancholy,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011667_0050_0F87CADFD8EE6A70"/>that would obſcure thy days! Then quitting irony to give utterance to the infernal malice by which he was agitated; No, ſaid he, what is good, ſhall never take root in thine ungrateful heart: I will deſtroy it. Thoſe clouds of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy thou wouldſt diſperſe, ſhall be re-aſſembled over thine head, thick and black as thoſe which ſurround with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal darkneſs, the ſummits of the infernal mountains.

Yes, I will accumulate them on thy brow: deſolation and miſery, yet unknown to the human race, ſhall find entrance among mortals: thy days ſhall be fill'd with horror and darkneſs, and theſe darlings of heaven ſhall taſte the cup of wrath pour'd forth for angels.</p>
               <p>Cheerful dawn again began to gild the horizon, inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſongs and gaiety, when Cain, with his inſtruments of huſbandry, was going to the field. Abel had already given him the ſalute of the morning, and was conducting his flocks to paſtures, ſtill moiſt with the dew of the night. Mahala and Thirza were advancing hand-in-hand, towards the garden which ſurrounded the altar. They ſtopt to ſalute their brothers, when Eve came to them, from her cabin, with geſtures of deſperation.—Both were ſeiz'd with inquietude and concern, and approaching her, cry'd out, with emotion, O my mother! You weep.—Why weep you? Eve, at this queſtion, redoubled her tears, then endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtifle her grief, ſhe, giving them a look of affection, ſaid, while her words were interrupted by ſighs, Alas! my children, have you not heard, dreadful groans come from our dwelling? The ſharpeſt pains this night have ſeiz'd your father, and he now ſtruggles with ſome diſeaſe that ſeems to penetrate even to his bones. He endeavours to conceal his anguiſh. He would prevent the ſighs that eſcape from my heart. He ſuppreſſes his complaints, and ſtrives to conſole me. But O my children! the moſt poignant grief has taken poſſeſſion of my ſoul, and my tortur'd heart refuſes all conſolation. When he repoſes in moſt tranquillity, he ſeems loſt in reflection: an inſtant after he groans with agony: a cold ſweat covers his face, and the tears he had reſtrain'd, burſt, in a torrent, from his eyes. O my dear children! dreadful apprehenſions op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

Let us go to your father. Eve follow'd by her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting children, return'd to her ſpouſe, weeping, and leaning on the ſhoulder of Mahala.</p>
               <p>Fill'd with ſorrow, they ſurrounded the bed of the ſick. Adam then lay tranquil. His countenance and geſtures diſcover'd, that, in ſpite of ſuffering and pain, his ſoul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

My intrails are torn with anguiſh: but, prais'd be the Lord, who regulates all by unerring wiſdom! perhaps he has ordain'd theſe pains to unlooſe the bands that unite my ſoul to this trail body. If it is now to return to the duſt of which it is form'd, I ſubmit. I adore the diſpenſations of my Maker, and wait, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and love, the fatal hour. I will praiſe Thee, the Sovereign of Life and Death, till this union is diſſolv'd: my ſoul ſhall then, deliver'd from its veſture of earth, offer Thee more elevated praiſe. O God of Conſolation! deign to be my ſupport. Teach me to endure, with patience, my preſent pain, in firm hope of future happineſs. But above all, forſake me not, O my Maker! forſake not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring ſinner in the diſtreſsful hour of death! Abandon me not, when my ſoul is diſmay'd by the laſt tremblings of nature!</p>
               <p>He then caſt his languid eyes on our general mother, who was weeping at his ſide. And thou Eve, ſaid he, whom I love as myſelf, and you, my dear children, add not to my griefs by your ſorrow and tears. How cruelly does your affliction diſtreſs me! Ceaſe, my beloved, ceaſe theſe ſighs, and theſe lamentations. Perhaps the Lord may remove the terrors of his hand, and death may yet be at a diſtance. Perhaps I may again, even on earth, taſte joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I wait the good pleaſure of my God, and reſign my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his will. Do you alſo, my dear children, and you, my tender ſpouſe, acquieſce with ſubmiſſion and devout gratitude, in the Divine appointments. Accuſtom your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before-hand to reflect with holy reſignation, on the inſtant when it ſhall pleaſe the Almighty to ſtrip off this garment of earth, and take me from you. The father of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011667_0052_0F87CAE1596A8FB0"/>mankind ceas'd to ſpeak. Sharp pangs again ſeiz'd him, and he could only utter ſighs and groans.</p>
               <p>When his agonies were abated, he regarded all about him with ſilent attention; but his looks were more particularly fix'd on Eve, who ſeem'd overwhelm'd by her deep diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: her ſorrows augmented thoſe of her huſband, and, to conſole her, he again reſum'd his diſcourſe: Alas! ſaid he, the death experienc'd by the firſt ſinner, will doubtleſs have ſomething frightful in it, to thoſe who ſhall behold it: but it will be more terrible ſtill to him who ſhall be the victim. May that Merciful God, who has never abandon'd us in our diſtreſs, ſuccour me in that dreadful hour!— He will do it—his paſt mercies are pledges that he will. As for you, my children, added he, go—leave me— reſign me to the will of the Lord. Pray for me with fervor. This dreadful criſis may perhaps end in a ſweet ſleep, that may reſtore vigour to my enfeebled members.</p>
               <p>Adam was ſilent, his children ſtoop'd to kiſs his trembling hand. Yes, my father, they cry'd, we will proſtrate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord. We will ſupplicate, that ſweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With hearts pierc'd with grief, they left the cottage. Eve only remain'd. I would ſleep, ſaid Adam, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his wife, who ſat near his bed ſuffus'd in tears. Why, my beloved doſt thou give way to thy grief? thy tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by encreaſing my pain, may chace repoſe far from me. At length he wrapt his face in the ſkins which cover'd him, to conceal from his companion the diſtreſs and inquietude of his mind. Is this, ſaid he, to himſelf—is this that hour ſo full of horror? I fear it is. Great God how terrible! —Abandon me not, O my Maker! forſake not, in the laſt agony, an expiring ſinner. How ſweet would be my conſolations, even in death, if theſe ſufferings, theſe fears, would exempt my unhappy offspring from the conſequences of the curſe pronounc'd on them for my ſin! —But no —the ſame horrors will terrify, the ſame veil of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will extend over all born of woman. From a trunk empoiſon'd by ſin, what can be produced but ſinners? ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſubject to death!—I have kill'd all my poſterity.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011667_0053_0F87CAE61720CAA8"/>All, like me, muſt be torn from thoſe they love—from thoſe whoſe tenderneſs ſoften'd and endeard'd life, and gave it all its delights. O Eve! O ſpouſe tender and dear! what anguiſh will rend thine heart! What tears wilt thou ſhed over my ſenſeleſs duſt! Frightful proſpect! Will not my inanimate clay tremble, when the orphan, left without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſhall lament the loſs of its father, ſnatch'd away by Death in the midſt of his courſe? or when decripid parents ſhall be depriv'd of their ſons, who were the comfort and ſupport of their declining age. When ſiſters ſhall water with their tears the dead bodies of their brothers: The wife that of the huſband: the lover that of the object belov'd. Spare then my memory, O my children! Curſe not my peaceful duſt. It is juſt that the weight of the curſe ſhould fall on the laſt hour; the hour that tears us from this life of ſin. Death, when he divides the ſoul from its covering of clay, will alſo draw it from a ſtate of malediction. If, notwithſtanding the little power its degradation has left it, it has ſtruggled againſt vice, and endeavour'd to raiſe itſelf to virtue, it ſhall enjoy never ending happineſs in the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of immortality. Ye ought not then, O mine offspring! to execrate my aſhes. Our abode on earth is not properly life: 'tis but the dawn of life: a troubleſome dream. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs me not then, ye mountains of grieſ! 'Tis by dying I ſhall revive. I wait for that inſtant, firmly relying on the mercies of my God! Such were the thoughts of Adam, when a ſweet ſleep overpower'd his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Eve ſat drown'd in ſorrow, by the bed of her ſleeping huſband, and, in a low voice, fearing to diſturb his repoſe, vented the anguiſh of her heart. What evils do I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? ſaid ſhe. O curſe, the conſequence of ſin! let thy burthen reſt on me; I was the firſt ſinner. Let a double weight of woe fall on my wretched head. It is juſt, I was the firſt offender. Ah! 'tis already on me. All the griefs, all the diſtreſſes of my huſband, of my unhappy offspring, flow from me. Their pains, their ſorrows are ſo many gnawing worms that prey on me. O my ſpouſe! if thou dieſt—How I tremble at the idea! a general ſhivering ſeizes me; the cold ſweat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011667_0054_0F87CAE8261EAAC0"/>the bands of life! hate me not. Add not to my inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſeries, thine anger. And ye, my children, curſe not your unhappy mother. Guilty as I am, I deſerve your pity. Ye upbraid me not, 'tis true; but, alas! every ſigh, every tear awakens my keen remorſe, and is to me a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reproach. O God Almighty! lend an ear to my plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſupplications, and remove his ſufferings: or, if they are the forerunners of death; if his body muſt now return to the duſt, terrifying thought! ſeperate us not: Let me die with him. Suffer my ſoul to retire firſt. that I may not behold his laſt pangs. I was the firſt ſinner. Eve ceas'd to ſpeak, and remain'd inconſolable, weeping by the ſide of her huſband.</p>
               <p>Cain, in ſpite of the roughneſs of his temper, had ſhed tears at the groans and diſcourſe of his father. He went into the fields when he left the cottage, and thus expreſs'd his concern: I could not help weeping when I was near the bed of my father; yet I hope he will not die. God grant that this good parent, whom I love, may not die. Yes, I could not help weeping: but yet I am not drown'd in ſorrow like my brother. Before I ſhed tears, on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, I muſt loſe my natural firmneſs and become, like him, ſoft and effeminate. Will they ſtill ſay, that I am of a ſavage diſpoſition? at leaſt they'll imagine that Abel loves Adam better than I, becauſe I cannot weep like him.

               <p>Such was the prayer of Abel. He was ſtill proſtrate on the earth, from which he was rous'd by a diſtant ſound. Sweet odours were wafted around, and before him ſtood a guardian angel, reſplendent in beauty. On his ſerene brow he wore a coronet of roſes, and his ſmile was gracious as the opening day. He ſaid, with a voice mild as the breath of the zephyrs, The Lord hath lent a gracious ear, O Abel! to the voice of thy ſupplications. He hath granted thee the deſires of thine heart. He hath commanded me to aſſume a body, and to bring thee conſolation and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. The Eternal, who inceſſantly watches over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; who regards with the eye of beneficence the crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſect, as well as the archangel array'd in glory, hath order'd this earth to produce, in its boſom, ſalutary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the diſeaſes of its inhabitants, whoſe bodies, by the

               <p>The angel, having given him the ſalutary herbs, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd. Struck with inexpreſſible aſtoniſhment, he remain'd ſome time immoveable; then breath'd the devout gratitude of his ſoul, in this ſhort ejaculation: What am I, O God? what am I? that Thou ſhould'ſt thus graciouſly regard my prayer. I am but ſinful duſt and aſhes. I would praiſe, Thee, O my God! but thy bounties exceed all praiſe. The triumphant archangel cannot ſufficiently exalt thy name, yet thou haſt deign'd to accept the ſupplications of a worm.</p>
               <p>His lively joy lent him wings. He ran to his cottage, and with eager impatience prepar'd the odoriferous dilution. This perform'd, he flew to his father. Eve was ſtill bath'd in tears, and her daughters ſat penſive by her ſide. They ſaw with ſurprize his eagerneſs, the joy which ſparkled in his eyes, and the ſmile which ſat on his lips. Dry up your tears, my beloved, ſaid he, as he enter'd. Weep no more, O my mother! the Lord hath heard our prayers, he hath ſent us ſuccour. An angel hath appear'd to me in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He hath given me aromatic herbs and flowers, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd by his celeſtial hand. Boil theſe, ſaid he, in clear water, and reſtore health to thy father. They heard his words with aſtoniſhment, and render'd thanks to the Lord, with gratitude and humble confidence. The ſick drank the healing draught, and ſoon experienc'd its ſalutary effects. Adam now rais'd himſelf on his bed, and with ardent pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offer'd up his adorations; then taking the hand of Abel, he preſs'd it to his cheek, and wetted it with tears of joy, ſaying, O my ſon! bleſſed be thou! thou, by whom God hath ſent me ſuccour: thou, whoſe virtue pleaſeth the Lord: thou, whoſe prayer he accepts, and hath vouchſaf'd to anſwer. I again bleſs thee, my ſon! my beloved ſon! Eve and her daughters then embrac'd him by whom the Lord had ſent them ſuccour.</p>
               <p>Cain at this inſtant enter'd the dwelling of his father.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011667_0057_0F87CAEA58BD05E8"/>While in the field, he had been tormented with care and anxiety: I will return, ſaid he to himſelf; I will return to my father: perhaps he needs my aſſiſtance.—Perhaps he is already dead, and I have not receiv'd a laſt bleſſing from his lips. I will haſten to him.—I love my father.</p>
               <p>On his entering, he ſaw, with amazement, their joy. He heard Adam bleſs his brother. Mahala, his wiſe, ran to him, and embracing him, ſaid, The Lord, my beloved, hath ſent us ſuccour by the hand of Abel. Cain approach'd the bed of Adam, and, kiſſing his hand, ſaid, I ſalute thee, O my father! Prais'd be God, who reſtores thee to our tears; but, O my father, have you no bleſſing for me? You have bleſs'd, my brother, by whom the Lord ſent you help: bleſs me alſo—me your firſt-born. Adam, giving him a look of affection, and preſſing his hand between both his, ſaid, I give thee my bleſſing, O Cain! Be bleſt of God, O my firſt-born! May the favour of the Lord reſt always on thee! May thine heart enjoy tranquillity and peace, and thy ſoul uninterrupted repoſe! Cain then embrac'd his brother. How could he avoid it? all had embrac'd him.</p>
               <p>Cain left his father's dwelling; but it was to retire into the gloomy receſſes of a thick grove, where, oppreſs'd with melancholy, he repeated after Adam, Peace and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—an uninterrupted repoſe—How can I enjoy this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity?—Where ſhall I find this repoſe? Was I not forc'd to petition for a bleſſing, while his affection made him, unaſk'd, pour forth his ſoul in bleſſings on my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py brother? He has allow'd me my rank of firſt-born: What advantage to me is this ſuperiority? Miſery is my inheritance; diſdain my portion. It is by the hand of Abel, the Lord hath reſtor'd health to our father. I am rejected. The bright meſſengers of Heaven appear not to me: they paſs me with contempt: they honour me not with their regards. While I ſpend my ſtrength in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the field; while the ſweat drops from my face, embrown'd by the ſcorching ſun, the angels hold converſe with him, whoſe delicate hands are unſoil'd by labour; who lies idle near his flocks, or, with unmanly ſoftneſs, is ſhedding tears, becauſe the ſhining dew glitters on the graſs and herbage, or the ſetting ſun tinges the clouds with purple. Happy favourite! All nature ſmiles on thee. I

I am, in every thing, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Thus revolving in his melancholy brain gloomy ideas, the offspring of hatred and envy, he wander'd in the thick ſhade.</p>
               <p>The ſun was retiring behind the azure mountains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the clouds a glowing red, when Adam ſaid to his wife, I will, my beloved, before the day is clos'd, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thanks to God, who hath reſtor'd my health. He left his bed, full of ſtrength and vigour, and repair'd, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd by his daughters, to the entrance of his cottage. The departing ſun diffus'd a mild light over the fields: Adam caſt himſelf on his knees, and view'd, with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the country thus enlighten'd. Here am I, ſaid he, with fervent effuſion of heart—here am I, my Sovereign Maſter, proſtrate before thy face, penetrated with a lively ſenſe of thine infinite goodneſs. Ye agonizing pains! what are become of you? Ye pierc'd my bones, ye ſcorch'd my vitals; yet in the midſt of anguiſh, my ſoul loſt not her hope; ſhe plac'd her confidence in God, and was not diſappointed. The Almighty lent a gracious ear to the groans and cries of a ſinner: he regarded the voice of a worm. Health return'd: pain and ſorrow were no more. Death ſhall not yet triumph over my duſt: I ſhall ſtill praiſe my Maker, in this habitation of clay, this houſe of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will praiſe Thee, O my God! I will praiſe Thee from the early dawn to the riſing of the evening ſtar. While my ſoul is confined in this body of earth, it ſhall ſtammer forth its gratitude; but it will praiſe Thee in more exalted ſtrains, when, diſengaged from this obſtructing duſt, it ſhall riſe triumphant and refin'd; it ſhall then behold Thee face to face, array'd in all the luſtre of Thy manificence. O ye angels, replendent in light! caſt your eyes on this dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinners, this abode of death. The earth ſhook from its foundations when it became defil'd by ſin, and its Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Maker turn'd from it his regards. Yet, on this earth he now diſplays the wonders of his love. Attune your golden harps to his praiſe. Exalt his name in ſeraphic ſtrains, while man, weak man, can only liſp his rapture. I ſalute thee, O ſun! I ſalute thy retiring beams. When

I ſalute you, ye loſty mountains, and ye hills ſcatter'd over the plain; mine eyes ſhall ſtill behold, reflected from your ſummits, the glowing brightneſs of the riſing and the ſetting-ſun. I ſalute you, O ye birds, who chant the praiſe of the Eternal; your ſongs ſhall ſtill recreate mine ear. Ye limpid ſtreams, I ſhall again repoſe my weary limbs on your flowery banks; again be lull'd to reſt by your ſoft murmurs; and ye groves, ye bowers, ye woods, I ſhall ſtill walk under your refreſhing ſhades: ye ſhall again ſhield me from the ſun's too ardent ray, when wrap'd in profound meditation, I ſhall wander in your fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant retreats. I ſalute thee, O nature entire; but I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and adore only nature's God, who ſupported my vile clay, when ready to crumble into duſt.</p>
               <p>The father of men thus prais'd the Lord, while the whole creation appear'd attentive to his prayer, and ſeem'd to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitate his return <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The young zephyrs wafted on their ambroſial wings the aromatic perfumes of the groves and gardens, as if charged by the flowers to exhale their ſweets to him. The feather'd inhabitants of the woods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him with their ſofteſt notes, actuated by a lively joy.</p>
               <p>Cain and Abel came under the ſhade, while Adam was yet on his knees. They ſaw with delight, their father reſtor'd to health. The prayer ended, Adam, aroſe from the earth, he embrac'd, and receiv'd the embraces of his tranſported children: he kiſs'd, with fond affection, the moiſten'd cheek of our general mother; after which, he, Eve and their daughters, return'd to their dwelling. Abel then addreſſing himſelf to Cain, ſaid, Let us alſo, my dear brother, render thanks to God Moſt High, who haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to our tears our affectionate father. I will, by the light of the moon, which is now riſing, offer on mine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar a young lamb: Wilt not thou alſo, on thine altar, make an offering.</p>
               <p>Cain, giving him a gloomy and angry look, ſaid, Yes, I will preſent an offering to the Lord of what my barren
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011667_0060_0F87CAEC991D3EB8"/>fields afford. Abel, with graceful ſweetneſs, reply'd, O my brother! the Lord our God counts as nothing the lamb which burns before him, neither doth he regard the fruits of the field which the fire conſumes. 'Tis the ardent piety that flames in the heart of the worſhipper, that gives the offering all its value.</p>
               <p>Cain return'd, The fire of Heaven, will perhaps conſume thy victim; for by thee the Lord ſent health to our father —I am diſdain'd. However, I will make my offering. I am, as well as thee, penetrated with gratitude. Our father, who is reſtor'd to our wiſhes, is equally dear to me, as to thee. Let the Lord do with me, miſerable worm! ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Abel tenderly threw himſelf on the neck of Cain, ſaying, Ah my brother, my dear brother! doſt thou make the Lord's having ſent by my hand, relief to our father, a new ſubject of diſcontent? I was charg'd with this commiſſion for us all. All pray'd to the Lord: the prayers of all were anſwer'd. Baniſh from thy boſom, my dear brother!— let me intreat thee, to baniſh for ever, theſe gloomy ideas. The Lord, who ſees into the inmoſt receſſes of our ſouls, can diſcover there unjuſt thoughts, and ſecret murmurs. Love me, as I love thee. Offer thine offering; but ſuffer it not to be defiled by any impure diſpoſitions.

Abel ſlew a young lamb; laid it on his altar; ſcatter'd on it odoriferous herbs and ſlowers, and put fire to the offering, then, warm'd with ſervent piety, proſtrated himſelf before it, and with humble gratitude prais'd the Lord. The flame roſe on high through the gloom of night, and enlighten'd the fields and paſtures. The Lord forbad the winds to blow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſacrifice was acceptable.</p>
               <p>Cain laid on his altar the fruits of the field; put fire to the offering, and alſo proſtrated himſelf before it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly a terrific ſound was heard among the buſhes.

               <p>Cain, ſeiz'd with horror, quitted the place of ſacrifice, a tempeſtuous wind driving after him the infected ſmoke of the offering.

The banks were decorated with lofty trees, and the clear water, reflecting the vivid colours of their ſeveral fruits, form'd a new landſcape. The ſtreams, after thus roving through the flowery turf, finiſh'd their wandering courſe in an ample lake, whoſe glaſſy ſurface was ſmooth and unruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled. He ſaw at a diſtance a citron grove where play'd the wanton Zephyrs, ſanning with their ambroſial wings the ſweets around. The proſpect was terminated by a range of lofty fig-trees, which ſpread their extenſive ſhade over the tender flowers. In this delightful ſpot were accumulated all the beauties with which imaginative ſable has decorated

               <p>Cain ſaw in his dream flocks white as the falling ſnow, ſporting in the meadows, or cropping the plenteous her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, while the indolent ſhepherd, whoſe head was encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with a wreath of flowers, lay reclin'd under the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing palm, chanting to the ſympathizing object of his paſſion an amorous lay.

               <p>A new ſcene now ſtruck the eyes of Cain. It was night, and the in human artifice was in execution. He heard the cries of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

May ſudden terror ſtrike even to the bones, all who ſhall paſs over it!</p>
               <p>Theſe were the imprecations of Cain. When Abel, pale as the ſculptur'd marble, ventur'd to approach him with flow and unſteady ſtep. My brother! ſaid he, in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voice: No—O my God! Horror freezes my blood— One of the ſeditious ſpirits, whom the eternal precipitated from heaven, has ſurely taken his form, under which he utters his blaſphemies! Where art thou, my brother?— I fly to ſeek thee—to bleſs thee.—Where art thou, my brother?</p>
               <p>Here I am, cry'd Cain? in a voice of thunder: here am I, thou ſoft favourite—thou dear minion of the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eternal, and of all Nature—thou, whoſe viperous race are one day ſolely to engroſs all the felicity of this world.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011667_0068_0F87CAFA1D096150"/>Yes, ſo it muſt be. It is fit there ſhould be a tribe of ſlaves, as beaſts of burden to the favourite lineage. Their delicate limbs muſt not endure the hardſhips of labour. Form'd only for voluptuous idleneſs, theſe ſons of ſloth muſt recline in ſhady bowers, while—The rage of hell is in my heart— Cannot I—</p>
               <p>Cain!—my brother! ſaid Abel, interrupting him, with a voice and look that at once expreſs'd his horror, affection and aſtoniſhment: What terrifying dream has troubled thy ſoul? I ſought thee in the early dawn. I came to embrace thee at the ſpringing day. But how do I find thee agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? How doſt thou return my tender love?

As Abel pronounc'd the laſt words, he ſtoop'd to claſp the knees of his brother; but Cain ſtarted back, crying Ah, thou ſerpent? Would'ſt thou twine thyſelf about me? At the ſame inſtant, with an arm ſtrengthen'd by rage, he ſwung a maſſy club, and ſmote the head of his brother. The innocent victim of his fury fell at his feet. The bones of his head were cruſh'd. He once rais'd his dying eyes to his unnatural brother, and giving him a look of pardon and pity, expir'd. His blood diſtain'd the waving curls of his fair hair, and ran in a ſtream to the feet of his murderer.</p>
               <p>Cain ſtood motionleſs, ſtiffen'd with horror. The cold ſweat ran from his trembling members, while he beheld with agony the laſt convulſions of his expiring brother. The ſmoke of the blood he had ſhed aſcended even to him. Curſed blow! he cry'd. My brother—Awake—awake, O my brother!—How pale!—His eyes are fix'd—The blood ſtreams from his head!—Miſerable that I was—Ah! what am I now? Inſcrnal horrors!—</p>

                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:011667_0069_0F87CAFAD99E1718"/>
Thus he cry'd aloud, and furiouſly threw from him the bloody club: then with violence ſtruck his temples. He ſtoop'd to the dead body, and endeavour'd to raiſe it from the earth, crying Abel!—my brother!—awake! Ah! what tortures do I feel!—How his head hangs!—how it bleeds!— how helpleſs!—Dead!—O anguiſh inſupportable!—he is dead. My crime is without remedy!—I fly—whither fly? My tottering knees will ſcarce bear me. Having thus ſpoke, trembling, he hid himſelf among the buſhes.</p>
               <p>The ſeducer, with triumph in his look, remain'd near the dead. Elate with pride, he ſtretch'd his gigantic form to its full height, and his countenance was not leſs dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the black pillar of ſmoke, ariſing from the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſumed lumber of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The flow of the ſacred ſprings of Heaven, before the fatal hour when the Maſter of the univerſe precipitated us from thoſe ſeats of bliſs, never gave me half this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

Riſe beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful youth! Riſe thou friend of angels! This indolence in thine oriſons ill becomes the worſhip of thy God! But he ſtirs not. His own brother has left him weltering in his blood. No: that honour is mine. I guided the arm of the fratricide. It is by actions, ſuch as Satan himſelf would boaſt, I ſhall riſe above the vile populace of Hell. I haſten to the foot of the infernal throne. The vaſt concave of the fiery gulph will reverberate my praiſes. I ſhall move in triumph thro' crowds of ignoble ſpirits, whom no hardy atchievement has digniſy'd, and look down with ſcorn on thoſe, who till now were accounted my equals. Inflated with arrogance, he turn'd once more to glut his eyes with a laſt view of the victim: but the hedious traces of deſpair
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011667_0070_0F87CAFB9A4737F8"/>inſtantaneouſly diſſipated his ironic ſmile, and effac'd the triumphant pride which ſat on his expanded brow. The Lord commanded, and he was ſeiz'd by infernal horrors: he was overwhelm'd by a deluge of torture. He now curs'd his exiſtence: he curs'd eternity, replete with torments, and yelling fled.</p>

               <p>I follow thee, reply'd the righteous ſoul. Into what a torrent of delight and felicity art thou conveying me! Dear and reſpectable friend, whoſe nature is ſo far ſuperior to mine! O my beloved kindred, whom I leave ſtill embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd in duſt; who muſt ſtill remain in this vale of tears; when the days of your lives are fulfill'd, when the hour of your diſſolution is at hand, and the celeſtial introducer of ſouls ſhall deſcend to meet you, I will accompany him; for at the foot of the Almighty's throne I will beg this grace. With what joy ſhall I ſee your pure and holy ſouls riſe from this ſeat of corruption, from this region of death! And thou too, Thirza, my dear and tender companion! when thou haſt yet a little longer wept over my moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duſt, and haſt rear'd to virtue the infant that but now begins to prattle forth its thoughts, thou muſt be the prey of death. What rapture! when thy ſoul, quitting the cold clay, ſhall fly into mine arms.</p>
               <p>Thus ſpoke Abel, and, riſing in the air, began to loſe ſight of the earth. As his eyes were taking a laſt look on the dwellings, whoſe inhabitants were ſtill dear to him, he beheld his brother: remorſe was imprinted on his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: his clench'd hands were held over his head: he ſuddenly liſted up his eyes to Heaven, then, frantic with deſpair, ſtruck, with repeated blows, his throbbing breaſt: he caſt himſelf in agony on the earth, and roll'd in the duſt. Tears of compaſſion dropp'd from the eyes of the happy, and he turn'd aſide from the frightful ſcene. His heavenly conductor was now join'd by multitudes of angels: the tutelar ſpirits of the earth ſurrounded the celeſtial tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers: they congratulated the ſoul of Abel, on its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from ſin and death: they embrac'd him in holy rapture; and, having eſcorted him to the confines of the terreſtrial atmoſphere, they reclin'd on a crimſon cloud, and to the ſoft lute and ſilver harp, join'd the melody of their celeſtial voices, chanting in chorus.</p>

Where ſhall he fly from torture? already convulſions ſeize his wounded breaſt, the mortal poiſon flows to his heart. So Cain vainly ſtrove to fly his pain. Oh that I could no more ſee the ſtreaming blood! he cry'd: I fly, but the blood follows me ſtill—ſtill it runs to my feet. Where ſhall I fly?—Where?—Miſerable that I am—His laſt look!—What have I done? the dreadful deed is the work of Hell—I already feel its tortures! I have, with him, murder'd his unborn offspring—Ah, what noiſe is that among the buſhes?—Why ſighs the dead?— Away, haſte feet far away from the purſuing blood—far away from the dreadful ſight of death!—Drag me away, ye trembling knees, ſprinkled with a brother's blood, to— Hell.

Stop, trembler! Hear thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Thus ſaith the Lord, What haſt thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood cryeth to me.

At length he cry'd, in a voice which ſpoke his anguiſh, My crime is to great—ah much too great, ever to be forgiven! Now, O inexorable God! Thou haſt curſed me on the earth, and—Where can I hide myſelf from thy preſence?—Baniſh'd from Society a vagabond—the firſt who meets me will ſlay me, and rid the earth of an infamous murderer.</p>
               <p>A vengeance ſeven fold more dreadful than thine, ſhall fall on him who ſheds thy blood, ſaid the angel, ſpeaking again in thunder.

No longer will we mourn in the duſt—no longer will we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, like the ſpirits of darkneſs, who are baniſh'd from Thine all-enlivening preſence. We are ſtill ſurrounded by Thy bounties: ſtill permitted to praiſe Thee, to ſupplicate Thy favor, to adore thy wiſdom, to celebrate Thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

We cannot indeed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſtrain our tears for the happy deceas'd: we muſt regret his being thus ſuddenly ſnatch'd from our embraces: but alas! the unhappy criminal ought rather to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our grief, the ſubject of our moſt earneſt prayers.

               <p>NOW Thirza, whoſe ſleep had been diſturbed by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying viſions, opened her eyes to the bright lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of day, and precipitately quitted her bed. So leaps
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011667_0084_0F87CB0D9E96EAD8"/>up the affrighted traveller, who, ſpent with fatigue, had laid himſelf down under the ſhelter of a rock, when a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying dream, ſuggeſted by his guardian angel, repreſents to him the rock falling over his head: trembling he haſtens from the dangerous ſpot; an inſtant after the huge maſs falls with hideous noiſe. He ſeeks the companion of his toil ſome journey; but alas! he is cruſh'd under the ruins. Not leſs agitated was the wife of Abel. What frightful images, ſaid ſhe, have paſs'd before me, while I ſlept! They reſemble nothing in nature. Welcome cheerful light, thou haſt ſcatter'd them. Hail, ye glowing flowers, ſweet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of my attentive care, your various odours, which the morning ſun draws forth, will refreſh my fatigu'd brain; and ye joyous inhabitants of the air, your ſoft melody will re-eſtabliſh ſerenity in my ſoul. I will join your morning ſong. I will join with re-animated Nature in praiſes to the Moſt High. Creator Almighty! Saviour Propitious! my ſoul, overpower'd by Thy goodneſs, can but imperfectly expreſs the immenſity of Thy benefits, and the extent of its gratitude. Thy ever-waking Providence guards Thy creatures, when, cover'd by the veil of night, ſleep weighs down their eye-lids. May my grateful thanks ariſe to Thee, O God! Accept from a feeble worm the tribute of praiſe.</p>
               <p>She now left her dwelling, and walk'd among the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flowers, whoſe firſt ſweets were diffus'd by the morning breeze. My heart ſtill throbs, ſaid ſhe, ſtill anxiety is lodg'd in my breaſt. What mean theſe unſual fears! an interior trembling ſeems to ſhake my very ſoul. My mind is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened like the heavens, when black clouds ſpread through the expanſe. Where art thou, Abel? Where art thou, my beloved? Deareſt half of myſelf! I haſte, purſu'd by gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my terrors, to loſe them in my arms. I fly to thee with the ſpeed thou wouldſt fly, if, benighted in a dark foreſt, thy feet were wing'd by fear.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſpoke, ſhe redoubled her pace, when Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſeeing her, ran from her cottage to meet her. I ſalute thee, my dear ſiſter, ſhe cry'd; Whither art thou going in ſuch haſte, with thine hair diſorder'd, without ornament; not ſo much as one flower? I go, reply'd Thirza, to throw myſelf in the arms of my beloved. Unuſual terrors have this night diſturb'd my ſleep, and my labouring heart is ſtill
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011667_0085_0F87CB0E5E9EF188"/>oppreſs'd by ſad apprehenſions, which the ſerenity of this delightful morning is not able to diſperſe. But though the blooming day; though the ſmiles of nature cannot diſpel my fears, I ſhall loſe them in the gladdening preſence of my huſband! I therefore run to caſt myſelf in his arms.</p>
               <p>The ſpouſe of Cain reply'd with a ſigh, Happy, happy ſiſter! alas! I have no ſuch ſweet reſource. I ſhould be loſt to all conſolation, were it not for a father who loves me, and a tender mother to whom I am dear; were it not for thee, my kind ſiſter, and thine amiable huſband. Yea, with you I loſe part of the load of woe that Cain's diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heaps on my wretched head. To him unhappy! all the beauties of nature are only ſources of melancholy, and he continually regrets the labour which his fertile fields ſo abundantly repay. But, my deareſt Thirza, above all I lament his unkind and cauſeleſs diſlike to our gentle bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Mahala now melted into tears. Thirza wept alſo, and tenderly embracing her, reply'd, Penetrated by the ſame idea, Abel and I ſpend many anxious hours in bewall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his inveterate hatred. Our reſource is in the hand of Heaven. Often in ſleepleſs nights we ſend up our moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent petitions to God, that a beam of His grace may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe the dark clouds from his breaſt; that every baneful weed may be rooted out from his heart, leſt they choak all principles of humanity and virtue. Ah my ſiſter! was thy huſband kind and gentle, again would peace ſmile—again would pleaſure bleſs our dwellings, and we ſhould no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with pain behold the brow of our venerable father wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled by care, nor the eyes of our fond mother ſwell'd with weeping.</p>
               <p>Mahala, ſtill in tears, anſwer'd, This, this is alſo the ſubject of my inceſſant prayer. When the earth is cover'd with darkneſs, while all nature is huſh'd, I bewail in ſilence the harſh obduracy of my ſpouſe, and pray to the Lord to ſoften his heart. Sometimes the agony of my ſoul burſts forth, in ſpite of myſelf, in ſobs and groans. Then he awakes, and in a terrifying voice accuſes me of depriving him of ſleep, the only good he enjoys on this wretched earth, ſo ſeverely accurs'd by the Almighty Avenger of ſin. My deareſt ſiſter! this too is the employment of my mind, while my hands are buſy'd in domeſtic labour. My
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011667_0086_0F87CB0F24802D60"/>innocent children, playing round me, obſerve my tears and demand with infantine careſſes, why I weep? Ah Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za! Thirza! I am faded by grief, like a young flower, when the thick branches of ſome neighbouring tree intercept from it the ſun's all-chearing rays. My unhappy huſband, this very day, left our dwelling before the dawn. His looks were terrible. Never did I ſee ſo dark a gloom on his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Anger flaſh'd from his eyes: his brows were knit by rage. Froze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true, I have not loſt all hope; for ſometimes (and thou thyſelf haſt obſerved it) his virtue breaks through the gloom, and his mind is open to the ſoft ſenſations of ſocial love. Then he acknowledges that he has injur'd us, aſks forgiveneſs, and ſeeks recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. But alas! too ſoon the light withdraws: as in the tempeſtuous days of winter the ſun darts a chearing ray, and is inſtantly hid from our eyes by the cloſing clouds. Let us hope, Thirza, that as mild ſpring reſtores light and joy to all nature, ſo the heart of my unhappy huſband may be reſtor'd to light and peace. For this we will inceſſantly petition Heaven. I have always nouriſh'd this hope in the bottom of my heart.</p>
               <p>Thus ſpake Mahala, when Thirza, pale and trembling, cry'd, What mounful ſound is that, — it comes from yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trees—it is not the cry of pain—from yonder trees—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> my ſiſter!—Mahala!—alas! it comes nearer—O my God! —Thirza was now ſinking to the ground, but her alarm'd ſiſter ſupported her in her arms.</p>
               <p>Adam, with tottering ſteps, was coming from behind the trees, bending under the ſad load of his ſon's lifeleſs body. Eve walk'd by his ſide; ſometimes ſhe turn'd her face, fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grief, towards the bloody corpſe: then hid it under her hair, dropping with her tears.</p>
               <p>Thirza continued pale and motionleſs in the trembling arms of Mahala, who was herſelf ready to ſink under the weight of her ſhe endeavour'd to ſuſtain. Thus three ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able virgins (but none ever felt ſuch ſond affection) in a ſummer's eve walk hand in hand over the variegated fields. Sudden the thunders roars, the rapid lightening tears the earth under their ſeet: terrify'd they fall: but ſoon
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011667_0087_0F87CB12E8792138"/>recovering from their ſurprize, two of them riſe, the third a cinder. The ſurvivors are ſtruck with new horror, more dreadful than that caus'd by the thunder.</p>
               <p>This was the ſituation of the two daughters of Adam, when, a little recovering, they beheld the corpſe of him they lov'd. The afflicted father had laid it on the graſs, and was ſupporting in his arms his fainting wife, who, weaken'd by grief, was near falling to the earth. Where am I, cry'd Thirza. O my God! where am I?—How he lies!—Abel—Why did I awake? Hateful light!—Ah un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy that I am!—Mahala!—Ah me miſerable!—See, ſee, my ſiſter, he lies dead!—Sight horrible!—Light hateful! —Why did I awake?</p>
               <p>Thirza, cry'd Mahala, in a tremulous voice; let us not give way to vain terrors—to me—to me alſo the idea is dreadful as the forked lightning—Ah! ſhe again faints— Awake, Thirza—awake—Let us go to him. He is not dead: Thy voice, thine embraccs will rouze him from ſleep.</p>
               <p>After theſe words, the two ſiſters, leaning on each other, dragg'd their enfeebled limbs towards the body. Oh! my father, O my mother! how they weep!—What dreadful terrors ſeize me! cry'd Thirza, as ſhe approach'd near the corpſe. Abel!—Abel!—my beloved!—my joy!—my life! —my huſband!—awake. Ah unutterable wo! he wakes not!—Abel—hear my plaintive cries, the groans of thy diſtreſs'd wife!—She then caſt herſelf on the body, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it with extended arms: but at the ſight of the blood, and fatal wound, ſhe, giving a terrifying ſhriek, fell on the earth without voice, motion, or ſign of life; pale and cold as him ſhe mourn'd. Deſpair was ſeen in her open and fix'd eye. Near her ſat on the earth Mahala, diſſolv'd in tears; wringing her hands, ſhe ſometimes rais'd her weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes to Heaven; ſometimes ſhe fix'd them with eager at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on the bloody corpſe.</p>
               <p>Adam, whoſe deep grief was augmented by the ſorrows of his daughters, eſſay'd to conſole them: O my dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! O Thirza! O Mahala! ſaid he; would to God that my anguiſh could keep from pain the hearts of thoſe I love: but, my beloved, hear me; liſten to the ſoft ſounds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. While Eve and I were weeping over this dear bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, an angel, replete in beauty, came to us. He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011667_0088_0F87CB139CA54080"/>from the the Moſt High to ſooth our ſorrows. Weep not, ſaid he: be comforted. He whom you lament ſtill exiſts. He has only left this frail covering of duſt. Diſengag'd from a mortal body, his ſoul is more happy than ye can conceive, while your ſouls are envelopp'd in their earthly covering. Ye are not ſeparated for ever: in a little time ye ſhall be reunited, ye ſhall enjoy with him tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of delight, of which your groſs ſenſes can give you no idea. Let us not, my Thirza—let us not Mahala, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the funeral of the happy by our inconſolable lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—Let us not offend the Almighty by our diſpair.</p>
               <p>Thirza ſtill remain'd without ſenſe or motion, while the wife of Cain, elevated her join'd hands above her head, thus expreſs'd her grief, O my father, why do you blame our tears? Can we forbear to weep? Can we forbear to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while he lies before our eyes extended, cold, and dead? O thou, our conſolation! our joy!

What a ſweet relief would this remembrance have been to thy ſorrows! How would it have ſoften'd the grieſs of thy future days! But—O my mother!—what new wo makes thine eyes ſtream?—O my father! ſpeak— ſpeak, I conjure thee—Why this horror on thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?—No anſwer!—O my tortur'd heart!—Where— ſay where, O my father!—ſay O my mother! where is Cain my huſband?</p>

Eve reply'd, O my child! who knows where, purſu'd by divine vengeance—Ah my God!—the unhappy— but what do I ſay?—I tremble to ſpeak it—he—he—ah me, unhappy mother! Horrid—deteſtable ideas, tear not thus my wretched boſom! Ah miſerable parent that I am! why —he—Ah my mother! interrupted Mahala, ſpare me not, ſpare me not, I conjure thee, O my mother!

Her exceſſive grief then took from her the power of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Mahala was ſtruck mute with terror. Her immoveable eyes ſhed no tears. The cold ſweat trickled down her pale face, and her trembling lips were diſcolour'd. At length ſhe cry'd out in agony, He kill Abel!—Cain my huſband, kill his brother—Where art thou fratricide? where?— Where, oh where has thy guilt purſu'd thee? Has the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of God aveng'd thy brother?—Doſt thou ceaſe to exiſt?—Where art thou, moſt miſerable? To what country of deſpair art thou fled, follow'd by the curſe of God? Thus rav'd Mahala, tearing her hair.</p>
               <p>Barbarous fratricide! vile murderer! exclaim'd Thirza; how couldſt thou kill ſo kind a brother: who, doubtleſs, when expiring under the mortal blow, given by thy cruel hand, regarded thee with eyes full of love?—Ah Cain, curſt—curſt be—O my ſiſter! O Thirza! cry'd Mahala, interrupting her, curſe him not, he is thy brother?—he is my huſband? Rather let us implore for him the mercies of God. I am ſure, when falling in his blood, the holy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of his fury caſt on him an eye of compaſſion, and I doubt not but now intercedes for him before the eternal throne.

Ye ſhady bowers, ye are now deſolate, ye can now only inſpire me with terror: I ſhall think you aſk for him, who, in your ſweet retreats was wont to embrace me in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rapture. The murmuring fountains will enquire, what is become of my beloved; left forlorn, I can no more taſte of joy. The ſhades, the ſtreams, the hills, the plains alike to me are hateful. Alas! no more I ſee with fond delight, him that made all lovely. I ſhall, indeed, ſtill behold him; but oh, diſtreſſing object! I ſhall behold theſe wan cheeks, theſe fix'd and ſightleſs eyes, this clotted blood, this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wound. Flow, flow my tears, for ever flow on this pale face.

               <p>Thus lamented Thirza, while her tears ran on the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs body. Eve's grief was encreas'd by the ſorrows of her daughters.

It is carry'd up to Heaven, to dwell there with God and his angels, where it will be for ever happy. Then he will wake no more! reply'd Eliel burſting into tears: He will never awake!—never! He that lov'd us ſo dearly, and us'd to ſet us on his knee, and tell Joſiah and me ſuch fine

He will talk to us no more!—He will never, never wake! How our father will weep for him, when he comes from the field!—How pale! how frightful! The terrify'd children now hid their faces in the folds of their mother's veſtment.</p>
               <p>Adam having finiſh'd digging the grave. Wake thou, ſaid he to Thirza: wake my beloved. Let us obey the Divine command, and return the duſt to its mother Earth. Wake, my Thirza, he continu'd, and tenderly took her hand to raiſe her from the corpſe. She had been in a kind of trance on the body of her huſband, and now wak'd from the holy viſion. Yes, I have ſeen him!—I have ſeen him! ſhe cry'd as ſhe aroſe. He came to me ſhining in celeſtial luſtre. Weep not, he ſaid; weep not, my deareſt Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za! I am happy.

Let us, my beloved chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! adore the Moſt High before this grave of the firſt dead. They now all proſtrated themſelves before the grave, little Eliel and his brother kneeling on each ſide their mother, and the father of men pronounc'd in a loud voice this prayer, with his arms devoutly folded on his breaſt.</p>

               <p>Adam ceas'd to ſpeak; but continued in ſilent extaſy, proſtrate on the earth: his wife and daughters ſtill kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his ſide. Nature herſelf obſerv'd the ſame ſilence; all was ſerene; not a cloud paſs'd over them through the lucid ſky.</p>
               <p>Now came "on mild evening, clad in ſober gray," while every breeze was huſh'd. During this perfect calm, Cain, purſu'd by guilt, was agitated with fear, horror, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and ſad diſmay. He rov'd from place to place, he wander'd in the deſarts, till ſpent with fatigue, he ſat down facing the riſing moon, and thus the voice of his deſpair diſturb'd the peaceful ſilence that reign'd over all nature: There beyond that dark hill, the moon begins her courſe, ſpreading around a faint light. All under the ſtarry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe imbibe new life from invigorating ſleep; man only wakes. My accurſed hand has driven from his dwelling peace and reſt. The voice of grief and lamentation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends from the cottages. 'Tis I—'tis I, miſerable! that have brought affliction to their abodes. The cries, the groans of my bewailing parents riſe to Heaven as ſo many accuſations againſt me. This day—this accurſed day, hear it, O Moon! turn pare and hide thy beams: Hear it, ye Stars! and ſet in darkneſs: This day the earth has drank the blood of the firſt ſlain, ſhed by my unnatural hand. Henceforth with-hold from me your precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, bright luminaries! Curs'd on the ground I tread, baniſh'd from the chearful face of man. Hide me, hide me in gloomy darkneſs. I have ſhed my brother's blood: I have torn the heart of him that begat me: I have fill'd with deſpair the breaſt of her who brought me forth and nouriſh'd my infancy. Hide me from the eyes of Nature, I have trampled on her dictates. I will fly—fly with my miſery, ſad companion! to ſome deſart region, where no human foot has mark'd the faded graſs. I will dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong rocks and precipices, where putred water trickles in tears from the ſteeps, into the ſwampy abodes of loathſome reptiles: where birds of prey build their neſts; where ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage beaſts devour their bloody carnage: alas! even theſe will abhor me, they kill no brothers!

                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:011667_0096_0F87CB1EA73F5918"/>from the chearing ſky; ſhade me ſome horrid gloom, from the ſight of every creature: there let me lament my cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; there howl out my deſpair. When ſleep overcomes me, terrors will preſent themſelves to my imagination: I ſhall behold my murder'd brother: I ſhall ſee his wounded head—his clotted blood!</p>
               <p>Thus Cain bewail'd his wretchedneſs. He ceas'd, and ſat abandon'd to mute grief. No bird of night diſturb'd the awful ſtillneſs; frighted by ſounds of human wo, they fled in ſilence; a gentle murmur only floated through the air. Again he vents his ſorrow, and caſting his melancholy eyes around, he cries, Pity me, ye woods! Weep for me, ye fields! No words can deſcribe my miſery, and pity is due to miſery. O Nature, array'd in beauty! grieve for me— for me, loſt to beauty and to happineſs. Mourn for me each creature; ye taſte, ye feel the efficacious preſence of a Gracious God, to me no longer gracious! I feel his wrath, I tremble at his power. He is to me only God the Avenger, the juſt Avenger of my brother's blood. For ever will it cry againſt me: my puniſhment is endleſs.</p>
               <p>He was now ſilent for ſome moments, then, with a deep ſigh, he ſaid, I weep! Can ſuch a wretch as I ſhed tears! Welcome precious drops, ye atteſt to me, that my miſeries are ſoften'd. The deſpair which had ſeiz'd my ſoul, is chang'd to plaintive grief—to weeping ſorrow. Ah flow my tears! receive them, O earth! I am curſt on thy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, thou haſt drank my brother's blood, yet oh receive theſe tears that ſhew my unſpeakable diſtreſs!—What new emotions!—How is my heart ſoften'd!—My tears flow faſter—Yes, I will—Yes, while darkneſs hides me from every eye, I will away to the dwellings of my afflicted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to poor Thirza. I will go to all, and once more ſee them—once more bleſs them.—Bleſs them! the angry winds would diſperſe the ſalutations, as they came from my polluted lips. Ah fratricide! canſt thou pronounce a bleſſing, thyſelf accurs'd? I will however go and ſtrive to bleſs them in their grief. I will weep before them, and in the duſt deplore my guilt, and then—yes, then I fly for ever from their reproaching eyes. Fly from thee, Mahala! I fly for ever from my children! Here his agony ſtifled his
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:011667_0097_0F87CB1EE14866A8"/>words, and he mov'd towards the cottages, watering with his tears the ſolitary way.</p>
               <p>He was now paſſing a little grove, planted by the hand of Abel, near the ſpring. Cain then remember'd that his brother, when he had compleated his work, had ſaid with fond affection, Flouriſh ye trees! ſpread wide your branches! may ye for ever bloom, that under your refreſhing ſhade our deſcendants may, in affectionate converſe, relate to their offspring, what they will learn from us, ſaying, Here Eve brought forth her firſt-born. Here ſhe ſooth'd with her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes his infant cries, him the firſt ſolace in her ſad exile. Here ſhe view'd him with inexpreſſible rapture. She call'd him Cain, ſaying, from the hand of the Lord have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd thee. The murderer paſs'd by this monument of his brother's tenderneſs with quicken'd ſtep; a remorſeful ſweat cover'd his averted face: his trembling knees could ſcarce ſuſtain his weight. Thus at the ſight of his father's grave trembles the parricide, who with murtherous diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation had invited the good old man, returning from the field, to refreſh himſelf with impoiſon'd viands. When he paſſes the tomb, the ruſtling of the trees which ſurround it, the odours of the garlands, with which his dutious ſiſters have crown'd the urn, raiſe a ſtorm in his guilty heart.</p>
               <p>Now Cain had paſs'd the terrifying grove, and drew near the cottages. The pale moon ſhed on them a feeble light through the trees, and melancholy ſilence reign'd around. He caſt on the dwellings his weeping eyes; he rais'd his hands to heaven; he wrung them in ſpeechleſs agony. Conſcious guilt tore his now ſoften'd heart. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling he ſtood amidſt the dreary ſtillneſs. At length he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in a low voice this impaſſion'd ſoliloquy. How quiet deep affliction reſts here—Ah that murmur!—Are they not ſighs?—They came from the cottages—from the dwellings come thoſe piercing ejaculations of ſleepleſs grief! Here— here, ye once chearful manſions!—here trembling in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtands the wretch who has made you the abodes of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—Here purſu'd by infernal horrors, ſhudders in obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Then I go—Hail, hail ye—Ah wretch! wilt thou profane their ſacred names? Wilt thou pollute with thy infected breath, titles that expreſs the ſofteſt ties, the moſt exalted ſenſations of the human heart?

               <p>Cain having thus ſpoke, remain'd ſtill near the cottages. He groan'd, he rais'd his eyes to Heaven; when he heard the footſteps of one advancing flowly through the gloom. A cold ſhivering, like the agonies of death, ſeiz'd his limbs. He ſtrove to fly; but in vain he ſtrove; he ſunk down trembling, without ſtrength, among the buſhes.</p>
               <p>Thirza, this firſt night of her ſad widowhood, unable to ſleep, had quitted her lonely bed. She left her cottage, and went to the grave of her huſband, where ſeating her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the damp graſs, ſhe wept among the clods.

Alas! he knows not yet the woes of mortals—he knows not his own irreparable loſs! Ah my infant!
