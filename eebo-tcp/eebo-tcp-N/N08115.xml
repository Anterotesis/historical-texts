            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The conſummate work of providence, and the moral government of the world, are the ways in which the divine character is made manifeſt. But how little ſoever, the calm, uniform courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may affect the careleſs and inattentive; yet a ſeries of ſuch alarming events, as we ſee in theſe years, (the divine patronage of rights and liberty, together
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010354_0005_0F7EA23E6F48B898"/>
with the ſurpriſing ſteps by which this noble cauſe has been reſcued, even to this day,) ſtand as a convincing proof of the wiſdom and goodneſs of the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; which may well ſerve to fix the reſolution of every ſober mind, to truſt in the Lord of Hoſts;—well might David ſay, <q>The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice.</q> A ſacred regard to the Deity, with ſuch religious ſentiments, as reaſon aided by revelation will approve, cannot fail of producing the happieſt fruits in life, and laying a ſolid foundation for bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the future world.—How great is the folly of ſuch as ſay unto God, <q>Depart from us, for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the knowledge of thy ways?</q> Whether we conſider ourſelves as members of civil or religious ſocieties—religion, in its happy fruits, will effect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, good order and loyalty. Since we are called to act our part, in various characters and capacities in life; and pure benevolence (in which true virtue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts) muſt be the leading principle; what can better become us, or form a more laſting foundation for uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, than a diligent and faithful attendance on the duties of our calling?—<q>Wherein a man is called, therein let him abide faithfully with God.</q> A due attendance on perſonal duties, muſt render men zealous worſhippers of God, and followers of the lamb; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dignified or depreſſed among men. And the like attention to relative duties, muſt exemplify juſtice, temperance, chaſtity, benevolence, and every ſocial vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:—How would ſuch a lovely conduct, garniſh the body politick, adorn every ſociety, and happify the humane race? The apoſtle directs to the like conduct,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010354_0006_0F7EA23EF7B86780"/>
Rom. 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether propheſy, let us propheſy according to the proportion of faith, or miniſtry, let us wait on our miniſtring; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that ſheweth mercy, with chearfulneſs.</hi> And ſince no gifts are granted, no talents betruſted with us, but what are deſigned for improvement, to good and valuable purpoſes; care muſt be exerciſed, that none be neglected or baſely perverted.—In order to which, it ſeems needful that men well underſtand the duty of their reſpective relations, — the nature and extent of the offices and capacities they ſuſtain,— leaſt ſome precious talent be neglected, or fair opportunity of doing good be left unimproved; or our brother's province be treſpaſſed upon. Irregular and inordinate ſelf-love, and private intereſt, have ſo much the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the heart, and ſo various is the taſte and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of men, that unleſs true benevolence, and public ſpirit prevent, there is eminent danger that private intereſt will be purſued, at the expence, or built on the ruins of the public weal. It well becomes members of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities to remember, that then do they beſt ſerve their own intereſt, when in proper ways they befriend the public good. But among proud, depraved, apoſtate creatures, what happy expedient can be found, to bring this to paſs? We enjoy all the glorious privileges of the goſpel of Chriſt; and all imaginable civil privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; the freeſt ſtate, and happieſt conſtitution; (which heaven grant to the laſt poſterity:) Yet all prove
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010354_0007_0F7EA23F68AEB410"/>
ineffectual to thoſe glorious purpoſes.— Alas! how is the goſpel abuſed! the civil ſword deſpiſed; our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and privileges perverted; our public weal ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red, and God provoked to jealouſy? Hence public calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and waſting judgments are threatned. Can there be a ſafe refuge, a ſovereign remedy preſcribed? I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, men who will act the moſt friendly part to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or the public, will gladly embrace it.</p>
            <p>Now this is preſented in the words to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>IN which the pious prince perſonates wiſdom.—By which (he being his own expoſitor) we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wiſdom.</p>
            <p>WISDOM here may be taken for Chriſt, who is the wiſdom of God, and the power of God, crying aloud to man, by the prophets, and apoſtles, his word, and providence. Or it may be taken for the benefits of his purchaſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which in a word, implies the being, and happy fruits of true religion. Now this is recommended to us, by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious qualities, enriching tendency, and happifying fruits. For by me kings reign, and princes decree juſtice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the Earth. Riches and honour are with me, yea durable riches and righteouſneſs: My fruit is better than gold, and my revenue than choice ſilver. Worthy of the higheſt eſteem, of the moſt honourable, while the meaneſt peaſant is bid welcome to intimacy with it.</p>
            <p>HENCE agreeable to the words of Solomon, and this ſolemn occaſion; I ſhall attempt to exhibit to view, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010354_0008_0F7EA240231A5BD0"/>
excellent nature, the happy tendency, <hi>and lovely fruits, of true religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY cauſe is beſt known by its effects: the tree by its fruits; and the excellent nature and tendency of true religion, by its revenues. Now theſe are more precious than gold; yea than much fine gold. True wiſdom muſt be moſt excellent and enriching, which produceth ſuch fruits, and entitles to ſuch revenues. It betrays a degenerate ſoul, ignorant both of the ſcripture and the power of God, to place it in the products of nature, or empty imagination, dry jejune external morality, or in an empty profeſſion, crying Lord, Lord, or yet in a firm perſwaſion, and ſelf-exalting confidence, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is our own. The efforts of nature (depraved as it is) can never produce this pearl of great price. Shall we (while we can exerciſe reaſon, or ſee by the light of revelation) ever be induced to believe, that the heaven-born ſoul, who is taught of God, and formed after the divine image, and made an heir of God, and joint-heir with Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall in no reſpects excel <hi>Seneca,</hi> or ſurpaſs the grovelling low-lifed phariſee? God forbid that the glorious goſpel of grace ſhould be perverted, and proſtituted to the vileſt purpoſes! even to elate the pride of the heart, magnify ſelf-ſufficiency, and diſhonour the divine Redeemer.</p>
            <p>THE religion of the goſpel, the wiſdom which is true and genuine, ſhall be recommended; not by the needleſs uſe of panegyricks and high encomiums; but merely by expoſing its native beauties, and attractive charms. It is well known, by all acquainted with it, to be of a divine nature, and original, conſiſting in a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010354_0009_0F7EA2422C569DD0"/>
real efflux, and communication from God; forming a new and divine nature and principle of life, in the ſoul; conforming the mind, as to its temper, ends and intereſt, to the moral image of God. It conſiſts in undefiling and purifying the heart: undoing what ſin has done: ſo that we come to have the ſame mind in us which was alſo in Jeſus Chriſt. In the truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul, the divine Spirit not only acts upon, or in an ineffable manner influences, but communicates of his own nature, to the ſoul; ſo that we are made partakers of his holineſs.—Which ſummarily conſiſts in benevolence:—a new ſpiritual ſenſe and taſte is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſoul, which lays a happy foundation for real delight, true and ſubſtantial pleaſure; in pleaſing God, and communing with him. Pride, luſts, and impure deſires, are all mortified; the ſoul commenceth new life, acts from a new nature, from new motives, and to new ends. In a word, the ſoul is (to uſe the apoſtle's words) created a new in Chriſt Jeſus: all old things are done away; all things are become new. The ſame faculties phyſically conſidered remain, but are morally changed. By which means the right object of full contentment, is found: in which the ſoul centers, the will fixes, and the affections terminate; for which I appeal to the ſacred volume, Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon the earth I deſire beſide thee.—Except ye are led by the Spirit of Chriſt, ye are none of his.</hi> Hereby the ſoul is raiſed to its proper dignity, employed in its proper exerciſe, and ſatisfied with its proper object. So Chriſt intimates to the woman of Samaria. <hi>He that drinketh of the water I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010354_0010_0F7EA242EBC9AFB0"/>
BUT peradventure it would be more agreeable, to dwell upon the bleſſed tendency, and happy fruits of real grace. But however pleaſing the attempt may be, it openeth ſo large a field, I may take but a partial ſurvey. Here it maybe obſerved; that if divine grace conforms the ſoul to God, and ſubdues whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the divine will, the conſequence will be, whatever the ſoul finds to be the divine pleaſure, (ſo far as it is of a gracious taſte) it ſtands ready, in a free, voluntary manner, to comport with, in practice; from the tendency of a divine principle. No longer is it led by a ſervile mercenary ſpirit: neither by ſlaviſh fears of penal evil, or hopes of honour among men: not the force of law, ſo much as divine love, inclines the heart to obedience. True religion effects a lovely har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, between diſpoſition and duty. <q>If ye love me keep my commandments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MEN may abound in external duty, and remain utter ſtrangers to the ſpirit of true obedience. If there be no divine principle there can be no divine fruits. But to the happy men, who are replenished with true wiſdom; the ways of wiſdom are ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all her paths are peace. This lays a happy foundation for undiſturbed peace; it calms every riſing ſtorm. Great peace have thoſe who love thy law: it admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſoul-ſupporting cordials in days of adverſity.—When we are fed with its bread, and the waters of affliction are wrung out to us: do we ſee dark and threatning ſtorms ariſe; are we threatned with the loſs of liberty, with ſervitude, vaſſallage and ſlavery? is the rod of oppreſſion ready to fall upon us, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010354_0011_0F7EA2434D11B018"/>
are we alarm'd with fears of evil, more to be dreaded than death? are our beſt days placed behind us, that we muſt look back to behold them? ah, lamentable ſtate! the bitter fruit of our own folly.</p>
            <p>BUT is there no ſoothing conſideration? is there no balm in Gilead?—The holy ſoul, directed by heavenly wiſdom, may take ſanctuary in God; abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty. Yea dwell in the ſecret place of the moſt high; where no ſtorms can approach us, or ſorrows over-whelm us:—Or while the holy ſoul ſurveys Zion's troubles, and beholds her whom he can never forget, all clad in ſable attire, as wounded, proſtrate on the earth, complaining that iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxes cold: that the body of Chriſt is rent, the church divided and diſturbed, and the miniſtration of the word and ordinances of God blaſted; the dues of heaven witholden, and profanity abounding; yea the awful declenſion and apoſtacy of the times; what an aſtoniſhing change in the ſtate of religious affairs within a quarter of a century? Here indeed the good man will drop a tear, and ſigh bitterly. But yet it comforts his heart that the Lord reigns, who is his rock and fortreſs; that he purſueth the wiſeſt plan, and will yet comfort Zion, and bring light out of darkneſs, and direct every event to accompliſh the benevolent purpoſes of his heart.</p>
            <p>DIVINE grace makes the ſoul patient in tribulation, humble in proſperity, and fruitful in every good work; prepares it for death, and brings it finally to glory.</p>
            <p>How happy a man is the ſincere chriſtian, whoſe character implies every perſonal, ſocial, and religious
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010354_0012_0F7EA243F9DA3DE0"/>
worth? For whatſoever things are pure, lovely, or of good report, all are included in that grand and noble aggregate, The real chriſtian! Let us all learn to make a ſacrifice of every wiſh, when it RUNS COUNTER TO THE DIVINE PLEASURE.</p>
            <p>BUT we may further purſue the pleaſing proſpect, while we conſider the happy tendency of vital piety, to heal the maladies, and rectify the diſorders of the church of Chriſt, in its preſent militant ſtate.</p>
            <p>As religious ſocieties, bound in covenant to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and walk with God, our firſt and prime concern is with religion: that we pay our vows, and carefully imitate the example of Chriſt: that we love God, in a diſintereſted and ſuperlative manner, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelves: and thus to do, is but to yield to, and follow the dictates of true wiſdom.</p>
            <p>BROTHERLY love is ſo eſſential to the character of a real diſciple of Chriſt, that the apoſtle ſaith, it was needleſs for him to write to the church about it; for ye are taught of God to love one another. How would this beautify the church; heal all our diviſions; cool the heats, and calm the tempers of bigotted zealots; whoſe zeal is heat, without light; a flow of paſſions, without the light of reaſon or revelation to direct them? Had wiſdom its proper aſcendency, how would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ceaſe, and profeſſors appear more ſolicitous to ſee that they are ſound in the faith, than to prove their brother heterodox, or blaſt their neighbour's character.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, let us attend to the fruit of wiſdom, as it tends to happify the civil ſtate. I am far from beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eving
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010354_0013_0F7EA244C4F8EF18"/>
that dominion is founded in grace, that the fear of the Lord intitles men to right, and authority to rule: though its fruits are more precious than gold, and its revenues than choice ſilver, civil power over the bodies and properties of men is never to be reckoned among them.</p>
            <p>DOMINION, or right to rule, is evidently founded neither in nature or grace, but compact, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: antecedent whereto, one has no better right to rule than another. He that is born of God, is become ſubject to the King of kings: but has never the more power over his fellow creatures. Chriſt tells us, his kingdom is not of this world. Though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace is an excellent qualification in him that rules, it is not that in which right to rule is founded. Property is founded in nature: what is my property can never be the property of another man, ſo long as it remains mine. None can have right to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of another's property, but by merit or compact, and when in either of theſe methods, what was one man's property becomes another's due, it ceaſeth to be his, and becomes the property of another. When we conſider our ſelve as confederate ſociety, ſo much of perſonal property as is neceſſary for the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the community, becomes due to the public, and ſuch as are intereſted with the public weal, have right to demand the public dues; and no man is impoveriſhed or injured by it: but then this muſt be done agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the general rules by which the ſociety or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity is conſtituted, and its conveniency and real good is ſecured: otherwiſe the conſtitution is violated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:010354_0014_0F7EA2456AEB07B0"/>
—But who ſhall judge in the caſe, or whether perſons are holden to obey, when the caſe is apparent, I refer to ſtate politicians to determine. But thus far I may venture to ſay, That no man ought to conſider himſelf holden by confederation, to diſburſt property to the known injury of the public, or the ſubverſion of the conſtitution: and whenever demands are made under ſuch circumſtances, (which God grant may never be, till the ſun become black as ſackcloth, and the moon as blood) let ſuch as love ſlavery, hate the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and delight in public ruin, plead for the doctrine of paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance. What are the rules and maxims of the Engliſh free government, the contents of magna charta, the ſpecial grants in colony charters, together with what meaſures of adminiſtration are inconſiſtent and ſubverſive, has been repeatedly diſcuſſed in a public way.</p>
            <p>MEN are naturally inclined to form themſelves into ſociety, and very great are the benefits of ſo doing: without which, neither life or property would be ſafe. He who ſhares in the benefits of civil ſociety and government, is confederate, and bound to obey authority. And the authority of God takes place, and good conſcience require us to keep the peace, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to proper authority, ſo long as the deſign of government is inviolate. Rulers are miniſters of God, for good: He that reſiſteth the power, reſiſts the ordinance of God. And thus viewing the caſe, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has much to do with the civil ſtate; and is neceſſary to its well being. And accordingly the goſpel injoins upon us obedience to the civil magiſtrate, and exhibits
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010354_0015_0F7EA2463112B2C8"/>
the true motives thereto. Hiſtory informs us, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſtates have found a neceſſity to uſe the religious doctrine of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhment: though they (as modern free-thinkers ſuggeſt of the chriſtian magiſtrate) uſed it only as ſtate policy. Perhaps there never was a ſtate managed with decorum without it; unleſs a mere theocracy: and perhaps this exception is needleſs: ſuch dominion has ſin in the heart; and ſuch is the power of pride, and the impetuoſity of luſts, and ſo are men in love with ſupremacy, that had they nothing to fear but whips, fines, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would not by theſe be reſtrained from atrocious and horrid outrage: of this we can no longer doubt, who ſee what blackened, inhumane deeds are committed among us, who enjoy both the goſpel of Chriſt, a chriſtian magiſtracy, and the greateſt civil privileges, and the beſt body of laws. If there be not ſomething internal, all external meaſures will prove ineffectual.</p>
            <p>BUT may I hope for your patience, while we further view the bleſſed tendency of vital piety to happify the civil ſtate? in that it would directly tend to curtail and moderate the abounding extravagancy of the preſent age. Whatever is expended, not for decency, health, or duty, but to gratify pride, and a modiſh taſte, ſerves to impoveriſh the ſtate, to beggar families, and multiply bankrupts, and numberleſs needleſs law-ſuits, with all the train of evils that follow. Now had men the ſame mind which was in Chriſt, all thoſe evils would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and virtue, induſtry, frugality, and temperance take place. Godlineſs with contentment is the greateſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010354_0016_0F7EA246E41BCE10"/>
gain. But to proceed to matters or awful importance; true wiſdom in its fruits, and happy tendency, would either prevent all occaſion of complaints, or compoſe the minds, and calm the tempers of murmuring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers, and malecontents, in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>As there is lamentable evidence, by facts, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that in the beſt regulations and mildeſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unreaſonable men will take occaſion to complain without cauſe; ſo it had been happy had there never been real occaſion, and moving cauſe of complaint, and bitter grievance. But whether with or without cauſe, there has been almoſt inceſſant complaints in ſucceſſion. I will go no further back than the times of general complaints, of a ſinking, depreciating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of trade; which are too recent to be forgotten. And no ſooner were theſe abated, but the calamities of a bloody ſcene took place; whereby our treaſures were exhauſted, taxes run high, and numberleſs lives loſt, and the morals of the youth ſorely corrupted. And when this ſtorm abated, we were ready to promiſe our ſelves a golden aera; when peace, plenty, and tranquility would ſucceed. And conſidering the glorious ſucceſs of the Britiſh and American arms, how the enemy were vanquiſhed by ſea and land; and what advantages providence placed in the hands of Great Britain, to diſenable an invidious ſoe to afford future trouble, with at leaſt a colour of reaſon, we promiſed our ſelves that our land ſhould yet be Emanuel's; and remain an aſylum for the oppreſt; a land of peace and tranquility. But alas! the uncertainty of humane affairs, the weakneſs of humane proſpects! the event
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010354_0017_0F7EA247C6066B60"/>
has prov'd the reverſe. When our expectations were, raiſed to the higheſt pitch; the Britiſh and American glory at the ſummit: What is become of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, ſo lately in the nation's hands? Ah, where is our peace and tranquility? a ſinking medium was never more loudly complained of, than its ſcarcity is now. And to add to our diſtreſs, trade, the only reſource in ſuch caſe, incumbered, and in great meaſure ruined. And unpayable duties enacted: and liberty, darling liberty, and ineſtimable privileges, which theſe ſelf-ſettled colonies, (it is ſaid) referved, as a condition of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Britiſh crown, and hold as ſacred, and for which our pious anceſtors left their native foil, and to tranſmit which to poſterity, ſuffered hardſhip, poverty and death; liberty, for which we have warred, and ſuffered the loſs of blood and treaſure. Hope in theſe days, appeared on the wing, ready to bid adieu, and leave us in thraldom, poverty and bondage. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in fix troubles and ſeven, we have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but now, good God! whither ſhall we turn? to whom ſhall we look? Can we ſtand as diſintereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpectators, and ſee the ruin of our country? without a tear, without a dying ſtruggle: If I am I unable to govern the tender paſſion, let the nature of the caſe apologize. Can any born among us, nouriſhed and careſſed in a free air, put to an impious hand to urge on ruin? and can ſuch be owned a friend to his country, or to filthy lucre only? with whom juſtice permits me to rank, ſuch as croſs the atlantic, to import epiſcopal tyranny, and ſuch ſuperſtition, as our predeceſſors fled hither to eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010354_0018_0F7EA248625A99F8"/>Now in all our complaints and remonſtrances (I am ſorry to have occaſion to ſay it) I am fearful we have not been directed by wiſdom, nor attended to the true cauſe: but rather overlook'd the main point. There has been very grievous complaints, of oppreſſion, tyranny, and corrupt and deſigning miniſtry: And of home bred abettors of tyranny, and well wiſhers to the late regulations. But however juſt this may be, are we not reproved as Job was, in thoſe words. <hi>They cry out by reaſon of oppreſſion, but none ſaith, where is God my maker who giveth ſongs in the night.</hi> Though we have ſeen much, have we ſeen enough in the caſe? Who is the moral governor of the world? Is there not a cauſe? Is there any evil in the city, which the Lord has not done? Have we been ſuitably humble under frowns, deeply ſenſible of our ſin, and contempt of goſpel grace, and kiſſed the ſon leſt he be angry, and put on ſackcloth? judged, and condemned ourſelves?—for verily it is our iniquities, which have ſeparated us from God, and the ſmiles of his providence. Methinks at leaſt we might have as good a degree of ſenſibility, as Saul had, after God had rejected him, who could ſay, I have ſinned, and done fooliſhly.—When the king of Babylon plundered the city and temple of Jeruſalem, and captivated the people of God, God uſed him as his rod, to puniſh the ſins of Iſrael. Now how pitiful had been the caſe, if Iſrael had attended to nothing in their troubles, but the pride and tyranny of their conqueror? and how lamentable is our ſtate, if we ſee not the rod, nor the hand that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010354_0019_0F7EA24B01682B20"/>
it.—Now had we been wiſe, we had either never provoked God to ſuch uſe of ſeverity: or have conducted quite differently under it: and learnt more ſenſibly, how evil and bitter a thing it is to ſin againſt God. Yea we might take ſanctuary in God. Such people are prepared for every event. All ſhall work for the good of ſuch. Whatever difficulties attend church or ſtate, people of this character may rejoice that God reigns, and will defend Zion, and plead her cauſe.</p>
            <p>BUT having tried your patience ſo long already, I will mention that one more of the glorious fruits of true wiſdom, viz. It will ſpirit rulers to faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not only in making good and wholſome laws, but alſo in nominating faithful men to execute them. The moſt elaborate, ſalutary body of laws, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver avail to the health and welfare of the ſtate, unleſs they are properly executed. And there is little hope of this, unleſs it be committed to faithful men.
GOOD rulers, who fear God, will attempt to effect God's deſign in their preferment: which the divine oracle informs us, is the good of the people: They are miniſters of God for good. And from the ſame principle people will lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty. Where people are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary in doing well, coercive meaſures are needleſs. True religion will give rulers pleaſure in gently holding the reins of government: and diſpoſe people to practice holineſs in the fear of God, <q>Godlineſs with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, is great gain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010354_0020_0F7EA24BC304C038"/>THUS we have taken a ſummary imperfect account of the excellent nature, and inriching revenues, of true wiſdom. And omitting all practical inferences, I may add nothing more, but only in few words to addreſs myſelf, with all humility, to his honour the governor, the deputy-governor, and the honorable general aſſembly.</p>
            <p>MAY it pleaſe your honours, and you honorable gentlemen, in ordinary circumſtances, to dictate or preſcribe to your ſagacious minds, might excite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of too great a degree of aſſurance: But ſince in preſent circumſtances, an attempt of ſuch a nature is an act obedience; I have the more reaſon to hope you will ſuffer me to intimate a few things.</p>
            <p>IT is with the utmoſt propriety, that the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs of this day be opened with a ſolemn act of divine worſhip. From whence can the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician go, to the arduous affairs of government, which beſure in the preſent day of tumult requireth cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deliberation, and ſacred regard to the deity, better than from the houſe of God, where we have not only ſupplicated for mercy, but had the nature of true religion opened, and the fruits of wiſdom exhibited to view? How happy for the ſoul replen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with it, and how bleſſed in its tendency rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>SINCE it has pleaſed the wiſe governor of the world, in the courſe of providence, to raiſe you to eminent honour, dignity, and influence, and committed to you the public weal, no doubt but in ordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010354_0021_0F7EA24C2D120278"/>of affairs, and peculiarly in preſent ſituation, wiſdom will be of excellent ſervice to you. I need not intimate your mortality, that you muſt die like other men: that your honour and dignity will prove no ſecurity to you: The time is approaching, when your honour muſt be covered in duſt, and your ſituation be on a level with the meaneſt peaſant. The ſevere and awful frown of heaven upon the nation and land, in the removal of the duke of Cumberland, an amiable prince; a father to the poor; auſpicious to Engliſh liberty, and a faſt friend to the good of the colonies: together with the death of prince Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick William, a lovely member of the royal family, of late has cloathed multitudes in ſable attire; and may well remind all, what will be the ſtate of the fabrick when the pillars are removed. Theſe, together with a recent inſtance of mortality, in one of your number, a uſeful member of the honorable council, no doubt has ſenſibly reminded your honours of your own mortality.</p>
            <p>SUFFER me then to recommend it to your honours, and you honorable gentlemen, to maintain an intimate acquaintance with true wiſdom, as what will not only qualify for, and aſſiſt in government, but alſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter peace in the important hour of death. And as far as poſſible, patroniſe and countenance wiſdom and virtue in the people governed by your laws, as nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing fathers to the church of Chriſt. Though civil laws are not means calculated to make men gracious, yet religion may be owned and encouraged by the civil magiſtrate; both by your example, and the proper exertion of authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:010354_0022_0F7EA24CF6966550"/>I SHALL not trouble your honours, by urging any alteration of, or addition to the religious conſtitution of the colony. We have not a wiſh, that men may be compelled by law, to ſupport a religion from which they ſoberly diſſent. The act of toleration is to the honour of the nation. If diſſenters here would impoſe ſuch taxes on ſuch as ſoberly diſſent from us, they forget their brethren at home; and the apoſtle's juſt remark—<hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O man, for thou who judgeth doſt the ſame things.</hi>—</p>
            <p>BUT though I have not the vanity to preſcribe laws, or teach your honours the art of ruling, yet we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreat the utmoſt exertion of your wiſdom, to protect and prolong our tranquility; our civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberties, privileges and conſtitution: And that the ſeminary of learning, ſo much the glory of the colony, may be ſupported, and continue the ſubject of your patriotick care.—That peculiar care may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the appointment of executive authority: in order that we may be governed by your laws. And we hope that in this day of tryal and exerciſe, the uſual chambering and wantonneſs, in the view of the honorable aſſembly, may no more give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to, or patronize the like miſuſe of time and treaſures, in any part of the colony.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, may heaven grant, whoever ſhall fill the chair, or aſſiſt in council, may have an heart truly wiſe, be cordial friends to <hi>Chriſt and his church, and patriots to the republick.</hi>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:010354_0023_0F7EA24DBA3411F8"/>REVEREND fathers, and dear brethren;</p>
            <p>THE imperfect account we have heard of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine nature and happy fruits of wiſdom, may ſerve to bring to mind, in a ſenſible and affecting manner, the great honour which the glorious head of the church has conferred upon us, in the bleſſed office and employment he has aſſigned to us; even to open to view the nature of religion, and by every proper motive, to perſwade men to be wiſe; knowing the terrors of the Lord, we perſwade men. The deſign of our ſacred office is of ſuch vaſt importance, and ſo directly tends to do honour to Chriſt, to happify men, to build up Zion, and do good to the civil ſtate; wherein we have ſo glorious an opportunity to do good in an extenſive way, that we may think our ſelves happy in the utmoſt exertion of our powers, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our talents in ſo noble a cauſe, whatever we ſuffer therein.</p>
            <p>WHILE with a juſt and becoming ſenſe of the worth of immortal ſouls, the importance of eternal life, the glorious fulneſs and ſufficiency of Chriſt, and the perillous ſtate of the irregenerate; we account not even our life dear to us, but willingly ſpend, and be ſpent, in imitation of the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, who laboured, ſtriving according to the power of God, which wrought in him mightily.</p>
            <p>I CAN ſenſibly ſympathiſe with you, in the tryals which are common to our calling and character: but the memorable words of Chriſt, may well quiet every impatient frame, <q>it is ſufficient for the diſciple to be as his lord.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:010354_0024_0F7EA24E6EB6ADE0"/>PERHAPS we never ſaw the day in which there was a louder call to painful exertion, to be prudent, wiſe, ſteady, reſolute, and zealous, in preaching (not ourſelves, but) Chriſt Jeſus the Lord. The enemies of religion abound, and the love of many waxes cold. May the Lord direct us, and divine grace ſupport us, for we are ſent as ſheep among wolves. But lo, ſaith Chriſt, I am with you to the end of the world.—If we may be ſo happy as to confront and confute the prevailing hereſy of the day; and make a noble ſtand againſt error; convince gain-ſayers, alarm the ſecure, edify, comfort, and feed the ſheep of Chriſt's fold, we ſhall have the pleaſure and honour to pleaſe God, advance the Redeemer's kingdom, and of doing the moſt important ſervice to the civil ſtate. And I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we ſhall act but a decent part, in leading our reſpective congregations, in aſcribing glory to God, that our civil and religious liberties and privileges have been ſo long continued; and that there is any grounds to hope for future enjoyment: for as cold water is to the thirſty ſoul, ſo is good news from a far country.<note n="*" place="bottom">As we have had general intelligence, by private letters from merchants in London, of a new turn of affairs in parliament, in favor to the colonies, through the influence of merchant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>GENTLEMEN and BRETHREN,</p>

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010354_0025_0F7EA24F236270F0"/>to you an ardent, painful purſuit after true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. You have heard ſomething of its nature, and glorious fruits, more precious than gold, yea than much fine gold: it is a bleſſing of great importance in ſuch a day as this; men greedy of gain, will do wiſely to ſeek it in this way: never was wiſdom more needed than in our day, whether it be underſtood in a theological, philoſophical, or political ſenſe:—this will enable us either to eſcape calamities, or to be patient under them, and make the beſt improvement of them.</p>
            <p>PEOPLE who have no other pilot but intereſt, fancy, and humor, while they are croſs'd in their deſigns, and preſs'd with perplexing difficulties; while all their attention is engaged to eſcape Scilla, are in danger of falling into Charibdis. Suffer me then to urge it upon every age, ſex, and denomination to make religion your firſt and great care.—There are many moving things which urge it upon us: The honour of the Deity; the ſoul's peace and ſafety; the harmony and good order of the church; the honour, peace and harmony of the civil community; all call upon us to ſearch for wiſdom as for hidden treaſure. That we improve a golden ſeaſon, while our liberty and privileges are enjoyed, and divine patience is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, leaſt (while with Agag we promiſe our ſelves that the bitterneſs of death is paſt) we ſo abuſe our liberties, and the divine benignity, as to occaſion diſtreſſes which we can neither eſcape nor endure: and we mourn at laſt, when our fleſh and our body are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and ſay, How have we hated inſtruction.

            </p>
            <p>BUT the ſingular circumſtances of the preſent day will juſtify me in obſerving to you, that the honour and authority of the King, Lords, and Commons, muſt be upheld by all lawful means. Let our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of property and privileges be all improved to the ſame glorious purpoſe, for which our anceſtors took poſſeſſion here, by purchaſe or conqueſt: and if our liberties may be enjoyed, let no man abuſe them; if they ſhould be threatned, may heavenly wiſdom direct us to the moſt juſtifiable methods to vindicate them.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, may we walk in wiſdom's ways, for they are pleaſant, and all her paths are peace.</p>
