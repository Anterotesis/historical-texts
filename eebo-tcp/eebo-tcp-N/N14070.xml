            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ſtory with which the text is connected, is one of the moſt affecting tales to be found on ſacred record. Taken in all its circumſtances, it is beyond a parallel. It contains ſuch a number of ſurpriſing incidents, and all, at laſt, ſo overruled by the providence of God, for the good of the eaſtern world, that it is not only one of the moſt <hi>entertaining,</hi> but alſo the moſt <hi>inſtructive</hi> pieces of hiſtory. It gives an <hi>illuſtrious character</hi> to Jehovah, as a being of <hi>ſuch</hi> ſublime perfections, that the moſt unpromiſing events are, by him, made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his own glory, and the good of his people. It teaches the malignancy of the paſſions of envy and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017807_0004_0FA31A36C58698B8"/>
hatred on the one hand, and the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>natural affection</hi> on the other; and when theſe are ſet in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt,</hi> as in the caſe of Joſeph and his brethren; when the events are <hi>ſo</hi> unexpected, <hi>ſo</hi> intereſting, and at laſt terminate <hi>ſo well,</hi> the ſtory becomes <hi>too</hi> impaſſioned to be read with ſtoical <hi>inſenſibility.</hi> A man of <hi>ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and of <hi>piety</hi> can never read it with an <hi>unaffected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From theſe ſuſpicions they ſent meſſengers to him, informing that it was the dying injunction of their common parent, that they ſhould confeſs their fault, and aſk forgiveneſs; hoping from the benignity of his diſpoſition, that he would in conſequence thereof, reſtore them to his favor.— They were not miſtaken. The injured brother, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways generous, humane and god-like, moſt heartily forgave them, aſſigning this particular reaſon for his conduct, "you thought evil againſt me, but God meant it for good," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The occurrence to which my text alludes, has a near affinity, in its origin and final iſſue, to the tragical event, which eight years ago took place in <hi>this</hi> town, deſtined, by divine providence, to be the ſtage on which a moſt <hi>memorable</hi> ſcene was acted. The inſtances are not, indeed, in all reſpects, parallel; and who could expect to find, even in the bible, that copious book, an inſtance exactly ſimilar to <hi>that</hi> which <hi>then</hi> happened in <hi>this place</hi>; which uſhered in the <hi>American</hi> war, and gave riſe to this anniverſary, which

            <p>Were we to trace the ſimilitude, it would be no difficult matter to point out a ſtriking <hi>one</hi> in <hi>ſeveral</hi> particulars, though not in <hi>all.</hi> It muſt be confeſſed there are ſome diſcrepant circumſtances. Thus, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle family was concerned in the baniſhment of Joſeph; whereas, a whole nation meditated the ſubjugation or ruin of the American States.</p>
            <p>In the caſe of Joſeph no murder was committed, though originally intended; but murder has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated <hi>here,</hi> with every circumſtance of cruel barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.—In theſe two inſtances they differ, but agree in many others.</p>
            <p>Joſeph's brethren through fear of his future exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aggrandiſement, firſt intended to murder, and afterwards ſold him into Egypt. Envy was the moving cauſe. And what greatly different excited the Britiſh king and his parliament to meditate and ſtir up againſt us, a ſevere civil war of near eight years conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance?
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017807_0006_0FA31A3842FF26A0"/>
They were jealous we ſhould one day revolt, become independent ſtates, and riſe to liberties ſuperior to their own.</p>
            <p>The elder brethren of the family meditated <hi>his</hi> ruin; and who but <hi>our</hi> elder brethren attempted to deſpoil us of our liberties, and reduce us to a ſtate of vaſſalage? Again, Jacob's ſons advanced Joſeph to <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>diſtinction,</hi> by the very means they made uſe of, to <hi>humble, depreſs</hi> or <hi>deſtroy</hi> him. So in the preſent caſe, the meaſures made uſe of by <hi>Britain</hi> to enſlave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this country, have accelerated their <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, ſovereignty</hi> and <hi>honor.</hi> Farther, as the great Jehovah overruled the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>envy</hi> of <hi>Joſeph's</hi> brethren for the good of the whole family and Jewiſh nation; ſo the <hi>unprecedented maſſacre</hi> of <hi>this day,</hi> and the ſubſequent ravages of the Britiſh troops, through the country, though "meant by them for evil, yet the great Jehovah has overruled for good," not only to <hi>this</hi> and the United States of America, but alſo to <hi>ſome other kingdoms</hi> of the world! And may I not add, that ſince the cauſes were ſo ſimilar, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects alſo, <hi>we</hi> in this country ought to reſolve as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph did, not <hi>ſo</hi> to remember the injury done and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, as to ill treat or forbear acts of kindneſs to the people of Britain; from whom our anceſtors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, to whom we are conſequently related, and with whom we ſymbolize in <hi>religion, language</hi> and <hi>laws.</hi>

But is it not contrary to the true meaning of Scripture, and the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to aſſert that he is the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of ſin, and that he influences men to commit it, in order to effect his deſigns? There is no need of this; for if good <hi>muſt</hi> be brought about by the wickedneſs of men,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017807_0008_0FA31A39C326F220"/>
there is forever a ſufficient number of moral, free agents, who, prompted by the devil, and their own hearts luſts, are ready to do that, which under the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending providence of God, is overruled and finally terminates, either to the <hi>general good</hi> of the ſyſtem, or to a <hi>particular</hi> part of it.</p>
            <p>The brethren of Joſeph, filled with envy and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could not brook his dreams, nor bear his party-colour'd coat; and therefore conceived a deſign to murder, or ſome way get rid of him: But the great GOD, <hi>known unto whom are all his works, from the beginning of the world; whoſe counſel ſhall ſtand, and who will do all his pleaſure,</hi> made theſe ſame paſſions ſubſervient to his particular purpoſe. <hi>They</hi> intended to gratify their malice, but <hi>He</hi> to indulge his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs philanthropy and benevolence. Now I would aſk. Is there not a mighty difference between GOD's <hi>permitting</hi> theſe brethren the gratification of their hearts deſire, and governing it to the public good, and his being the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of their behavior? The <hi>latter</hi> opinion makes men machines; the <hi>former</hi> is conſiſtent with that freedom which is <hi>eſſential</hi> to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings—to moral agents.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, that GOD has general plans of providence, which he is ever carrying into execution, and which he ſome times accompliſhes through the luſts and paſſions of men.—I will mention a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances out of very many.—It was the will of heaven that a ſeven years drought ſhould come upon the <hi>eaſtern world,</hi> and that the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then in <hi>Canaan</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be preſerved from the fatal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it. This could not be better effected, in the common courſe of things, than by having a prudent man of their own number ſent before them into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017807_0009_0FA31A3A84BF2620"/>
that garden of the world, who, having a foreſight of the impending ſcarcity and through a variety of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fortune, being raiſed to <hi>diſtinction</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> ſhould cauſe the erection of granaries, by ſtores ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably accumulated in which, the <hi>poſterity</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as well as others, ſhould be preſerved from the ſad conſequences of a <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>long continued ſcarcity.</hi> This ſcheme was executed by the malice and envy of Jacob's ſons, who ſold their brother with no other view than to be rid of his pretended, haughty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious temper. Now, through whoſe efficiency was this barbarous baniſhment brought about? God's? or Satan's? Let ſcripture and common ſenſe decide.</p>
            <p>Indeed, ſome perſons pretend that God influences to the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> to the outward action, but not to the ſinfulneſs of it. This appears to me, a lame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter. It will not quadrate with the caſe referred <hi>to</hi> in the text. How can we, in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſeparate the action from the obliquity of it? To <hi>kill,</hi> or to <hi>baniſh</hi> perſons, under <hi>ſome</hi> circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a virtuous action, a laudable deed, when they have <hi>forfeited</hi> their lives or <hi>merited</hi> exile. But how can the ſame be done to innocent perſons without guilt? And if there was guilt, to whom is it to be imputed? To God, or to Jacob's ſons? Let God be holy, but every man a ſinner.</p>
            <p>In after ages, the Jews were to be redeemed from <hi>Egypt</hi> by an out ſtretched arm. The great Jehovah, in that idolatrous country, and <hi>emporium</hi> of the world, choſe to diſplay his wonderful w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ks, and his evident ſuperiority to the falſe gods of the Heathen. Nothing gave a greater ſcope for this, than the obſtinacy of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> the reigning prince, who refuſed to let the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go out of his dominions, till the moſt

               <hi>aſtoniſhing judgments</hi> were ſent, and <hi>miracles</hi> wrought in the land of <hi>Ham!</hi> But we are not from hence to conclude that God by his efficiency produced this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of diſpoſition, in the <hi>Egygtian</hi> king. All that was neceſſary, was to raiſe to the throne, and cauſe to ſtand <hi>there</hi> a certain man, whoſe avarice, ambition and tyranny prompted him to detain the poſterity of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his kingdom, till Jehovah demonſtrated himſelf to be the true God of the univerſe. There is one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this account of the matter: the ſcripture aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, in direct and poſitive terms, that <hi>God hardened Pharoah's</hi> heart. It alſo ſays in other places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>he hardened his own heart</hi>; nothing more, therefore, can re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſonably be intended thereby, than that God <hi>permitted</hi> him to follow the evil diſpoſitions of his heart, <hi>left</hi> him expoſed to the temptations of the world and the devil, <hi>took</hi> from him his holy ſpirit, and <hi>brought</hi> him into ſuch trials, as meeting with a perverſe temper, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it more ſo; not that he uſed any poſitive influence in the production of this event.</p>
            <p>Farther, it was the will of heaven, a ſcheme in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be planted down in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> To this end the antient inhabitants <hi>muſt</hi> be exterminated. <hi>They</hi> were left there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to fill up the meaſure of their iniquity, that ſo the Jews might be juſtified, in the deſtruction of them. To ſuppoſe God made them wicked by his own <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,</hi> is to imagine that he was reduced to the <hi>hard neceſſity</hi> of juſtifying one ſin by the production of another, than which nothing can be more injurious or abſurd.</p>
            <p>Again; The <hi>Jews</hi> after being ſometime planted in <hi>Canaan</hi> become extremely vile; ſo that, agreeable to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

they ſhould be puniſhed by captivity. There were thoſe who were ready to carry this deſign into execution. <hi>Senacharib</hi> undertook the ſervice: but it was far from his intention, to fulfill the deſigns or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the <hi>plans</hi> of heaven; all that he meant was to gratify his <hi>luſt</hi> of <hi>domination</hi> and <hi>conqueſt.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find the Almighty thus declaring, <hi>I will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſſyria. He meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo; but it is in his heart to deſtroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more: It was the ſcheme or plan of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to redeem the fallen world by the <hi>advent</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In order to accompliſh this benevolent plan, the Saviour of the world muſt be put to a <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>ignominious</hi> death. <hi>Judas</hi> and the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtood ready to accompliſh the deed, which, though nefarious in itſelf, was productive of the happieſt conſequences to the world.

The duty of forgiveneſs Heaven does not extend ſo far as to oblige us to make the offenders our confidents and friends— to truſt them for the future, or receive them into our intimate communion: it only requires, that we bear them no ill-will— take no ſteps for revenge—and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to the mercy of God.

            <p>Now, would it not be deemed impertinent or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, I could eaſily point out the great advantage that has accrued to ſome <hi>other countries</hi> as well as to <hi>this</hi> from the late <hi>American</hi> war. Before the conteſt with this weſtern world, the ſpirit and the idea of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, was almoſt loſt from Europe, as it had been long before from Aſia and Africa. This diſpute arouſed it in Ireland, who before were fettered in chains of ſevere bondage. Poverty and oppreſſion reigned in that iſland.

A glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the American war! Farther, the king of <hi>France</hi> has given free toleration to his Proteſtant ſubjects, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them to build their churches, undiſturbed in any part of his kingdom! The king of Spain has put an end to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi>; and from the ratified articles of peace between theſe two latter kingdoms and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> it ſhould ſeem, that it is made upon more liberal principles than commonly has been between <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> kingdoms.

Freedom, indeed, may be abuſed to purpoſes of licentiouſneſs, and what other bleſſing may not be abuſed? But, if it be not our own fault, we may <hi>now</hi> be the happieſt people upon the face of the globe!

            <p>We have at preſent a happy conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, framed by wiſe men and accepted by a majority of the people at large. If we adhere to the ſpirit of it, and labor to give energy to the laws, and dignity to the governing authority, by electing <hi>wiſe men</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and then ſubmitting chearfully to their commands, we ſhall doubtleſs taſte the ſweets of that liberty for which we have bled at every vein.</p>

            <p>NEITHER the public nor the world, at this time, need to be informed, that the late great and affecting conteſt, between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> opened in <hi>Lexington,</hi> by the <hi>unprovoked maſſacre</hi> of a number of its inhabitants, perpetrated by a body of <hi>Britiſh</hi> troops, on the <hi>nineteenth</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1775.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> diſtreſſing <hi>day has been unto us for a memorial.</hi> As ſuch it hath been ſtatedly obſerved in this place, as an <hi>important anniverſary,</hi> through the courſe of the late war, by a reſpectable appearance of the <hi>militia</hi> in arms, and a ſolemn aſſembly of the <hi>whole congregation</hi> in the houſe of GOD, to drop a tear upon the <hi>graves</hi> and mourn over the <hi>aſhes</hi> of our <hi>ſlaughtered friends,</hi> religiouſly to notice and acknowledge the hand of GOD, —humbly to expreſs our confidence in him, as the righteous and powerful <hi>avenger</hi> of <hi>injured innocence,</hi> and devoutly to implore his preſence and aid in the cauſe of our country, of poſterity, and mankind.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed him, who is <hi>governor amongſt the nations,</hi> to behold the ſtate of an oppreſſed land, to hear the prayers of an afflicted people, to give them to ſee their deſires upon their enemies, and to rejoice in his ſalvation, by bringing the war to an happy iſſue, and granting them the pleaſing proſpect of the bleſſings of a peace, in which all their rights and claims, as <hi>free, ſovereign ſtates,</hi> and an <hi>independent nation,</hi> are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon a permanent foundation.</p>

            <p>The dawn of the day was uſhered in by the ringing of the bell.—The officers of the <hi>town militia,</hi> with a large number of the inhabitants, being collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—at five o'clock (the time when the <hi>Britons</hi> made their approach, and, without notice or provocation, <hi>inhumanly</hi> fired upon the people of this town) <hi>eight cannon,</hi> from the <hi>artillery,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Oliver Brown,</hi> were diſcharged, in memory of <hi>eight</hi> of our brethren, who fell the <hi>firſt victims</hi> to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor's cruelty, and <hi>martyrs</hi> in the cauſe of liberty, <hi>America,</hi> and mankind.</p>
            <p>At the riſing of the ſun, a large flag of the <hi>United States</hi> appeared diſplayed over the houſe of Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> near the meeting-houſe and place of parade, where our brethren were <hi>ſlain,</hi> and <hi>thirteen cannon</hi> were diſcharged in commemoration of that ſpirit of liberty, patriotiſm and bravery, which, upon that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting event, fired the <hi>American's</hi> breaſt, and catching from ſoul to ſoul, diffuſed itſelf through this wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended continent, and inſpired the inhabitants of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the (then) <hi>colonies</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> as <hi>one man,</hi> to riſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At two o'clock, a large number of the inhabitants (ſeveral of whom in years paſt had borne commiſſions from this or the United States) turning out as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, in honor to the day, aſſembled in arms; and being embodied under the conduct of the preſent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the militia, performed ſeveral <hi>military ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuvres</hi> to good acceptance.</p>
            <p>Preciſely at three o'clock, the company, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Capt. <hi>Munroe,</hi> appeared at the houſe of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> and from thence eſcorted his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency the Governor, and a large number of gentlemen in the miniſtry, and other gentlemen of character, to the meeting houſe, to attend divine ſervice.</p>
            <p>As the company, with the proceſſion, were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the houſe of GOD, <hi>thirteen cannon</hi> were diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in memory of the wiſdom, firmneſs and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm of the <hi>thirteen colonies,</hi> in declaring themſelves <hi>free, ſovereign and independent ſtates,</hi> and conſolidating their union and ſtrength into one body for glory and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as a nation, by articles of a confederation, founded in principles of wiſdom and equity, virtue and liberty, ſupported by the experience of ages, and approving itſelf to the common ſenſe of mankind.</p>
            <p>In the houſe of divine worſhip, prayers and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings were devoutly addreſſed to that God who hath been with his people in diſtreſs, who has carried them thro', and who, alone, is to be exalted in their ſalvation;

The exerciſe was cloſed with a pſalm and an anthem, pertinent to the joyful occaſion.</p>
            <p>After divine ſervice, the proceſſion was eſcorted back to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the company in arms, and three vollies fired, as a ſalute to his <hi>Excellency</hi> and the other gentlemen of the proceſſion.</p>

            <p>The rejoicings of the day were cloſed with a parting ſalute of three vollies, by the company in arms; and the diſcharge of a cannon, and the ſtriking of the flag at the ſetting of the ſun.</p>
