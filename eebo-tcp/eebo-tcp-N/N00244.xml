            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> answer to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> as to this particular. They say, those of the Congregational way in <hi>England, plead for Anabaptists liberty as for their own.</hi> That they plead for liberty and indulgence to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards those that differ from them only in that point of <hi>Paedo-Baptisme,</hi> I believe: when I was in <hi>England,</hi> I did so my self; and if I were their now, I would do so again: but that they should plead for liberty unto such practices, as our Anabaptists have been guilty of, is not easie to believe; or, if they do, it is because such <hi>Narrators</hi> as these <hi>Animadverted</hi> upon, have by untrue Relations misguided them into undue Apprehensions. Nay, I am fully convinced, that those of their own way, if of serious and gracious Spirits, when once they are possessed with a true Relation of things concerning them, will see cause to condemn <hi>New-England</hi> less, and those their Friends more, than at first they were aware of: How did they bear the World in hand, that the Churches here did Excommunicate them for nothing but their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, in scrupling <hi>Paedobaptisme!</hi> But that therein they have dealt most untruely, and injuriously; the subsequent Answer to their <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> hath made apparent from the Church-Records concerning those matters.</p>
            <p>Finally, let me intreat the Brethren to believe, that some of us would shew as much indulgence unto truly tender Consciences, as themselves. It is not so long since our own Necks bled under an intolerable yoke of Imposition upon Conscience, as that we should forget what it is to be so dealt with; or exercise that severity towards any, that we have our selves complained of, in others. But the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will readily own that some men have pretended Conscience, when pride, &amp; perverseness in the will, have been at the bottom: They will also confess, that a meer pretence of Conscience, is not enough to bear men out in an evil practice. All the difficulty is, in discerning the one of these from the other. Blessed Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his excellent <hi>Irenicum,</hi> hath laid down Rules concerning this: And if that which he saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. be sound Doctrine (as undoubtedly it is) some of our <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> have not such characters of a tender Conscience upon them, as were to be desired.

               <p n="1">1. Our practises are contrary to <hi>the Principles and practises of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Our practises are contrary to the design of our first Planters, who left all for liberty of Conscience, and we are the Children of those that felt the lash of Imposition, and yet will shew to others the like severity.</hi>] I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they are mistaken in the design of our first Planters, whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was not Toleration; but were professed Enemies of it, and could leave the World professing they <hi>died no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. But they are Brethren that <hi>avowedly profess and appeal to the same rule</hi>] But what if the Churches, in their bearing witness against them, do appeal to the same rule? and think they should violate it by neglecting this duty, how shall we do then? why do they censure our Church censures against them that have sometimes been our Members? we do avowedly appeal to the same rule. Is it sufficient to satisfie men in one anothers proceedings (though contrary) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they appeal to the same rule; this must certainly be some <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Rule,</hi> that may square to all mens Opinions and fancies.</p>

up this discourse; The persecution, and the success.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The persecution is compendiously represented. <hi>Some of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> were oftentimes brought before Councils,</hi> &amp;c.] (I suppose they allude to <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 17.) To which let this be taken as a Reply, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> that as the Honoured Magistrates here are Christian, so have they judged it their duty to maintain the ways of Christ, and strengthen them by civil Laws, which hath not only been the practice of Reformers of old, but the constant Judgement of the Church of Christ ever since the Apostles. If evil minded men will take this advantage to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the truth, it is no more then may be done in all other cases: &amp; as it is thought no good plea to keep the Scriptures from the laity, lest they should learn to be Hereticks; so neither to deny the Magistrate his due power on supposition that he may abuse it. On this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple our worthy Rulers have made Laws against many Sects and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, and among the rest the <hi>Anabaptists.</hi> That in quelling the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> they do not oppose the truth, but suppress Error they are fully perswaded: and although they never pretended to a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship over mens Consciences, yet they account the outward man is subject to them: and if we must tarry till all men are agreed about what is truth before we oppose Error, we shall stay till there is no need <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For the progress of our Magistracy in the execution of these Laws, they have been so far from a violent, eager, or willing taking advantage against these men, that (notwithstanding their opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speeches when they have been before them, their scornful carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and purposed indeavours to irritate them by insolent challenges) they have alwayes proceeded slowly, tenderly, far on this side the Law, as those who sought not to ruine either their Names, Liberties, or Estates. How often when fines have been laid upon them, have they stopt the Execution? if any have been imprisoned, it hath been but when dared to it: and though once a Sentence of Banishment did pass upon two of their Ring-leaders (heady violent men) yet then they neglected, and scorned to take notice of it (resolving to run utmost hazards) neither was this improved as any advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Nor is it to be wondred that our Governours have been opposite in particular to these men, since, if they could get head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, they would certainly undermine the Churches, ruine Order, destroy piety, and introduce prophaness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the success of these endeavours: <hi>God is pleased still to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, and they are by these means not weakened, but strengthened and increased</hi>) Methinks I hear the Jews crying, <hi>we are delivered to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

these abominations.</hi> Let them but remember that many things are done by Gods Permissive providence, when the doers have not his approbation: nor is it an unfailing ground of sincerity, that they have withstood such trials and are increased: we know (do what we can to restrain them) <hi>Evil men and Seducers shall wax worse and worse, and many shall follow their pernicious wayes.</hi> Nor is it to be wondred at that persons discontent with the yoke of Christ in the Churches, or taking offence at particular Administrations, which might touch their own Interest, have so readily followed the faction of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> of which sort of men the most of their society and Founders here, have consisted.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This charge (in termes) was never made against them by us, and so, part of their vindication is superfluous; for we never said all of them rent from these Churches: some were strangers to us till their trubulency made them too well known and others were never joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other Churches, but had lived without Communion. But that they are a society of schismaticks, (if Schisme be an unjust renting from a Church of Christ) we assert. Three things they (in words) grant. 1. That our Churches are Churches of Christ (<hi>page</hi> 14.) 2. That some of them were once Members of them (<hi>page</hi> 4.) 3. That some of theirs did depart from these Churches and joyn in this new combination (<hi>page</hi> 5.) now to prove them hence, a company of Schismaticks: Observe,</p>

2. That <hi>Thomas Gold,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Osborn</hi> (the persons in dispute were Schismaticks, or did unjustly rend from the Church where they were before Members, will appear by a true Relation of matters of fact (for this story of the Narrative, and Truth are Strangers) whereof there is sufficient Testimony to be found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church at <hi>Charlstown</hi> (whereof they were Members) and there are many faithful witnesses yet alive, who were present at these transactions and can say, if these things be not so; which ought to outweigh the story of a prejudiced person, who hath all by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, whose very business is to palliate and lick over matters to shape them to his own turn: Here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Goodman Gold:</hi> Let the Reader consider these things; and let the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> disprove them if they can.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though he was first called to an account about withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his childe from Baptisme, yet that was not the reason of his being admonished (as the Pamphlet asserts) nor because he could not be convinced of Error; not yet did the Church proceed to Admonition, till such time as (he not only spake contemptuously and irreligiously of the emptiness &amp; nullity of that Ordinance, but also) used unbecoming gestures in the time of Administration, of which (being asked the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) he (before the Congregation) acknowledged they <hi>were</hi> to cast disresect upon it: nor then neither till after much patience. Now let <hi>Anabaptists</hi> themselves judge whither there be not a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between doubting about an Ordinance, and professedly vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by unhandsome words and carriages; and whither they will bear with any Member of theirs that will so contemn any of those things which are to them sacred, and acknowledged as Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
               <p n="2">2, That at his first Admonition he was not sententially suspended, but only desired for the preventing of the offence of some, to abstain from coming to the other Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That upon This, <hi>Thomas Gold</hi> took up a trade of absenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Meetings of the Church to worship God on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which made a new offence.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> that those who do such things (adding the word <hi>justly</hi> to the first part of the charge) are to be reputed scandalous. That they have so done remains to be proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Foundation was laid with persons excommunicated, and that for scandal: for this it may be considered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thomas Gold</hi> was not admonished for his Opinion (nor doth it appear that ever he should, if he had carried humbly) but for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious words and carriages against an Ordinance. Which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had before professedly reverenced and highly esteemed and which he knew that Church he walked with had still in the like esteem. And <hi>Thomas Osborne,</hi> by relinquishing publick Worship directly violated his Covenant, not so much as pretending (at first) any doubt about infant Baptisme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They both of them despised the Church, continued to absent themselves, laid false charges against them, separated in a private meeting, went off to the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> without asking leave, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came (supposed) Members of one, before they were regularly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of their obligation to another Church: all which things are against the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> own professed Rules if they will stand to their confession. Whereas he faith, <hi>their not hearing the Church was nothing else but their not coming when the Church sent for them]</hi> it is a foolish pretence: their not hearing the Church was their appearing and proving themselves impenitent and that after many Treaties used with them many solemn Admonitions laid upon them, convictions sufficiently offered, of sins against the light of their Consciences, and which (it's certain) they would have acknowledged, had it not been for fear of being reconciled to the Church, whose Excommunication they feared not, but impudently des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red. The truth is, they were weary of their Church Relation, and resolved to get rid of it, and not knowing any regular way to obtain it, they chose to sin rather then suffer; and undergo a just Excommunication, that they might be by themselves; presuming that they could blind the World with a vain pretense that they were ejected for no other reason but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they questioned the right of Infant Baptisme. Hence <hi>Thomas Gold</hi> did particularly express before the Church his desire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, which yet they proceeded not to (till by a first and second refusal to appear at the Churches citing of them) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000309_0022_0FA4A9CD44012D50"/>
themselves incorrigible. Besides, it is to be observed that these men (having privately exercised their gifts in Meetings with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause) began to think themselves wronged that their light was put under a bushel; and finding no remedy in our Churches, threw on, a cloak of <hi>Anabaptisme,</hi> and so gained the thing they aimed at, in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They called such to Administer,</hi> &amp;c.] against all his winding to get clear of this, [only say, <hi>Thomas Gold</hi> was thus imployed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom too much hath been said, except we had better to say.</p>

Here he endeavours a <hi>salvo.</hi> The persons instanced are <hi>Thomas Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>John Farnham;</hi> the former sometimes of the Church as <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerica.</hi> the other of the <hi>second gathered Church in Boston.</hi> He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth they have received them but on just reasons, or (at worst) not very irregularly. Let the Records of these Churches be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this Narrative, and see if the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> have not good skill in painting, and putting a fair face on a foul matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Thomas Foster,</hi> let it be observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he was not only a Member of the Church of <hi>Billerica,</hi> but of the Foundation, and at their gathering was full, free, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in owning Infant Baptisme to be as Ordinance of Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: and if he judged himself (that notwithstanding) to have been then a true Christian he ought to have extended more charity (then his after expressions) shewed to the Church still remaining of the same perswasion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he first discovered his receding from that (formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) judgement by disorderly carriage at the time of Administration of that Ordinance, and being reproved for it, he confessed he had carried unbecoming any person in any Christian Assembly; which gave satisfaction to the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though, (when about three months after this, he began, and thence continued to leave the meeting at the celebration of Baptism,) he was, at a private Church meeting given to understand that it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Brethren, and that he had receded from his Covenant and was advised solemnly and seriously to consider of it, yet he was not (as the Narrator asserts) laid under Admonition, or prohibited Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: nor did the Church ever do any such thing in private to any (which he knew) nor did they intend for this, to have debarred him of Communion.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:000309_0023_0FA4A9CE01603410"/>
4. That after this, he neglected the Church Assemblies; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the <hi>Anabaptist</hi> meetings, and was there rebaptized: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called by the Church at a meeting; at the Pastors house, to give an account of these proceedings; though at first he dissembled, yet at length acknowledged, and justified his actions, (if false charges may be accounted a justification:) For he told them;</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>That they denied him Baptisme:</hi> whereas they owned him for Baptized, and if he was not it was wickedness in him (an unbaptized person) to come to the Lords Table.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That they yoked him with Unbelievers:</hi> which was, because they extended Church watch to a Child (or children) of the Church: and yet, for this, he judged his separation lawful, and produced for it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 17. therein (implicitly at least) pronouncing the Church a company of <hi>Belialists</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>That they had presented him to the Court]</hi> The truth is, one of the Brethren of the Church, had made complaint of him to the Grand-jury, which occasioned his presentment, judging his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans oath engaged him so to do, when other due means to reclaim him from his turbulent carriages had been used; and this he makes the Churches fault, because they did not lay that Brother under a censure, for not daring to violate his Oath, and betray his Fidelity to the Civil Authority.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That they had dealt injuriously by one of his Brethren, in laying him under Admonition]</hi> In justification of which act there needs no account be given here; only, let any judge whither it be a just ground to separate from a Church, because I am not fully of their mind in every act of Administration: and also, it seems a thing not warrantable for a private Member of a Church (in pretence of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vindication) to vilifie and asperse a Church of Christ: if this be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, what is pride? But yet,</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. His offence for which he was dealt with, was many moral evils (and so a complicate offence) breaking forth at once: <abbr>

On all these accounts was he laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Admonition. Two months after which, being called before the Church, he, in words, confest the evil of some of the particulars, but was observed at the same time to turn about and laugh: where then was his Repentance? The Church (this notwithstanding) waited divers months longer, till he went on to that height of impiety and prophaneness, that one of the Teaching Officers, setting before the Church the Rule concerning Excommunication, <hi>Farnum</hi> makes a <hi>leg</hi> to him (in the Assembly) in way of derision, and declared, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Church would yield to four things, he would have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them: <abbr>
