            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ALTHOUGH they who are departed hence in the Lord, can receive no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to their happineſs by any teſtimonial of their ſurviving friends, however juſt; yet to the wiſe in heart, precious is the memory of the truly pious and upright, whoſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walking in the fear of God has livingly witneſſed againſt the appearance of evil in its various transformations; their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in ſpirit and practice to the holy law of the Lord, evincing the delight and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to be found therein; for
<q>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</q>

               <q>What ſcene in this life more dignifies humanity? what ſchool is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inſtructive than the death-bed of the righteous, impreſſing the underſtanding with a convincing evidence, that they have not followed cunningly deviſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but ſolid ſubſtantial truth; that there is a meaſure of divine light and grace in man, which if duly minded and obeyed, is ſufficient to preſerve thro' all the viciſſitudes in life, to give him the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is right therefore, that the remembrance of thoſe ſhould be preſerved, whoſe lights have ſo ſhone before men as to excite the beholders of their good works to glorify God, the original, and ſource from whom all good is derived, that tho' being dead, the luſtre of their pious example through life, and on the approach of death, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſpeak the inviting language,
<q>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us as we have followed Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With this view, our yearly-meeting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that many memorials of our depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friends lay dormant on the records, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Collection to be made of ſuch of them as were moſt likely to be of general benefit by publication, which the committee appointed for the ſervice having performed to the beſt of their judgment, it is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the readers, ſome of whom will be reminded of the ſincere piety and virtue of their anceſtors, who through the dangers and difficulties to which they were ſubjected, in their removal from their native land, and forming a new ſettlement in a wilderneſs, were happily preſerved in a ſteady attention to their religious duty, and many of them faithfully engaged in promoting the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs among mankind, to whom others ſucceeded, who through obedience to the powerful influence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, became alike eminent in their day, and ſerviceable in the church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:020377_0004_0FAF095D73C33498"/>The following Collection is affectionately recommended to the deſcendants of thoſe worthies, to the readers in general, and particularly to the youth, who may derive profitable inſtruction by a ſerious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the happy effects of an early devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, and the inexpreſſible advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of embracing the merciful viſitation of the Moſt-High, to ſecure their true comfort in this life, and enduring felicity in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Though the language and ſtyle of theſe memorials may not be calculated to pleaſe ſuch curious readers who in their eſtimate of the value of a Book, are too much amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſplay of wit and literary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments in the compoſition, to give due attention to the inſtructive import of an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs account of the chriſtian experiences of thoſe, who have not been ſo ſolicitous for the approbation of men, as to be found humble followers of Chriſt, their meek and lowly pattern and redeemer; but it is hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there are many to whom the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this Collection will afford informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, edification, and encouragement in the purſuit of their moſt ſubſtantial intereſt, a life of true wiſdom, piety, and virtue; and that the number of ſuch may increaſe is the deſign of the following publication.</p>

               <head>An abſtract of <hi>Nicholas Waln's</hi> Teſtimony, concerning that faithful ſervant of the Lord, <hi>CUTHBERT HAYHURST,</hi> who departed this life, at his own houſe in the county of <hi>Bucks,</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> about the <hi>5</hi>th of the firſt month, <hi>1682-3,</hi> near the fiftieth year of his age.</head>
               <p>HE was born at Eaſington, in Bolland in the county of York, in Old England, and was one of the worthies in Iſrael. My ſpirit is comforted in a ſenſe of that power, which did attend him in our meetings, for many years in the land of our nativity, and alſo after he came into theſe parts; having been a valiant ſoldier for the truth, and bore a faithful teſtimony to the ſame, in
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:020377_0009_0FAF0963453129A0"/>
word, life and converſation. He went through many great exerciſes and impriſonments, and was a comfort unto the faithful and true believers, who <hi>follow the Lamb through many tribulations.</hi> He was a worthy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Lord's hand, againſt the falſe teachers and hirelings, going ſeveral times to their ſteeple-houſes, and teſtifying againſt their deceiving the people. He alſo went to ſeveral market towns, and at their croſſes, declared and publiſhed the truth as it is in Jeſus: I accompanied him and his dear wife at one of them, where he faithfully warned the people and exhorted them to repentance; the divine power and preſence eminently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, which my ſoul was made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of to my comfort and ſatisfaction. I can ſay he was of great ſervice to me and many others, being inſtrumental in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us near unto the Lord, whoſe name over all we have cauſe to bleſs on his behalf; and although his body is gone to the earth, his memorial liveth among the righteous, and I am perſuaded his ſoul is in the enjoyment of peace with the Lord. I was often with him in the time of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and beheld his meek, innocent and lamb-like deportment; being alſo by his bed-ſide when he departed, which was in a quiet and truly reſigned frame, like one fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a ſweet ſleep; ſo that I have great cauſe to believe he is one of thoſe <hi>that died in the Lord, and is at reſt with him forever.</hi>

                           <p>HE was one of the Lord's worthies, ſtrong and ſteadfaſt in the faith, very zealous for the truth and careful for the church; his life being hid with God in Chriſt. His miniſtry ſtood not in the wiſdom of the fleſh, but in the power of God. It was the birth born from above, that could receive him and was refreſhed by him. In a word, he was a Jew inward whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God. And foraſmuch as he was a man thus qualified, I could not well be ſatisfied that ſo worthy a man as dear Chriſtopher Taylor, ſhould be buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.

of conſiderable ſervice in public affairs, and very active in ſettling meetings for diſcipline in thoſe early times; the firſt of that ſort for the women, being held at his houſe in 1683.</p>

friends, who then were priſoners there, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the king, magiſtrates and officers on their behalf. At Embden, where friends were ſufferers, he laboured for their freedom, and it being a time of hot perſecution, went through the ſtreets, warning the people to repent of their wickedneſs, where they kept him two nights a priſoner: At another time in the ſaid place, he delivered a paper to the council, relating to the liberty of friends; after the reading whereof, he was called in to the council room and received in a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, with promiſes of freedom to the people called Quakers, in matters of faith and worſhip; he alſo had good ſervice with magiſtrates, lawyers, prieſts and collegians, and was ſeveral times a priſoner in thoſe parts. Five times he paſſed through Ireland, viſiting friends, where he had good ſervice, ſometimes among the Iriſh when at maſs. Once he paſſed through part of Scotland, twice at Barbados, once through New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and Virginia, twice in Maryland and the Jerſeys, and twice at Pennſylvania; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travelled by land above 20,000 miles, his travels by water, not being much leſs: And though he was often in ſtorms and tempeſts at ſea, perils by land, and met with bad ſpirits and exerciſes of divers kinds, yet the Lord ſtood by him and made him a ſucceſsful inſtrument in his hand: Cheerfully paſſing through them all, by the power of him that called him thereto, not being ſlack to labour in word and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,

wherever he came, to the edifying of the brethren, and reconciling things where he found them amiſs: Settling and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing meetings in many parts where he came, to the great comfort and refreſhment of the upright in heart, by which he got a name amongſt the ancients, and is recorded among the worthies of the Lord. Not long after his arrival in Pennſylvania, he was taken ill with a fever; his diſtemper was violent upon him, yet he bore it patiently and paſſed away like a lamb, leaving a good ſavour. And though <hi>the name of the wicked ſhall rot, yet the righteous ſhall be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance.</hi>

               <p>I KNEW him 14 years, he having been made inſtrumental in the hand of the Lord, to turn me from the evil of my ways, and from darkneſs to his marvellous light; and I am a witneſs that he held his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty until the finiſhing of his courſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to the ſaying of David, "Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace", And therein he laid down his head. Having experienced the work of regeneration in himſelf, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came qualified to ſtrengthen the brethren, and went forth in the miniſtry and word of life, preaching the everlaſting goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus; having freely received he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave, not fearing man but obeying God, who had committed a large meaſure, and clear manifeſtation of his ſpirit unto him, not only for his own profit and benefit, but many others received comfort thereby; for his doctrine dropped as the rain, and his ſpeech diſtilled as the dew, to the renewing and refreſhing the ſeed and plant of God.</p>
               <p>Thus he went forth in the name of the Lord, and was valiant for truth upon earth; and though many weapons were formed, and many tongues roſe up againſt him, yet the divine power which ſtopped the mouths of lions, and quenched the violence of fire, girded him with ſtrength and valour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was enabled to encounter all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſuch as endeavoured to ſtop the work which God has begun in the earth. After ſome time, he with his wife and two children came into this country, and whilſt here, he bore a living, ſound and faithful teſtimony for the Lord God, to the great ſatisfaction and comfort of the faithful in this wilderneſs, where his lot did fall. For having had the opportunity of being with

him here in this ſolitary country, as well as in our native land, both in private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places; I am a witneſs according to my meaſure, that the power and preſence of the Lord did greatly attend him in preaching the everlaſting truth. After he was taken ſick, he grew weaker until his departure, ſaying "The will of the Lord be done." His ſhort continuance here cauſed many to mourn when he was taken from them, yet not as thoſe that mourn without hope, for tho' he be dead, yet he lives, and tho' his removal is our loſs, it is his gain.</p>

and ſeveral came forth in a living teſtimony for God, who were begotten to the Lord by by him, and ſtill remain ſeals of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.

In the year 1682, he removed with his family into Pennſylvania, and as his teſtimony was in the power of God, when in the land of his nativity, ſo it was when here; he being likewiſe ſerviceable many ways.

               <p>HE was born at Newby in the County of York, being the ſon of John At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, of Thruſh-Croſs, was convinced of the truth and had received a gift of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry before I knew him. We were joined in marriage in the year 1678, and lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in love and unity. He was a zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man for the truth, and according to the gift which he had received, bore a faithful teſtimony unto it, of which many were witneſſes in that country from whence we came. In 1682 we came into this country, with one conſent, and in the unity of our dear friends and brethren, who gave a good teſtimony for us, by a certificate from their monthly meeting; and my ſoul hath good cauſe to bleſs the Lord, and to prize his mercies, whoſe preſence was with us by ſea and land. Since we came into this part of the world, he retained his love and zeal for God and his truth, his treaſure not being in this world, and as it often opened in his

heart, did exhort others to ſtand looſe from things which are here below, and diligently ſeek after thoſe things that are above. He was a tender huſband, ready to encourage and ſtrengthen me in that which is good. About the latter end of the fifth month 1687, he was taken with the ague and fever, which much weakned his body, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a conſiderable time; being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the dealings of the Lord: His heart was often opened in prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication unto his God, to preſerve him in patience unto the end of his days, and that none of us might think hard of any of thoſe exerciſes that he is pleaſed to try us withal. At times he would look upon me and ſay, <hi>my dear wife, the Lord preſerve thee and take care of thee, for I muſt leave thee and go to my reſt</hi>; with many more ſweet and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly expreſſions and exhortations, in the time of his great weakneſs, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the 31<hi>ſt</hi> of the eighth month, when he once more exhorted me to be content, and that I would deſire his brother (who was then abſent) to be content alſo: After which he paſſed away as one falling into a quiet ſleep. And as the Lord hath hitherto been my ſtrength and my ſtay in the time of my great diſtreſs, ſo the deſire of my heart is, that I, with my brethren and ſiſters, who yet remain behind, may alſo finiſh our courſe in faithfulneſs, that in the end we may receive the ſame reward with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous that are gone before</p>

               <p>I AM perſuaded it is a juſtice due to the righteous, and a duty upon us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething to perpetuate the names of ſuch who have left a fragrancy behind them, and <hi>through faith have obtained a good report.</hi> Tho' their bodies ſleep in the grave, and by divine appointment, they die like other men, yet this ſignal difference hath the Lord declared, <hi>the memory of the juſt is bleſſed, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Pro. 10, 7. And to give teſtimony to thoſe that die in the Lord, is not only juſt to them, but is very uſeful to the living; as many under great conflicts of ſpirit have experienced, that it hath been to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſtrength, to hear or read of the faithfulneſs and conſtancy of God to his own in all ages, and how he hath in due time, made them more than conquerors, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their end with peace and dominion. Theſe conſiderations, together with the ſincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I had for this our dear friend, hath prevailed with me, in truth and ſoberneſs, to give the following teſtimony concerning him. As a man he was pleaſant, courteous, diſcreet and grave, and in public ſervices accompanied the foremoſt. <hi>The word of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was in his mouth, and he had received the tongue of the learned, to ſpeak in due ſeaſon.</hi>

I might truly ſay much of his innocency, love and zeal for truth, which hath left a lively impreſſion upon the hearts of many. His laſt ſickneſs was the ſmall pox, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper often known to be very afflicting; notwithſtanding which, he cheerfully and contentedly ſubmitted to the providence of God in it, upon all occaſions expreſſing a free and hearty reſignation to his will; and was frequently filled with praiſes to God, and inſtructions to his people.</p>

But this my friend received the truth with a ready mind and gladneſs of heart, and thought nothing too dear to part with for it, yea it was precious to him as <hi>the pearl of great price,</hi> and it wrought effectually in him, not only in opening his underſtanding, but alſo in its various operations, both to wound and to heal, to purge out the old leaven and to leaven anew into its holy nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: And as the Lord had made him a living witneſs of the power and life of truth in himſelf, he called him to bear a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the truth as he had received it, and alſo againſt the falſe ways and worſhips that were then extant in the world; for which he ſuffered ſeveral impriſonments, bearing the burden and heat of the day, being one of the firſt that received and bore witneſs to the truth in thoſe parts. He was very ſerviceable in his public teſtimony, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in convincing but alſo to the edification of many; yea he was a great ſtay and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to friends in the parts near where he lived: For he was an inſtrument of great ſervice in the Lord's hand, being much eſteemed for his works ſake, not only at home but in other places where he travelled in truth's ſervice.</p>

My ſoul loved him and was drawn near him the firſt day I ſaw him, becauſe of the ſincerity that I beheld in him; and as our familiarity increaſed, ſo I found the bent of his mind was to ſerve the Lord in uprightneſs of heart.

His bow abode in ſtrength, and tho' many archers ſhot at him, yet he kept the ſhield of faith, by which the fiery darts of the wicked one were quenched, and his ſoul preſerved in communion with the Lord, and in the faith of Chriſt he finiſhed his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, with a heart full of love to God and his people: The Lord took him away from evil to come.

However, in an unexpected time, way was made for our getting into a ſmall buſineſs, which ſuited our capacities, and the Lord gave a bleſſing unto our endeavours.

               <head>A Teſtimony from the Monthly-Meeting of <hi>Haverford</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> concerning THOMAS LLOYD.</head>
               <p>THE love of God and the regard we have to the bleſſed truth, conſtrains us to give forth this teſtimony, concerning our dear friend Thomas Lloyd, many of us having had long acquaintance with him, both in Wales, where he formerly lived, and alſo in Pennſylvania, where he finiſhed his courſe, and laid down his head in peace with the Lord, and is at reſt and joy with him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evermore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:020377_0029_0FAF09764B903868"/>He was by birth of them who are called the gentry, his father being a man of a conſiderable eſtate and of great eſteem in his time, of an ancient houſe and eſtate called Dolobran, in Montgomeryſhire in Wales. He was brought up at the moſt noted ſchools, and from thence went to one of the univerſities; and becauſe of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, natural and acquired parts, many of account in the world had an eye of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard towards him: Being offered degrees and places of preferments, he refuſed them all: The Lord beginning his work in him, and cauſing a meaſure of his light to ſhine out of darkneſs, in his heart, which gave him a ſight of the vain forms, cuſtoms and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the ſchools and colleges: And hearing of a poor deſpiſed people called Quakers, he went to hear them, and the Lord's power reached unto him and came over him, to the humbling and bowing his heart and ſpirit; ſo that he was convinced of God's everlaſting truth, and received it in the love of it, and was made willing, like meek Moſes, to chooſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of the Lord, than the honours, preferments and riches of this world. The earthly wiſdom came to be of no reputation with him, but he became a fool, both to it and his former aſſociates, and through ſelf denial, and taking up the daily croſs of Chriſt Jeſus, which crucified his natural will, affections and pleaſures, he came to be a ſcholar in Chriſt's ſchool,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020377_0030_0FAF0976F0395E10"/>
and to learn the true wiſdom which is from above. Thus by departing from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and iniquities of the world, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leadings, guidance and inſtructions of the divine light, grace and ſpirit of Chriſt, he came more and more to have an underſtanding in the myſteries of God's kingdom, and was made an able miniſter of the everlaſting goſpel of peace and ſalvation; his acquired parts being ſanctified to the ſervice of truth.</p>
               <p>His ſound and effectual miniſtry, his godly converſation, meek and lamb-like ſpirit, great patience, temperance, humility, and ſlowneſs to wrath; his love to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, his godly care in the church of Chriſt, that all things might be kept ſweet, ſavoury and in good order; his helping hand to the weak, and gentle admonitions, we are fully ſatisfied have a ſeal and witneſs in the hearts of all faithful friends who knew him, both in the land of his nativity and in theſe American parts. We may in truth ſay, he ſought not himſelf, nor the riches of this world, but his eye was to that which is everlaſting, being given up to ſpend and be ſpent for the truth and the ſake of friends.</p>
               <p>He never turned his back on the truth, nor was weary in his travels Sion-wards, but remained a ſound pillar in the ſpiritual building. He had many diſputes with the clergy and ſome called peers in England, and alſo ſuffered impriſonments and much loſs of outward ſubſtance, to the honour of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020377_0031_0FAF0977B06F2B80"/>
truth, and ſtopping in meaſure, the mouths of gainſayers and perſecutors. Yet theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and trials in the land of his nativity, which he ſuſtained through the ability God gave him, were ſmall and not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the many and great exerciſes, griefs and ſorrows he met withal and went thro' in Pennſylvania, from that miſerable apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate George Keith and his deluded compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Oh the revilings, the great provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the bitter and wicked language, and rude behaviour which the Lord gave him patience to bear and overcome. He reviled not again, nor took any advantage, but loved his enemies, and prayed for them that deſpitefully abuſed him. His love to the Lord, his truth and people was ſincere to the laſt. He was taken with a malignant fever, the 5<hi>th</hi> of the ſeventh month 1694, and tho' his bodily pain was great, he bore it with much patience. Not long before his departure, ſome friends being with him, he ſaid,
<q>Friends, I love you all, I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from you, and I die in unity and love with all faithful friends: I have fought a good fight and kept the faith, which ſtands not in the wiſdom of words, but in the power of God: I have fought, not for ſtrife and contention, but for the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſimplicity of the goſpel. I lay down my head in peace and deſire you may all do ſo; friends, farewell all.</q>
He further ſaid to Griffith Owen, a friend then intending for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020377_0032_0FAF0978CECC6FD8"/>
England,
<q>I deſire thee to mind my love to friends in England, if thou lives to go over to ſee them; I have lived in unity with them, and do end my days in unity with them; and deſire the Lord to keep them all faithful to the end, in the ſimplicity of the goſpel.</q>
On the 10<hi>th</hi> day of the ſeventh month aforeſaid, being the 6<hi>th</hi> day of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it pleaſed the Lord to remove him from the many trials, temptations, ſorrows and troubles of this world, to the kingdom of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy and peace; but the remembrance of his innocent life and meek ſpirit lives with us, and his memorial is, and will remain to be ſweet and comfortable to the faithful.</p>
               <p>He was buried in friends burial-ground in Philadelphia, aged about forty-five years, having been ſeveral years preſident and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty governor of Pennſylvania.</p>

loved and highly eſteemed him for his works ſake, being an able miniſter of the goſpel, ſound in doctrine, endowed with wiſdom and a ready utterance; and favour'd with openings into the myſteries of the things of God's kingdom. He was not forward to offer his gift, having a true regard to the giver, who ſaid formerly, "Caſt the net on the right ſide of the ſhip:" Therefore his "Bow abode in ſtrength." And tho' the Lord had furniſhed him with ſuch excellent qualifications, he had ſo learned ſelf-denial as not to glory therein; but was ready to prefer his friends before himſelf, and give them the right hand of fellowſhip; being careful to keep the teſtimony of truth clear on all accounts, ſaying, "Thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in public, are doubly bound ſo to do." He was of a cheerful and peaceable temper, and innocent and blameleſs in life. As the Lord had beſtowed on him a gift of the miniſtry, beyond many of his fellows, ſo he was careful to improve it to his honour and the comfort of his people, labouring therein, not only here in Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey, but he alſo ſeveral times viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the churches in New-England, Rhode-Iſland, Long-Iſland and Maryland, and laſtly he went on that ſervice to Old-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, where he finiſhed his courſe.

In 1683 he came with his family into Pennſylvania: And in 1695 he went in company with Griffith Owen, to viſit his brethren in England; where, in the courſe of his travels, he was taken ill at Hitchin; and two of his relations from Cheſhire, going thither to viſit him, he ſaid to one of them,
<q>It is ſome exerciſe to think of being taken away ſo far from my home and family, and alſo from my friends and relations in Cheſhire. My care hath been for my ſons, that they may be kept in the fear of God: I have been a good example to them. I have a care upon me, that they may be kept humble while they are young, that they may bend their necks under the yoke of Chriſt. If I am taken away, I am very clear in my ſpirit, I have anſwered the requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God. I have been faithful in my day, and I have nothing that troubles my ſpirit; my ſpirit is very clear.</q>
He alſo expreſſed his concern for his brethren of the miniſtry, eſpecially the young, that they might obſerve the leadings of God's ſpirit in their miniſtry, and not lean upon their own natural parts. After this, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered

ſo as to be able to get down into Cheſhire; but after ſome time his diſorder returning, he ſaid to his ſiſter,
<q>If it be the will of God, that I be taken away now, I am well content.</q>
He departed in much quietneſs of mind, the 12<hi>th</hi> of the twelfth month 1696, and was buried the 15<hi>th</hi> of the ſame month, in friends bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place in Cheſhire. Aged ſixty-three years. A public miniſter 41 years.</p>

               <p>TRUTH in the inward parts God loves, and thoſe that love it and give way to the operation thereof, are made precious and lovely in the ſight of God, and he makes them inſtrumental in his hand for the good of others; among whom was my dear friend and brother Hugh Roberts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, who was qualified by God's power, to be a ſerviceable inſtrument to the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt in our parts of America.

Having paſſed through many trials and exerciſes, he could by experience ſpeak a word in ſeaſon for the encouragement of weary travellers; his doctrine often "drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as the dew, and diſtilling as the ſmall rain upon the tender plants," for in the openings of life, "things new and old" came forth of the treaſury of wiſdom, which gladned our hearts and comforted our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in a ſenſe of God's love, who is the author of all good to his people. He was zealous for good order in the church, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the diſcipline, and ſkilful in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating differences. And it is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that we, eſpecially of that meeting he belonged to, and the adjacent meetings, which moſtly received the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his labour of love, may lay to heart and conſider our loſs of him, and in the ſenſe thereof, may breathe and cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, who is the repairer of breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to raiſe up inſtruments in his room, for carrying on of his great work that he hath begun in the earth, to his own praiſe, who is alone worthy of the ſame forever.— I was twice with him over ſea, and in many places in our native land, alſo in Maryland, and in his laſt journey to viſit friends on Long-Iſland, Rhode-Iſland and New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where he had good ſervice.

               <p>ELLIS PUGH was born in the pariſh of Dolgelly, in the county of Merion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and dominion of Wales, in the ſixth month 1656. His parents were religious people; but his father died before he was born, and his mother a few days after. In the days of his youth, when going with the multitude into folly, it pleaſed God by his judgment, to ſtand in his way, and cauſed him to conſider the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his ſoul's everlaſting peace. And in the eighteenth year of his age, the Lord viſited him more eminently, kindling a zeal in him to ſerve his Creator more diligently; having been alſo reached by the teſtimony of John-ap-John, one of the people called Quakers.</p>
               <p>God who promiſed to be a father to the fatherleſs, took care of him; and about the year 1680, gave him a part in the miniſtry of the goſpel of Chriſt, (notwithſtanding he was not one of the wiſe of this world, nor had human learning) yet he was made a profitable inſtrument to turn divers from vanity, and to exhort and ſtrengthen many

in their ſpiritual journey, in his native land, and alſo in this country where he finiſhed his courſe.</p>
               <p>In the year 1686, he and his family, with divers of his acquaintance prepared to come over to Pennſylvania, and whilſt they wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſhip to be ready, there came great trouble and exerciſe upon him, ſo that he was ſick for ſome days; in which ſtrait the Lord ſhewed him, that they ſhould meet with troubles and exerciſes in their way, and that he had a work for him in that country, and muſt return again to his native land. After they ſailed, they met with ſtorms, ſtraits and troubles; and having been upon the tempeſtuous ſea all winter, they arrived at Barbados, where they were joyfully and lovingly received by their friends, and the ſummer following, in the year 1687, they arrived in Pennſylvania; where this our friend was a ſerviceable inſtrument in the Lord's hand, to cheriſh and inſtruct us, in meekneſs and tendern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His pious labours (among others that were fitted for the ſame ſervice) have been profitable in directing and edifying us in the way of truth; for by the tenderneſs and influence which came as dew upon our ſouls while we ſat under his miniſtry, we believed his doctrine was of God.</p>

After he came home, three of his children, in the flower of their age, who from their youth walked orderly and were hopeful, died within one month; in the time of which trial the Lord was near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; he mourned not as one without hope. Strength was given him to bear his affliction. He ſaid in a public meeting "If he could bear his affliction acceptably in the ſight of God, it would be as marrow to his bones:" Which teſtimony, amongſt ſeveral other things, was to the edification and comfort of the hearers. His reſidence was then nearer to us than before, which render'd his life and converſation more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and his fellowſhip more known unto us.

To another who had been viſited with great ſickneſs, he ſaid,
<q>It had been better for thee to have died in thy ſickneſs, than to live to forget God.</q>
He prayed that God would remember all his people, and that their dwelling might be with the Lord, adding,
<q>But what ſhall I ſay, there are too many that tread the teſtimony of truth under foot; O! gather them into thy fold of reſt, I pray thee O Lord!</q>
To a friend of the miniſtry he ſaid,

               <p>SHE was a woman of an exemplary life and converſation, of a ſweet and loving behaviour, and was favoured with a gift in the miniſtry.

<q>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ſmall gift, I have diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf, ſo that nothing lieth at my door. O! that the people would remember the words that I have ſpoken among them, and that this young generation would come up in truth.

not that I might have my poor children amongſt faithful friends: I have ſeen the wonders of the Lord in the deep ocean, and witneſſed his delivering arm in many exerciſes, and he hath kept me ſweet and clean all along ſince I knew the truth. Oh! that my children may remember the advice they have received of their father and me; I am clear, having done my duty.</q>
And praiſed God; alſo uttered many ſweet and comfortable expreſſions. At another time, ſhe ſaid to ſome friends,
<q>When I was but nine years old, the Lord made himſelf known unto me, but I then lived where there were no friends; and after ſome time, I went to Pennſylvania, and there met with friends, but ſome were looſe and light, others were ſolid and weighty, and with theſe I joined, and received much benefit from the family of the Lloyd's. After I was married, we went to Antigua, and there in the firſt meeting, the power of the Lord was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me, inſomuch that the peoples expectations were upon me for words; but ſoon after it pleaſed the Lord to ſend two of his ſervants, Joſiah Langdale and Thomas Thomſon, to viſit the iſland, when the power of the Lord did break in upon me like thunder:</q>
And ſignified ſhe had been faithful ever ſince in her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in giving up to the work of the Lord. On the day of her deceaſe, ſhe ſaid to ſome preſent,

that the Lord may bleſs you. The love that I feel in my heart is inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</q>
After a while ſhe deſired a friend to remember her love to Lydia Lancaſter, Elizabeth Rawlinſon and friends generally, adding,
<q>Tell them, I die in unity with all faithful friends.</q>
Afterwards ſhe ſaid,
<q>My huſband is gone, but I ſhall not be long a ſorrowful widow; yet not my will but thine be done; my ſpeech fails apace, ſweet Lord Jeſus, thou haſt loved me from a child, and I have loved thee ever ſince I knew thee, and my caſe is no doubtful caſe, I come, I come, haſten thou my journey.</q>

Two other friends coming in, he added,
<q>Now I think I have moſt of the chief friends about me that I deſired; dear friends, give me up freely, that I may not be kept longer in miſery, for I can ſay with one of old, Lord I have long wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thy ſalvation, and now have an aſſurance of it, and altho' the pains are great, yet the comfort and pleaſure I ſee before me do outbalance them all.</q>

               <p>His laſt ſickneſs continued about ſix days, wherein he was preſerved in a ſweet, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and tender frame of ſpirit, and at times ſpoke in ſubſtance as follows, viz.

<q>I would have thee ſpeak thy mind freely concerning me, for I am not afraid to die.</q>
The doctor after ſome pauſe, ſignified the doubt he had of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; which bringing an awful ſilence over his mind, he broke forth in earneſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Lord for the welfare of Sion, and exhorted friends preſent to love and unity, and to beware of that ſpirit which would lead into a ſeparation. He ſpoke clearly to the ſtates of ſome, warning them to fear the Lord and walk humbly before him, and then they would be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his divine and heavenly bleſſing. He prayed the Lord to proſper his work, and ſaid, "The Lord will cauſe his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth to break forth in the north coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and among the Ethiopians," In a ſight and ſenſe whereof he rejoiced. Another time, his wife ſitting by him, he look'd earneſtly at her and ſaid, "My dear, don't be ſurpriſed, for in time thou wilt come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that reſt that I am going into."

Taking leave of his children one by one, he charg'd them to be loving and obedient to their mother, and not to go out in their marriages. He prayed the Lord to make his paſſage eaſy, and receive him graciouſly into his arms of reſt and peace forever; and deſired his love to friends in general at their monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings, and meeting of miniſters.

miniſtry, and being obedient and faithful, he ſoon became acceptable and edifying, being ſound in word and doctrine. He was advanced to his forty-ſeventh year when he engaged in this ſervice, and having a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a great work before him, requiring his cloſe application, he drew his worldly buſineſs into a narrow compaſs, and devoted his time principally to the ſervice of truth; not only viſiting neighbouring meetings, but alſo travelled through New-Jerſey, Long-Iſland, Rhode-Iſland, New-England and Maryland; and about the year 1715 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd a viſit to friends in South-Britain. He was early appointed clerk of our month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting which ſervice he performed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years to ſatisfaction; being zealous and ſerviceable in the diſcipline, a diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender of all our religious meetings, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in obſerving the time appointed and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concern'd to exhort ſuch to amendment as were remiſs herein.</p>
               <p>In the eighth month 1721 his ſpeech was much affected by frequent attacks of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytick diſorder, but his underſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining clear, and being favour'd with the enjoyment of divine love, he was enabled to utter ſome ſentences to thoſe that viſited him, ſaying,
<q>That if conſiſtent with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will the time of his diſſolution was at hand, it would be more joyous to depart now, than continue longer in the body.</q>
Yet expreſs'd his free reſignation to the will of God, and in an humble tender frame of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:020377_0069_0FAF099C5E1C63A8"/>
ſpirit mention'd the teſtimony Chriſt gave concerning the woman who poured on his head the precious ointment, ſaying
<q>He was favoured with the evidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he had done what he could, and felt peace,</q>
Expreſſing at the ſame time,
<q>That his hope for eternal ſalvation was alone in the mercy of God through his ſon Chriſt Jeſus, the only ſaviour and mediator.</q>
Some friends who were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attend a neighbouring yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coming to viſit him, he took an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate leave of them, ſaying
<q>Remember my dear love to friends in general; tell them I am going and all is well.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He departed this life the 23<hi>d</hi> of the eighth month 1721, aged ſixty-ſeven years; and on the 25<hi>th</hi> his corpſe was borne to our meeting houſe in High-ſtreet, accompanied by many friends and neighbours, as well as friends from the adjacent country meetings, and thence to our burial ground in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where it was interr'd. Concerning whom we hope, he hath obtained an entrance into the manſions prepared by Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, for thoſe who continue faithful to the end of their time here, as did this our friend.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the eighth month 1725, I went to Derby to viſit our worthy aged friend Thomas Lightfoot, who lay very weak in body, none expecting his recovery; I called as I went from home, and then he was very ill, and told me,
<q>He thought that illneſs would conclude his time in this world, but ſaid that all was well and likewiſe that he had a great concern upon his mind for the growth and proſperity of truth in the earth, and deſired with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of ſpirit, that I would give his dear love to all friends;</q>
And he now ſaid,
<q>I never thought to ſee thee more, but am glad to ſee thee.</q>
I ſtayed there all night and in the morning we had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable heart-melting time together, in which was revived the remembrance of the many favourable ſeaſons of God's love we had enjoy'd in our travels in the work of the miniſtry of the goſpel of Chriſt, and we tenderly prayed if we never met more in this world, we might meet in that which is to come, where we might never part more, but might forever live to ſing with all the ſaints and holy angels, hallelujah to God and the Lamb.</p>
               <p>In the 9<hi>th</hi> month 1725, I was at the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of our worthy ancient friend Thomas Lightfoot. He was buried at Derby; the

meeting was the largeſt that I have ever ſeen at that place. Our dear friend was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved for his piety and virtue, his ſweet diſpoſition and lively miniſtry: The Lord was with him in his life and death and with us at his burial.</p>
               <p>This our friend removed from Ireland in an advanced age, and ſettled in Cheſter county Pennſylvania. In 1724 being then near fourſcore years of age, he with Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Kidd, a young miniſter from England, paid a general viſit to friends in New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</p>

               <p>THE memory of the righteous cannot ſoon be forgotten by thoſe who follow their footſteps, but are as memorials, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engraven on their minds, and are worthy to be had in remembrance, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was that ſteady friend and exemplary elder James Daniel, whoſe pious life and ſavoury converſation is freſh in ſome of our memories.</p>
               <p>He was born in Ireland about the year 1675; his father Neal Daniel brought him over ſea when about five years of age, and ſettled in Alloway's-Creek townſhip in the county of Salem Weſt-Jerſey; at which time the white people were but few, and the natives a multitude. He learned their language perfectly, and has frequently ſaid, that at that time the natives were a ſober,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:020377_0073_0FAF099EDD3B71B8"/>
grave and temperate people, and uſed no manner of oath in their ſpeech. About the 15<hi>th</hi> year of his age his father died, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the care of friends to be educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way of truth, which he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the love of it; and as he grew in age, he grew in experience and divine favour, and had a ſhare of the overſight of the flock and elderſhip conferred upon him, which he faithfully performed in the ſpirit of love and meekneſs, thereby rendering his ſervice acceptable and obtaining a good report. He ruled his own houſe well, having his children in ſubjection: Diligent in attending meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for worſhip and diſcipline, altho' for many years with difficulty, the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new and roads not made; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he, with conſiderable coſt and labour, got bridges erected over ſome creeks and a public road made near his own houſe. His houſe and heart were open to entertain friends according to his ability; was zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concerned for the honour of God and promotion of truth. He often lamented that as the country grew older the people grew worſe, and had corrupted the natives in their morals, teaching them bad words and the exceſſive uſe of ſtrong drink, which he, during many years in the latter part of his time, for example's ſake took none of, and frequently admoniſhed ſuch as were in the uſe thereof, to obſerve great temperance.</p>
               <p>In the latter years of his life, he deſired his eldeſt ſons to take the care of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               <p>Whilſt in health, the Lord gave him a ſenſe that his departure drew near; ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he was taken with the pleuriſy and lay about eight days, during which time he gave much good advice to his family, friends and neighbours that came to ſee him, to whom he alſo gave evident proofs of a happy exit. The day before his departure, many friends and neighbours came and had a religious meeting, after which, ſeveral taking leave, he ſaid,
<q>I am glad of this viſit and of the meeting, but I have a great concern on my mind for this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</q>
mentioning many growing evils then prevalent, and ſaid,
<q>Many of the elders are called away and more muſt ſoon; but I hope the Lord will raiſe up ſome that ſhall be faithful and zealous.</q>
The evening of his deceaſe, he took his ſolemn leave of all preſent, beginning with his wife, and afterwards his children in order, giving each ſomething in charge; to one particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſaid,
<q>Thou doſt not know what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

So remaining ſenſible until about the 10<hi>th</hi> hour, he departed like one falling into a ſweet ſleep, at his own houſe on the 26<hi>th</hi> of the tenth month 1726, in the fifty-ſecond year of his age.</p>

               <p>OUR worthy and much eſteemed friend Hannah Hill, wife of Richard Hill, and daughter of Thomas Lloyd (formerly governor of this province) by Mary the daughter of Gilbert Jones, of Welchpool, was born in Montgomeryſhire North Wales, at the ſeat of her anceſtors called Dolobran, the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of the ſeventh month 1666. She was a woman highly favoured of the Lord, poſſeſſed many excellent chriſtian virtues, as well as natural accompliſhments: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over into this country with her parents when young; ſoon after their arrival it pleaſed the Lord to remove her pious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by death, when the care of the younger children devolved upon her: This cloſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the earlier part of her time, was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſanctified to her; for her mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged to ſeek the Lord for her porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and her father's God for the lot of her inheritance, he was graciouſly pleaſed, not only to favour her with the knowledge of himſelf and the enjoyment of his living preſence in the days of her youth, but alſo
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:020377_0078_0FAF09A4B4802F80"/>
made her a ſingular inſtrument of good, and a bleſſing to her father's family. As ſhe grew in years, her conſpicuous virtues, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a courteous deportment, juſtly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eſteem and favour of moſt if not all with whom ſhe converſed. Being earneſtly ſolicited in marriage by John Delaval, who (tho' a worthy man) was not at that time of the ſame religious communion, ſhe, by her prudent conduct and pious reſolution to maintain the principles ſhe profeſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deviating therefrom in a matter of ſuch importance, did not agree thereto; until he after ſome time embraced the truth in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart, and bore his croſs like an humble follower of Chriſt; he received a gift in the miniſtry, and continued faithful therein to his death: Concerning whom ſhe gave this teſtimony, viz. "That he never uſed to her an expreſſion of anger, or the product of a diſturbed mind." The deceaſe of her ſaid huſband proved to her a time of deep probation, having been heard to ſay, that in eight weeks time ſhe loſt eight of her family by death, beginning with the deceaſe of her beloved huſband, and ending with that of her only child: Under which afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, as well as what attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the remaining part of her life (of which ſhe had a large ſhare) ſhe approved herſelf a ſhining example of patience in tribulation, and a meek, humble, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying follower of Chriſt.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:020377_0079_0FAF09A5C1419050"/>In the affluent ſtation wherein divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had placed her, her benevolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was conſpicuous in adminiſtring to the neceſſities of the indigent, her charity not being limited to thoſe of her own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. She was a true ſervant of the church, and in the ſenſe of the apoſtle's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, "One that waſhed the ſaints feet," receiving with joy into her houſe, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and meſſengers of the goſpel, for whom her love was great: The low, the poor and the mean, were objects of her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar care.</p>
               <p>In her younger years ſhe received a gift in the miniſtry, which ſhe retained with faithfulneſs to the end; and tho' not large in her appearance, yet with great modeſty and ſoundneſs of expreſſion, "Her doctrine drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as the dew, and diſtilled as the ſmall rain," and was therefore truly acceptable. She travelled in the ſervice of the goſpel, to New-England and divers other parts of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and was alſo concern'd for the good order and diſcipline of the church, having for a number of years, ſerved in the ſtation of clerk of the women's monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings, wherein ſhe gave ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Although bodily weakneſs frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her in the latter years of her life, it did not abate her love and zeal for the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth, which ſhe experienced to be her ſupport in every time of trial; and when her diſſolution drew near, ſhe made divers
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:020377_0080_0FAF09A960EC3900"/>
ſeaſonable remarks and obſervations, alſo ſignified her acquieſcence with the divine will, in the diſpenſations of his providence towards her; at one time particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the expreſſions of the apoſtle,
<q>That no chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheleſs, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs unto them which are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed thereby.</q>
This was her happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and after a well-ſpent life, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with a variety of exerciſing viciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, ſhe exchanged this ſtate of exiſtence (no doubt) for a bleſſed immortality in the regions of unmixed felicity; after about three weeks illneſs, on the 25<hi>th</hi> of the twelfth month 1726-7, in the ſixty-firſt year of her age. Her corpſe was reſpectfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a large number of friends and others, to the High-ſtreet meeting-houſe in Philadelphia, where divers living teſtimonies were borne, after which it was interr'd in friends burial ground.</p>
               <p>She was twenty-ſix years the wife of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Hill, who was a ſerviceable member both in church and ſtate, and died in good eſteem, the 4<hi>th</hi> of the ſeventh month 1729.</p>

                  <q>My wife was religiouſly inclined in her young years, and zealouſly concerned to obſerve the ceremonies of the church of England, and I believe (as ſhe has often told me) ſhe aimed ſincerely therein at God's glory and the ſalvation of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul. After we were joined in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſhe continued very zealous in that way; but when a weighty concern came upon my mind for the well-being of my immortal ſoul, I ſaw it very needful for me to make a narrow ſearch after the beſt way, and thoſe people who performed that worſhip and ſervice that was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before God; and being in a weighty frame of ſpirit, the people called Quakers came before the view of my mind; and hearing of a book of George Fox the younger's, to be at a relation's houſe, I was willing to go thither for it, and in the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:020377_0084_0FAF09AC2E5F27A0"/>
reading thereof, I was ſo well ſatisfied, that I can truly ſay, what I then read, anſwered the witneſs of God in my own boſom, as "Face anſwereth face in a glaſs:" But ſoon after I came home, my wife per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me to be more ſerious and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in my ſpirit than formerly, was jealous I had an inclination towards that way which the people called Quakers made profeſſion of; and finding I had the ſaid book, came up to the chamber where I was, and cautioned me not to be beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I ſpoke to her in ſimplicity and much brokenneſs of heart, of the ſenſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I had, that thoſe who were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that divine principle which the people called Quakers bore teſtimony to, were the people God owned, or to that import; and it reached to God's witneſs in her, that we parted in much tenderneſs at that time. However ſhe continued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what zealous in her way ſtill, and would be often arguing with me in vindication thereof, much about twelve months; but at one time, when ſhe was at their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Prieſt denounced his excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication againſt me, and ſhe being in a ſeat juſt under him, it came ſo near her that ſhe was nigh to faint away; when their worſhip was over, ſhe went to the Prieſt and ſpoke ſomewhat home to him, and that ſhe thought ſhe deſerved more civility, at leaſt ſo much as to know afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of their excommunication, for he
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:020377_0085_0FAF09AD0D556FD8"/>
might know that ſhe ſincerely loved her huſband tho' he diſſented from her in judgment. And after that time, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more willing to ſearch cloſely into the weighty work of the ſalvation of her immortal ſoul; and the Lord's love was manifeſted to her, that in a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, her underſtanding came to be opened, and ſhe came to be convinced of God's everlaſting truth, that was promiſed
<q>To lead into all truth.</q>
And having taſted of that living bread that gives life to the ſoul, ſhe came withal to ſee there was no need of the outward bread, which formerly ſhe was zealous and conſcientious in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, to commemorate the death and paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the true remembrancer being come and witneſſed, even he
<q>Who ſtands at the door of men's hearts for an entrance, that he may come to ſup with them and they with him.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Soon after our convincement, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ſouls muſtered his forces, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtifle our convictions, and we were hard put to it both within and without, but as our eyes were to the Lord, and in poverty and humility of ſpirit we leaned upon him, he made the hard things eaſy, and in the ſenſe of his divine love which was often ſhed abroad in our hearts, we were made willing to deny ourſelves, to take up the croſs, and to deſpiſe the ſhame. And tho' we were but a few, we thought it convenient to meet together to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:020377_0086_0FAF09AF75DE0618"/>
wait upon the Lord, being fully ſatisfied it was a duty incumbent upon his people in all ages; and in the performance of our duty herein in the year 1675, ſeveral friends were taken from our houſe at two ſeveral times, and brought before two juſtices of the peace, who tendered the oath of allegiance and ſupremacy to them, and becauſe, for conſcience ſake, they could not break the command of Chriſt who ſaid "Swear not at all," they were committed to priſon, where they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about fourteen weeks, and then were ſet at liberty; ever ſince which, the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has been kept either at our houſe or at the meeting-houſe, quietly without any more diſturbance.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Sometime before the year 1683, we heard that our eſteemed friend William Penn, had a patent from king Charles the ſecond, for that province in America call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pennſylvania; and my wife had a great inclination to go thither, and thought it might be a good place to train up children amongſt ſober people, and to prevent the corruption of them here, by the looſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the youth and the bad example of too many of thoſe of riper years; ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me therewith, but I then thought it not likely to take effect for ſeveral reaſons; but as I was ſenſible her aim was upright on account of our children, I was willing to weigh the matter in a true balance; and I can truly ſay, my way was made
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:020377_0087_0FAF09B06623CB40"/>
eaſy and clear to go thither, beyond my expectation; and it was the Lord's great mercy to preſerve us over the great deep to our deſired port: And what hardſhips we met at the beginning of our ſettlement, the Lord was our helper and ſupport to go through: And I can in a ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance ſay, many were the bleſſed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we had with God's people in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote country, and I believe and am well ſatisfied that the Lord has a remnant there, that ſincerely aim at his glory and the proſperity of his truth, bleſſed and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be his holy name forever.</q>

                  <q>We ſtaid there many years, and had four of our children married with our conſent, and they had ſeveral children, and the aim intended by my wife, was in a good meaſure anſwered.—When a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concern came upon my mind to return to my native country, and that chiefly on truth's account. I laid it before my wife, and ſhe could not be eaſy to ſtay behind me, and we came over in the year 1704; and through the Lord's great mercy we were preſerved in that tedious voyage, north about Scotland through many difficulties, and from the cruelties alſo of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, of which there were many then on that coaſt, as we were afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.— This wonderful preſervation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be remembered with thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; having loſt the fleet, we were only four ſhips coming together from Virginia,

and one of them belonging to Briſtol, we thought to remove to that ſhip, becauſe Briſtol was nearer to our habitation in Wales than London, whither our veſſel was bound; we agreed with the maſter for our paſſage, and next morning we were to go on board, but that night I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a weighty exerciſe about our removal, but in the morning it happened to be ſo ſtormy that he could not take us in, ſo he parted from us, and bore his courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Briſtol; then the weight I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was removed, and I was very eaſy in my ſpirit; and as I was afterward inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhip was taken near to Lundy Iſland: This deliverance therefore and preſervation of us, I aſcribe to the Lord's great favour and mercy towards us, thanks, honour and praiſes be rendered and aſcribed to him for the ſame and all other mercies forever.</q>

Her houſe and heart ſince her convincement, were open to receive the Lord's meſſengers, both here and in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and ſhe was very careful and open hearted to help the poor and weak, both amongſt us and others. In her laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe was ſenſible ſhe was not like to recover out of it, and ſhe was ſatisfied and contented therein to ſubmit to the Lord's will; ſpeaking to me, ſhe ſaid,
<q>I take it as a great mercy that I am to go before thee, we are upwards of forty-five years married, and our love is rather more now towards one another, than at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yet I am willing to part with all, for the Lord is better than all.</q>

great love towards them and me, in that they are gone to their reſt, and ſhall never partake of thoſe exerciſes and ſorrows theſe do that remain in the world; and then my ſoul was poured forth before the Lord for them that remain, that as they grow up in years, they may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt; or elſe I would rather follow them to their graves whilſt they are young, than that they ſhould live to the diſhonour of his worthy name: And then a more general and weighty concern came upon me for friends children that are grown up and do not come under the yoke nor bear the croſs.

In the laſt monthly-meeting he attended he was taken unwell, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaid to divers friends preſent, "I am glad I was here to day, for I had a lively meeting, and though I now feel much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the infirmities attending my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced age, yet I can ſay, truth is as dear and as ſweet as ever."

His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition continued a few days, which he bore with chriſtian patience, expreſſing "His ſenſe of his near arrival at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of reſt and quiet, where none could make him afraid." He expired at the houſe of his ſon-in-law John Evans, in the eighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year of his age, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Plymouth, (to which particular meeting he belonged) in the ſeventh month 1729.

And I deſire thee (if I go) by a few lines, to remember my kind love to friends, deſiring they may ſtand in the counſel of God; for I have often rejoiced and been glad, to ſee friends ſtand in his counſel and keep their places in the truth; and on the contrary, it has often wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſpirit, to ſee thoſe that have made a profeſſion of the truth, (and ſome of them children of good parents) take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due liberty, taking pleaſure in vanity and folly, and neglecting that which would be to their everlaſting peace.

He was of a ſprightly genius, affable diſpoſition, and even temper, which, as he grew to manhood, gave him eaſy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to company, eſteemed the better ſort. A viſitation of divine love being extended to him about the twenty-ſecond year of his age, he like Zaccheus, made haſte, and with joy embraced, both the meſſage and the meſſenger of ſalvation: And being endued with a gift in the miniſtry, acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf "As a workman that need not be aſhamed," and had great place in the minds of men.

               <p>By which it will appear, that he was, in the early part of his life, ſenſibly affected with the viſitation of divine life and grace, and, by adhering thereunto, was preſerved from the vanities and follies, which often divert and alienate the minds of youth from the due remembrance and awful regard of their creator; ſo that he was enabled to bear a teſtimony of chriſtian patience and ſelf-denial in his youthful days, and, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under that exerciſe, as he advanced in years, attained to further knowledge and experience in the work of religion, in which he had a ſight of the neceſſity of keeping in a ſtate of humility, and of bearing the croſs of Chriſt, which mortified him to the world; ſo that the loſs many ſuſtain by the anxious purſuit of the lawful things thereof appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, he was concerned to avoid it, and in obedience to the precept of Chriſt, to <hi>ſeek firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs,</hi> having faith in his promiſe, <hi>that all theſe things</hi> (neceſſary for him) <hi>ſhould be added.</hi>

and religious labours were bleſſed with the deſired ſucceſs, of which there are yet ſome witneſſes living, and others, who were convinced of the principles of truth by his means, became ſerviceable members of the church, and continued therein to the end of their lives.</p>
               <p>But as the wiſe king Solomon formerly obſerved, that <hi>one event cometh to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to the wicked,</hi> ſo it happened to this good man, who met with various loſſes and diſappointments in his temporal eſtate; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, the circumſtances of his affairs engaged him to undertake ſome buſineſs, in the management of which he was obliged to croſs the ſeas frequently: This, however, did not abate his zeal and religious care to make uſe of all opportunities of viſiting the meetings of friends when among them, and of calling, at other times, to ſuch who might be accounted as <hi>the outcaſt of Iſrael, and the diſperſed of Judah, or as ſheep not yet of the fold of Chriſt;</hi> and his ſervices of that kind are worthy to be commemorated, having been often productive of good effects.</p>

lawgiver, and more eſpecially thoſe expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſermon on the mount (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſum of our moral and religious duties) ſo he manifeſted himſelf to be one of that number, whom Chriſt compared to the wiſe builder, who laid a ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that his building ſtood unſhaken by the various floods and winds of tribulations and temptations he met with, both from within and without.</p>
               <p>He was a lover of unity amongſt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and careful to promote and maintain it, ſhewing the example of a meek, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and loving deportment, not only to friends, but to all others, with whom he had converſation or dealings; ſo that it may be truly ſaid, that <hi>few have lived ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved and reſpected among us</hi>: And it was manifeſt this did not proceed from a deſire of being popular, or to be ſeen of man: For his love and regard to peace did not divert him from the diſcharge of his duty in a faithful teſtimony to thoſe that profeſſed the truth, that they ought to be careful to maintain good works; and he was often concerned zealouſly to incite and preſs friends to the exerciſe of the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the wiſdom of truth, by admoniſhing, warning, and timely treating with ſuch as fell ſhort of their duty therein, and by teſtifying againſt thoſe who, after loving and brotherly care and endeavours, could not be brought to

               <p>The ſeveral Eſſays he wrote on religious ſubjects at ſea, are further proofs that his mind was principally engaged in the great buſineſs and concern of religion; and as he continued under the ſame engagement to the end, we are fully perſuaded the words with which he concluded his laſt public teſtimony on the iſland of Tortola, may be truly and properly applied to him, <hi>that he had fought a good fight, and had kept the faith, and</hi> we doubt not, <hi>he now enjoys a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>Much more might be truly ſaid of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, faithfulneſs and worth, but we do not think it neceſſary; our chief intention being to expreſs our reſpectful remembrance of him, and our unity with his labours and ſervices; and we are ſincerely deſirous, that the glory of every good and perfect work may be attributed to that divine power alone, which can qualify others to ſupply the places of thoſe faithful miniſters and ſervants of Chriſt, who have been of late years removed from among us, and are of that number, of whom it is written, <hi>bleſſed are the dead, which die in the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, yea, ſaith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>I early found a concern on my mind to viſit friends in Maryland, which I did on both ſides of the bay (Cheaſapeak) in fear and trembling, being young and weak, and the work very exerciſing by reaſon of an obvious declenſion, which occaſioned me much exerciſe in ſpeaking and writing againſt the ſpirit of liberty, ſuperfluity, and conformity to the world, for a teſtimony againſt which, in many particulars, ancient friends ſuffered much; but now, with many is the offence of that croſs ceaſed, and friend's ſufferings tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon, to the great grief of my ſpirit, reſpecting tythes, apparel &amp;c. And as the Lord hath been pleaſed to commit a part of the miniſtry to me, and of that part which is more neceſſary than deſirable, in this age of the church, he hath been graciouſly pleaſed hitherto to furniſh with a ſuitable ability for his honour, and my faithful diſcharge of duty; for, as before my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance I was long under the concern, being fully convinced it was required of me, but giving way to reaſonings, the ſuggeſtions and buffetings of Satan, I was likely to loſe my condition, had not the Lord been very gracious, who knew that I did not hold back obſtinately, but thro' human weakneſs, and contempt of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſuch a weighty ſervice; ſo in a
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:020377_0118_0FAF085876E8E668"/>
deep travail of ſoul once in a meeting, breathing for ſtrength to bring forth, I deſired, that the Lord would commit the hardeſt part of the work to my charge, which I think was granted, and a hard travail I had in my firſt appearance; but it fared otherwiſe with my brother, whom I prefer, he was not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion, ſubmitting ſpeedily to the call, and has been very proſperous hitherto; may the Lord preſerve us ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and faithful to the end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, we travelled together in Maryland, viſiting friends on each ſide of the bay, and at the yearly-meeting near Choptank, having meetings alſo in the way on our return, and were frequently employed and zealouſly concerned in the Lord's work; bleſſed be his name who hath called us out of darkneſs, and with the day ſpring from on high viſited our ſouls, accounting us worthy of this high vocation, even to hold forth the glory of this goſpel day, giving encouragement and enlargement of heart in the myſteries and doctrines of his kingdom, ſo that in the ability of divine faith, we frequently travelled about, both in Virginia and Carolina, while young; but as there is a diverſity of gifts, ſo there is of operation, according to the good pleaſure of our great benefactor, and the emergency of times and occaſions; ſo let not us of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, imitate one another in this reſpect,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:020377_0119_0FAF085B9B5F00F8"/>
but be careful, dear friends, to keep to our true guide, the holy ſpirit, for youth is warm, zealous, and without ſeaſonable caution and watchfulneſs, apt to exceed ability and experience, and ſo may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and ſuſtain loſs and injury.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1722, he performed a religious viſit as far as New-England, which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him about ten months, and on his return home, he was ſued in the beginning of the following year for prieſts wages, and for his refuſal to comply with the demand, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the magiſtrates in writing, ſundry conſiderations, which being taken amiſs, he was, after ſome time, indicted by the grand jury, and ſummoned before the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and council; in this time of trial (he ſays)
<q>Some forſook me as being aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my teſtimony, and of my ſufferings for it; at my firſt appearance the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the dragon was felt, his dark pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeeming to be great and terrible, as though he would have ſwallowed me up quick, and truth's adverſaries ſeemed to rejoice, for I was made to ſtand like a fool for them to glory over me; however my mind being compoſed, and ſtayed in ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the Lord, with earneſt breathings for divine aid in this his cauſe, for which and myſelf, I found it ſafeſt to ſay little at that time, being greatly deſirous that I might not give way one jot from my teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, through fear even of death itſelf, for I thought I felt the bitterneſs of it ſtrike at my natural life.</q>

                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:020377_0120_0FAF085C8B6196E8"/>
                  <q>On the day when final judgment on the caſe was to be given, I was brought before them the third time, and they demanded what I had further to ſay before ſentence was paſſed; I then deſired liberty to make my defence, and to give my ſenſe on the contents of my paper, the commiſſary or chief prieſt having perverted my meaning, which requeſt the governor ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to allow, but it was afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as I apprehend, through the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the prieſt, howbeit I told them I remembred to have read a proviſo of an act of parliament, that no man ſhould be puniſhed for any offence againſt the act, unleſs he was proſecuted within three months after the fact, but this, ſaid I, was about ſeven months after; but ſome of the court reſolving on ſeverity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to ſubmit, they proceeded to give ſentence of a years impriſonment, or bonds with ſecurity for good behaviour &amp;c. when with a compoſed mind and an audible voice, I ſaid, <hi>this is an hard ſentence and I pray God to forgive mine adverſaries,</hi> which affected divers of the byſtanders with tears, and one in particular, a judge, and man of note, was much affected, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acquainted, and converſed with me more than once, appears to be a tender man, and well convinced, having ſince gladly received meetings into his houſe, and as he has told me, laid down his commiſſion.—</q>

                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:020377_0121_0FAF085DA67CFF30"/>
                  <q>Being committed to priſon, I was firſt placed in the debtors apartment, but in a few days was removed into the common ſide, where condemned perſons are kept, and for ſometime had not the privilege of ſeeing any body, except a negro who once a day brought water to the priſoners; this place was ſo dark, that I could not ſee to read even at noon, without creeping to ſmall holes in the door; being alſo very noiſome, the infectious air brought on me the flux, that, had not the Lord been pleaſed to have ſuſtained me by his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hand, I had there loſt my life; the governor was made acquainted with my condition, and I believe uſed his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for my liberty: The commiſſary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited me more than once under a ſhew of friendſhip, but with a view to enſnare me, and I was very weary of him. I wrote again to the governor, to acquaint him of my ſituation; ſo after a confinement of three weeks, I was diſcharged, without any acknowledgment or compliance, and this brought me into an acquaintance, and ready admittance to the governor, who ſaid I was a meek man &amp;c.—Thus I returned home with praiſe and thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my heart to the Lord, who had cauſed his truth to triumph over the ſtrong efforts of man and the powers of the earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1725, accompanied by Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pleaſants, he again viſited friends in Maryland, and the yearly-meeting near
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:020377_0122_0FAF085DC7BE96F8"/>
Choptank. My concern here (he ſays)
<q>Was principally to labour for the reſtoration of wholeſome diſcipline, the neglect whereof I conceive has been a great cauſe of the diſorder and undue liberty prevailing among the profeſſors of truth there, and when the ſervice of this meeting was over, we viſited the meetings on the weſtern ſhore, and returned home, having left an example of that uſeful and neceſſary prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of viſiting families, joining friends therein for ſometime; we are, thanks be to God, come and coming into the ſame in Virginia, which, with ſome aſſiſtance, I have pretty generally performed through our monthly-meeting, and never, I think, was more ſenſible of the company and ability of truth in any ſervice, according to the dignity of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A malicious perſon getting into his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, the judgment obtained againſt him for the demand of tythes before mentioned, had ſeven of his cattle ſeized and appraiſed, but deferred taking them away until about two years after, when he procured a new action againſt him, alledging, but not prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Robert had converted at leaſt a part of them to his own uſe, and ſo manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the matter in his abſence, as to make the debt amount to twenty-pounds, tho' the demand was but eight-pounds, and ſerving the execution on his body, he was again committed to priſon in the twelfth month 1727, where being confined fifteen weeks,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:020377_0123_0FAF085E72912508"/>
he was at length diſcharged, without any perſon paying any thing for him, which he would not ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Soon after he was brought under a trial, with others of his friends, by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of a militia-law, whereupon they addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed governor Gooch on his arrival, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him their ſufferings by ſpoil of goods and impriſonment, which, with the friends who attended on the occaſion, he received with kindneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Having this year (he remarks) ſuffered perſecution in body and eſtate, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to a greater affliction, (all which doth and will work for good) my dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate wife was called away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next year 1728, he embark'd for Great-Britain, with our friend Samuel Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, who had accompliſhed his journeys on this continent in the ſervice of the goſpel; and after performing a religious viſit to the meetings of friends in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, he proceeded to Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, and arrived from thence in this city in 1730, then went to Virginia, and in the ſame year performed a viſit as far eaſtward as Rhode-Iſland, accompanied by his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend Caleb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The following year intermarrying with Mary the widow of Richard Hill, he became a member of our monthly-meeting, and after a viſit to the meetings of friends in Maryland and Virginia, he embark'd on a ſecond viſit to Great-Britain, from whence
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:020377_0124_0FAF085F35C601A8"/>
he returned in the ſummer of 1734, between which time and the year 1738, he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another viſit eaſtward, and three to the ſouthern provinces, beſides one to South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina and Georgia, and from thence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Rhode-Iſland, and to Boſton, and in 1740 he went on a ſecond viſit to Barbados, and in the ſucceeding year, accompanied by Caleb Raper, he accompliſhed his laſt viſit eaſtward as far as Boſton.</p>
               <p>Hereby we may obſerve his unwearied ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and exerciſe, to fulfill the miniſtry which he had received of the Lord. He was a member of this meeting above ten years, and tho' his time was much employed in his religious duties abroad, he did not omit the adjacent meetings, being induſtrious and laborious for the general welfare and proſperity of the churches; for the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof he was, through the divine anointing, eminently qualified.</p>
               <p>His miniſtry being convincing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory, his delivery graceful but unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in prayer he was ſolemn and reverent; he delighted in meditation, recommending by example, religious retirement in his familiar viſits among his friends; in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents he was generous and charitable, yet a firm oppoſer of obſtinate libertines in principles or practice, demonſtrating his love to the cauſe of Religion and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs above all other conſiderations, being careful to adorn the doctrine of the goſpel, by a life of piety and benevolence, and we

have ground to hope and believe he was, prepared for the ſudden ſummons from his pilgrimage here, which was on the fifth day of the eighth month O. S. 1742, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the houſe of one of his moſt intimate friends on the third day of the week in the morning, waiting for the hour of meeting, he was ſeized with a fit of the apoplexy, which very ſoon deprived him of ſpeech, and he died about midnight following, in the forty-ninth year of his age, being a miniſter about 24 years; his burial on the 7<hi>th</hi> of the ſame month was attended by a great number of his fellow-citizens, to our meeting-houſe in High-ſtreet, and thence to the grave-yard.</p>

               <p>THE remembrance of our dear deceaſed friend John Eſtaugh, remains as a good ſavour on many of our minds. He was born in Keldevon in Eſſex in Great-Britain, on the 23<hi>d</hi> of the ſecond month 1676. In the year 1700, he came over to America on a religious viſit, which he performed to the great ſatisfaction of friends; after which, he ſettled at Haddonfield, in the county of Glouceſter, and weſtern diviſion of New-Jerſey. He has been heard to ſay, that when he firſt ſettled in our parts, he was
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:020377_0127_0FAF08619E4027E8"/>
nearly united to a ſolid remnant of friends that then belonged to Newtown-meeting, and that he had been careful to feel the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the father's love in viſiting neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring meetings, in many of which, he was favoured to miniſter ſuitably to the ſtates and conditions of thoſe that heard him; he being as a ſcribe well inſtructed, who brought forth out of the heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, things both new and old.—Since his firſt ſettlement among us, he viſited friends in England, Ireland, New-England and ſome of the Weſt-India-Iſlands, ſeveral times. He was an humble minded exemplary friend, ſolid and grave in his deportment, well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a miniſter of Chriſt, zealous for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving good order in the church, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining love and unity, that badge of true diſcipleſhip, remarkably careful in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation among men, his words being few and ſavoury.

               <p>SINCE it pleaſed divine providence ſo highly to favour me, with being the near companion of this dear worthy, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altogether ſilent, but muſt give ſome ſmall account of the early working of truth in him. He was born of religious parents, but grew uneaſy with the religious profeſſions of both father and mother who were of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſuaſions, and being a ſeeker, fell in with the baptiſts, and liked them ſo well he was near joining them. But a neighbour who was a friend, being dead, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the burial, where that worthy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the goſpel, Francis Stamper of London, being led to ſpeak with life and power directly to his ſtate, it made ſuch deep impreſſions on his tender mind, that put him upon ſearch into the principles of friends, and being fully ſatisfied, joined with them in the ſeventeenth year of his age.</p>
               <p>About the eighteenth year of his age, he came forth in the miniſtry, and being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he grew in his gift, ſo that in ſome time he travelled to viſit friends in the north of England, and Scotland, and in the year 1700 came over on a viſit to friends in America. We were married on the firſt day of the tenth
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:020377_0129_0FAF08651E46B3B0"/>
month 1702, and ſettled at Haddonfield in New-Jerſey. In the fore part of his time he travelled pretty much; but in the latter part he was prevented therefrom by an infirmity of body; and his good maſter, who requires no impoſſibilities of his ſervants, favoured him with being eaſy at home; where thro' mercy, we lived very comfortably; few, if any, in a married ſtate, ever lived in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er harmony than we did.

This brought on him a deep exerciſe, but when he was confirmed it was really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, he gave up to it; and was then weaned from home, and the company there which uſed to be ſo pleaſant to him. He firſt wrote to friends on that iſland; but finding that would not excuſe him, he durſt no longer delay; ſo, on the 13<hi>th</hi> of the eighth month 1742, we parted in the aboundings of love and affection. And now, the moſt acceptable account I can give of his ſervice in Tortola, is extracted from two letters which I received from a friend of that place, directed to me, and to the following effect, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:020377_0130_0FAF0865872DA580"/>
                  <q>On the eighth of the ninth month 1742, he arrived at the houſe of John Pickering with his companion John Cadwalader, where they were received with much love and great joy, being made to rejoice together in the tender mercies and love of God, which was greatly manifeſted that day, to the honour and praiſe of his great name, and alſo to the comforting of his poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The teſtimonies of theſe ſervants of the Lord were with life and power, and were as clouds fill'd with rain upon a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty land.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But to be more particular concerning thy dear huſband, whoſe memory is dear and precious to me, and many more whoſe hearts were open to receive the glad-ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings which he brought. His godly life and converſation ſpoke him to be a true follower of the the Lamb, and miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, whom he freely preached, and by the effectual power of whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, was he called forth to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for which we bleſs, praiſe and magnify the God of all our mercies: And as a faithful meſſenger, with much love, in a tender frame of ſpirit, would he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite all to the fountain which had healed him. O! the deep humility that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him in the time of his public teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and when in private converſation with his near and dear friends, as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid we were to him, how cheerful and pleaſant would he be, in that bleſſed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:020377_0131_0FAF08669CA4C380"/>
wherein Chriſt had made him free, Innocent, harmleſs, of a cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet not without a chriſtian gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity well becoming the doctrine he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He was valiant for the truth to the laſt, and tho' he is gone to his grave, his memory is ſweet and precious.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He had his health very well until the death of his dear companion; but going to his burial, we were caught in a ſhower of rain, which we and he believed was the occaſion of his illneſs. However, he was mightily favoured with the divine preſence, which enabled him to anſwer the ſervice of that day; and the next, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt day of the week, we had a bleſſed meeting, the Lord's preſence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying us; and tho' thy dear hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was ſo near his end, his candle ſhin'd as bright as ever, and many that beheld it were made to glorify God on his behalf, This was the laſt opportunity on this iſland, ſave his farewell upon his dying bed, where he both preached and prayed, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his departure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>On the next day, being the ſecond day of the week, he went to a little iſland call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jos Vandicks, accompanied with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral friends; but on the 3<hi>d</hi> day in the morning he complained very much, yet was enabled to go to meeting, where a pretty many people were aſſembled, and a bleſſed opportunity we had together, to the tendring and melting our hearts into a heavenly frame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:020377_0132_0FAF0866B87B4250"/>
                  <q>But he who never ſpared his labour whilſt amongſt us, extending his voice as a trumpet of the Lord's own ſounding, was ſo inwardly ſpent he was ready to faint. However, he went on board the ſloop that afternoon, and next morning came aſhore at our houſe; where he had not been long before a ſhivering fit ſeized him, and a fever ſoon followed, which kept its conſtant courſe every day. This being the 1<hi>ſt</hi> day of the tenth month, he took great notice that it ended forty years ſince his marriage with thee; that during that time you had lived in much love, and parted in the ſame; and that thou waſt his greateſt concern of all outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And tho' the laſt two days he was in much pain, yet he was preſerved under it in much patience and reſignation, and had his perfect ſenſes to the laſt, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends to faithfulneſs, &amp;c. And on, the 6<hi>th</hi> day of the tenth month, about ſix-o'clock at night, he went away like a lamb, with praiſes and thankſgivings in his lips but about two minutes before.</q>
Thus far from the ſaid letters.</p>
               <p>And thus finiſhed this dear worthy in the ſixty-ſeventh year of his age; highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by his great and good maſter in the very extreme moments; the conſideration whereof, and the account given of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, afford me, at times, ſome relief. And I have a ſecret ſatisfaction in that I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to give him up (tho' ſo dear to me)
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:020377_0133_0FAF086789CD27C0"/>
unto the ſervice into which he was called. This is a hint for thoſe who may be under the like exerciſe and trial, that they may not hold back, but ſubmit, and freely give up their all, leaving the conſequence to the wiſe diſpoſing hand, who knows for what cauſe it is, he is pleaſed ſo nearly to try his people.</p>

               <p>HE was the eldeſt ſon of John and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothy Pleaſants, and born the 3<hi>d</hi> of the ninth month 1695; being a youth of good natural parts, and well instructed in ſchool-learning. His father dying whilſt he was young, he was deprived of the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal advantage, of the admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of a worthy parent, ſo beneficial to the forming the minds of youth: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had an eye to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and about the twenty-ninth year of his age was called to the work of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, in which he laboured both amongſt friends and other people much to ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having meetings where none had been held before. Once, in company with his brother Robert Jordan, he viſited friends on the weſtern ſhore of Maryland, and alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the yearly-meeting at Choptank, on the eaſtern ſhore. His ſervices ſeemed much confined to his own country, where, tho' the number of friends was ſmall, he was not diſcouraged thereat, but endeavoured to diſcharge his duty amongſt them, not only at the adjacent meetings but thoſe more at a diſtance, and was made inſtrumental in convincing ſeveral in the upper parts of the colony, as well as in ſettling two or three meetings. A few years before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, he wrote an epiſtle, directed to friends

He was indeed a man much devoted to the ſervice of truth, and a conſiderable ſufferer for bearing his teſtimony againſt prieſts-wages, having once been a priſoner on that account. He married Mary the daughter of Robert Jordan of Nancemond county, and left a numerous offspring, ſome of them young, for whoſe eternal welfare he was particularly ſolicitous; being once on a viſit to friends at ſome diſtance from home, he was taken very ill, and ſeemed deſirous that he might finiſh his courſe among his dear children, in order that he might have an opportunity at that awful period, of enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his experienced advices to them, and promoting the cauſe of God to which he was much devoted to the laſt. Accordingly he departed this life at his own houſe the 24<hi>th</hi> of the eleventh month 1744, and on the 28<hi>th</hi> of the ſame month was interr'd in the family burying-ground at Curles, attended by a numerous company of friends and neighbours.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HE was a native of the principality of Wales, and arrived in Pennſylvania in the year 1698. And altho' he was not then in profeſſion with friends, yet he ſoon after entered into cloſe fellowſhip with them, and continued ſtedfaſt to his end. He was a diligent and ſeaſonable attender of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious meetings: On firſt days particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was ready an hour before the time appointed, and then read ſeveral chapters in the bible or ſome religious book: As the time approached, he would frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the time of day, and by means of ſuch watchful care, he was ſeated in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one of the firſt, and ſcarcely ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time appointed. The gravity and compoſure of his countenance as he ſat in ſilence, was no leſs remarkable than his punctual attendance, and beſpoke ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward recollection and divine engagement of mind, as often attracted the eyes and affected the hearts of others.</p>
               <p>He received a gift in the miniſtry, in the exerciſe whereof, he was generally led to ſpeak of his own experience in religion and the chriſtian warfare; and his teſtimony, tho' ſhort, was inſtructive, lively, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly attended with divine ſweetneſs: Notwithſtanding it was always acceptable,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:020377_0138_0FAF086B348B4370"/>
he was very cautious of appearing, leſt any, as he often ſaid, ſhould be drawn from a right concern of mind, to place their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on words.</p>
               <p>He was zealouſly concerned for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and promotion of truth, and ſupport of our chriſtian diſcipline; and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with diſcerning, and clear judgment tempered with charity, he was very uſeful in many ſervices of the church, eſpecially that weighty one of viſiting friends in their families. And altho' he was naturally of a warm diſpoſition, yet a tender regard to the ſervice of truth, and a continual awe of the divine preſence preſided in his heart, inſomuch that meekneſs and condeſcention were conſpicuous in his conduct.</p>
               <p>There was a freedom and affability in his behaviour and converſation, which indicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a benevolence of heart, and endeared him, not only to the <hi>houſhold of faith,</hi> but alſo to the profligate and vain; rendering him ſerviceable in compoſing differences, and in comforting the ſick and afflicted; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that ſkilful and tender office of healing diſcord in private families, wherein his endeavours were remarkably ſucceſsful. In ſuch ſervices, he ſpent much of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his life, riding about from one houſe to another; and where no cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion appeared, he interſperſed his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on common affairs, with uſeful hints, ſolid remarks, and leſſons of inſtruction. But where admonition or comfort were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:020377_0139_0FAF086C10709670"/>
the propriety of his advice and the uprightneſs of his life, added weight to his labours, and ſeldom failed of good effects.</p>
               <p>In private life, few had a better claim to the virtues of temperance, juſtice, induſtry and frugality, and as he well knew how advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous it was, "To train up a child in the way he ſhould walk," he took frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to drop his experienced advice among thoſe under his care. It was his practice, in winter evenings eſpecially, to read the holy ſcriptures in his family, and was particularly careful that neither child nor ſervant ſhould be from home at unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being highly ſenſible how ſlippery the paths of youth are, and how numerous the ſnares which attend them.</p>
               <p>He was greatly favoured in the uſe of his natural abilities, and enjoyed an uncommon ſhare of health until his laſt illneſs, which was ſhort; during that time, very many came to ſee him, who ſhewed great marks of eſteem and affection; and even libertines whom he had often rebuked and treated with, were deeply affected with ſorrow: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was rare to ſee ſo many tears ſhed at a ſick bed, more eſpecially of one of his years, which gave a proof that he had not outlived his ſervices. His ſoul overflowed with love to God and man, and being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in his laſt moments, with a bleſſed hope and confidence, he was going to that place which God had prepared for thoſe that
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:020377_0140_0FAF086EABEB7C08"/>
love him; he had a happy exit from time to eternity, the 30<hi>th</hi> of the third month 1745, aged eighty-one.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WILLIAM LEVIS, of Kennet in Cheſter county Pennſylvania, ſon of Samuel Levis an early ſettler in Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field in ſaid county, was born in Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field aforeſaid, about the year 1688, and removed to Kennet about 1718.

               <p>His laſt ſickneſs was the ſmall pox, which was heavy upon him, but he bore it with much patience and reſignation of mind to the laſt; ſaying, that when the diſtemper came into the houſe, it was no ſurprize to him, for he was freely reſigned, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he was ſo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a to be contented to bear affliction. One night, as thoſe that watched with him were preparing ſomething for him to take, he ſaid, 'You ſhall ſee your endeavours for me will
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:020377_0141_0FAF087013710148"/>
avail nothing.' He continued in a ſtate of reſignation and appeared cheerful in the time of his illneſs. When nearer his end, he was concern'd that others might do their duty faithfully according to the beſt of their underſtanding, ſaying,
<q>I have often thought at other times as at this, of the ſhortneſs of our lives and time here, and the uncertainty thereof, which ought to engage us to circumſpection and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Lord, and I charge you here that are elders, to diſcharge your truſt faithfully in the ſight of the Lord, having your eye ſingle to him, and let nothing of ſelf rule, and then his work will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in love and patience. I could be glad to have an opportunity once more with my friends, but if I ſhould not, I would have thoſe preſent, to acquaint them with what I have to ſay, and preſs it home to the elders, that they may faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharge their duty, and acquit themſelves of that charge wherewith they are entruſted; and alſo that parents of children and heads of families, may faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharge that great duty which is laid upon them, not only in being good examples to their children and families, but alſo to be concerned that they follow their footſteps, adding, it was a noble teſtimony that God gave of Abraham, <hi>I know him, that he will command his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and his houſhold after him.</hi> And if parents were concerned to teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:020377_0142_0FAF087075D1D500"/>
and bring them up in the way of their duty to God, and leſs concern'd to deck and ſet them off, and provide things to make them look great in the world, it would be of far more benefit to them. And my deſire is, that elders may walk faithfully as good ſtewards, not only in their own families, but to the flock which they have the overſight of; that ſo they may leave a good ſavour to the riſing and ſucceeding generation. I am ſenſible that all thoſe who are rightly concerned for the diſcipline and promotion of truth, will meet with trials from that libertine ſpirit which would lay all waſte; theſe will ſay, that religion conſiſts not in ſuch ſmall things; but I have obſerved, that one ſmall thing makes way for another, and greater things will take place; and if there is not a careful watching againſt theſe ſmall things, the eye that ſhould be kept open to ſee the evil of them, will become darkened. But keep ye your places, and labour in faithfulneſs with ſuch, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gain them; but if after friends la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they will not be gathered, friends will be clear and have peace in themſelves; but a blaſt will come on ſuch troubleſome ſpirits. And as friends faithfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this their diſcipline, the Lord will preſerve them, but if they neglect it they will ſurely ſuffer loſs.</q>
To ſome preſent who had been engaged in the ſervice of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing families, he ſaid
<q>It was a good work
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:020377_0143_0FAF0871538B4BC0"/>
and deſired it might not be forgotten.</q>
At another time, being in a weighty frame of mind, he ſaid,
<q>There is an enemy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to accuſe the innocent, and prompts on the wicked in their wickedneſs.</q>
See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his affectionate wife and ſiſter with ſome neighbours weeping, he ſaid,
<q>Don't weep for me, but be you faithful, and we ſhall meet again, for it is the hardeſt of all to ſee you weep.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The morning before he died, he deſired to be helped to the chamber where his eldeſt ſon lay ill of the ſame diſorder, and ſitting down by him, he charged his children to be dutiful to their mother, and have a care of doing any thing that would be a trouble to her, but mind to take her advice, and deſired a bleſſing might attend them; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<q>My race is almoſt run, and I ſhall lay down my head in peace with the Lord; and if you are faithful (meaning his wife and children) and live in the fear of God, he will bleſs you.</q>
After ſome time of ſilence, he ſaid,
<q>Farewell my ſon, the Lord bleſs thee my child, and thine after thee.</q>
Being then helped down ſtairs, he ſat in his chair, and after a time of ſilence, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hands together, ſaying with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed countenance, 'I bleſs thee O Lord' Afterwards laying ſtill in a quiet compoſed frame of mind, he grew weaker and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and about the ninth hour in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, departed without ſigh or groan, like

retained an awful ſenſe of appearing in public teſtimony, he was particularly cautious and watchful, not to preſume to ſpeak without aſſurance of a neceſſity being laid upon him, and equally careful to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the continuance of it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his "Preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit and of power." His ſervice was rendered more effectual, by the diſtinguiſhing marks which he bore, of "An Iſraelite indeed, in whom was no guile," a plainneſs and ſimplicity of manner in word and deed, with a zeal ſeaſoned witb divine love; and as he had large experience in the work of regeneration and the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the heavenly kingdom, as well as the ſnares of the world, he was thereby well qualified to adminiſter to the ſtates of the people.</p>
               <p>He travelled through many of theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the ſervice of the miniſtry, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his relation and dear friend John Evans.

In viſiting friends families his ſervice was great; for being endued with a ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning and the authority of truth, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was adapted with great propriety and advantage, to the particular ſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of perſons and families.

               <p>He was abroad in the ſervice of truth when attacked with his laſt illneſs; and as the diſorder was ſlow and tedious, he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral meetings in the forepart thereof; in ſome of which, his lively powerful teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies clearly manifeſted, that the God of his youth who had raiſed him up an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his hand, and on whom he had relied all his life, continued to be his ſhield and ſupport in the evening of his days and period of life; which was on the 24<hi>th</hi> of the fifth month 1747.

               <p>She was well qualified for that weigh ſervice of viſiting families, having, at ſuch opportunities, to communicate of her own experience, and tell what God had done for

her ſoul; and under a good degree of divine influence, would often be drawn forth in opening divine myſteries, as if ſhe had been in a large aſſembly, as many witneſſes can teſtify, that have been ſenſibly reached, yea baptized by her religious viſits; at which ſhe was moſtly full of good matter, well adapted and ſuitable to the different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of individuals and families.</p>
               <p>She was often concern'd to ſtir up her friends, to a cloſe attendance of meetings, both on firſt and other days, as alſo to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the hour appointed, being herſelf a good example therein, until, by old age and infirmity of body ſhe was diſabled, which was about three years before her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval. And notwithſtanding the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect life and watchful ſtate ſhe was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in, yet in the time of her weakneſs, ſhe was viſited with great diſcouragements and dejections, as may appear by her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions.</p>

At another time ſhe ſaid,

May my whole truſt and confidence ever abide in him, who has ſo filled my heart with joy, that pain and grief vaniſhed away.

About the twenty-firſt year of his age, he received a gift in the miniſtry, in which he was frequently exerciſed during the courſe of his life. His miniſtry was ſound and ſavoury, attended with a good degree of that life and power "By which the dead are raiſed, and without which all preaching is vain." He was not tedious or burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but often very reaching and edifying to his hearers. In his life and converſation he was grave, yet innocently cheerful, and ſtrictly juſt in his dealings, alſo a lover and promoter of peace, unity, and brotherly love amongſt friends, of which himſelf was a good pattern. He was generally beloved during his life, and at his death left a good ſavour. His removal from time to a happy eternity, though certainly his greateſt gain, was a conſiderable loſs to the meeting where he belonged.

               <p>Her labours were not confined to this meeting, but it pleaſed the great Lord of the harveſt, to ſend her forth in his ſervice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other provinces on this continent, as Pennſylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, New-England, Rhode-Iſland, Long-Iſland, &amp;c. in all which ſhe had good ſervice for truth, as appears by certificates produced to this meeting.

               <p>SHE was convinced of the truth in her native country, Wales, when young, which incurred her father's heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but in time he became reconciled to her.

uſeful in her generation and a bleſſing to many. Her love and companion for the widow, the fatherleſs, and others in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appeared by her often viſiting them: She was one of the wiſe in heart, who was favoured to foreſee the enemy in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and would rouſe and excite her fellow-ſoldiers to uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to repel his attempts, which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten done with deſirable. ſucceſs. She was alſo zealouſly concern'd for maintaining chriſtian discipline in the church.</p>
               <p>She was rightly qualified for the weighty ſervice of viſiting friends families, and at thoſe opportunities was frequently favoured with ſomething ſuitable to every ſtate and condition, which was attended with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial effects, eſpecially on the youth. But ſuch indeed was the divine ſavour which uſually accompanied her diſcourſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, one could rarely be an hour with her without ſenſible edification.</p>
               <p>Her firſt coming to reſide among us was ſeaſonable, for we having but few miniſters, the field before her was extenſive, in which ſhe laboured fervently, tenderly inviting thoſe afar off to draw nigh, and querying with them, whether they knew what the Lord had for them to do. By the viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of heaven and a bleſſing on her labours, many came to have their mouths opened to ſpeak of God's goodneſs to their ſouls; whereby was verified, what ſhe had declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at our meeting before ſhe came to dwell
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:020377_0158_0FAF088153CD0BC8"/>
among us, though it then ſeemed improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſome doubted the accompliſhment thereof. To theſe babes in the miniſtry, ſhe who had a large ſhare of experience in the work, was not wanting to adminiſter ſuitable precaution and advice.</p>
               <p>She went pretty much abroad, viſiting friends in this and the adjacent provinces, to wit, the Jerſeys, Maryland, Virginia and Carolina, accompanied to the remoteſt parts by her near and dear friend Suſanna Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. In her more advanced years ſhe viſited Great-Britain, accompanied by our eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend Mary Pennel, between whom a near and ſtrict union was preſerved through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their travels; and ſhe brought home very clear and comfortable accounts of her acceptable ſervice in the goſpel miniſtry, and her godly converſation in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>After her return from Great-Britain, ſhe met with great difficulties in reſpect to her outward circumſtances, which ſhe ſuſtained with chriſtian fortitude. A near friend of hers aſking her how ſhe felt under it, ſhe replied,
<q>While I keep my eye ſteadily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the object worthy of our chief regard, it ſeems as if a wall was on each ſide; all is calm, and nothing hurts or annoys: But if I ſuffer my eye to wander to the right hand or the left, the enemy breaks in upon me like a torrent, which hurries me away, and it is with great difficulty I recover myſelf.</q>
After this, ſhe met with a very heavy affliction in the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:020377_0159_0FAF0881FB2FC390"/>
loſs of her huſband, which ſhe likewiſe bore with becoming reſignation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of mind. In a few months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſhe fell into a lingering diſorder; (the dropſy) and as in time of health ſhe preferred the proſperity of truth to her chief joy, ſo in her illneſs ſhe rejoiced much to hear of any young people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing hopeful in the miniſtry. On the other hand, ſhe would, even in time of great weakneſs, lament with anxiety of mind the low ſituation of the ſeed, and ſay Oh! what will become of us? Will this dark cloud which hangs over our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, terminate in a boiſterous ſtorm to try the foundations of the children of men?</p>
               <p>By the long continuance of her diſorder, ſhe was reduced to great weakneſs ſometime before her end; yet it was evident, that charity, (to wit) Love to God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, continued with her to the laſt.</p>
               <p>She died on the 9<hi>th</hi> day of the fourth month 1750, in the ſeventy-third year of her age, having been a miniſter 50 years, and was buried at Gwynedd aforeſaid; on which ſolemn occaſion we had a good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the extendings of divine love being witneſſed.</p>

He twice viſited friends in the weſtern parts of America, going once as far as North-Carolina.—Before he proceeded on his laſt journey into thoſe parts, he appeared reſigned to the will of God, and much weaned from the things of this world; his kinſman Adam Mott accompanied him, and by teſtimonials receiv'd from ſeveral meetings, their ſervice was well accepted. On his way homeward, he was taken ſick at Oblong in New-York government, bearing his pain with great patience to the laſt; and whilſt his underſtanding was clear, often mention'd his concern for the proſperity of truth. In the time of his ſickneſs he wrote a letter to his wife, wherein he expreſs'd his ſubmiſſion to the will of God whether in life or death, deſiring ſhe might experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſame; and in an eſpecial manner requeſted her care in the education of their children, to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; keep them from hurtful and unprofitable company, and endeavour to inſtil into their minds the chriſtian principles of patience, temperance, meekneſs and ſobriety, that ſo they might be made fit veſſels for the holieſt to dwell in. In another letter wrote to his children, in the time of his ſickneſs, we find theſe words,
<q>I hereby let you know, that as I am doubtful whether I ſhall ever ſee you more, there reſts ſomething on my mind

to write to you by way of advice, which I greatly deſire may not be forgotten, and that is, as you have a tender affectionate mother, who is deſirous you may do well, therefore dear children, be obedient to her in all things in the Lord, and ſubmit to her counſel and advice at all times in love to her, and alſo endeavour to live in love and peace one with another at all times, and let not any contentions or hard thoughts ariſe one againſt another by any means, but be helpful one to another, and be exceeding careful to attend week-day meetings, and encourage others alſo, and endeavour to let all things be in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the church.</q>
He would ſometimes deſire thoſe about him to be ſtill and quiet, that they might have a time to wait on the Lord in ſilence, and ſeveral times opened his mouth in prayer and ſupplication in a living and powerful manner; alſo exhorted the by-ſtanders in the ſame life and power.

               <p>His engagements in the exerciſe of the miniſtry, occaſioned him to be much from home, yet his regard to his family was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his ſtation both as a huſband and a father; it was his frequent practice to fit down with them to wait upon the Lord, and we believe his faithfulneſs therein, was of conſiderable ſervice.</p>
               <p>In the year 1755, he, in a weighty man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner laid before us, a concern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>A Teſtimony from <hi>Norwich</hi> Monthly-Meeting concerning <hi>PETER ANDREWS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OUR dear friend Peter Andrews, from Weſt-Jerſey in North-America, being on a religious viſit to friends in this nation, deceaſed in this city; and the lively ſenſe of his ſervices, and the regard we bear to his memory, engages us to tranſmit the following teſtimony concerning him.</p>
               <p>His firſt viſit to us was in the eleventh month 1755, and his ſervice and exemplary deportment will remain as a laſting teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for him, and to the truth he preached, in the minds of many; and we have good reaſon to believe he was made inſtrumental, in a very particular manner, to the help and furtherance of ſome amongſt us, whom it had pleaſed the Lord to viſit with a freſh viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his love. And by the information of other friends, who well knew him, and particularly our friend Edmund Peckover, who frequently accompanied him, as well as from our own knowledge, we are enabled to give the following brief account of his labours and travels, from the time of his arrival to his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:020377_0177_0FAF089396962E48"/>He landed in the ſouth part of England, in or about the ſixth month 1755, and came directly up to London, where he was kindly received by friends, and had very good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice during a ſhort ſtay there; but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of being at the quarterly-meeting to be held at York, in company with ſeveral friends of London, he went as directly to the ſaid city as he could well do, being near two hundred miles, and reached there by the 24<hi>th</hi> of the ſixth month, at which time began the quarterly-meeting; and this our dear friend had a very memorable and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty opportunity in miniſtry, in the meeting of miniſters and elders at the opening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but, in the ſucceeding meetings for worſhip, was moſtly ſilent; yet in thoſe for diſcipline, was divinely led to ſet forth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, good end and tendency of the ſame, and very zealouſly preſſed to the keeping them up, in the ſame wiſdom and power in which they were firſt eſtabliſhed; evidently ſetting forth,
<q>that they proceeded from that which gathered our fore-fathers to be as a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people unto God;</q>
to the no ſmall edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and comfort of many ſincere hearts, who rejoiced greatly in having his company, which remains freſh in their remembrance; his ſervices being as bread caſt upon the waters, which, according to the wiſe man's obſervation, <hi>ſhall be found after many days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the quarterly-meeting was ended he went to Pickering, where a very large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is kept annually for worſhip, and had
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:020377_0178_0FAF0893B2B8D530"/>
ſeaſonable and profitable ſervice. He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to many other places in that county, and friends were greatly refreſhed and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his chriſtian viſit, though not always attended by public declarations in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious meetings appointed on his account, which were moſtly very large, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions high, yet his eye was to his great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's putting forth. He often was led to famiſh that too eager deſire after words; and in ſeveral public meetings he had nothing to ſay amongſt them; which tho' a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment to many for the preſent, yet there afterwards appeared a ſignal ſervice in it.</p>
               <p>He was at Yarm, Stockton, Bainbrig, and ſeveral other meetings in and about the Dales; then came to Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Doncaſter, and ſo into Lincolnſhire; which county he viſited pretty generally, alſo the iſle of Ely, and came into Norfolk, and to this place in the eleventh month 1755, as afore-mentioned; was at moſt, if not all, of friends meetings in our county; then went into Suffolk and Eſſex, and returned to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the latter end of the firſt month 1756, where he remained a few weeks, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ill; yet was at moſt of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in that city, and was very ſerviceable, with many other friends, in affairs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly relating to the ſociety in Pennſylvania at that time.</p>
               <p>He went back again into Eſſex, and ſo for Hertfordſhire, ſome parts of Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:020377_0179_0FAF089474C22E08"/>
Oxfordſhire, Glouceſterſhire, and to the yearly-meeting at Briſtol in the fifth month 1756; and had good ſervice both in meetings for worſhip and diſcipline, which was well received, and, it is hoped, made laſting impreſſions on the minds of many who had the opportunity of being preſent.</p>
               <p>His indiſpoſition ſtill continued, but did not hinder him from travelling: From Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol he paſſed through ſome part of Glouceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhire, Wiltſhire, and Oxfordſhire, and got to the yearly-meeting at London in the ſixth month, and altho' his illneſs continued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, was enabled to bear ſeveral living teſtimonies, in the demonſtration of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of power.</p>
               <p>After the ſaid yearly-meeting was ended, he came down to the yearly-meetings at Colcheſter and Woodbridge, where he was eminently ſupported to be ſerviceable in the churches. At Woodbridge he was ſtrengthened to bear a large, powerful and affecting teſtimony in the laſt meeting of worſhip, to the tendering of many hearts, whoſe ſtates were ſo effectually ſpoken to, as that it may be fitly compared to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and glorious ſituation which the Pſalmiſt deſcribed, when he ſays,
<q>How good, and how pleaſant a thing it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's beard, that went down to the ſkirts of his garments: As the dew of Hermon,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:020377_0180_0FAF089531A628C8"/>
and as the dew that deſcended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life for evermore,</q>
Pſalm cxxxiii. 1, 2, 3. It was indeed a moſt heavenly, precious, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing ſeaſon, (this being the laſt public op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity our dear friend had) in which he was wonderfully led to ſet forth the progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſteps the Almighty was pleaſed to make uſe of, in appearing to Gideon, confirming him in the certainty of his requirings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to grant his requeſts in a very peculiar manner, and ſealing them with his preſence, and giving him victory over his enemies, as he was faithful to follow the bleſſed author that pointed forth the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as well as finiſhing that great work, to which that extraordinary ſervant of God, Gideon, in his day was called; which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable ſervice of our dear friend, there is great reaſon to believe the great Lord, who prepared him for the ſame, was graciouſly pleaſed to fix as a nail in a ſure place; and may it ſo continue in the remembrance of thoſe then preſent, who are left for a ſmall ſpace yet in mutability.</p>
               <p>He continued very weak in body all his ſtay in Woodbridge, being above five days, and no perſuaſions could prevail with him to hinder his ſetting forward for his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, having ſtrong deſires in his mind to ſee friends in this place again; and to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend he expreſſed his love ſo great to us,
<q>That he thought he could willingly
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:020377_0181_0FAF0896399A98E8"/>
die with us.</q>
He was favoured to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it in two days after he left Woodbridge, though with great difficulty, and lodged at the houſe of our friend John Oxley, as he had done before, but took to his bed ſoon after he got in, to which, the remaining part of his time, he was moſtly confined.</p>
               <p>It being the time of our yearly-meeting, many friends went often to viſit him, and he expreſſed to ſome,
<q>That he was ſatisfied he was in his place, in giving up to follow the requiring of the Lord, in leaving his outward habitation, and thoſe near bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of a moſt tender affectionate wife and dutiful children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeverity of his illneſs kept him moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delirious, yet he was favour'd with ſome clear intervals; in one of which, being in a ſweet heavenly frame of mind, he broke forth in the following fervent ſupplication, viz.
<q>Oh! this poor ſoul hath been for many days on the brink of the pit of diſtreſs; but thou, dear father, doſt not afflict thy children willingly, but for ſome great and good cauſe known only to thyſelf: Dear father! ſuffer not thy children ever to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of thy mercies, but that we may be helpful, as much as may be in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to one another in all ſuch times of trouble. Deareſt father! thou haſt been pleaſed to open, and to favour with thy goodneſs; my ſoul is thankful, and can ſay, thou art worthy of glory and praiſe for evermore.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="unknown:020377_0182_0FAF0898D2DC0890"/>He continued to the 13<hi>th</hi> of the ſeventh month 1756, and then departed this life, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground the 18<hi>th</hi> of the ſame, after an awful meeting, (his corps being attended by a very large number of friends and others) and no doubt he reſts, with the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, in thoſe glorious manſions prepared for all thoſe that hold out in faithfuneſs to the end. His memory is very precious and dear to many who are yet ſurviving, and we believe it may truly be ſaid, that few friends who have travelled in this nation, have been more approved, or had more general ſervice in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HE was born in Denbighſhire, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1689, and arrived in Pennſylvania with his parents in 1698, under whom he received a pious education.—He was a man of good natural underſtanding and favoured early in life to ſee the neceſſity of a diligent attention to the voice of divine wiſdom, to eſtabliſh and preſerve him in peace with God; and by a ſteady adherence to it, he became honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in ſociety and eminently ſerviceable in the church of Chriſt.—In the twenty-third year of his age he appeared in the miniſtry
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:020377_0183_0FAF0898EE384298"/>
of the goſpel, his deportment therein was reverent as became a mind ſenſible of the awful importance of the ſervice. He had a clear engaging manner of delivery, was deep in heavenly myſteries, and plain in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them; being well acquainted with the holy ſcriptures, he was made ſkilful in opening the doctrines therein contain'd, and was often led to draw lively and inſtructive ſimilitudes from the viſible creation. He travelled through moſt of the northern co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in the ſervice of truth, and ſeveral times thro' this province.—He was often drawn to attend general meetings, funerals and other public occaſions, particularly the adjacent meetings after their firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, over which he had a tender fatherly care, as a good ſhepherd taking heed to the flock;—and the great ſhepherd of Iſrael bleſſed his labours, and afforded him at times great ſatisfaction and comfort.—The latter part of his time, the viſible declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many from the life and power of truth, frequently made ſorrow and deep lamentation his portion.—His labours were fervent with the youth, in much love and zeal, that they might come to know God for themſelves, bow their necks to the yoke, and lay their ſhoulders to the work, ſaying,
<q>That their remembering their creator in the days of their youth, would be as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to his bones.</q>
It was indeed his great joy to behold the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, and his labours for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:020377_0184_0FAF0899EA1EE5E0"/>
thereof made him honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men of various ranks and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his teſtimony generally acceptable to them.</p>
               <p>In the ſupport of our chriſtian diſcipline, he was zealous, active and unwearied, and favoured with qualification to adviſe in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult caſes, which ſeldom failed of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His teſtimony was cloſe againſt hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy and an outſide ſhew of religion only, but full of parternal tenderneſs to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, weak, or diffident in ſpirit; of ſound judgment, and deep in divine expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, yet modeſt and condeſcending, and being favoured with the deſcendings of the father's love, that at times appeared to clothe him as with a mantle; he had an open-door in the hearts of his friends, and an aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency over the ſpirits of gainſayers.—He was a zealous promoter of viſiting friends in their families, was many times engaged therein, and his labours were awakening and uſeful; often employ'd in viſiting the ſick, the widow, and the fatherleſs and others in affliction; on theſe occaſions he was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom large in expreſſion, but his ſilent ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and ſecret breathing for their relief, were more conſolatory than many words; a conſiderable part of his time was ſpent in aſſiſting widows, and the guardianſhip of orphans, which, though laborious to him, was of much advantage to them.</p>
               <p>The importance of love and peace to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and religious ſociety he was deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:020377_0185_0FAF089ADC0D3A88"/>
of, diligent in promoting them both by precept and example, and ſucceſsful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring harmony where any violation of it appear'd.—His conduct and converſation in private life was exemplary, and ſuch as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied an inward cloſe inſpection into the ſecret operations of his own heart.</p>
               <p>He was apprehenſive of his approaching end for ſometime before his laſt illneſs, and told a friend,
<q>He ſhould not ſurvive one year,</q>
who admir'd he was ſo poſitive; but he made no further reply than,
<q>See what will follow.</q>
In his public teſtimony alſo, he frequently ſaid,
<q>He had but an inch of time to treat with us.</q>
In the firſt part of his illneſs, he went to ſome meetings, one whereof was large, and he was favour'd with ſtrength to ſpeak in a powerful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive manner to the youth, for whoſe welfare his deſires were ardent.—His diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſlow and lingering, wherein he was favour'd with his underſtanding almoſt to the laſt; and altho', at ſome ſeaſons, he was much concern'd on account of the gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the times in religious and civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, yet in general he poſſeſs'd a very great degree of calmneſs and ſerenity of mind, with a perfect reſignation to the will of God, whether life or death ſhould be his portion. On the day of his departure, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his wife troubled, he ſaid with a cheerful countenance,
<q>I am eaſy, I am ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and deſir'd her to be eaſy alſo;</q>
indeed it appear'd that the Lord had ſtrengthened
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:020377_0186_0FAF089B6EF2A958"/>
him on the bed of languiſhing, and made all his bed in his ſickneſs. And thus hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerved God in his generation, he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 23<hi>d</hi> day of the ninth month 1756, aged ſixty-ſeven years; having, we hope, ſhaken himſelf from the duſt, put on his beautiful garments, and enter'd the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding chamber of the bridegroom of his ſoul, and enjoys the reward of his faithful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; was buried on the 25<hi>th</hi> day of the ſame month, in friends burying-ground at Gwynedd.</p>

               <p>HE was born in Barking, in the county of Eſſex, Great-Britain, on the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of the ninth month 1696, came whilſt young with his parents into this province, and lived ſome time in this city, from whence he removed with them to Plumſtead in Bucks county, where he firſt appeared in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; ſome years after which, he ſettled in this city. His gift in the miniſtry was liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deep, and very edifying; and in the exerciſe thereof, he was remarkable for an awful care, not to appear without clear and renewed evidence of the motion of life for that ſervice: And though not a man of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, was often led into ſublime matter, which was convincing and perſuaſive, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

forth the dignity and excellence of the chriſtian religion, yet was very attentive that thoſe heighths ſhould not detain him beyond his proper gift, but to cloſe in and with the life, which made his miniſtry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acceptable to the living and judicious. Although he was not led to viſit the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in diſtant parts, yet was ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to attend ſome of the neighbouring meetings, of two of which he has preſerv'd ſome minutes, which being a lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his concern of mind for the promotion of the cauſe of truth, it is thought well to ſubjoin them here in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>1756, eighth month 9<hi>th,</hi> I went to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord quarterly-meeting, but found no cauſe to eſpouſe the cauſe of God in a public manner that day. The next day went to the youth's meeting at Kennet, which was to great ſatisfaction; my ſoul was ſo bended towards the people, that I could ſcarcely leave them, being engaged in a ſtream of the miniſtry, to extol the divinity of that religion that is breathed from heaven, and which arrays the ſoul of its poſſeſſor with degrees of the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, and entitles them to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance; alſo introduces a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, intelligible only to the converted ſouls which have acceſs to a celeſtial foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is no leſs than a foretaſte of eternal joy, to ſupport them in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards the regions above, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has room to breathe in its divine

               <p>
                  <q>1756, the 29<hi>th</hi> of the eighth month, I viſited Gwynedd-meeting, where in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nothingneſs before God, without ſeeking or ſtriving to awake my beloved before the time, by degrees my ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inveſted with that concern that the goſpel introduces, with an opening in
<q>theſe words; I think it may conduce to my peace, to ſtand up, and engage in a cauſe dignified with immortality and crowned with eternal life.</q>
The ſubject raiſed higher and brighter until my ſoul was tranſported on the mount of God in degree, and beheld his glory; where I was favoured to treat on the exalted ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the redeemed church, which ſtands in the election of grace, where my ſoul rejoiced with tranſcendent joy and adored God. Returned home in peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His conduct and converſation was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and edifying, being much weaned from the world and the ſpirit of it. He was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to engage in worldly concerns ſo as to encumber his mind, and draw it off from that religious contemplation, in which was his chief delight; which happy ſtate of mind he maintained to the laſt, as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared to thoſe friends who were with

                  <q>I am fine and eaſy, and don't know but what I may recover; but if I ſhould, I expect to ſee many a gloomy day, but nevertheleſs I am willing to live longer, if I might be a means of exalting religion, that the gift beſtowed on me, might ſhine brighter than it hath ever yet done, or elſe I had abundance better go now; for I think I have ſhone but glimmeringly to what I might have done, had I been ſtill more faithful; tho' I cannot charge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a preſumptuous temper, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſobedience; but I can ſay, it has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happened with me, as with the poor man at the pool of Betheſda, whilſt I was making ready another has ſtepped in.

                  <q>Although the ſoul has at times to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory, ſplendor and magnitude of the true church or ſpouſe of Chriſt, yet thoſe extraordinary ſights are but ſeldom, not often: Though I have had at times, cauſe to eſpouſe the cauſe of God, yet there are times that the ſoul is ſo veiled, and ſurrounded with temptations and fiery trials, and all out of ſight, that I have wondered that I was made choice of; but I have experienced, that they that would reign with Chriſt muſt ſuffer with him; I never expect to get beyond it, while I am ;cloathed with this clog of mortality.</q>

                  <q>People may have a regular outſide, and be diligent in attending meetings, and yet know little or nothing of it; for formality and externals are nothing; religion is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſubject, ſubſiſting between Chriſt and the ſoul: I don't confine it to our name,

but amongſt the different names there are, that my ſoul is nearly united to, who are in a good degree, I do believe, in poſſeſſion of that religion which is revealed from heaven: And I am in the faith, that there will be them raiſed up, that will ſhine as bright ſtars, and religion will grow and proſper, and the holy flame riſe to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er height than it hath ever yet done. I can ſay with the holy apoſtle,
<q>I have nothing to boaſt of, ſave my infirmities,</q>
yet thus much I venture to ſay, that if I die now, I die a lover of God and religion.</q>
And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſſing a compaſſionate ſympathy with the poor afflicted churches up and down, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with this ſaying,

               <p>HE was born in Bucks county, Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, of parents profeſſing the truth as held by us the people called Quakers. About nine months after his birth his father dying, and his mother ſometime after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying from among friends, expoſed him to a looſe irregular education; about ten years of age being put apprentice, where through eleven years ſervitude, he ſuffered great bodily hardſhip, and much greater danger as to the better part; yet (ſays he in a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript leſt for the uſe of his children)
<q>I took delight in my bible, and believe the good hand was with me, that inclined my
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:020377_0194_0FAF08A2C18F5290"/>
mind thereto.—Tho' I followed lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and ſo forſook my own mercies, yet I could ſay my prayers every night, till I grew afraid to ſay them any more, and ſeemed like one abandoned from good for ſeveral years.</q>
Having ſerved his time out, he providentially became a reſident in Benjamin Clark's family at Stony-brook, who were exemplary and kind to him;
<q>I thought (ſays he) they were the beſt people in the world, careful in their words, yet cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant, ſo that I thought I muſt be a Quaker.</q>
And Edward Andrews, from Eggharbour, being at a quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Croſſwicks,
<q>He came (adds he) with power to give me my awakening call; I was much reached, but after the manner of the world, looking at the man, gave him the praiſe, viz. he is a brave man, he preaches well, I wiſh I lived near him, I would go to hear him every firſt day; at ſame time not minding what he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, Chriſt in ourſelves, the true teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that will not be removed till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from him; in us is the place he has ordained to reveal himſelf.—I afterwards went more to friends meetings than I had done before, and read much in friends books, but was yet in the dark, the time of my deliverance was not come, the ſins of the Amorites were not full; I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moſes in the wilderneſs, come out of Egypt, but Joſhua's time was not come, the Saviour, the warrior that brings

through judgment, and makes war with the old inhabitants; yet I ſometimes long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſomething which I could not find, a lot in the good land. I think this year Thomas Willſon and James Dickenſon, came into the country, and ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to viſit the meeting of friends at Croſſwicks, I happened to be at the meeting before they came in; the ſight of them ſtruck me, the heavenly frame of mind which their countenances manifeſted, and the awe they ſeemed to ſit under, brought a ſtillneſs over my mind, and I was as ground prepared to receive the ſeed: James ſtood up in the authority of the goſpel, and in it he was led to unravel me and all my works from top to bottom, ſo that I looked on myſelf like a man diſſected or pulled to pieces, all my religion as well as all my ſins were ſet forth in ſuch a light that I thought myſelf undone: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſat down, Thomas ſtood up and brought me together again, I mean what was to be raiſed, bone to his bone, with, the ſinews and ſtrength that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a chriſtian; I almoſt thought myſelf new born, the old man deſtroyed and the new man made up, concluding I ſhould never be bad again, that my ſins were forgiven, and I ſhould have nothing to do but to do good; I thought I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my lot in the good land, and might ſit now under my own vine and fig tree, and nothing more ſhould make me afraid.

Poor creature! I had only a ſight, I did not yet think what powerful adverſaries I had to war with; this has been the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe of many, they have ſat down under a convincement, and in a form of religion, ſome depending on former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience or former openings, ſome on their education, ſome a bare belief, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hiſtorical of the ſcriptures and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of truth.—Thus tho' I received the truth, yet I was like the ſtony ground; I received it with joy, but had not root in myſelf, my heart grew hard again, for when tribulations, perſecutions, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and trials came upon me, I fell. Oh! how I moped at times and wandered about as a priſoner at large, I would have run, but I could not, my offended judge, my accuſer was in me, I could not fly from him; yet, great goodneſs was near, and his power kept me from groſs evils in a great degree.—I kept pretty much to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but there was ſuch a mixture of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted matter in me, it was not to be ſoon ſeparated.

               <p>Having paſſed thro' various probations, he had conſiderable openings of the divine ſenſe of the ſcriptures, and alſo ſaw that the Lord had a work for him to do, to which he at length gave up, and being faithful therein, was made helpful to many, being

               <p>He was an affectionate huſband and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, diligent in attending meetings for worſhip and diſcipline, and manifeſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a zealous concern for the promotion and honour of truth, waiting for wiſdom to ſee his duty, and ſtrength to perform it.—He divers times travelled abroad on this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the ſervice of truth, and frequently to the neighbouring meetings to ſatisfaction; his outward circumſtances being at times difficult, gave him an opportunity to ſhew an example of chriſtian reſignation, and to ſee its effects in divers providential aſſiſtances.</p>
               <p>In 1756 he laid before this meeting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious concern to viſit friends in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which had been on his mind upwards of ten years, wherewith the meeting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, he had our certificate, and embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, landed in Ireland; and after viſiting the meetings in that country, arrived in England and performed his religious viſit in ſeveral counties, but was taken ill, and died in London the 26<hi>th</hi> of the firſt month 1758; finiſhing his days work with a firm aſſurance that the gates of Heaven were opened to him; very acceptable accounts of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices both in England and Ireland have been received, as are more fully ſet forth in the annexed teſtimony of Devonſhire houſe monthly-meeting concerning him.</p>

               <p>THIS worthy miniſter and elder, having had drawings in ſpirit for ſeveral years, as we are informed, to viſit the churches of Chriſt in this nation and Ireland, in the ſervice of the goſpel; when he apprehended the time approached wherein he was to enter upon this weighty engagement, he ſettled his outward affairs: and having the concurrence and unity of the brethren, embark'd in a veſſel bound from Philadelphia to Dublin, in company with three friends from Europe, who had performed a religious viſit to the churches in America.—After a favoured voyage of about four weeks, landing at Dublin, he viſited the meetings, of friends in Ireland, and by the accounts from thence, had very weighty and acceptable ſervice there: Having laboured faithfully in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtrengthen the brethren and aſſiſt in building up the waſte places in Zion, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd for England, viſited the churches in ſome of the northern counties, attended the yearly-meeting at Penrith, and afterwards that

in this city, his labour of love in the work of the miniſtry, being to edification and comfort, was truly acceptable.—After at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the yearly-meetings of Colcheſter, Woodbridge, Norwich and the quarterly-meeting of York, he viſited many meetings in the northern and midland counties, from whence good accounts have been received of his weighty and affecting labours.

               <p>His miniſtry was in plainneſs of ſpeech, and attended with divine authority, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the witneſs of God in man, and to the habitation of the mourners in Zion; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pointing out, in a lively manner, the paths of the exerciſed travellers, and the ſteps of heavenly pilgrims; by which he was made helpful to ſuch as are ſeeking the true reſt, which the Lord hath prepared for his people.

She was of an innocent pious life and converſation, a good example in attending meetings both on firſt and week-days, until a few years before her death. She was a miniſter above ſeventy years; her teſtimony, tho' generally ſhort, was moſtly to ſatisfaction and edification; and in her declining age, when nature ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt ſpent, ſhe appeared more divinely favoured than common, to the admiration of ſome. When ſhe could no longer attend meetings, ſhe would often, at meal times, appear in prayer, with praiſes to the Lord, to the comfort and ſatisfaction of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and frequently ſignified,
<q>She had the evidence of divine peace.</q>
Not long before her departure ſhe ſaid,
<q>That her ſweet Lord had not forſaken her, but was ſtill with her to comfort and refreſh her in her old age.</q>
Thus ſhe was removed from time to eternity, like a ſhock of corn fully ripe.</p>

               <p>HE was born the 27<hi>th</hi> of the firſt month 1687, near Bala, in Merionethſhire, in the principality of Wales, and removed with his parents into Pennſylvania about the year 1697; ſoon after their arrival, he was placed with a friend until he came of age, in this time of his youth, he was naturally very wild and airy, and delighted much in vain company, until by convictions he broke off from his companions. In the year 1710 he married, and ſoon after ſettled at Uwch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan in Cheſter county, where he remained until his deceaſe. A meeting being eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that place ſhortly after his removal thither, he duly attended the ſame both on the firſt and other days of the week; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remarking,
<q>That he knew the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of leaving the hurry of the world to attend meeting,</q>
where he was a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, both in keeping to the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his ſolid ſitting in ſilence. He was zealous for the ſupport of our chriſtian di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and active therein, as well as in overſeeing the flock and other ſervices in the church.</p>
               <p>He ſerved in the ſtation of an elder about 28 years, diligently attending thoſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings even until old age and under bodily weakneſſes. In his ſickneſs, he often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd

much concern and ſorrow for ſome of the profeſſors of truth, ſaying,
<q>They are on the decline, what will become of them?</q>
And further ſaid,

ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing a concern for the right management of the diſcipline, and remarking the remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome herein.

               <p>SARAH SHOTWELL departed this life, in the eighth month 1759, in the forty-fourth year of her age. She was educated amongſt friends on Long-Iſland, and was early engaged in a public teſtimony. In the twenty-ſeventh year of her age, ſhe was married to Joſeph Shotwell of Rahway; was a woman much beloved, of a ſweet, free and hoſpitable ſpirit, guarded in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, careful to give no juſt occaſion of offence, a prudent loving wife, a tender ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary parent, an affectionate and kind

neighbour; often ſympathizing with thoſe in affliction, eſpecially ſuch as were religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and virtuous; the rich and poor of thoſe were equally near to her, and nearer than natural kindred where truth had not united in ſpirit: She gladly received ſtrangers; and her carriage and behaviour to young mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and burden-bearers, manifeſted her concern for and ſympathy with them, often dropping ſeaſonable hints for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. Although ſhe did not travel much abroad, yet ſhe was diligent in attending meetings at and about home, being endued with a ſound and living miniſtry, clear and diſtinct in her teſtimony, whereby many were alarmed, ſome convinced, ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed in the faith through a bleſſing on her labours. She was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſilent humble waiting on the Lord, who was pleaſed to own her, and often raiſe in her memorials and ſongs of thankſgiving to the God of all mercies, who never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook his people in the deep, nor left them to periſh in the wilderneſs, but was faithful and true, and failed not to bring to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed land. The goſpel truths ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to open, were ſo affecting to many, that ſome who were prejudiced againſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's preaching, have been heard to ſay,
<q>If ſuch a thing could be, ſhe was a true goſpel miniſter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She was a pattern of humility, not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applauſe, nor forward in her public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and tho' ſometimes large, was
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:020377_0209_0FAF0781F8000770"/>
generally careful not to ſtand long; fervent and living in prayer, wherein, we believe, ſhe had acceſs to the father. She frequently exhorted all to come up in faithfulneſs, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
<q>That God would have a people that would ſerve him in uprightneſs and integrity of heart.</q>

               <p>Having had a ſight ſometime before her laſt ſickneſs, that her time here was nearly accompliſhed, ſhe departed this life, after about four days illneſs, in a reſigned frame of mind.</p>

               <p>His laſt illneſs was a nervous diſorder, which continued on him nineteen days; within which time he attended our meeting on a firſt day, and bore a living teſtimony

free, in the demonſtration of the power of pure love; and in the ſtream thereof ſhe was often led forth, to comfort the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful travellers in Zion, and in the line of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience could tell what great things the Lord had done for her ſoul, thro' her obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and truſt in him, to whom ſhe freely attributed all ſhe received as from his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful hand, and thereby gave the glory to God, and adminiſtred comfort to weary travelling ſouls. But being of a backward ſpirit, from a ſenſe of her own weakneſs, was loath to give up to travel in truth's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which often brought her very low un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch exerciſes.

               <p>She was very lively to the laſt, and her teſtimonies were accompanied with power that made them truly ſeaſonable to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, the divine preſence being ſenſibly with her, under a ſenſe whereof ſhe was very much reſigned, and rather deſirous to depart and be at reſt with the Lord.

<q>She had often magnified that gracious hand which was with her when a poor orphan child; and preſſed them to ſerve the Lord in their youth, which would draw divine bleſſings on them;</q>

               <p>THIS worthy woman was one whom it pleaſed the Lord, to call out of the broad way and vanities of the world, and make acquainted with his bleſſed truth; and as ſhe abode under the croſs, it pleaſed the almighty to manifeſt unto her, that ſhe was a choſen veſſel or inſtrument for his ſervice, to preach the goſpel.

               </head>
               <p>ELEANOR SHOTWELL, late wife of Jacob Shotwell of Rahway, was a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted friend, and encouraged ſuch as ſought the Lord. She was an elder of ſound judgment, concern'd for the church's wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and that Zion might be reſtored to her primitive beauty, and was a pattern of plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſelf-denial. In the ninth month 1762, being on her journey to attend the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting at Philadelphia, a friend mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the danger of going to ſaid city, on account of an infectious diſtemper then prevalent there; to which ſhe replied,
<q>She had no fear on that account, and that it was no matter where we departed the world, ſo that we were in our duty.</q>
She according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to the meeting and attended the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of it, until ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a violent diſorder, attended with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pain near three days, which ſhe bore with a calm and even mind. To a friend who viſited her, ſhe ſaid,
<q>She was almoſt gone, and in great pain of body, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding peace of mind.</q>
At another time ſaid,
<q>It was ſatisfactory that her peace was made with the Lord, and that it would be terrible to have a wounded conſcience at ſuch a time to ſtruggle with.</q>
Concerning her huſband and children whom ſhe dearly
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:020377_0224_0FAF078EB82C0140"/>
loved, ſhe ſaid,
<q>Though ſhe was not like to ſee them more, ſhe was glad in the Lord, that ſhe had given up to attend the yearly-meeting;</q>
expreſſing her deſire,
<q>That her offspring ſhould be brought up in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that friends watchful care might be over them; and that her huſband might be preſerved in ſelf-denial, and humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the Lord's will in all his trials.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She departed this life, on the 2<hi>d</hi> day of the tenth month 1762, in the forty-ſixth year of her age, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Philadelphia.</p>

               <head>A Teſtimony from <hi>Burlington</hi> Monthly-Meeting in <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> concerning <hi>PETER FEARON.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HE was the ſon of John and Elizabeth Fearon, of Great-Broughton, in Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, and born in or about the year 1683. He came amongſt friends on a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of convincement, during his appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip with his uncle Peter Fearon, and appeared in a few words in meetings before he was twenty years of age. In the latter end of 1703, with the concurrence of friends, he left England, and landed in Virginia, where he ſtaid about three months, then came to Burlington in the ſecond month 1704, and from that time until his deceaſe, he was a uſeful member of this meeting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:020377_0225_0FAF07919C55DC48"/>Between the years 1704 and 1730, he travelled in the ſervice of the goſpel, through moſt parts of this continent where meetings were then ſettled, and to ſome provinces ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times; and employed above two years in viſiting friends in England, Scotland and Ireland; returning with ſatisfactory certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of the approbation and unity of friends with his religions labours.</p>
               <p>After thoſe travels, his worldly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being attended with difficulties, and his deſires earneſt that he might get through them with credit, he went many voyages to ſea as a factor, chiefly to Boſton and the iſland of Barbados; and thro' many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, he was enabled to pay his debts, and to ſave ſufficient, with induſtry and care, to yield a comfortable ſubſiſtance in old age, and to be helpful to ſome others. In thoſe undertakings he took certificates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſuch as were very ſatisfactory, both of his diligence in his outward buſineſs, and of his care to edify the churches with the gift of miniſtry which had been committed to him. Whilſt in Barbados in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of 1746, a concern came upon him to viſit friends on Tortola, which by their large and full certificate, appears to have been very ſeaſonable; and was the firſt after our worthy friends Thomas Chalkley, John Cadwallader and John Eſtaugh, had laid down their heads in peace among them. They ſay,
<q>He came in a needful time, as
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:020377_0226_0FAF07928E844F00"/>
a cloud full of rain upon a thirſty land, greatly to our mutual comfort and joy in the Lord, and in one another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of his laſt voyages by ſea, was in 1750, and on purpoſe to perform a religious viſit to friends in Barbados and Tortola, having our friend Thomas Lancaſter for his companion; and when they had performed their ſervice, the ſaid friend was, after a ſharp ſickneſs, removed by death at ſea. Beſides this, he met with other ſore trials in his pilgrimage through life, particularly in the long confinement of his wife, who was ſeized with the palſy five years before her death, and lay moſt of that time entirely helpleſs. His behaviour towards her, was as an affectionate huſband, with much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and care; and indeed his frequent practice of viſiting the ſick and afflicted, evidenced a ſympathizing heart, and was very becoming his ſtation.</p>
               <p>He was preſerved in the exerciſe of his miniſtry, in much love and goſpel ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And his ſenſe of the nature and ſpirit in which the diſcipline ſhould be managed, is thus expreſs'd in an epiſtle which he wrote to friends on Tortola, viz.
<q>That you may grow up together a ſpiritual houſe that holineſs becomes, and a care according to goſpel order may be kept to amongſt you, and that no harſhneſs be uſed one towards another, but tender and helpful, and not apt to judge or cenſure one another, that you may be kept in that univerſal ſpirit
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:020377_0227_0FAF0793CB9F6338"/>
of love, that ſeeks the good of all and hurt of none, and yet gives all their due, and what is right and juſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His diligence in attending religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was remarkable, for though he lived three miles from the particular meeting of Burlington to which he belonged, it was very uncommon for bodily infirmities, or any extremities of weather to keep him at home on meeting days; and the year before his deceaſe, he viſited ſeveral general meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings both in this and the neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
               <p>A life ſo ſpent in fervent endeavours to promote truth and righteouſneſs among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was, we have cauſe to hope, in a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preparation to be cloſed at a ſhort warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He was ſeized with a fit by his own fire ſide, which quickly deprived him of underſtanding, and about three days after he breathed his laſt, on the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of the twelfth month 1762, in the ſeventy-ninth year of his age, having been a miniſter about 60 years. He was interr'd on the 23<hi>d</hi> in friends burying-ground at Burlington, after a ſolid meeting held on the occaſion.</p>
               <p>Having obſerved ſtrict temperance and moderation, he finiſhed his courſe in a good old age; being an example of prudence and ſteadineſs, which we deſire may be often remembred, and uſefully improved to the advantage of ſuch as are left behind.</p>

               <p>ON the 4<hi>th</hi> day of the firſt month 1763, died our friend Thomas Tilton, in the ſeventy-ninth year of his age. Some of whoſe laſt expreſſions were as follows, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That his paſſage was very long and hard, and many times prayed God to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him through, that his poor wife's trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was greater for him than ſhe could well endure, and that he was not inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhe laboured for him both in body and mind.</q>
Some time after he ſaid,
<q>It was a comfort to him to ſee his children concerned for themſelves,</q>
and deſired them,
<q>To keep to their duties, for there was a falling away of ſome, but that they might not neglect theirs; that they would live in love and in the fear of the Lord, which would be to their advantage, but to live looſe and wanton would make hard work on a dying bed;</q>
obſerving,
<q>That people thought too little of their latter end, although they think of it ſometimes, it ſoon goes out of their minds.</q>
Then pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<q>That the Lord would carry him through,</q>
ſaying,
<q>His paſſage was very hard, and his pain and affliction great; yet his peace was ſteady, for the Lord did not charge him with any thing.</q>

               </head>
               <p>OUR friend Elizabeth Haydock, late wife of James Haydock, of Rahway, was religiouſly inclined from her youths and an early pattern of ſelf-denial and plainneſs to thoſe of her age and ſex. Being called to the work of the miniſtry, it became a trial to her, and ſuch a croſs to her own will to give up to the Lord's work, that ſhe was ready to give way to conſultations, and on account of her own incapacity and frailties, to queſtion its being his call; ſo that (as ſhe expreſſed) could ſhe have found peace, ſhe would rather have choſen death than obedience; but finding the love of God, as it is abode in, to be ſtronger than the world, ſhe yielded thereto; and confiding in the Lord alone, came forth an inſtrument of his own preparing; and continuing to walk in the way of ſelf-denial, ſhe grew in her gift, increaſing both in underſtanding and utterance to the cloſe of her days.</p>
               <p>In her laſt illneſs, ſhe ſignified,

               </head>
               <p>THOUGH few of us were perſonally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this our dear ancient friend in the early part of his life, yet as we have information by good authorities, of ſome things remarkable therein, we think it not amiſs to tranſmit ſome hints of them, with what hath fallen out within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our knowledge concerning him.</p>
               <p>He was born in Merionethſhire, in the principality of Wales, and came over with his parents into Pennſylvania, when about twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>He was naturally of a very cheerful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and for ſome time indulged himſelf in keeping company with ſuch, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and conduct were unprofitable and vain, for which, though we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand he was guilty of immoral practices, he was cloſely reproved by the witneſs of God in ſecret, and his condition being thereby plainly manifeſted to him, as likewiſe the danger of purſuing ſuch courſes, he did not dare to go any longer in vanity: but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the reproofs of inſtruction, was brought under great exerciſe and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; in which ſtate, the converſation of his former companions, once his delight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a burden and increaſed his diſtreſs; but avoiding to feed their light airy diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, keeping his mind retired, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:020377_0231_0FAF0796421831A0"/>
the holy ſcriptures, when they ſought to entice him, had ſuch an effect, that they forſook him, which was a great eaſe to his mind, in that it afforded him opportunity for a further ſearch after the will of him, who in mercy had called him to glory and virtue. As he was thus engaged, after many deep baptiſms and trials, it pleaſed the Lord, about the thirty-fourth year of his age, to call him to the work of the miniſtry; which was an exceeding humbling exerciſe to him, and many ſore conflicts he had therein, through the buffetings of Satan; but by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to follow the Lord in the way of his requirings, help was adminiſtred, ſo that he at times, had to experience, that he gives
<q>The oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His chief inducement to come and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in theſe parts, was a ſtrong draught of love attending his mind, which however he did not haſtily give way to, having felt drawings hither near eight years before he came; of ſo great moment did the removing himſelf and family appear to him.</p>
               <p>He was a diligent attender of firſt and week day meetings for worſhip, as alſo of our monthly, quarterly and yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, even when age and infirmity of body rendered travelling very difficult to him. He likewiſe viſited ſome of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provinces on truth's ſervice, with the unity of friends; and by accounts which
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:020377_0232_0FAF0797352EFD80"/>
we have had from the places he viſited, his labours of love were well received and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable.</p>
               <p>From the time of his coming amongſt us, he was always one of the number, who went on the viſit to friends families; which weighty work he undertook in much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of himſelf, and fear of a forward ſpirit, often ſaying,
<q>That former appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and engagements thereto, were of no account for future ſervices; but that ſuch as went, muſt wait for renewed qualifications to enter upon that work,</q>
which he uſed to ſay,
<q>He thought muſt be a good one, ſince it occaſioned greater nearneſs, and was a renewal of love, both among viſitors and viſited:</q>
And by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts received, it was ſo in a good degree.</p>
               <p>In meetings for worſhip he was a good example in ſilent patient waiting upon the Lord, and when raiſed to bear a public teſtimony, it was with that power and authority, which accompanies a true goſpel miniſter, and hath made laſting impreſſions upon ſome minds. Though he was of an exceeding tender diſpoſition, yet being a lover of good order in the church, and well knowing the dangerous tendency of undue liberty, he both by precept and example, endeavoured to promote the former and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the latter; in which he gave repeated proofs, that the near connections of natural kindred did not bias his judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:020377_0233_0FAF079822A47C08"/>His deportment being meek and loving, and his converſation familiar and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively cheerful, gained him the eſteem of moſt who knew him, of different ranks and religious perſuaſions. He was a nurſing father in the church, and particularly ſo to divers whom the Lord had viſited that were under affliction, whether of body or mind; nor was his charity in this reſpect confined to the members of our ſociety.</p>
               <p>He was an affectionate huſband, a tender parent, a kind maſter; and having, by the bleſſing of divine providence on his honeſt induſtry, obtained a competency of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life, was very hoſpitable, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining both friends and others freely and kindly, not with oſtentation or for applauſe, but for the promotion of piety and virtue, and the good of mankind.</p>
               <p>As his natural ſtrength abated in the laſt years of his life, he appeared more bright and lively in his public miniſtry, both at home and abroad; and the day he was taken ill of his laſt ſickneſs, at the funeral of one of his ſons, which was the laſt meeting he was at, he was remarkably favoured in his public teſtimony to a large gathering of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and in ſupplication at the ſame meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his great Lord and maſter was pleaſed to favour him with a tranſcendent view in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beauty of holineſs, crowning; a life, a great part of which had been, according to the meaſure received, devoted to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with evident tokens of his being near
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:020377_0234_0FAF0798718E14B8"/>
to the kingdom of reſt and peace everlaſting. And the ſame evening he was taken ill at his own houſe in Exeter aforeſaid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for about eleven days, moſtly in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pain, yet bore it with patience and reſignation to the divine will; and though he inclined much to be ſtill and quiet, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many comfortable expreſſions, ſome of which were taken down in writing. At one time he ſaid,
<q>It is a fine thing to have a clear conſcience.</q>
And one morning,
<q>Here is another day, Lord ſo preſerve me through it, that I may do nothing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee.</q>
In the evening he ſaid,
<q>Lord bleſs this night to me.</q>
And taking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give him eaſe, he ſaid.
<q>He that turned water into wine is able to give a bleſſing.</q>
After laying ſtill ſome time, ſaid,
<q>Sorrow at night, but joy cometh in the morning.</q>
And in the morning he ſaid,
<q>I remember a dream I had about fifty years ago, I thought I was in a room alone, juſt going to die, and as I was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and troubled becauſe there was no one preſent to ſee me die, I thought the great phyſician of value ſtood by me and ſaid, <hi>I will be with thee;</hi> and I have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith, that he will be with me, and if I am favoured with my ſenſes, hope I ſhall not give over wreſtling for a bleſſing.</q>
A little before noon he ſaid,
<q>Lord, this is the way of mortal men, when they come to lie on a ſick bed, they crave thy favour, though at other times many are forgetful
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:020377_0235_0FAF079985B1C380"/>
of thee.</q>
At another time he ſaid,
<q>Though affliction may not ſeem pleaſant during its continuance, yet it worketh an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great joy to them that love and fear God.</q>
And in the evening, being in great bodily pain, ſaid,
<q>Lord give me eaſe if it be thy bleſſed will.</q>
The next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt day of the week, ſeveral friends came to ſee him before meeting, to whom he ſaid,
<q>Fear God and ſerve him, and his regard will be unto you, but if you neglect to worſhip him, he will caſt you off for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</q>
or words nearly to that import. And being fearful they would over ſtay the time for meeting, inquired what hour, ſaying to them,
<q>Don't neglect the buſineſs of the Lord:</q>
And when they were going, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
<q>They would remember him when it was well with them.</q>
In the evening inquiring what ſort of a meeting they had that day, and being anſwered, a good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he ſaid with ſeeming joy,
<q>The Lord is not limited to perſons, but all that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him aright ſhall be accepted of him,</q>
or words to that effect. A little after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, being in great bodily pain, and from the ſymptoms, it was thought for about an hour he was departing, during which he appeared to have his mind retired to the Lord, and then reviving a little ſaid,
<q>This has been a bleſſed meeting.</q>
The next morning taking leave of a neighbour, he ſaid,
<q>Farewell, and if we never meet again in this world, I hope we ſhall meet in a
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:020377_0236_0FAF079C14AB88D0"/>
more glorious place among the righteous.</q>
The day before his departure his ſpeech fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, tho' he remained very ſenſible; and the laſt words he was heard to ſay, were, 'Lord in heaven receive my ſoul.' Then growing weaker until the third hour next morning, being the 11<hi>th</hi> of the firſt month 1764, he departed this life, in a quiet frame of mind, aged ſeventy-ſix years and ſome months. His corps was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Exeter aforeſaid, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a large number of his friends and neighbours.</p>

               <p>SHE was born in Radnorſhire, in Wales, and educated by her parents in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the church of England. About the thirteenth year of her age, going with her elder ſiſter to a meeting of friends, who were ſitting in awful ſilence, with tears drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping down the cheeks of divers, it made ſuch religious impreſſion on her tender mind, that ſhe thereby became in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, convinced of the truth.

               <p>SHE was born at Burlington, in Weſt-New-Jerſey, in the year 1691, being the daughter of Charles Read, who was one of the early ſettlers of Pennſylvania under

the grant to William Penn. It pleaſed the Lord to extend his gracious viſitation to her in her tender age, which as ſhe ſubmitted to and abode under, ſhe happily experienced to lead her into a life of righteouſneſs and great circumſpection. About the eighteenth year of her age, ſhe was married to our worthy friend Iſrael Pemberton, who united with her in a pious concern for the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and prevalence of the cauſe of truth, her ſincere love to which and the friends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhe uniformly manifeſted by her kind ſympathetic care as a "Mother in Iſrael." She uſefully filled the ſtation of an overſeer and elder, being carefully concerned to rule her own family well, and that her offspring might have a portion in that treaſure which faileth not. She was a true ſympathizer with thoſe under affliction of body or mind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating her ſenſibility herein, by her frequent viſits to ſuch, which were weighty and comforting, her converſation being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and inſtructive.</p>
               <p>In the firſt month 1754, it pleaſed divine providence to deprive her of her beloved huſband, in whom was removed, a father, a friend, and counſellor to her and the church; which cloſe trial (after 40 years living toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in much harmony) ſhe was enabled to bear with chriſtian calmneſs and reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; having often to experience the reality of that truth left upon record,

               <p>Few have been more zealouſly concerned, and diligent in the attendance of religious meetings, ſeldom allowing the inclemency of weather to prevent her; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to manifeſt the like concern when very feeble; which diligence, was, in the time of her confinement and languiſhing ſtate, a ſatisfactory reflection to her, as her attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had been from a real ſenſe and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of duty.</p>

               <p>SHE was the daughter of Rowland and Margaret Ellis, born near Dollegelle, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1685. She was favoured with a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which being improved by a religious education and ſtrict attention to the dictates of divine grace, ſoon diſtinguiſhed her as one ſeeking after heavenly treaſure, which made her in riper years, an honourable member of ſociety.</p>
               <p>She married our worthy and much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend John Evans, of this place, to whom ſhe was truly a help-meet, more eſpecially in public religious ſervices; for whenever ſhe diſcovered the leaſt inclination in him, to viſit the meetings of friends whether far or near, ſhe did all in her power to cheriſh and encourage the motion; ſhe was alſo a great ſupport and comfort to him under his ſpiritual conflicts about the time of his appearing firſt in a public teſtimony.</p>
               <p>In her family, ſhe was an example of piety and induſtry, riſing early in the morning,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:020377_0242_0FAF07A00DE839F8"/>
and encouraging others ſo to do, often obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thoſe who lay late, loſt the youthful beauty of the day, and waſted the moſt precious part of their time; that the ſun was the candle of the world, which called upon us to ariſe and apply to our ſeveral duties. When the affairs of the morning were tranſacted it was almoſt her invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice, except on meeting days, to retire about noon, with the bible or ſome religious book; where a portion of her time was ſpent alone; from which retirement ſhe often returned with evident tokens, that her eyes had been bathed in tears.</p>
               <p>She was remarkably well acquainted with the holy ſcriptures, as alſo the writings and characters of our ancient worthy friends, together with thoſe of her own time; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſſing,
<q>The many advantages ſhe reaped from often converſing with the dead and abſent; endeavouring to cultivate the ſame diſpoſition in her family, by often calling them together in the winter even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and requiring one of her children to read audibly in the bible or ſome other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious book;</q>
repeatedly obſerving to them,
<q>The benefit which attended preſerving the characters of thoſe faithful miniſters and elders in the church, whoſe pious lives and happy diſſolution, if held up to the view of poſterity, might be a likely means of kindling the ſame holy zeal, and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to tread in their footſteps.</q>
And as miniſtring friends (whom ſhe truly loved

from her infancy as brethren and ſiſters in goſpel fellowſhip) in the courſe of their viſits came this way, generally lodged at their houſe, at which times ſhe ſeldom miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prepare her family, and inform the neighbourhood of an intention to ſit a while together in the evening; which ſelect oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, many can yet remember, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſingularly bleſſed with divine comfort and edification.</p>
               <p>Her diligence in attending meetings for religious worſhip, was no leſs manifeſt than her ſteady zeal for ſupporting our chriſtian diſcipline, and that we might adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things: Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>She diſcovered evident traces of divine goodneſs in their uncultivated minds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In her friendſhips ſhe was warm and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and on her death bed earneſtly preſſed her children,
<q>Not to forget the friends of their father and mother;</q>
and the ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of her heart, made her very attentive to the wants of the poor in her neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>

                  <pb n="237" facs="unknown:020377_0244_0FAF07A175C8CC80"/>Some years before her deceaſe ſhe loſt in the huſband of her youth, a boſom friend, and the great ſupport of her age, which proved ſo great a trial, ſhe ſaid,
<q>That if God whom ſhe loved all her life long, had not enabled her to ſuſtain it, ſhe muſt have ſunk under it.</q>
This diſpenſation of providence weaned her from all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enjoyments. She continued attending meetings, and frequently viſiting the ſick and afflicted while her ſtrength permitted, and when that failed, much of her time was ſpent in reading the holy ſcriptures and in meditation.</p>
               <p>The early ſtate of religion in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was a grateful ſubject of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her in the evening of her day, but upon turning her eye to the preſent time, ſhe would ſay with a deep ſigh,
<q>Oh! what is become of the morning dew and celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rain, that uſed to fall and reſt upon our aſſemblies.</q>
For herſelf, ſhe often prayed,
<q>That ſhe might poſſeſs a lively reliſh of truth to the laſt, and retain the greenneſs of youth in old age, which God was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to favour her with.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Her laſt illneſs began about a year before her deceaſe, in the forepart thereof ſhe felt a lowneſs and depreſſion of mind, that cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to cry,
<q>Tell me, Oh! thou whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at noon.</q>
But after ſome time, this cloud was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:020377_0245_0FAF07A27481A680"/>
and ſhe was enabled to ſay,
<q>He brought me to the banqueting houſe, and his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over me was love.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, by remembring her creator in the days of her youth, and a ſteady perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance therein, ſhe was enabled to meet the king of terrors with a ſerene counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and reſigned her breath without a ſigh or groan, the 29<hi>th</hi> day of the fourth month, and was buried at Gwynedd, the 2<hi>d</hi> of the fifth month 1765; being, we truſt, admitted to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born, which are written in heaven.</p>

He freely gave up to ſpend both time and ſubſtance on truth's account when called thereto, having viſited ſeveral provinces on this continent, and ſome of them divers times.

yet we have good reaſon to believe, he was carried through them all, and died in peace with the Lord and goodwill to all mankind, and is enter'd into reſt, and reaps the reward of the faithful, where trouble and exerciſe are at an end.

mention'd his deſire of having a time of retirement together, in which opportunity he expreſs'd in a lively and ſenſible manner, his reſignation to the will of God reſpecting his indiſpoſition, and ſpoke of the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it would be to the members of our ſociety, if they were more drawn from the ſpirit and friendſhip of the world, and the eager purſuit after the riches and grandeur thereof; ſaying, that the profeſſors of truth ſuffered great loſs in a ſpiritual ſenſe, for want of being often deeply inward, when about their lawful callings, labouring to have their minds retired, where true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and inſtruction is to be witneſſed; and that friends who are heads of families, ought to wait for the movings of truth, to make way for them to call their children and ſervants together; and if this was but the engagement of their minds, way would be made for ſuch opportunities beyond their expectation. On which and ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he, at that time, ſpoke in a ſenſible humble manner.</p>
               <p>At other times he frequently mention'd his uneaſineſs in beholding, that many of the profeſſors of truth did not keep within the bounds of true moderation reſpecting cloathing and furniture, but rather pleaſed the natural diſpoſition, to no real advantage, and conſumed much precious time that might be profitably ſpent in doing good among mankind; ſaying, that if friends lived near enough to the inward teacher
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:020377_0249_0FAF07A7723CF258"/>
that diſcovers things to be as they really are; there are many things amongſt us termed ſmall or trifling, which would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear inconſiſtent with the pure truth.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding his affliction was great, yet he bore it with remarkable patience, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing more concern'd for the glory of God and the good of his church and people, than any temporal conſiderations: And fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſs'd his reſignation to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, being freely given up either for life or death. The retired frame of mind he generally appeared in, was inſtructive; often ſaying he felt eaſy in mind, having witneſſed a comfortable refreſhing ſeaſon, and expreſs'd his thankfulneſs for ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar favour in ſo trying a diſpenſation: Yet he had no other proſpect but that he ſhould recover, until a few hours before his deceaſe, when he ſignified,
<q>He had almoſt done with time.</q>
And changing faſt, he quietly departed, the 15<hi>th</hi> of the tenth month 1765, in a ſenſible compoſed frame of ſpirit. On the 17<hi>th</hi> his corpſe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by many friends, was interr'd in friends burying-ground in New-Garden, after a ſolid meeting.</p>

<q>At fourteen years of age, the call of the Lord was to me, when ſeeing ſome of my companions carri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But being young and not willing to bear the croſs, the witneſs for God was ſo far ſuppreſſed, that ſhe gave way to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the vanities and diverſions of the world; yet the Lord did not forget her; but ſome years after, the viſitation was renewed, and then, ſhe ſays,
<q>I returned in earneſt to look within, to my own ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to the anointing mentioned by the apoſtle John, which opened clearly in my mind.</q>
This brought her to a cloſe exerciſe, and often in ſecret prayer, that the Lord would be pleaſed to manifeſt her duty. Soon after this, ſhe went to viſit a

brother at Dolobran, who had a ſhort time before joined in communion with friends; and being at a meeting, ſhe was further reached unto, and the thoughts of her heart declared by a worthy miniſter then preſent. Her father took pains to diſſuade her from joining friends, and got ſeveral prieſts to aſſiſt him with their endeavours, but being enlightened to ſee the formality and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the profeſſion of religion in which ſhe had been educated, and the blindneſs and emptineſs of their prieſts, ſhe aquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her father,

               <p>Being taken ill in Philadelphia, in the eleventh month 1765, immediately after our quarterly-meeting which ſhe attended, after a few days illneſs, ſhe departed this life. She had divers times, to her particular friends, expreſſed her deſire, if it was the Lord's will, to finiſh her days in this city; and in her ſickneſs expreſſed her willingneſs to depart, but requeſted ſhe might be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with ſome interval of eaſe from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pain, that ſhe might take her leave of her friends, which was granted her.

               <p>SHE was born the 7<hi>th</hi> of the ſixth month 1699, near Cheſter, in the county of Cheſter in Pennſylvania. When ſhe was about five years old, her parents John and Hannah Churchman, removed and ſettled at Nottingham, in the county aforeſaid; and ſhe being religiouſly educated by them, ſoon became inwardly ſenſible of the bleſſed truth; and taking heed to its teaching, was early a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned thereby with a meek and quiet ſpirit; was a great lover of meetings for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and a humble exemplary wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er therein. About the thirty-fourth year of her age ſhe appeared in the miniſtry, and being faithful in her gift, though ſhe did not increaſe in many words, and but ſeldom appeared therein, being rather a pattern of awful ſilence, yet her teſtimony when ſhe did appear, was remarkably ſeaſoned with the baptiſing power of the ſpirit, which made it truly acceptable to friends. She was often heard to expreſs her apprehenſion of the danger of words increaſing in the church, without ſufficient weight and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and at different times, eſpecially in the latter years of her life, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic teſtimony and in private, ſhe ſpoke of a winnowing time at hand, wherein ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the chaff was to be blown away,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:020377_0254_0FAF07AB2F2B0708"/>
and the church reſtored to as great, if not a greater degree of purity than heretofore; which is now freſh in the memory of divers perſons.</p>
               <p>She was an example of plainneſs herſelf, and careful prudently to ſuppreſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in her children, as long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under her immediate care, meekly diſſuading in a moving manner, againſt any appearance of corruption in converſation, as well as the world's vain faſhions and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity in dreſs; firmly maintaining pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental authority in this ſteady reſolution which ſhe never departed from, viz. that while her children were clothed at her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, they ſhould ſubmit to have their clothes faſhioned agreeable to her mind. She was no leſs remarkable for humility and charity, a promoter of good order in the church, and of true peace upon the right foundation; for which virtues ſhe gained the general eſteem of her friends and others.</p>
               <p>Between the years 1742 and 1754, ſhe viſited moſt of the meetings of friends in Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey, Long-Iſland and the Eaſtern-ſhore of Maryland. Her care to attend meetings was memorable and worthy of imitation, even when under great bodily weakneſs and infirmity, as ſhe was for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years in the latter part of her life, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of her joints being greatly affected with the violence of rheumatic pains; all which ſhe bore with ſuch patience and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſignation of mind, as truly becomes a

               <p>She was at meeting a few weeks before her deceaſe, but feeling much bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe expreſſed her doubt of ever coming again; having at divers times before mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a ſenſe of her end being near. About five days before her deceaſe ſhe was ſeized with a fever and inward pains, which weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened her very faſt.

and about the 8<hi>th</hi> hour on the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of the firſt month 1766, ſhe quietly departed, as one falling aſleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheerful and ſenſible almoſt to the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life; in the ſixty-ſeventh year of her age, a miniſter about 33 years; and on the 3<hi>d</hi> of the ſame month, was interr'd in the burying-ground of friends at Eaſt-Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham.</p>

About a year before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe ſhe was taken with a lingering diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in which time of weakneſs ſhe was often tenderly affected, adviſing her children and others,

               <p>About four hours before her departure many friends came to ſee her, whom ſhe earneſtly beholding, deſired they would ſit down, that they might truly wait in God's fear, and that thoſe who knew how to wait would get deep in true ſilence: At which time, notwithſtanding her great weakneſs, ſhe was divinely favoured, and her tongue looſed to leave her laſt teſtimony, ſaying,

Adding,

               <p>HE was born in Maryland in the year 1688, and being convinced of the truth ſome time after he arrived to man's eſtate, was choſen an elder of the meeting where he then reſided; afterwards remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this then remote part of the country, in the fifty-ſeventh year of his age he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the miniſtry, and travelled twice on that ſervice to North-Carolina, of which viſits we receiv'd comfortable accounts from friends there; and when at home was enabled to miniſter ſuitably to the ſtate of the church, to the comfort of the true mourners in Zion, and encouragement of the faithful travellers. Towards the latter part of his time, his bodily ſtrength much failed, yet he viſited ſome of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meetings, and families of friends, to the comfort of the faithful, his miniſtry continuing to be ſound and lively.</p>

At another ſaid,

And divers times ſignified, 'He ſtill felt the comforter with him;' ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'His day's work was done.' A little before his departure, he ſang praiſes and hallelujahs, to his great Lord and maſter. Then prayed for the little handful; and taking leave of all preſent, continued in a ſweet frame of mind, ſinging praiſes until he could not be underſtood, and quietly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life, the 31<hi>ſt</hi> of the tenth month 1767, and was interr'd the 2<hi>d</hi> of the eleventh month, in the ſeventy-ninth year of his age.

When about fifteen or ſixteen years of age, our worthy friend John Gratton being abroad in truth's ſervice, was concern'd to have a meeting at a town called Alnwick, where this our friend then reſided, who ſo powerfully declared the truth, that he amongſt divers others was convinced; and carefully abiding under the diſcipline of the croſs, he in time received a part in the miniſtry. About the year 1697, he came over to Pennſylvania, and for ſome time reſided near Derby, where he enter'd into a married ſtate, and in a few years afterwards removed to the forks of Brandywine, then a new ſettled part of the country, the neareſt meeting being about eleven miles, which he ſeldom miſſed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending when of ability of body; he was alſo inſtrumental in ſettling this called Bradford meeting, within the compaſs of which he reſided the remainder of his days.

               </head>
               <p>HE was early viſited, and reached unto by the reproofs of divine light and grace, for thoſe youthful vanities and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt converſation, which by nature he was
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:020377_0267_0FAF07BAF9448D90"/>
prone to and purſued, to the grief of his pious mother, who was religiouſly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſtrain him; but as he became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the renewed viſitations of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call, denying himſelf of thoſe things he was reproved for, he not only learned to ceaſe from doing evil, but to live in the practice of doing well; and continuing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, became an example of plainneſs and ſelf-denial, for which he ſuffered much ſcoffing and mocking of thoſe who had been his companions in folly; yet he neither fainted nor was turned aſide by the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the ungodly, which thus fell to his lot, for his plain teſtimony againſt their evil conduct.</p>
               <p>In the twenty-ſixth year of his age, he appeared in the work of the miniſtry, and laboured therein in much plainneſs and godly ſincerity, adorning the doctrine he preached, by a humble circumſpect life and converſation, being exemplary in his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and induſtry to labour honeſtly for a livelihood, though often in much bodily infirmity and weakneſs, deſiring, as he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſed, that he might owe no man any thing but love. His inoffenſive open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability, drawing many of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent denominations to converſe with him, he had ſome ſeaſonable opportunities of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing and rebuking the evil doer and evil ſpeaker, which he did, in the plainneſs of an upright zeal for the promotion of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and virtue, tempered with true brotherly

kindneſs and charity; reſpecting not the perſon of the proud nor of the rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his riches, but with chriſtian free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, declaring the truth to his neighbour, and was thus in private as well as public, a preacher of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>In his public miniſtry he was zealous againſt errors both in principle and practice, and conſtantly concerned to preſs the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of obedience to the principle of divine grace; a manifeſtation of which is given to every man; knowing, from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it bringeth ſalvation to all them that obey and follow its teachings, and was frequently enabled with energy and power to bear teſtimony to the outward coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous birth, his holy example in his life and precepts, and his death and ſufferings at Jeruſalem, by which he hath obtained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal redemption for us.</p>

               <p>He travelled ſeveral times, and viſited moſt of the meetings of friends in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and New-Jerſey, and ſome in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent provinces, but was not much from home; being upwards of forty years a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

               <p>Afflictions of divers kinds, and ſome very deep and exerciſing, fell to his lot through the courſe of his life, which he was enabled to bear with exemplary patience and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and particularly through his laſt ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which, for upwards of ſix weeks, he underwent great difficulty and pain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflicted with the aſthma and dropſy, ſo that he ſuffered much, yet was never heard to utter a murmur or complaint, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſſed his thankfulneſs, that he had not more pain, and often engaged in prayer, that he might be preſerved in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the end, which was graciouſly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; ſo that he was capable of ſpeaking to the comfort and edification of thoſe who viſited him; and from the fervent love of the brethren, which evidently appeared thro' his life, and moſt conſpicuouſly during his laſt illneſs, and even in the hour of his death, we have a well-grounded aſſurance that he is paſſed unto life, and hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reward of the righteouſs.</p>

               <p>OUR ſaid friend was born in England, of parents not profeſſing with us, who brought him over with them when very young, and reſided in New-Jerſey in the early ſettlement of that province. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he became capable of religious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was convinced of the principle of truth as profeſſed by us, on which account he underwent the diſpleaſure of, and ſome ſeverities from his father, but being ſteady and prudent in conduct, and faithful to his convincement, he at length ſo gained on his father's affections, that after ſome time he became reconciled and friendly to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>He became a member of this monthly, and of Abington particular meeting, on or about the thirtieth year of his age, and ſo continued to the end of his life, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, when at home and in health, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attender of thoſe meetings, tho' living at a conſiderable diſtance therefrom.</p>
               <p>When about forty-eight years of age, he appeared in the miniſtry, and became a faithful labourer therein according to abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He had little or no ſchool learning, yet delighted much in hearing the ſcriptures read, and often promoted the reading of them in his family; by means whereof and a retentive memory, he ſometimes, thro' the aſſiſtance of divine grace, quoted texts
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:020377_0274_0FAF07C1F5712ED0"/>

               <p>He divers times viſited moſt of the diſtant meetings of friends on this continent, and on his return produced ſatisfactory accounts of his ſervices in thoſe viſits. He often communicated good and wholeſome advice to his neighbours of other religious deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, amongſt whom he was generally reſpected, as a good neighbour, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, innocent, inoffenſive man.</p>
               <p>Altho' he did not appear to be much gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the exerciſe of the diſcipline, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſtant attender of meetings appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe, and a diligent waiter therein, there was a language intelligible in his ſolid ſilence, which communicated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to his friends, who were always well pleaſed with his company.</p>

               <p>This worthy friend approved himſelf to be one who had ſubmitted to the yoke and croſs of Chriſt in his youth, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and operation of truth upon him, was made ſenſible of the neceſſity of living a circumſpect and ſelf-denying-life; and as he yielded obedience to the dictates of grace, being thereby ſubjected to the divine will and requirings, the Lord was pleaſed to employ him in his vineyard, and to qualify him for ſervice therein, both in the exerciſe of the diſcipline of the church, and as a miniſter of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>He was exemplary in life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his deportment being meek, humble and innocently cheerful, yet guarding againſt any thing that would tend to lightneſs in behaviour, his company was pleaſant, and his words ſavoury and edifying: A tender affectionate huſband and parent, a kind friend and neighbour; not of a murmuring diſpoſition when he met with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and afflictions, but freely ſubmitted to what was permitted to come upon him.</p>

                  <pb n="270" facs="unknown:020377_0277_0FAF07C4AFE19950"/>He was zealous for the cauſe of God, and the ſupport of chriſtian diſcipline in its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious branches, not haſty in giving his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on matters relative thereto; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deliberately waiting for a proper quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he moſtly ſpake cloſe and pertinent, with clearneſs and ſoundneſs of judgment.

Yet he was at times, led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſympathy and travel of ſoul for ſuch who through inadvertency had miſſed their way, and were in ſome meaſure ſenſible of their error; to thoſe he ſome times extended private admonition and counſel, in love to their ſouls, and with deſires for their reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It may truly be ſaid, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a large ſhare of natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which being ſanctified by divine grace, he became well qualified for ſervice in the church.</p>
               <p>As a miniſter, be approved himſelf one rightly called to the work, having experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a growth from a good beginning to a large advancement, and at times, thro' di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aid was enabled to deliver much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent doctrine to the comfort and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of ſuch whoſe minds were gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a true inward worſhip of God in ſpirit: And the negligent were exhorted to more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the great work of religion and their ſouls ſalvation.</p>

He had a clear delivery and ready utterance, his ſtile being familiar to the loweſt capacities, his matter well connected, his doctrine ſound, his powerful miniſtry having a great reach upon the people.

               <p>We are fully ſatisfied he was one whom the Lord in his wiſdom ſaw meet to make uſe of for the work of the goſpel, having fitted, qualified and called him forth when but young, to publiſh the glad tidings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; to which divine call and holy requiring, he gave up in obedience, and ſuffered not the things of this world to take up his mind, but in true fervency of zeal and love for the cauſe of truth, he ſpent much time in its ſervice.

               <p>He was ſteadily concern'd to promote good order and diſcipline, and therein to act uprightly for truth's cauſe without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.

               <p>In his declining years he was affected with bodily weakneſs, yet his zeal for the cauſe of truth did not abate, but the life and power uſually attending his miniſtry rather increaſed. In his laſt teſtimony at our meeting, he was highly favoured, the power of truth riſing into dominion; with much ſalutary counſel and fatherly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition he ſeemed to take a final farewell of his brethren, and fervently prayed for our preſervation.

He departed this life, the 5<hi>th</hi> of the fifth month 1769, in the ſixty-ſixth year of his age; and as a good and faithful ſervant, we doubt not, is entered into everlaſting joy and happineſs.

               </head>
               <p>HE was born in Rhode-Iſland, of honeſt parents, who died whilſt he was young, from which time until he came to man's eſtate, we have no account of him, only that ſome of us have heard him ſay, he was much delighted with mirth and vanity. Soon after his arrival at manhood, he came into New-Jerſey, where he married, and ſettled at Eveſham; not long afterwards he was convinced, and effectually reached with the power of truth, through the living mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of that eminent miniſter of Chriſt Jeſus, Thomas Wilſon; and by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of divine grace in his heart, he gradually experienced a growth therein. Thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing in true obedience, he witneſſed an overcoming of his own ſtrong will (as ſome of us have heard him relate with awful gratitude to the divine hand) and in due time he became a father and elder in the church; being tenderly concerned for the promotion of the truth, which had in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſet him free from the body of ſin and death, communicating ſuitable advice and counſel to ſuch as were tender, and a ſharp reprover of obſtinate ſinners; his advice being much enforced by his upright uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form conduct.</p>
               <p>In converſation he was free and open, and eaſy of acceſs: In meetings for worſhip and

He was of a benevolent diſpoſition, his heart and houſe being open to entertain ſtrangers, eſpecially travelling friends; nor was his benevolence confined to thoſe of our own ſociety; for, being bleſſed with afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, many widows and fatherleſs received his hearty aſſiſtance. He was well beloved by moſt or all who were acquainted with him; his converſation and conduct truly demonſtrated, that he had learn'd to do to others, as he would be done unto; which is truly worthy the imitation of all. Being deſirous to retire from the cares of the world, he removed to Mount-Holly, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided until he was taken with a paralytick diſorder, which much impaired his natural faculties, after which he return'd to his former ſettlement at Eveſham under the care of his ſon. Altho' his diſorder render'd him incapable of much converſation, yet he gave evident ſigns of a lively ſenſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs accompanying him to the laſt; and quietly departed this life, the 9<hi>th</hi> of the firſt month 1770, in the eighty-eighth year of his age, and was buried the 11<hi>th</hi> of the ſame month at Eveſham.</p>

               <p>WHEN John the Divine was in exile in the iſle of Patmos,
<q>He heard a voice from Heaven, ſaying, write,— bleſſed are the dead, who die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea ſaith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them;</q>
which we believe now is the portion of our worthy friend, concerning whoſe faithful ſervices we are engaged from the united motives of love and duty, to give this teſtimony; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, that all who read it, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the youth, may be excited, by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to ſeek an early acquaintance with the Lord, and to take up their daily croſs in the prime of their days. Thus, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, may become ſhining lights and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of good to others.</p>
               <p>He was born in this city, in the year 1708, and his father dying before his birth, and his mother a few years after, he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great trials and hardſhips when very young: Being early concerned to ſeek the knowledge of God, he had a fervent deſire to attend religious meetings, though ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to many difficulties and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before that privilege was allowed him; yet, being earneſt in his deſires to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain divine favour, he was eminently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:020377_0290_0FAF07D1731C2310"/>
under great conflicts and probations, and, continuing faithful to the degrees of light and grace communicated, a diſpenſati- of the goſpel miniſtry was committed to him, ſometime before the term of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip was expired; and abiding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſanctifying power of truth, he grew in his gift, and became a zealous faithful miniſter.</p>
               <p>He was very exemplary in his induſtry and diligence, in labouring faithfully at his trade, to provide for his own ſupport, and after he married, and had children, for their maintenance; and was often concerned to adviſe others to the ſame neceſſary care; yet he continued fervent in ſpirit for the promotion of truth and righteouſneſs, ſo that he was ſoon engaged to leave home, and the neareſt connections of nature, to publiſh the glad tidings of the goſpel, and frequently viſited moſt of the meetings of friends in this and the adjacent provinces, and ſeveral times as far as the eaſtern parts of New-England. Having thus honeſtly diſcharged his duty among us above twenty years, and feeling his mind conſtrained in the love of the goſpel, to viſit the few friends who remained in ſome of the Weſt-India iſlands, and from thence the meetings of friends in general through Great-Britain and Ireland, he communicated his concern to a few of his moſt intimate friends, who having unity therewith, he was encouraged to lay it before our monthly-meeting. Before he
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:020377_0291_0FAF07D2363C71F8"/>
entered on this weighty ſervice, he paſſed through a near trial and affliction in the death of his beloved wife; under which exerciſe he was graciouſly ſupported by the arm of divine ſtrength, which had often been revealed for his help, in times of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conflicts and outward diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>His concern to travel in the ſervice of truth continuing, and the meeting having full unity with him therein, he embarked in the fifth month 1748, accompanied by our dear friend, Samuel Nottingham, in a veſſel bound for Barbados, and having vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the few meetings in that iſland, they went by way of Antigua to Tortola, where they continued ſometime, having ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to get a paſſage to Europe; and their voyage thither was attended with ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular hazards and dangers, which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their landing in Ireland; where our friend Daniel continued ſome months, viſiting the meetings of friends in that kingdom; and after he apprehended himſelf clear, went over to England, and viſited the meetings generally in that nation, and in Wales and Scotland, where his meek circumſpect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and converſation, and lively edifying miniſtry, rendered his viſit very acceptable, and his memory precious.</p>
               <p>In his return home, and for ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was in a low afflicted ſtate of mind; being apprehenſive, that through diffidence, and the want of perfect reſignation to the divine will, he had omitted fully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:020377_0292_0FAF07D2EF009F90"/>
the ſervice required of him, by not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the few friends in Holland: Yet he was mercifully preſerved, and after a time of deep exerciſe, raiſed again to ſing of the mercies and loving-kindneſs of God on the banks of deliverance.</p>
               <p>He ſeveral times, with other friends ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to that ſervice, viſited the families of friends in this city, and between the years 1757 and 1760, being accompanied by our friend John Pemberton, he viſited the families of friends generally within the limits of our meeting; which weighty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing ſervice, he was enabled to perform to our edification and ſatisfaction. After which, he was frequently engaged to excite friends to this uſeful and edifying practice.</p>
               <p>In the twelfth month 1760, he ſet out on a viſit to the meetings in the weſtern parts of this province, and from thence in Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Virginia, and North and South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and returned in the ſixth month fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; ſince which he frequently viſited many of the meetings near home, and ſome as far as Long-Iſland, and other parts of the province of New-York. Within the laſt two years, he viſited the families of friends of ſome of the meetings in Weſt-Jerſey, in the city of New-York, and part of Long-Iſland; and after his return from this ſervice, with great peace and ſatisfaction, he expreſſed his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that he was now clear of all places, and that his ſtay here was near over; having
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:020377_0293_0FAF07D59B84E818"/>
an evidence, that he had been faithfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from his youth to fear and ſerve God.</p>
               <p>His chief labour and religious exerciſes were in this city, where he was a diligent attender of all our meetings, and often on committees appointed on the ſervices of the church; in which he was ſolid and weighty in ſpirit, waiting for the ſpringing up of life, being ſteadily concerned both in and out of meetings, to live near the divine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Thus he was very frequently qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enabled to ſtir up the pure mind, and to recount the gracious dealings of God to mankind, and as a faithful embaſſador to warn the negligent to flee from the wrath to come, and to excite the people to bring forth fruits anſwerable to the great mercies graciouſly beſtowed on us; and was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſtrained to declare in a prophetic manner, a day of trial, in divers inſtances, very ſhortly before ſuch a ſeaſon came to paſs.</p>
               <p>He was of late deeply exerciſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the evils of the horſe races, ſtage plays, drunkenneſs, and other groſs enormities encouraged and increaſing in this city; cloſely exhorting our youth againſt thoſe pernicious and deſtructive devices of the enemy of mankind; and under the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe that God will judge and puniſh the wicked and evil doers, he was often fervent in public ſupplications, that the Lord would lengthen out the day of his merciful viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and yet try the people longer; which ſeaſons were ſolemn and humblingly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; manifeſting, that although he was very cloſe and ſharp in reproof againſt evil, yet moſt tenderly concerned, that the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the righteous law of God might be prevailed with to repent, return, and live.</p>
               <p>His love for the riſing generation was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great; which he manifeſted by his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate notice of them, and eſpecially of thoſe who were religiouſly inclined, and his houſe was open to receive ſuch, his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with them being ſeaſoned with grace, and his counſel inſtructive and helpful to thoſe who had ſeeking deſires after the knowledge of truth, often lovingly inviting them to come, taſte, and ſee, that the Lord is good; greatly deſiring, that all who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth, might walk agreeable to its dictates and be led thereby, as our worthy predeceſſors were, into that meekneſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and godly ſimplicity and plainneſs, which rendered them conſpicuous and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning examples, and that none might reſt ſhort of the enjoyment of the life or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his zeal being great againſt ſuch, who have the form of godlineſs, and by their actions manifeſt they have not the power thereof; and he often fervently advis'd and cautioned thoſe who are eagerly purſuing the world, and by the ſurfeiting cares, and graſping after earthly treaſures, fruſtrate the good purpoſe of the viſitation of divine grace to them, and cloſely reminded thoſe, who

in their ſmall beginnings were low and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that now they were abundantly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhould not ſet their affections on things below, but remember the rock from whence they were hewn; and his concern was great that thoſe who had the glad tidings of the goſpel to publiſh, might be true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to the flock, and adorn the doctrine they had to deliver by a circumſpect life and converſation, and where any by not ſteadily keeping to that which would have preſerved them, had involved themſelves in difficulties, either by letting their minds out to the gains and profits of this world, or otherwiſe, his travail was great for ſuch that they might be brought through, and every cloud and miſt removed.</p>
               <p>He was much employed in viſiting the ſick and afflicted, to whom he adminiſtered his ſpiritual advice and experience, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten engaged in humble prayer for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and in the diſtributing to the neceſſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous according to his circumſtances, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his benevolent diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>As he had been many years under great exerciſe and ſuffering of ſpirit on account of the ſlavery of the poor Africans, and frequently bore teſtimony againſt that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous gain of oppreſſion, he was of late ſomewhat relieved, as he found the eyes of the people become more open to ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of the practice; and he died in faith, that the light of the goſpel will ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail, that the profeſſors of chriſtianity
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:020377_0296_0FAF07D90DA85680"/>
will find it their duty to reſtore to theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their natural right to liberty, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the principles of the chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>On the 5<hi>th</hi> day of the fifth month, he was violently ſeized with the bilious cholic, and continued in great pain ſeveral days; but afterwards being ſomewhat eaſier, he was at our morning and evening meetings on firſtday, the 13<hi>th</hi> of the month, in which he was much favoured in his public mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and expreſſed that he thought his time would not be long with us. After this day's labour, he was again confined, yet being a little recovered he was at our meeting on fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the 24<hi>th</hi> of the month, which being ſmall, he expreſſed his ſorrow for it, and encouraged friends to diligence in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of week day meetings, the benefit of a faithful diſcharge of duty therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great; the next day he was at our monthly-meeting, and to his own and our admiration was enabled to ſtay through both our ſittings, though the laſt of them was longer than uſual, and he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that he thought himſelf better in the meeting than when out; it was a ſeaſon of divine favour, and ſome weighty matters being before the meeting, he with great openneſs ſpoke pertinently and clearly to them, encouraging friends to the ſupporting and maintaining our chriſtian teſtimony, againſt all that is contrary to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For two or three weeks before his ſickneſs, he appeared very deſirous of ſettling every thing he had to do reſpecting the affairs of this life, and deſired a friend to review and tranſcribe the ſhort memoirs he hath left of his travels and religious ſervices, and to write his will, which he executed the day before he was firſt taken ſick, and then appeared eaſy in his mind.</p>
               <p>During the time of his ſickneſs he often expreſſed his concern leſt his friends ſhould be too anxious for his recovery, ſaying, if he ſhould live longer, and thro' any human frailty or infirmity occaſion any reproach, it would be a cauſe of ſorrow to them.</p>
               <p>By the deſire of his friends who attended him, he rode out ſeveral times, tho' not without much difficulty, and ſpent the two laſt days of his life at the houſes of two of his intimate friends.

               <p>During his ſickneſs, he frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf in a very ſeaſonable, inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and affecting manner; and the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſtday before he died, ſeveral friends coming in to ſee him, he ſpoke a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She was the daughter of Henry and Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Burr, by whom ſhe was religiouſly educated, we believe to good effect; for in her very young years, ſhe cloſed in with the love and mercy of God extended to her, and did not incline to vanity and lightneſs, but was a good example to other youths.</p>
               <p>She married young, and with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Jacob Lippincott, ſettled among us.

                  <pb n="296" facs="unknown:020377_0303_0FAF0686BA6E0DB8"/>In the decline of life, ſhe underwent much bodily infirmity, yet diligently attended meetings when of ability, where ſhe was a humble waiter for the ariſing of the pure truth, travelling in the deeps for the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; well qualified for ſervices in the church, a true mourner in Zion, being grieved for the corruptions, vain faſhions, and cuſtoms of the times, and in obſerving the gaiety and lightneſs apparent in ſome, when they came to places for worſhip.

Thomas Thornborough, of the ſame place, being on a religious viſit to friends of this nation, departed this life, at the houſe of a friend near New-Caſtle upon Tyne. The deep regard we bear to his memory and eminent ſervices, engageth us to tranſmit the following teſtimony concerning him.</p>
               <p>They arrived in London about a week af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the yearly-meeting 1771, and attending ſeveral meetings in that city, proceeded northward, viſiting friends in divers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in England, and alſo in Scotland. The enſuing winter was ſpent in viſiting York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Lancaſhire and Ireland, returning to London in time to attend the yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there in 1772; then attending the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meetings in Eſſex, Suffolk and Norfolk, and proceeding through Lincolnſhire to Hull, they took ſhipping for Holland, and after viſiting the few friends there, they embarked for Scarborough, but by contrary winds landed at Shields, the 25<hi>th</hi> of the eighth month, and after being at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the 26<hi>th</hi> came that afternoon to the houſe of a friend near New-Caſtle upon Tyne.</p>
               <p>From accounts received, and our own knowledge of his conduct and miniſtry, we have good cauſe to believe, that in all his travels in Europe, he behaved as a faithful miniſter of Chriſt, exemplary and uniform in conduct, of a weighty deportment and retired ſpirit, his converſation was grave and inſtructive, ſeaſoned with love and
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:020377_0305_0FAF068775BA5D30"/>
ſweetneſs, which rendered his company both profitable and deſirable, his miniſtry was living and powerful, deep and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an excellent example in patiently wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the clear manifeſtation of the divine will, and careful to move accordingly, ſo that his appearances in meetings were moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with great ſolemnity, in which he ſkilfully divided the word, being to the unfaithful as a two edged ſword, but to the honeſt hearted travellers in Zion, and to ſuch as were ſeeking the way to God's kingdom, his doctrine was truly refreſhing. He was a man of ſound judgment, quick of apprehenſion, and deep in religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and altho' he was only in the thirty-ninth year of his age, yet ſuch was his experience and ſtability, that he ſtood as an elder and a father in the church, worthy of double honour.</p>
               <p>He attended the meeting at New-Caſtle, on the 27<hi>th</hi> of the eighth month 1772, in which he delivered a ſhort and living teſtimony in the love of the goſpel to his friends of that place; that afternoon he was cheerful, and expreſſed his ſatisfaction in being there, and upon being aſked what place they intended for next, he replied, he ſaw no further at preſent than New-Caſtle. Next day he was taken ill, which was not apprehended to be the ſmall pox 'till the fourth day of his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; when the eruption appeared, he ſaid to his companion,
<q>This ſickneſs is nigh unto death if not quite;</q>
his companion
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:020377_0306_0FAF068847A43510"/>
ſignified his hope that it might not be ſo, he replied,
<q>My coming hither ſeems to be providential, and when I wait I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed and ſee no further.</q>
At another time he made the ſame remark to a friend, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q>It will be a ſore trial to my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if I am now removed.</q>
He alſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in an affectionate manner his dear wife and children to a friend who attended him, and requeſted ſome counſel and advice (which he then communicated) might be tranſmitted to them, if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to remove him, which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done.</p>
               <p>On the third day of his illneſs, two friends from the country came to viſit him, to whom he thus expreſſed himſelf, viz.
<q>I have longed to ſee you and be with you, but was put by,</q>
one of them ſaid, I hope we ſhall have thee with us yet; he anſwered, 'That muſt be left;' the friend ſaid, that whatever affliction we are tried with, we may yet ſee cauſe of thankfulneſs; he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<q>Great cauſe indeed, I never ſaw it clearer, O the wiſdom! the wiſdom and goodneſs, the mercy and kindneſs has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me wonderful, and the further and deeper we go, the more we wonder; I have admired ſince I was caſt upon this bed, that all the world does not ſeek after the truth, it ſo far tranſcends all other things.</q>
Two friends from Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land coming to viſit him, he ſaid,
<q>The Lord knows how I have loved you from
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:020377_0307_0FAF068AE71FA3E8"/>
our firſt acquaintance, and longed for your growth and eſtabliſhment in the bleſſed truth; and now I feel the ſame renewed afreſh;</q>
and ſaid,
<q>He much deſired they might fill up the places Providence intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lay up treaſure in Heaven,</q>
adding,
<q>What would a thouſand worlds avail me now?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The diſorder was very heavy upon him, having a load of eruption, under which he ſhewed great fortitude and patience even to the admiration of the phyſician and ſurgeon who attended him; his mind being merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved calm, and reſigned to his maſter's will, whoſe preſence he found to be near him in the needful time, ſaying,
<q>It is enough, my maſter is here;</q>
and again,
<q>He that laid the foundation of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans knows this, if it pleaſes him he can remove it;</q>
at another time he ſaid with great compoſure,
<q>The Lord knows beſt, I am in his hands, let him do what he pleaſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Perceiving a friend to be diligent and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to do what ſhe could for him, he ſaid,
<q>The Lord refreſh thy ſpirit, for thou haſt often refreſhed this body, and whether I live or die, thou wilt get thy reward.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the ſecond fever came on, finding himſelf worſe, he ſaid,
<q>My life hangs upon a thread.</q>
The doctor being ſent for, he ſaid,

'Entirely.' Underſtanding that two friends who had ſat much by him, did not intend to leave him that night, he very ſweetly ſaid,

               <p>HE was born in Northampton, in the county of Burlington, and province of Weſt-New-Jerſey, in the eighth month 1720,
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:020377_0309_0FAF068CE71FAFA0"/>
of religious parents, who inſtructed him very early in the principles of the chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as profeſſed by the people called Quakers, which he eſteemed a bleſſing to him, even in his young years, tending to preſerve him from the infection of wicked children; but through the workings of the enemy, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity incident to youth, he frequently deviated from thoſe parental precepts, by which he laid a renewed foundation for repentance, that was finally ſucceeded by a godly ſorrow not to be repented of, and ſo became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that ſanctifying power which qualifies for true goſpel miniſtry, into which he was called about the twenty-ſecond year of his age, and by a faithful uſe of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents committed to him, he experienced an increaſe, until he arrived at the ſtate of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, capable of dividing the word aright to the different ſtates he miniſtered unto; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing. milk to babes, and meat to thoſe of riper years. Thus he found the efficacy of that power to ariſe, which in his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<q>Prepares the creature to ſtand like a trumpet through which the Lord ſpeaks to his people.</q>
He was a loving huſband, a tender father, and very humane to every part of the creation under his care.</p>
               <p>His concern for the poor and thoſe in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction was evident by his viſits to them; whom he frequently relieved by his aſſiſtance and charity. He was for many years deeply exerciſed on account of the poor enſlaved A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans, whoſe cauſe, as he ſometimes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:020377_0310_0FAF068D929389F8"/>
lay almoſt continually upon him, and to obtain liberty to thoſe captives, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured both in public and private; and was favoured to ſee his endeavours crowned with conſiderable ſucceſs. He was particularly deſirous that friends ſhould not be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to lay burthens on this oppreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but remember the days of ſuffering from which they had been providentially delivered, that if times of trouble ſhould return, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice dealt to thoſe in ſlavery might riſe in judgment againſt us, but, being clear, we might on ſuch occaſions addreſs the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a degree of confidence, for his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and relief, being particularly careful as to himſelf, not to countenance ſlavery even by the uſe of thoſe conveniencies of life which were furniſhed by their labour.</p>
               <p>He was deſirous to have his own, and the minds of others, redeemed from the pleaſures, and immoderate profits of this world, and to fix them on thoſe joys which fade not away; his principal care being after a life of purity, endeavouring to avoid not only the groſſer pollutions, but thoſe alſo which, appearing in a more refined dreſs, are not ſufficiently guarded againſt by ſome well diſpoſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In the latter part of his life he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the plainneſs and ſimplicity of his dreſs, and as much as poſſible, avoided the uſe of plate, coſtly furniture and feaſting; thereby endeavouring to become an example of temperance and ſelf-denial, which, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved himſelf called unto; and was favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:020377_0311_0FAF068E36271150"/>
with peace therein, altho' it carried the appearance of great auſterity in the view of ſome. He was very moderate in his charges in the way of buſineſs, and in his deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gain; and tho' a man of induſtry, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtrove much to lead others out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme labour, and anxiouſneſs after periſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things; being deſirous that the ſtrength of our bodies might not be ſpent in procuring things unprofitable, and that we might uſe moderation and kindneſs to the brute ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals under our care, to prize the uſe of them as a great favour, and by no means abuſe them; that the gifts of Providence ſhould be thankfully received and applied to the uſes they were deſigned.</p>
               <p>He ſeveral times opened a ſchool at Mount-Holly, for the inſtruction of poor friends children and others, being concerned for their help and improvement therein: His love and care for the riſing youth among us was truly great, recommending to parents and thoſe who have the charge of them, to chuſe conſcientious and pious tutors, ſaying,
<q>It is a lovely ſight to behold innocent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</q>
and that
<q>To labour for their help againſt that which would marr the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His miniſtry was ſound, very deep and penetrating, ſometimes pointing out the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſituation which indulgence and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom leads into; frequently exhorting others, eſpecially the youth, not to be diſcouraged at the difficulties which occur, but preſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:020377_0312_0FAF068F0AB925D0"/>
purity. He often expreſſed an earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement that pure wiſdom ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, which would lead into lowlineſs of mind and reſignation to the divine will, in which ſtate ſmall poſſeſſions here would be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>In tranſacting the affairs of diſcipline, his judgment was ſound and clear, and he was very uſeful in treating with thoſe who had done amiſs; he viſited ſuch in a private way in that plainneſs which truth dictates, ſhewing great tenderneſs and chriſtian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance. He was a conſtant attender of our yearly-meeting, in which he was a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and particularly uſeful; aſſiſting in the buſineſs thereof with great weight and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. He ſeveral times viſited moſt of the meetings of friends in this and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring provinces, with the concurrence of the monthly-meeting to which he belonged, and we have reaſon to believe had good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice therein, generally or always expreſſing at his return how it had fared with him, and the evidence of peace in his mind for thus performing his duty. He was often concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other friends in the important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of viſiting families, which he was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to go through to ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>In the minutes of the meeting of miniſters and elders for this quarter, at the foot of a liſt of the members of that meeting, made about five years before his death, we find in his hand-writing the following obſervation and reflections.</p>

               <p>In the twelfth month 1771, he acquainted this meeting that he found his mind drawn towards a religious viſit to friends in ſome parts of England, particularly in Yorkſhire. In the firſt month 1772, he obtained our cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, which was approved and endorſed by our quarterly-meeting, and by the half year's meeting of miniſters and elders at Philadelphia. He embarked on his voyage in the fifth and arrived in London in the ſixth month following, at the time of their annual meeting in that city.

                  <pb n="308" facs="unknown:020377_0315_0FAF06912F6D76D8"/>He arrived in the city of London the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the laſt yearly-meeting, and after attending that meeting travelled northward, viſiting the quarterly-meetings of Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Buckinghamſhire, Northamptonſhire, Oxfordſhire and Worceſterſhire, and divers particular meetings in his way.</p>
               <p>He viſited many meetings on the weſt-ſide of this county, alſo ſome in Lancaſhire and Weſtmoreland, from whence he came to our quarterly-meeting in the laſt ninth month, and though much out of health, yet was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to attend all the ſittings of that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing except the laſt.</p>
               <p>His diſorder then, which proved the ſmall-pox, increaſed ſpeedily upon him, and was very afflicting; under which he was ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in much meekneſs, patience, and chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fortitude; to thoſe who attended him in his illneſs, his mind appeared to be centered in divine love; under the precious influence whereof, we believe he finiſhed his courſe, and entered into the manſions of everlaſting reſt.</p>
               <p>In the early part of his illneſs he requeſted a friend to write and he broke forth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O Lord my God! the amazing horrors of darkneſs were gathered around me and covered me all over, and I ſaw no way to go forth; I felt the miſery of my fellow creatures ſeparated from the divine har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and it was heavier than I could bear, and I was cruſhed down under it; I lifted up my hand, and ſtretched out my
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:020377_0316_0FAF0694CE046CB8"/>
arm, but there was none to help me; I looked round about and was amazed: In the depths of miſery, O Lord! I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that thou art omnipotent, that I had called thee father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou hadſt pity upon me, when no man could help me; I ſaw that meekneſs under ſuffering was ſhewed to us in the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting example of thy ſon, and thou waſt teaching me to follow him, and I ſaid, thy will O father, be done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many more of his weighty expreſſions might have been inſerted here, but it was deemed unneceſſary, they being already publiſhed in print.</p>
               <p>He was a man endued with a large natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacity, and being obedient to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of divine grace, having in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and humility endured many deep bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, he became thereby ſanctified and fitted for the Lord's work, and was truly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his church; dwelling in awful fear and watchfulneſs, he was careful in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic appearances to feel the putting forth of the divine hand, ſo that the ſpring of the goſpel miniſtry often flowed through him with great ſweetneſs and purity, as a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream to the weary travellers towards the city of God: Skilful in dividing the word, he was furniſhed by him in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to communicate freely to the ſeveral
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:020377_0317_0FAF0695D7A2A0F0"/>
ſtates of the people where his lot was caſt. His conduct at other times was ſeaſoned with the like watchful circumſpection and attention to the guidance of divine wiſdom, which rendered his whole converſation uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly edifying.</p>
               <p>He was fully perſuaded that as the life of Chriſt comes to reign in the earth, all abuſe and unneceſſary oppreſſion, both of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and brute creation will come to an end; but under the ſenſe of a deep revolt, and an overflowing ſtream of unrighteouſneſs, his life has been often a life of mourning.</p>
               <p>He was deeply concerned on account of that inhuman and iniquitous practice of making ſlaves of the people of Africa, or holding them in that ſtate; and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we underſtand he hath not only wrote ſome books, but travelled much on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of America, in order to make the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro maſters (eſpecially thoſe in profeſſion with us) ſenſible of the evil of ſuch a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and though in this journey to England, he was far removed from the outward ſight of their ſufferings, yet his deep exerciſe of mind remained, as appears by a ſhort trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe he wrote in this journey, and his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent concern to open the miſerable ſtate of this deeply injured people: His teſtimony in the laſt meeting he attended was on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, wherein he remarked, that as we as a ſociety, when under outward ſufferings, had often found it our concern to lay them before thoſe in authority, and thereby in
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:020377_0318_0FAF0696A9065990"/>
the Lord's time, had obtained relief, ſo he recommended this oppreſſed part of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to our notice, that we may as way may open, repreſent their ſufferings in an individual, if not a ſociety, capacity to thoſe in authority.</p>
               <p>Deeply ſenſible that the deſire to gratify people's inclinations in luxury and ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is the principal ground of oppreſſion, and the occaſion of many unneceſſary wants, he believed it to be his duty to be a pattern of great ſelf-denial, with reſpect to the things of this life, and earneſtly to labour with friends in the meekneſs of wiſdom, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on their minds the great importance of our teſtimony in theſe things, recommending to the guidance of the bleſſed truth in this and all other concerns, and cautioning ſuch as are experienced therein, againſt contenting themſelves with acting up to the ſtandard of others, but to be careful to make the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of truth manifeſted to them, the meaſure of their obedience; for ſaid he,
<q>That pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of life which proceeds from faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in following the ſpirit of truth, that ſtate where our minds are devoted to ſerve God, and all our wants are bounded by his wiſdom; this habitation has often, been opened before me as a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement for the children of the light, where they may ſtand ſeparated from that which diſordereth and confuſeth the affairs of ſociety, and where we may have a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our innocence in the hearts of thoſe who behold us.</q>

                  <pb n="312" facs="unknown:020377_0319_0FAF069733F9DCC8"/>We conclude with fervent deſires, that we as a people may thus, by our example, promote the Lord's work in the earth; and our hearts being prepared, may unite in prayer to the great Lord of the harveſt, that as in his infinite wiſdom he hath greatly ſtripped the church, by removing of late divers faithful miniſters and elders, he may be pleaſed to ſend forth many more faithful labourers into his harveſt.</p>

               <p>FOURTH-DAY morning, 30<hi>th</hi> of the ninth month 1772, being aſked how he felt himſelf, he meekly anſwered, I don't know that I have ſlept this night, I feel the diſorder making its progreſs, but my mind is mercifully preſerved in ſtillneſs and peace: Sometime after he ſaid he was ſenſible the pains of death muſt be hard to bear, but if he eſcaped them now, he muſt ſometime paſs thro' them, and he did not know that he could be better prepared, but had no will in it. He ſaid he had ſettled his outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to his mind, had taken leave of his wife and family as never to return, leaving them to the divine protection; adding, and tho' I feel them near to me at this time, yet I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give them up, having a hope that they
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:020377_0320_0FAF0697F7353978"/>
will be provided for. And a little after ſaid, This trial is made eaſier than I could have thought, my will being wholly taken away; for if I was anxious for the event it would have been harder, but I am not, and my mind enjoys a perfect calm.</p>
               <p>In the night a young woman having giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him ſomething to drink, he ſaid, My child thou ſeems very kind to me a poor creature, the Lord will reward thee for it. Awhile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he cried out with great earneſtneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Oh my father! my father! and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſaid, Oh my father! my father! how comfortable art thou to my ſoul in this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſon. Being aſked if he could take a little nouriſhment; after ſome pauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, my child I cannot tell what to ſay to it; I ſeem nearly arrived where my ſoul ſhall have reſt from all its troubles. After giving in ſomething to be inſerted in his journal, he ſaid, I believe the Lord will now excuſe me from exerciſes of this kind; and I ſee no work but one which is to be the laſt wrought by me in this world, the meſſenger will come that will releaſe me from all theſe troubles; but it muſt be in the Lord's time, which I am waiting for. He ſaid he had laboured to do whatever was required, according to the ability received, in the remembrance of which he had peace; and tho' the diſorder was ſtrong at times, and would like a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind come over his mind; yet it had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been kept ſteady and center'd in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love; adding, and if that be mercifully
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:020377_0321_0FAF0698E432A5B8"/>
continued, I aſk nor deſire no more. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time he ſaid, he had long had a view of viſiting this nation, and ſometime before he came had a dream, in which he ſaw himſelf in the northern parts of it, and that the ſpring of the goſpel was opened in him much as in the beginning of friends, ſuch as George Fox and William Dewſbury, and he ſaw the different ſtates of the people, as clear as he had everſeen flowers in a garden; but in his going along he was ſuddenly ſtopt, tho' he could not ſee for what end; but looking towards home, fell into a flood of tears, which waked him.</p>
               <p>At another time he ſaid, my draught ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrongeſt towards the north, and I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my own monthly-meeting, that attending the quarterly-meeting at York, and being there looked like home to me.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day night, having repeatedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to take medicine with a view to ſettle his ſtomach, but without effect; the friend then waiting on him, ſaid thro' diſtreſs, what ſhall I do now? He anſwered with great compoſure, Rejoice evermore, and in every thing give thanks; but added a little after, this is ſometimes hard to come at.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day morning he broke forth early in ſupplication on this wiſe, O Lord it was thy power that enabled me to forſake ſin in my youth, and I have felt thy bruiſes for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; but as I bowed under them thou healed me, continuing a father and a friend; I feel thy power now, and I beg that in the
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:020377_0322_0FAF06999C63DA50"/>
approaching trying moment thou wilt keep my heart ſtedfaſt unto thee. Upon his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions to a friend concerning ſome little things, ſhe ſaid I will take care, but hope thou wilt live to order them thyſelf; he reply'd, my hope is in Chriſt, and tho' I may ſeem a little better, a change in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order may ſoon happen, and my little ſtrength be diſſolved, and if it ſo happens, I ſhall be gathered to my everlaſting reſt.

The ſame day he had given directions about wrapping his corpſe; perceiving a friend to weep, he ſaid I would rather thou wouldſt guard againſt weeping for me, my ſiſter, I ſorrow not, tho' I have had ſome painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, but now they ſeem over and matters well ſettled, and I look at the face of my dear redeemer, for ſweet is his voice and his countenance is comely.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day, 4<hi>th</hi> of the tenth month, being very weak and in general difficult to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, he uttered a few words in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the Lord's goodneſs; and add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how tenderly have I been waited on in this time of affliction, in which I may ſay in Job's words, Tedious days and weariſome nights are appointed unto me, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſpending their time and money in vanity and ſuperfluities, while thouſands
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:020377_0323_0FAF069A3271DD38"/>
and tens of thouſands want the neceſſaries of life, who might be relieved by them, and their diſtreſſes at ſuch a time as this, in ſome degree ſoftened by the adminiſtring ſuitable things.</p>
               <p>Second-day morning the apothecary who appeared very anxious to aſſiſt him, being preſent, he queried about the probability of ſuch a load of matter being thrown off his weak body, and the apothecary making ſome remarks implying he thought it might; he ſpoke with an audible voice on this wiſe, My dependance is on the Lord Jeſus, who I truſt will forgive my ſins, which is all I hope for, and if it be his will to raiſe up this body again, I am content; and if to die, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; and if thou canſt not be eaſy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trying to aſſiſt nature, I ſubmit. After which his throat was ſo much affected, that it was very difficult for him to ſpeak ſo as to be underſtood, and frequently wrote when he wanted any thing. About the ſecond hour on fourth-day morning he aſked for pen and ink, and at ſeveral times with much difficulty wrote thus, I believe my being here is in the wiſdom of Chriſt, I know not as to life or death.</p>
               <p>About a quarter before ſix the ſame morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſeemed to fall into an eaſy ſleep, which continued about half an hour, when ſeeming to awake, he breathed a few times with more difficulty, and expired without ſigh, groan, or ſtruggle.</p>

               <p>OUR worthy and much eſteemed friend John Vail, was born at Weſt-Cheſter, in the province of New-York, and removed from thence while young to Woodbridge, where he ſettled and married. He was when a youth, reached by the power of truth,

and ſubmitting to the croſs, he became ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and religious; and continuing faithful and obedient to what he believed to be his duty, the Lord in infinite mercy, was pleaſed to beſtow on him, a gift in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry, and he proving faithful with the one talent, witneſſed an increaſe and growth in the truth, and was enlarged in his public teſtimony, whereby the church was edified, and the faithful comforted. Having a regard to the putting forth of the divine hand, he waited in meetings for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per qualifications to miniſter in the ability that God gives, whereby he was often ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not only to reprove the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, but to ſpeak comfortably to thoſe who mourned for the pride and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the times. He often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the plainneſs and ſimplicity which our forefathers appeared in, and was ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affected for many of the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in that they ſlighted their good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and indulged themſelves in many things which thoſe worthy men bore a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teſtimony againſt. He was a diligent attender of meetings, and very exemplary in being early there, even to old age, when of ability of body; often exciting friends to that duty, not as formaliſts, but patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wait for qualification to perform ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable worſhip to the Almighty.

               <p>He was exemplary himſelf, and careful to bring up his family in the practice of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending meetings on the firſt and other days of the week; was zealous in promoting and faithful in performing that good work of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting friends families: His miniſtry was ſound and edifying, being in the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit and power; and he may be ſaid to be of the number of them that through ſaith have obtained a good report.</p>

About the twentieth year of his age, thro' the great loving kindneſs of a merciful God, the divine viſitation was again renewed wherewith he cloſing in, became ſubject to the Lord's hand, who was about to prepare him as a choſen inſtrument for ſervice. In his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fifth year he married, and ſoon after was

               <p>His firſt appearance in public miniſtry, was in the year 1733, and by humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the giver, he improved in the gift, and became an able miniſter of the goſpel; in which ſervice he travelled much, having viſited the meetings of friends in this and ſeveral of the adjacent provinces, moſtly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times; and in the ſummer 1742, he perform'd a religious viſit to friends in New-England, and the year following to New-York and parts adjacent, which he repeated in 1774.

               <p>At another time he ſpake to this purpoſe,
<q>I have found myſelf much ſtripped as to a ſenſe of good, and tried with poverty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days.

<q>I love friends who abide in the truth as much as ever I did, and I feel earneſt breathings to the Lord, that there may be ſuch raiſed up in the church who may go forth in humility, ſweetneſs, and life, clear of all ſuperfluity in expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and otherwiſe, ſtanding for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that they may be uſeful to the church in theſe difficult times.</q>

<pb n="330" facs="unknown:020377_0337_0FAF06A98D1FBDC0"/>
that ſuch a departure from primitive inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity ever did, and ever will, occaſion a withering from the life of true religion.</q>

               <p>To a friend who came to viſit him on the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of the ſeventh month he ſaid,

               </head>
               <p>SHE was born in this city, being the daughter of our ancient friends Anthony and Elizabeth Morris, who were careful to inſtruct her in the fear of the Lord, a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attendance of our religious meetings, and an early acquaintance with the holy ſcriptures; the advantage whereof ſhe at times expreſſed to be a great comfort to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of benefit to others. Her father di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when ſhe was about ſeventeen years of age, and near his end gave this teſtimony reſpecting her,
<q>That ſhe had never diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and was his comfort;</q>
which we inſert with deſires it may ſo impreſs the minds of youth, that by duly regarding the divine command of obedience to parents, they may be their comfort, merit the like teſtimony, and ſecure peace to their own minds. She was endued with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperior to many, which, with her ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, agreeable diſpoſition, occaſioned her converſation in the younger part of her life to be ſought and acceptable to ſuch who were accounted wiſe in the eſtimation of the world; but from her religious inclination prefering the company of thoſe who exceeded her in age and experience, ſhe was mercifully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the ſnares and temptations to levity and vanity by which many of the youth are too readily captivated.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That, I having been one who was born of religious parents, was by that means fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a ſober and virtuous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but what was far beyond all outward bleſſings, the Lord in his mercy was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make very early impreſſions of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion on my ſoul, by his immediate grace and good ſpirit, and made me ſenſible of the touches of divine love when very young, and at times theſe merciful viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were continued from my very infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (and through every part of life) by which I was in a good degree preſerved from the evils and vanities of the world, and not only ſo, but comforted and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in every time of trouble and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as there was a ſecret regard to that good hand which is, and ever will be the help of all thoſe who put their truſt in it.

God, by the death of a ſiſter whom I entirely loved, to give me a freſh inſtance of the uncertainty and unſatisfactorineſs of all temporal bleſſings, he was pleaſed to ſtrengthen my deſires after the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which is eternal and fadeth not away; and ſtrong cries were raiſed in my ſoul that I might be brought to a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acquaintance, and a more conſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding with him who is the beloved of ſouls, and who, by the ſecret touches of divine goodneſs, had raiſed ſuch a hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, that my ſoul could not be ſatisfied ſhort of it: I ſay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had pleaſed God thus to incline my mind to ſeek after a more full enjoyment of that inward life and virtue which is communicated and conveyed to the ſoul through the illumination of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I was viſited with ſickneſs, in which I had ſo a near a proſpect of eternity, that I ſeemed juſt entering into it; O! then, the emptineſs and vanity of all the world; the pleaſures and friendſhips of it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a clear and ſtrong light; nothing then but the hope of an entrance into the kingdom of Heaven ſeemed of any value, and that hope the Lord was at that time pleaſed in ſome degree to afford me; but yet I thought I ſaw a great deficiency, and was made to deſire of the Lord, that if it was his will to reſtore me, he might ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to live more cloſe to his teachings, and follow him more fully than I had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

done; but in order to this, a work of greater mortification than ever had been experienced by me, was neceſſary. Great diſtreſs of ſoul and affliction of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was I brought into, inſomuch that I knew not where, or what I was; ſuch temptations and buffetings of Satan that I had till now been a ſtranger to, were ſuffered to beſet me, in the abſence of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comfort: and refreſhment, yet in all this the Lord was very merciful, and let me ſee that his dealings with my ſoul were in order to qualify and fit for ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice; O! then the ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments my ſoul was willing to enter into at this Bethel! If thou O Lord! will be with me in the way that I go, and give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and bring me to my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father's houſe in peace, thou ſhalt be my God, and I will ſerve thee! And the Lord, who knew the tenderneſs of my heart (at that time, for it was his own work) was pleaſed graciouſly to ſhower down of the heavenly rain of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by which my ſoul was greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and refreſhed in his preſence; and in a true ſight and ſenſe of my own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs and inability to do any thing that was acceptable in the ſight of God without his aſſiſtance, was my ſpirit great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled before him, and a reſignation wrought in my will to be given up in all things to him, who had thus enabled my

ſoul to praiſe his name upon the banks of deliverance from great and ſore conflicts and troubles, which were unknown to any in that day, for then was the Lord my refuge and ſure hiding place, and under the ſhadow of his wing was I kept, and in the ſweet enjoyment of divine love, light and life, at times was made to ſay, ſurely nothing ſhall ever be able to make a ſeparation from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus: But alas! this laſted not long, for when it was clearly ſhewn me what was required of my hands, which was to bear a public teſtimony for God, and to declare unto others what he had done for my ſoul, then conſultations with fleſh and blood began, tho' the merciful viſitations of love were long continued unto me; yet doubts, fears and reaſonings increaſed, ſo that great darkneſs and diſtreſs came upon me, nor could I now apply with that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and truſt as formerly, to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who can help, but began to diſcloſe ſomething of my condition to others, from which time I was ſenſible that my ſtrength decreaſed; yet all this while I was willing to hope that a freſh viſitation might be ſometime afforded, for without it, I ſaw my ſtate very dangerous; what would I not then have done to have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my former condition? I went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great diſtreſs and perplexity day and night for ſome months, the comfortable refreſhments and divine opening with

which I had been ſo plentifully favoured, were withdrawn, and I left in unſpeakable anguiſh and diſtreſs; under this ſenſe of terror I cried to the Lord to ſhew me his will and enable me to perform it, but the ſenſe of his love was ſo far withdrawn, and fears and doubts had ſo prevailed, that I began to queſtion every thing, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the unwearied adverſary hath ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, or it is ſo ſuffered for ends I know not, that I am at this time, according to my weak apprehenſion, left very much to myſelf without the ſenſation of divine love upon my ſoul, or the ability to ſeek after it, or rightly to wait for it, or to ſtir or move any way as to my ſoul, but, in a ſtupidity not to be deſcribed, ſtript of all inward comfort, and not able to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in any thing this world can afford.</q>

<q>Oh, it is the ſpirit of Chriſt that is the chriſtians glory and ſtrength! It makes us humble, meek and wiſe, it is this teacher that cannot be removed; a guide into that righteous way, which if but lived in, would have kept off this impending ſtorm.

At another time being in great pain, ſhe cried out,

a land of pitts and deſerts, beſet as with noxious creatures, and amongſt ſerpents and ſcorpions, from whence none could deliver but him who can open and none can ſhut; I have ſeen the neceſſity, after having done the will of God, to wait with patience to receive the promiſe of him who is the ſame to-day as yeſterday, and will ſo continue forever. Many are the comfortable aſſurances in holy writ to thoſe who keep the word of his patience;
<q>I will keep ſuch in the hour of temptation, which ſhall come upon all the earth, to try them that dwell therein;</q>
I have many times, my dear, may I not ſay my beloved friends, for ſo at ſeaſons you have been to me, tho' at other times I hardly dare ſay ſo; I have many times been glad to feel a little opening of ſtrength with my friends, and may ſay, I am thankful for this quiet ſolemn opportunity, for great have been and ſtill are my trials, and cloſe may be your provings; I don't ſpeak it to diſcourage any, but I find without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newings of divine love and life, we are incapable of keeping the word of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, being ſo frequently beſet and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with weakneſs and infirmities; O! may you, my dear friends, who have been called and anointed for ſervices, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a renewed ſupply of holy oil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by your lamps may be kept burning, and your lights ſhining; and experience the law to go forth, from Zion, and the word

of the Lord from Jeruſalem, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your covenants made in the day of deep diſtreſs; may you be ſupported thro' every future difficulty and trial, and I thro' the preſent conflict; that when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pool and channel of comfort ſhall be dried up, and all human help found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing, we may witneſs him to be near, who hath promiſed, for the cry of the poor and for the ſighing of the needy he would ariſe; therefore, cry mightily to him, that we may know him to do ſo for us; for I find, without ſenſibly feeling the drawing cords of his love, which opens and enlarges the heart, we cannot apply thoſe gracious promiſes to our comfort; and when he draws, let not the cares of this life, nor ſlaviſh and unneceſſary fears, prevent your following him faithfully, whatever afflictions may attend; O! may we be ſo preſerved in his holy hand, as that nothing may be ſuffered to pluck us out of it, and ſo aſſiſted to conduct, as to be found among that happy number who have come through many tribulations, where all ſorrows and ſighing will be done away and all tears wiped from our eyes, to join thoſe who can acceptably ſing the ſong of praiſe, having had their robes waſhed in the blood of the lamb and made white.</q>
And on the 3<hi>d,</hi> tho' with ſome difficulty of utterance, ſaid,

love being preſent, and in that love ſaluted her friends, as ſhe hoped each one there had in a greater or leſſer degree, known the ſanctifying power of religion on their minds; ſhe very earneſtly and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately urged them to a more cloſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn attention to this important work, not to reſt ſatisfied ſhort of witneſſing daily advancing forward on the way; that when this earthly tabernacle was diſſolved, we might have a well grounded hope of a houſe eternal in the Heavens, whoſe maker and builder was God. That our bleſſed Saviour had told his immediate followers, in his father's houſe were many manſions, and that he went to prepare a place for them, that where he was they might be alſo; and that tho' the ſenſible enjoyment of divine love was much withdrawn from many who had formerly been eminently favoured with its living influence; yet not to be diſcouraged, as living faith in Chriſt Jeſus (tho' but in a ſmall degree) was abundantly ſufficient for our ſtrength and ſafety; and as his divine love ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe who are far advanced and as on the verge of time, it would alſo be the guide and bleſſed guardian of the younger in years, as they humbly and ſteadily kept upon their watch, and paid a due obedience to the divine inſtructions of his holy ſpirit.</q>

mind, ſhe was reminded of ſome late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours or divine love extended to her; after laying ſometime in awful ſilence, ſhe replied,
<q>Now I ſee it to my comfort, that the Lord hath been with me through all this illneſs, and I, at times, knew it not, ſuch was my diſtreſſed ſituation, it was hard for me to believe it.</q>
Afterwards falling into a ſweet ſleep, ſhe in about two hours awaked much refreſhed, and remarked, ſhe had not ſlept ſo ſweetly in all her illneſs, for ſhe had been in company with her father's God, mother's God and her God; aſked her niece (Deborah Morris) who had with abundant care at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on her, if ſhe thought life would hold all night, who anſwering, ſhe thought it might, as the night was far ſpent, ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her ſaid niece would ſit by her until the Lord came, (meaning to cloſe her life) then ſlumbered again, and awakening, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, ſaying,
<q>It is ſtrange I ſhould ſleep at ſuch a time as this.</q>
Being told her work was done, and it was a favour to her ſhe could ſleep, ſhe replied,
<q>I believe it is, and am thankful;</q>
inquiring what time it was, on being told it was after three o'clock, ſhe lifted up her hands as engaged in mental prayer; ſoon after uttered ſome words but not intelligibly, and ſeeming again to drop into a ſweet ſleep, neither ſtirred or ſpoke more, but continuing till between eight and nine o'clock, paſſed eaſily away, on the 24<hi>th</hi> of the tenth month 1775, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-ſecond year of her age, and 31<hi>ſt</hi> of

               <p>SHE was born at Mansfield, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Burlington, New-Jerſey, in the year 1736, of parents in memberſhip with friends, and was educated in the profeſſion of the truth as held by us. Her tender mind while in her minority, was ſenſibly reached with a divine viſitation of the love of God, and as ſhe grew to riper years, ſhe was preſerved in a good degree of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect walking in the fear of the Lord; her converſation being ſerious, ſenſible and guarded, and oftentimes her grave deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was uſeful as a check to her compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the year 1757 ſhe was married to Iſaac Horner, and filled the ſtation of a faithful and prudent wife and mother. In the beginning of the year 1768, ſhe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in public as a miniſter, her teſtimony being ſhort and lively. In the year 1770, ſhe removed with her huſband and family, to ſettle within the compaſs of this meeting,
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:020377_0359_0FAF06BE54799F78"/>
and has ſince reſided among us. She was remarkable for her unreſerved charitable openneſs and innocent freedom of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards all; and through the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the love of God ſhed abroad in her heart, by a life of unaffected piety, and a godly circumſpection of conduct and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, ſhe obtained a good report. She was divers times, with the concurrence of her friends, engaged in goſpel love, in viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meetings abroad, and had good ſervice in viſiting families, not only within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of this monthly-meeting, but others.</p>
               <p>Having taken a cold, it brought on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, under which ſhe languiſhed upwards of eight months, near half of which time ſhe nevertheleſs attended meetings. During her indiſpoſition, her quiet compoſure of ſpirit, and cheerful reſignation to the will of her heavenly maſter was truly edifying. She told a friend who viſited her not long before her departure, that
<q>Though death appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a dark paſſage, yet all was light beyond it.</q>
And to another, who at parting, bid her farewell, ſhe ſaid,
<q>I ſhall fare well when I am rid of this body.</q>
She was remarkably clear in her underſtanding, and ſaid,

               <p>HE was born of pious parents, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by knew the advantage of a religious education, which he frequently expreſſed by way of encouragement to parents and youth, as a means by which he had in a good degree been guarded in the time of his youth, from the vanities of the world.

to that which his ſoul exceedingly long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; and under a ſenſe of this want, was brought at times very low, and for ſome years had to paſs through a ſtate of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deep exerciſe, being baptized as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cloud and in the ſea in a ſpiritual ſenſe; which brought him to a paſſive ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the divine will, ſo that it pleaſed the Lord, in the returns of his favour, to viſit him with the day ſpring from on high; and having learned obedience through the things that he ſuffered, he gave up to the heavenly viſion, and came forth in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in a few words, moſtly in ſcripture language, in great ſimplicity; and altho' not eloquent, yet being faithful in the little, he became much enlarged in his gift, having clear openings in the ſcriptures, and at times much favoured with clear proſpects of the ſtates of meetings and individuals, that he had to ſpeak to ſecret and hidden things, in the demonſtration of the ſpirit and with power, which reached the witneſs in many hearts. He was a father to the young in experience, and zealous to reprove lightneſs and vanity where he ſaw occaſion.</p>
               <p>He travelled in the work of the miniſtry, in ſeveral of the American provinces, and once to England, of which ſervices we had comfortable accounts.

<pb n="355" facs="unknown:020377_0362_0FAF06C0B693DCE0"/>
made him near to his friends, and a uſeful member in ſociety. Being weak in body, a conſiderable time before his deceaſe, he ſaid,

obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome worthy friends had of late been removed without much foreſight of their latter end, and had not much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, he ſaid,
<q>If it ſhould be his caſe, he would not have it looked upon as in diſpleaſure, for he was clear and eaſy in his mind, and that he believed his ſtay would not be long;</q>
which proved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his proſpect; for being taken with ſomething of a quinſy followed by an ague, he ſaid,
<q>He thought that would be his laſt illneſs,</q>
adding,
<q>I have never been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know when my time was near at an end, but have long been deſirous to live ſo as to be ready, and I think I am ready.

               <p>SHE was the daughter of Enoch and Sarah Core, of Eveſham aforeſaid, and was born the 17<hi>th</hi> day of the tenth month 1710; her father dying while ſhe was very young, left her and three other children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of their mother, whoſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern for them was very great; as ſome of us have heard our ſaid friend often expreſs both in public and private.</p>
               <p>She was naturally of a cheerful diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at times when young in years, ſhe ſuffered an airy ſpirit to prevail ſo far as to lead her into lightneſs, yet, thro' divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the ſolid inſtruction and example of her mother, had ſuch influence on her mind, as to preſerve her from groſs evils; which we have often heard her expreſs with awful reverence.</p>
               <p>In the year 1729, ſhe was married to our friend William Foſter, and entered into the care of a family, at which time, the cares of this world had great effect on her mind, as ſome of her laſt expreſſions herein after mentioned will more clearly evince.</p>
               <p>Some time after her marriage, it pleaſed the Lord to renew his viſitation of love to her ſoul, and to ſhew her the vanity of all temporal enjoyments without his love; and ſhe yielding obedience to the heavenly viſion, and being given up to ſerve the Lord, had
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:020377_0364_0FB087E0812AEB70"/>
a gift in the miniſtry committed to her, in which we have reaſon to believe, ſhe was in a good degree faithful to improve, and through divine aid, became a lively miniſter.</p>
               <p>She viſited moſt of the meetings on the continent of America, except ſome part of Virginia and Carolina; and the accounts received of her religious labour in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, were comfortable and ſatisfactory. Her humble awful waiting in religious meetings was edifying; ſhe was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that good order might be preſerved, and careful to example and admoniſh her offspring in the fear of the Lord, more than to influence their minds to ſeek after the treaſures that are tranſitory and periſhing. A near ſympathizer with the afflicted, either in body or mind, often viſiting ſuch and adminiſtring to their relief.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter part of her time, her health was much impaired, yet ſhe grew more lively in the miniſtry, and in ſome of the laſt meetings ſhe attended, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in a ſolemn manner, to invite the youth to join the heavenly call of God, and to be faithful in their gifts, and then they would be raiſed like an army in his power, to ſubdue the works of darkneſs, which ſhe ſaw much prevailed amongſt them; remarking ſome parts of the epiſtle from our laſt yearly-meeting, reſpecting ſome hopeful youths who attended that ſolemn, ſervice.</p>

<q>That there was a time when her heart and mind was much ſet on the world and the things of it, and it proſpered with her according to her deſire; but ſhe bleſſed the name of the Lord, who ſoon let her ſee the vanity and emptineſs of all worldly treaſure, and that ſhe was thankful he had enabled her to yield obedience to the heavenly viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in ſome degree to anſwer his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings, for it now yielded her more peace, than if ſhe had poſſeſſion of the whole world, if it was of tenfold more value than it is; and that her prayers had often been to the Lord, that he might yet favour the riſing generation with the like viſitation of his love,</q>
with ſome other words which could not be underſtood.

               <p>AS the memory of the juſt is pronounced bleſſed, we think it expedient to give forth a teſtimony concerning this our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed friend.</p>
               <p>He was born at the Falls the 28<hi>th</hi> of the eleventh month 1712-13; being young when his father died, he was brought up under the care of his relations and friends: And through the early extendings of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly regard whilſt young, and attending to the teachings of divine grace, he was led and preſerved from many of the follies and extravagances incident to unthinking youth. About the twentieth year of his age he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in public teſtimony in our religious meetings, and continuing in a good degree faithful to the meaſure of light and grace communicated, he grew in his gift, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a lively and able miniſter.</p>
               <p>He was naturally of an open cheerful diſpoſition, and honeſtly concerned for the promotion of piety and virtue, and for the ſupport and maintenance of good order in the church; for which ſervice he was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently gifted, and truly ſerviceable amongſt us, being often concerned that the authority of truth might be kept up in all our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of diſcipline, and that true judgment might be placed upon the diſorderly and irreclaimable. He was exemplary in his

life and converſation, a diligent and timely attender of our religious meetings when health of body permitted; and was often favoured therein in public teſtimony and ſupplication, much to the comfort and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the truly humble waiters. And altho' he had a large gift in the miniſtry, he many times ſat meetings in ſilence, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, not being haſty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the exerciſe of his gift; but careful not to miniſter without the heavenly life and power that firſt raiſed him up in the miniſtry, whereby his public ſervice was greatly to the conſolation and refreſhment of many.</p>
               <p>He ſeveral times had a concern to viſit the churches abroad, and with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this meeting, viſited many of the meetings of friends in this and ſeveral of the adjacent provinces, and once through ſome parts ot Maryland, Virginia and North-Carolina: And having for ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time been under a weighty concern to pay a religious viſit to friends in ſeveral parts of Europe, he with the concurrence and unity of his friends took ſhipping for that purpoſe in the year 1758, and after a ſhort paſſage landed in England, and having pretty generally viſited friends meetings in England and Ireland, and ſome parts of Wales, he returned to his family and friends, having been from home in truth's ſervice near three years: And at his return from
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:020377_0368_0FAF06C746E90EE8"/>
theſe viſits produced certificates of friends unity and good ſatisfaction with him, and his public ſervice amongſt them.</p>
               <p>He was divers times appointed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſervice of viſiting families, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well qualified for that weighty ſervice.</p>
               <p>He much loved the company and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his friends; was a loving and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate huſband, a tender parent and a good neighbour, generally beloved by his friends and others that knew him, being in ſeveral reſpects uſeful and ſerviceable in the neighbourhood where he lived.</p>
               <p>He was attended from his youth at times, with a pain at his breaſt, with intermiſſions of health, ſometimes for years, and at other times but ſhort; but as he advanced further in age, intermiſſions of health grew ſhort and pain increaſed, which brought on other bodily infirmities, which he bore with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and reſignation, often craving he might not be off his watch when his pains were exquiſite, nor his faith fail in the time of trial, believing it to be the goodneſs of God, through his thus dealing with him, more and more to wean him from all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward connections and neareſt ties of nature, that being as the pure gold, refined through the furnace, he might with triumph join the redeemed that were gone before, which he at times had a foretaſte and evidence of; but the time when, as he himſelf ſometimes expreſſed, he did not then ſee, believing it to be conſiſtent with divine wiſdom to keep it hid from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="unknown:020377_0369_0FAF06C827E12310"/>The latter part of his time for ſeveral months, he ſlept but litte in the night ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being at times engaged in reverent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions and divine contemplation, and appeared to be waiting for the ſolemn mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>He lived in the compaſs of the Falls par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meeting until a few years before his death, and then removed to Makefield, (a branch of the ſame monthly-meeting,) and having for ſome months felt ſtrong deſires (if favoured with health) to go to the Falls meeting, and on a monthly-meeting day ſet out to go there; but the weather being cold and he in a weak ſtate of health, ſoon found himſelf unable to perform the journey, and returned home. But ſometime after feeling his bodily ſtrength ſomewhat reſtored, and love renewed, he ſet out, in company with his wife, one firſt-day morning, and got to the meeting where he was favoured with an open time in public teſtimony, much to the ſatisfaction of thoſe preſent. After the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was over and friends gone out, a friend being deſirous of ſpeaking to him, not ſeeing him out of doors, returned into the houſe, and found him ſitting on a ſeat, unable to move without help; the friend aſſiſted him, and took him to his houſe, where he was taken care of: The fit being of the paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick kind, was much more favourable than at ſome other times, tho' it continued eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing for ſeveral hours; in which
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:020377_0370_0FAF06C91C5B3378"/>
time he expreſſed ſeveral things, ſome of which being then taken down, are nearly as follows.</p>
               <p>Being aſked by his ſon Samuel how it was with him; he anſwered,
<q>I dont know but that I am near my end. My deſire at this time for thee is, that thou ſeek unto the Lord for aſſiſtance, to govern thee in thy conduct in this fluctuating life, for I have found him to be a ſure help and counſellor to me; and if thou follow after him in truth and ſincerity, as I have endeavoured to do, he will be unto thee a ſufficient director, a teacher that cannot be removed into a corner: I have not been anxious to gather a portion of this world, nor make to myſelf mammon of unrighteouſneſs, for I think I have ſeen a ſnare that has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended many young people on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. I have ever from my youth had a deſire to be more in ſubſtance than in ſhew: Let me appear as I might in the ſight of men, their praiſe I ſought not for; but I have ſought the honour of God, therefore there is a place where no trouble ſhall annoy, prepared for me as a reward for obedience: You that ſtay, be more humble, and when trouble awaits you, look not upon nor truſt to the arm of fleſh for aſſiſtance, but ſtay yourſelves upon him who ſuffered for you, for me, and for all mankind; for I have for ſometime believed, and lived in the hopes thereof, and am now in meaſure confirmed, of
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:020377_0371_0FAF06C9B7158448"/>
more glorious things yet to be revealed to the church of Chriſt, and that further and greater diſcoveries will yet be made, with reſpect to the chriſtian religion than ever yet has been ſince the apoſtaſy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And after a ſhort pauſe he broke forth in theſe expreſſions,
<q>The door is open, I ſee an innumerable company of ſaints, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and of the ſpirits of juſt men, which I long to be unbodied to be with, but not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! I cannot utter nor my tongue expreſs, what I feel of that light, life and love that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends me, which the world cannot give, neither can it take away from me. My ſins are waſhed away by the blood of the Lamb that was ſlain from the foundation of the world: All rags and filthineſs are taken away, and in room thereof love and good will for all mankind: O that we may become more united in the church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and nearer reſemble the church triumphant! O that we all might make ſuch an end as I have in proſpect, for its all light, all life, all love and all peace, the light that I ſee is more glorious than the ſun in the firmament; come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, come when thou pleaſes, thy ſervant is ready and willing; into thy hands I commit my ſpirit, not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! Let this mortal body be committed to the duſt, be with me, with my children and my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children; be with all them that love thee,
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:020377_0372_0FAF06CC5B12C558"/>
that love thy appearance. O the pains that I feel, that attend this mortal body, they are more comely to me than jewels! I rejoice in my ſighs and groans, for to me they are moſt melodious; I am near to enter that harmony with Moſes and the Lamb, where they cry holy, holy, holy, I cannot expreſs the joy I feel. My heart (if it were poſſible) would break for joy: If any inquire after me, after my end, let them know all is well with me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many more weighty expreſſions he ſpoke, which not being taken down, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected.</p>
               <p>The next day his pain abating, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſomewhat relieved from his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, he was taken to his own houſe, where he remained in a weak ſtate of health for ſometime, being unable to go much abroad. And one night ſome ſhort time before his death, his pain had been ſharp the forepart of the night, but the latter part it abating, his wife lay down by him, and fell aſleep, but he as uſual ſlept not, but after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time called to his wife in theſe words:
<q>My dear, I believe I muſt take my leave of thee. I have never ſeen my end till now, and now I ſee it is near, and the holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels encloſe me around, waiting to receive me;</q>
his wife aſked him if ſhe ſhould call up the children, he ſaid, he did not ſee any thing further he had to ſay to them, except to his ſon Joſeph, who being called, and he having expreſt what he had on his mind,
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:020377_0373_0FAF06CC7979BAD8"/>
was much ſpent, and appeared as tho' he was near his deſired port; but after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he revived, with theſe words,
<q>Life is yet ſtrong in me and will not yield;</q>
thus he continued the few concluding days, waiting in reſignation and retiredneſs of mind, until the repeated returns of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytick complaint reduced his faculties and ſenſes ſo, that he knew not what was done for ſome days, and departed in much ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as in a ſleep, the 10<hi>th</hi> day of the third month 1777, and was decently interr'd in friends burying-ground at the Falls meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, the 12<hi>th</hi> of the ſame; his body being attended to the grave by a number of friends and neighbours.</p>
               <p>May we under the conſideration of our great loſs of him, and many other faithful labourers in the Lord's vineyard, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from us, be excited ſo to follow their footſteps, that with them, we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that incorruptible inheritance, which is reſerved for the righteous, when time here ſhall be no more.</p>

               <p>She firſt appeared in the miniſtry in the ſecond month 1771, and tho' not large was pertinent in teſtimony; often admoniſhing ſuch as were forgetful of their known duties, and ſharply reproving where a wrong ſpirit prevailed: Yet frequently ſpeaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to the bowed down mourners in Zion, with whom ſhe often travelled in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, endeavouring according to her ability, to lend a hand of help to ſuch.</p>

               <p>About the year 1728, a remarkable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation being extended to friends in this city, the hearts of divers were humbled, and, in the efficacy of divine love, ſeveral were conſtrained to open their mouths in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious aſſemblies, in public teſtimony, and acknowledgments of the Lord's goodneſs and gracious dealings with their ſouls.</p>

In her young years ſhe loved to attend religious meetings, and to ſee friends behave ſolid therein, being herſelf an example of piety. She married John Stapler, of the county aforeſaid; and being called to the work of the miniſtry, ſhe became a faithful labourer. About the thirty-fourth year of her age, her huſband was removed by death; after which ſhe married John White, and in the year 1739 removed with their family to this place.</p>

She was careful to maintain brotherly love, ſometimes ſaying, that

               </head>
               <p>HE was born in the city of Worceſter, in Old-England, in the year 1686. His parents being of the church of England, educated him in that way during his abode with them, which was until he was about fourteen years of age. In the year 1700 he
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:020377_0384_0FAF06D6B6ABBE28"/>
arrived at Philadelphia, and going into New-Jerſey, there reſided until twenty-one years of age.</p>
               <p>He was convinced of the truth about the year 1708, and in 1712 appeared in the miniſtry, being then in the twenty-ſixth year of his age: Having, ſince his convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, undergone many ſore conflicts, by reaſon of a backwardneſs to comply with the Lord's requirings whereunto he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times been diſobedient through diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and weakneſs, but at length he gave up, and therein found peace.</p>
               <p>After his marriage, he reſided about twelve years at Nottingham, in Cheſter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pennſylvania, and then removed to Deer-Creek where he continued. He was of an innocent life and harmleſs converſation; and in him were blended thoſe truly chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian virtues which render religion lovely and deſirable; even the irreligious eſteemed him an ornament to the chriſtian profeſſion. Being very converſant in the holy ſcriptures, and favoured with a retentive memory, he was enabled to quote them with propriety, and very often ſuitably apply them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification.</p>
               <p>Divine love, as witneſſed by the believers in Chriſt, was a ſubject upon which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſſed himſelf, in engaging and perſuaſive terms; inviting others to come and be made partakers of ſo glorious a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; adding,

<q>Choſen by God, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him.</q>
In this happy ſituation he was ſupported with chriſtian fortitude, through times of adverſity and deep affliction.</p>
               <p>His wife dying in the ninth month 1777, to whom he had been an affectionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion upwards of ſixty years, he did not long ſurvive her, but, about four months afterwards, was viſited with his laſt illneſs, in which he ſuffered much pain, but was compoſed; ſome days before his departure he grew eaſy, and in his latter moments, when exhauſted nature ſcarcely left him ſtrength to utter himſelf intelligibly, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the ſtate of the careleſs and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, who did not duly and timely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end.</p>

               <p>HE was born (by his own account) in Pembrokeſhire, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1683, and was in his youth an earneſt ſeeker after righteouſneſs among divers forms of religion, until he became meaſurably convinced of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of truth as held by friends, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing William Penn's key to chriſtian knowledge, before he had much if any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acquaintance with them: And coming over to this country when a young man, he ſoon after joined with friends in religious fellowſhip; and being faithful to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of divine grace in his heart, he had a gift in the miniſtry beſtowed upon him; and tho' not large, was ſavoury and edifying; which, together with his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary life and converſation, manifeſted him to be an heavenly minded man, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the love and ſpirit of this world.</p>
               <p>He was not anxious about the increaſe of outward riches, but eaſy and content with a ſmall ſhare thereof; ſo much as ſerved for bodily ſupport in great ſimplicity and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he thankfully received; having a teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt all ſuperfluity, and every thing tending to exalt the mind of man, or

               <p>He was a lover of peace amongſt brethren and in his neighbourhood; and by precept and example, laboured to promote it; being at times concerned to travel about on foot, even in advanced age, to his friends houſes, and pay ſhort viſits in true chriſtian love, and drop weighty and edifying hints, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtir up the pure mind; and ſcarcely any thing was ſaid by him at any time but what had a tendency that way.</p>
               <p>He was a remarkable and worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in conſtantly and early attending our religious meetings, until upwards of ninety years of age; when through weakneſs and infirmity, he was confined at home, and underwent great bodily affliction with true chriſtian fortitude and reſignation to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, patiently waiting his change; which was on the 29<hi>th</hi> of the ſixth month 1778; aged about ninety-five, and a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter near 70 years.</p>

among us according to ability, in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the diſcipline; of a meek and quiet ſpirit, careful not to give juſt occaſion of offence to any. He was appointed an elder in the year 1772, in which ſtation he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to good ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>In the early part of the eighth month 1777, he was taken unwell, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great bodily pain, often begged for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſaying, he was afraid to aſk for any thing elſe. After he had been confined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two weeks, his pain ſomewhat abating, he called his children together, and ſpoke to them as follows:
<q>It looks as if I may ſhortly be taken from you, and I think I have nothing to charge myſelf with, in regard to bringing you up; I have with great care watched over your morals, and anxiouſly endeavoured by example, to teach you to walk in the fear of the Lord; but a backward diſpoſition prevailing, which I fear, has ſometimes kept me from doing the good I might have done in the world, has at times, when my heart has been earneſtly engaged for you, cauſed me to keep ſilence, when it might have been profitable to have thus addreſſed you: Look to the Lord my children, and aſk of him to direct your ways. He muſt be the ſupport of youth as well as of old age. It is him, and him alone you muſt cleave to, if ever you expect to find peace that will be laſting. It is not moral rectitude, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meeting, or any outward acts of
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:020377_0389_0FAF06DAB1A968D0"/>
devotion only, that will do for you. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is an inward work, and true worſhip muſt be performed in the heart, by quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waiting on him who is the rock of ages. I know by experience what I ſay, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly deſire you to look to the Lord, live near him, and let his fear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you in all you undertake. Keep out of the noiſes and confuſions that are in the world, 'tis all deluſion. To be bleſt with the preſence of the Lord in a dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is preferable to liberty enjoyed in palaces without it. And if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to take me from you, tho' we may part for a ſeaſon, yet if we walk in his ways, we ſhall hereafter meet in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bliſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His diſorder increaſing, his pain at times was very great, which he was enabled to bear with a good degree of chriſtian reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; often deſiring he might be endued with patience to hold out to the end. And altho' his outward tabernacle gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, yet the ſeaſonable and lively expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he at times uttered, evidenced that his inward man was frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
               <p>A few weeks before his departure, ſeveral friends coming to viſit him, after a ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time of ſilence, he ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have often of late been led to examine myſelf, to ſee what it is that keeps me back, ſometimes I think I ſee death ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing ſwift, and at other times quite
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:020377_0390_0FAF06DB7A3590C8"/>
gone; at this time in particular, I have been led to conſider whether there remains any thing for me to do, and if I have any thing in my heart againſt any perſon, that my love is not yet perfect; and upon a ſtrict examination, I find nothing but love to mankind univerſally. I have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tried with pain of body, and poverty and barrenneſs of ſpirit, but through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have been preſerved from murmuring; and I have a hope, that when I put off this body, I ſhall be at reſt; and that hope is an anchor to the ſoul.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A day or two before his departure, his pain much abated, and tho' he was reduced very low, yet was preſerved in much calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſerenity of mind, ſaying,
<q>He thought his diſſolution was near; that he had done with every thing below, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the change to him would be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py one, believing a place of reſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him.</q>

Some years afterwards he was concerned that a meeting might be ſettled, which was allowed to be held at his houſe at times for ſeveral years; when the number of friends increaſing, they concluded to build a meeting houſe, which our ſaid friend zealouſly promoted. His houſe was much reſorted to by travelling friends and others, both in that early period and ſince, to whom he was courteous and kind.</p>
               <p>Some years after the ſettlement of a month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting at Fairfax, of which he was a member, he was appointed to the ſtation of an elder, which he filled with propriety and reputation; being an example of plainneſs, and anxiouſly careful for the education of his children.

               <head>A Teſtimony from <hi>Wilmington</hi> Monthly-Meeting in the county of <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> on <hi>Delaware,</hi> concerning <hi>DAVID FERRIS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HE was the ſon of Zachariah and Sarah Ferris, and was born in Stratford, in Connecticut government, New-England, the 10<hi>th</hi> of the third month 1707. His parents being preſbyterians, brought him up in that way, his mother being religiouſly diſpoſed, and much concerned for her offspring, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gave them good advice and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which had ſome good effect with this our friend, as he hath often been heard to expreſs.</p>
               <p>We find by ſome remarks he left, that about the twelfth year of his age, he was frequently viſited and called unto by the divine monitor in his heart, to forſake evil and youthful vanities which he delighted in, and by being in a good degree faithful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, was for a time, preſerved from them; but for want of attending to that which would have continued to preſerve him, the pleaſures and vanities of this world got hold of his mind, ſo that he took much delight in airy and vain company, muſick and dancing, and ſuch like amuſements, until about the twentieth year of his age; when
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:020377_0398_0FAF06E3D56831B0"/>
it pleaſed the Lord to viſit him with a ſore fit of ſickneſs, which proved of laſting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him, as it occaſioned him to take up a freſh reſolution, to forſake the evil of his ways, and turn to the Lord with full purpoſe of heart, which he was, thro' mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, favoured with ability in meaſure to perform.</p>
               <p>He ſtill continued in profeſſion with the preſbyterians, not having any knowledge of friends; although by attending to the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of divine grace, he became convinced of the principle we profeſs; and hearing of a yearly-meeting of friends to be held on Long-Iſland, went to it, with deſires to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whether they were a living people or not, for ſuch he deſired to find; where he met with what he often longed for, (a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that worſhipped God in ſpirit and in truth) which was a great ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to him, in forſaking the errors of his youth, and by yielding obedience to theſe inward motions, he gained ſtrength, and was more and more enabled to bear a faithful teſtimony to the truth as it was made known to him.</p>
               <p>In the ſixth month 1733, he removed to Philadelphia, where he joined in religious fellowſhip with friends; in 1735 he married Mary the daughter of Samuel and Sarah Maſſey; and in 1737 removed to Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in New-Caſtle county, where he reſided the remainder of his days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="unknown:020377_0399_0FAF05AEB2E04EA8"/>He made ſome appearance in the miniſtry about the year 1734, but through unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the divine call, he from time to time put it off, and remained in a neglect of duty therein upwards of twenty years; altho' he was often warned both immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſtrumentally in a remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which at length produced a ſubmiſſion to the divine will, ſo that in the year 1755, he was made willing to give up thereto, and therein found great peace.</p>
               <p>He travelled thro' divers parts of this continent in the work of the miniſtry, and by certificates produced on his return home, it appeared, that his conduct, converſation, and labours abroad were exemplary and edifying, tending to the advancement of truth and righteouſneſs. His doctrine was ſound, and acceptable to the honeſt hearted, tho' ſharp againſt the hypocrite and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, yet tender to the mourners and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate.</p>
               <p>He was very ſerviceable in our meetings for diſcipline, which, with other meetings, he diligently attended, not ſuffering his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affairs to hinder him from what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be his religious duty. And altho' he followed ſhop-keeping for a living, it was his practice to ſhut up his ſhop and take his family with him to week day meetings, often expreſſing for the encouragement of others, that he believed it was attended with a bleſſing. He was free and open hearted to entertain friends, and concerned to bring
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:020377_0400_0FAF05AF78BDE8D0"/>
up his children in plainneſs, and inſtruct them in the fear of the word, believing that to be the beſt portion they could inherit; remarkably charitable to the poor, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten adminiſtred to their neceſſities.</p>
               <p>Bodily weakneſs attended him during the laſt three years of his life, and near the cloſe of his days, he was much afflicted with ſickneſs, which he bore with patience, often expreſſing his proſpect of his approaching end, and his reſignation therein; ſaying, 'All is well.' Several friends being preſent, after a time of ſilence, he in a lively manner repeated the expreſſions of the apoſtle,
<q>To me, to live is Chriſt and to die is gain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He departed this life, the 5<hi>th</hi> of the twelfth month 1779, aged upwards of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-two, a miniſter about 24 years; on the 7<hi>th</hi> of the ſame month, his corps was interr'd in our burying-ground in Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>

He was often led to ſympathize with the afflicted in ſpirit, unto whom his doctrine dropt as the dew, and was by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſteemed a nurſing father in the meeting to which he belonged. He ſeveral times, with the concurrence of his friends, viſited the churches in this and the adjacent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; was zealouſly concerned that meetings for diſcipline might be maintained in the ſame authority wherein they were firſt eſtabliſhed; and divers times was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in viſiting families, for which weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſervice he was well qualified. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for his children was great, which at times he expreſſed under the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, adopting the language of David, viz.
<q>My children, know ye the God of your fathers, and ſerve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart and willing mind; if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you, but if ye forſake him, he will caſt you off forever.</q>

He was confined at home near three months, in which time he was viſited by many friends, often had refreſhing opportunities in his room; in one of which, (being about a week after his confinement) he was led to ſpeak of the precious effects of unity; at another time, divers friends being preſent, after ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he expreſſed himſelf on this wiſe,
<q>How many opportunities of this ſort I may yet have is unknown to me; this morning as I lay in bed, meditating on the things of God, it appeared to me as tho' my time in this world would be but ſhort;</q>
earneſtly exhorting thoſe preſent, to labour that they and their children might be prepared to meet with death. At ſeveral times he ſignified,
<q>He was like one that was waiting for his change,</q>

               <p>SHE was the wife of Thomas Brown, of Weſt-Nottingham, in Cheſter county Pennſylvania, and daughter of Ralph and Phebe Needham, of Kent county on Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, educated amongſt friends, ſhewing in her younger years an inclination towards piety, and after her marriage was concerned at times to ſpeak in teſtimony in our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meetings, and tho' not large, yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, eſpecially in the latter part of her time, her appearances were attended with a lively favour, which, with her exemplary conduct, and zeal for the attendance of our meetings for public worſhip and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good order in the church, rendered her ſervices uſeful and acceptable among us; and towards the concluſion of her life, ſhe appeared to be favoured with an increaſe of ſolidity and weight.</p>
               <p>In her laſt illneſs which continued about three weeks, we believe ſhe was much bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the incomes of divine love, uttering many weighty expreſſions, ſome of which

At another time,
<q>Oh! the ſtraitneſs and refinedneſs of the path that leads to life and happineſs,</q>
repeating her ſenſe of the wonderful love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to his church, which ſeemed then remarkably opened to her, in an explanation of thoſe expreſſions in the eighth verſe of the fourth chapter of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's Song,
<q>Come with me from Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, my ſpouſe, with me from Lebanon; look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the Lions dens, from the mountains of the Leopards;</q>
the myſtery of which invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we underſtand ſhe ſpoke of at divers times in her ſickneſs in a lively manner, as it appeared to her applicable to the divine call of our Saviour to his followers, to come out of all high things, and for his ſake who was plain, meek and lowly, to leave or forſake the loftineſs and grandeur of this world, things deſirable to the proud fleſhly part in us, to ceaſe alſo from ſpotted things, and thoſe of a fierce devouring nature: And, as her laſt teſtimony againſt the ſuperfluity crept in among friends in relation to coffins and dreſſing the bodies of the dead, ſhe
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:020377_0405_0FAF05B7080832B8"/>
earneſtly deſired that her coffin might be quite plain, and that no needleſs things might be put on or about her.</p>
               <p>She deſired her love to her friends, ſaying,

               </head>
               <p>BY accounts we have had, ſhe was born at Grange, in the county of Antrim, in the North of Ireland, the 10<hi>th</hi> of the firſt month (old ſtile) 1719-20, deſcended of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious parents profeſſing the truth (John and Margaret Hudſon.) Her father dying in low circumſtances when ſhe was young, ſhe was placed out by her mother to earn her living by her own labour; who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſought a portion in the truth for her daughter, eſteeming it the beſt riches; and lived to ſee the deſire of her heart in that reſpect in a degree accompliſhed; for the tendering viſitations of divine love being mercifully extended to this our dear friend
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:020377_0408_0FAF05B940C69BC0"/>
early in life, ſhe happily cloſed in therewith, and witneſſed an advancement in piety and godlineſs; ſuch was her love to the truth and zeal for the attendance of meetings when young, ſhe would go many miles on foot to them, and being an honeſt ſervant, laboured hard to make up the time to her employer. In theſe times, her cup was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made to overflow with the goodneſs of the Lord to her ſoul, which ſhe has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been heard to ſpeak of with tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, for the encouragement of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and others in low circumſtances; and that the rich and full who have horſes to ride on, and are bleſſed both with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries and conveniences of life, might prize their time and privileges, and bring forth fruits adequate to the favours confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on them.</p>
               <p>A diſpenſation of the goſpel was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her to preach, to which ſhe gave up in the ſeventeenth year of her age; and we have reaſon to think, ſhe grew therein as a willow by the water courſe; for in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof, with the unity of her friends at home, ſhe came over to this country with Ruth Courtny, in the latter part of the year 1737, and paid a religious viſit to friends generally on this continent, we believe to good ſatisfaction; ſome of us having cauſe to remember her, and the ſweetneſs of her ſpirit at that time. With the ſame friend ſhe alſo travelled in England and Wales, in
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:020377_0409_0FAF05BA80D132B0"/>
1740, ſpending upwards of fifteen months there in the ſervice of truth.</p>
               <p>On the 25<hi>th</hi> of the ninth month 1742, ſhe was married to Jeſſe Hatton; in which ſtate, ſhe for many years, underwent great outward difficulties, as well as inward exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and trials on account of the cauſe and teſtimony of truth which ſhe had eſpouſed, and was favoured with firmneſs to hold her integrity thereto; which ſhe has been heard to commemorate with thankfulneſs to the Lord her deliverer, rendering the praiſe to him alone, who, even during that trying diſpenſation, opened her way to labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably in his cauſe in many places, as in Ireland, Scotland, and again in England.</p>
               <p>About the year 1754, ſhe removed with her huſband and family, and ſettled in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford, where ſhe was made truly near to friends and uſeful in the Lord's hand.</p>
               <p>In the year 1759 her huſband died; and in 1760, being conſtrained by the love of truth, and having the concurrence of her friends at home and of the meeting of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and elders in London, ſhe entered on a ſecond viſit to America, which for many years had reſted weightily on her mind. In the ninth month of the ſame year ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here, and viſited friends meetings ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generally throughout this continent, as far ſouthward as Charleſton, in South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and to the eaſtern parts of New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, to the comfort and ſatisfaction of friends, leaving ſeals of her miniſtry in
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:020377_0410_0FAF05BAB51F7108"/>
many places; and after a labour of upwards of two years, embarked for England. In the ſummer following ſhe viſited Munſter province in Ireland. And on the 25<hi>th</hi> of the ninth month 1763, ſhe was married to our friend Thomas Lightfoot; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervent in ſpirit for the diſcharge of her religious duties, finiſhed her viſit to that nation by midſummer following.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the eighth month 1764, ſhe embarked at Cork with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and family in order to ſettle here, and arrived in the ninth month following, from which time ſhe belonged to our monthly-meeting, whereof ſhe was a ſerviceable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; likewiſe was engaged in the love of the goſpel, to viſit many of the meetings of friends in this and the adjacent governments, alſo the neighbouring yearly-meetings, and in the year 1774, went into New-England, with our friend Elizabeth Robinſon from Great-Britain; in which viſits her company and ſervices were weighty, ſtrengthening and eſtabliſhing to friends.</p>
               <p>At divers meetings previous to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the preſent calamity, ſhe had, in an awful manner, to proclaim the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a ſtormy day, which would ſhake the ſandy foundations of men; and many of the formal profeſſors in our ſociety ſhould be blown away.</p>

wading and waſting exerciſe, with feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body was her lot. Soon after her return home, a fit of illneſs contributed much to the breaking of her conſtitution; but the balm of ſweet peace of mind was ſtill her comfort and ſupport. She recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo as to get abroad again to her own and many other meetings about the country, and to our laſt yearly-meeting in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, tho' in a weak ſtate of health; the laſt ſhe attended was our ſelect meeting at Uwchlan, the 27<hi>th</hi> of the firſt month 1781, under an increaſing weakneſs of body, but to the comfort of friends then aſſembled.</p>
               <p>She was an excellent example of ſteady waiting upon the Lord in ſilence, and out of meetings ſolid and grave in her deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtructive and weighty in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, watchful over her own family for their good, bearing her teſtimony againſt wrong things in them as well as others; of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſpirit; and when her lot was caſt in families as well as meetings, was often led to feel for and ſympathize with the hidden ſuffering ſeed. Having paſſed through the deep waters of affliction herſelf, her eye was not unuſed to drop a tear for, and with others in diſtreſs either in body or mind, and ſhe rejoiced in comforting and doing them good.</p>
               <p>She was a living and powerful miniſter of the word, careful not to break ſilence in meetings, until favoured with a freſh anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the holy one, whereby ſhe was
<pb n="405" facs="unknown:020377_0412_0FAF05BC4A028000"/>
preſerved clear in her openings, awful and weighty in prayer, her voice being ſolemn and awakening under the baptizing power of truth.</p>
               <p>Many were the heavenly ſeaſons with which ſhe was favoured during a lingering illneſs, in ſome of which ſhe was led to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs herſelf in a lively edifying manner, and often, with divine pertinence to the ſtates of thoſe who were preſent; as alſo her belief that ſhe ſhould join the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, in that city whoſe walls are ſalvation, and her gates praiſe.</p>
               <p>One evening, after a ſolemn ſilence, ſhe broke forth in a ſweet melody, ſaying,
<q>I have had a proſpect this evening, of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heavenly hoſt, in ſinging praiſes to Zions king, for which favour my ſoul and all that is ſenſible within me, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that arm which hath been with me from my infant days, and caſt up a way where there was no way, both by ſea and land.</q>
She then ſignified what an exerciſe ſhe had laboured under for the good of ſouls, and how it wounded her very life, to behold the profeſſors of chriſtianity acting incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the example of a crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>She frequently ſupplicated the Lord for the continuance of his help, and that ſhe might be endued with patience, adding,
<q>Oh! what would become of me now, if I had a wounded conſcience? The work with me is not now to do: This winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:020377_0413_0FAF05BCF201DD58"/>
day muſt come cloſer to the dwellings of ſome than ever it has done, even to the ſhaking of them from the gods of ſilver and of gold, hay or ſtubble.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The quarterly-meeting being nigh, ſhe urged her huſband to leave her, ſaying,
<q>There is nothing yields ſuch comfort on a languiſhing bed as an evidence of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed our religious duties to the beſt of our underſtanding, I can ſpeak it at this time by experience.</q>
She ſpoke of the neceſſity there was for friends to guard againſt keeping in their families perſons of corrupt morals and evil communication, which hath a tendency to poiſon the tender minds of their children; and ſignified her apprehenſion, that ſome parents were ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the blood of their offspring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. At another time, ſhe encouraged ſome that were preſent, to be faithful to the Lord, and to keep to their gifts, adding,
<q>Oh! what a fine thing it is to ſit lively in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to witneſs the holy oil to run as from veſſel to veſſel.</q>
Feeling herſelf grow worſe, ſhe gave directions about the laying-out her body, that it ſhould be with exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary plainneſs.</p>
               <p>One morning, in the hearing of a few friends, ſhe cautioned againſt a light chaffy ſpirit getting up in a ſhew of religion, and was led in a remarkable manner, to utter reproofs againſt the ungodly Quaker, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a terrible day would ſooner or later overtake ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="unknown:020377_0414_0FAF05BDCC0D9A10"/>She expreſſed herſelf one day nearly as follows,
<q>When I have ſat down in our meetings, and caſt my eye over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how have I been grieved to ſee the haughtineſs of the young men, and the folly of the young women, looking one upon another, as if there was nothing to do; coming to meetings juſt to ſee and be ſeen: Oh! will not the Lord viſit for theſe things? Yea, ſurely he will, and call to an account thoſe haughty ſons and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful daughters; I have been grieved with it when I have ſat as with my lips ſealed; and yet there is a remnant that are near to my life among the youth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At another time, being raiſed by divine aid from great weakneſs, ſhe thus expreſſed herſelf,
<q>The Lord will ſearch Jeruſalem, he will blow away the chaff; but the wheat, Oh! the weighty wheat he will gather into his holy garner.
It ſeems to
me, that many of the better ſort are haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to their graves. I do not repine at my afflictions, for how ſmall are they, compared with his who ſuffered for us all, when he ſaid, "My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?" Oh the profeſſors of truth! How often have I thought of their great privileges! How often have they been called unto and watered! And yet remain unredeemed; there is much impurity about the ſkirts of ſome; if they refuſe they will be rejected and others called in; he will have his table filled, he
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:020377_0415_0FAF05BE70D098E8"/>
will have a people that will ſtand for his name.</q>
After ſometime, aſking for a friend, ſhe ſaid,
<q>I have ſomething to ſay to thee about the city; the folly, I would not willingly call it iniquity, but upon a ſtrict examination I believe it may be ſo called, of laying out their dead, has been a burden to me many times of late when I have been there, I have wondered at the pomp and vanity, and the coſt, how much for no good purpoſe at all, but to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the mouldering body. How much better it would be, to ſpare this expence for the benefit of ſome poor families? I did not know but I ſhould have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it at the yearly-meeting, but I got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, and I prayed it might reſt on ſome others, that it might be done then or at ſome other time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the afternoon of the ſame day, ſhe mentioned ſome of the words of Amos,
<q>I was no prophet, nor a prophet's ſon, but I was a gatherer of ſycamore fruit;</q>
                  <q>low employments, ſaid ſhe,
<q>But the Lord raiſeth the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to ſet them among princes.</q>
I have been one of ſorrows, and much acquainted with grief. It is true, this has been a pleaſant ſpot to live in, and with an agreeable companion, and it was nothing ſhort of the good hand that thus provided for me, but I have never forgot the wormwood and the gall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="unknown:020377_0416_0FAF05C1E2EA8D88"/>She continued quiet and ſenſible the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her time, ſaying,
<q>Oh deareſt Lord! take me to thyſelf, even into thy heavenly kingdom; take me into Paradiſe, for I long to be with thee there.</q>
After expreſſing the deſire of her ſoul reſpecting one of her ſons, ſhe took leave of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and others preſent with a look of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing love, and expired about the fourth hour in the morning, like one falling into an eaſy ſlumber, on the 8<hi>th</hi> of the fifth month 1781, and was interr'd the 11<hi>th</hi> at Uwchlan, attended by a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people; on which occaſion a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was held, and was indeed a good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, agreeable to a proſpect ſhe had in the early part of her illneſs; aged ſixty-one, and a miniſter 44 years.</p>

               <p>In his advanced years, he had divers pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful times of illneſs, but was admirably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved through them without the help of medicine. He was temperate in his living; and that innocency of life, meekneſs and love which attended him in his early years, ſhined clear in his latter days, being often favoured (when his underſtanding in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters appeared to fail him) in a lively manner to ſpeak to the ſtates of the people when religiouſly aſſembled, which made him near to many friends. He was a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker amongſt his neighbours and friends, and earneſtly engaged for the univerſal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of true peace amongſt mankind; bearing a faithful teſtimony againſt war, and againſt the unneceſſary diſtillation and uſe of ſpirituous liquors, and the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fooliſh cuſtoms and faſhions of the world.</p>
               <p>In his laſt illneſs, he was preſerved in great patience and reſignation through much bodily pain, ſignifying his

At which time romiſh bigotry and ſuperſtition ſubjected the proteſtants in that kingdom to very rigorous perſecutions, which occaſioned many thouſands of them to leave it, among whom were the parents of our deceaſed friend, who removed from thence on the 3<hi>d</hi> of the ſecond month called February, 1715, and after ſpending a few months in Holland, proceeded to London, where they reſided about ſixteen years, and in the month called November, 1731, they arrived in this city, being well recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divers friends.</p>
               <p>In the fifth month, 1736, he was married to our friend Joyce Marriott, of this city, in whom he experienced a truly religious help-meet, almoſt to the end of forty-eight years.

May theſe conſiderations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thee to interpoſe thy kind endeavours on behalf of this greatly oppreſſed people, whoſe abject ſituation gives them an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal claim to the pity and aſſiſtance of the generous mind; inaſmuch as they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deprived of the means of ſoliciting effectual relief for themſelves. That ſo thou may not only be a bleſſed inſtrument in the hand of him
<q>By whom kings reign, and princes decree juſtice,</q>
to avert the awful judgments by which the empire has already been ſo remarkably ſhaken, but that the bleſſings of thouſands ready to periſh, may come upon thee, at a time when the ſuperior advantages attendant on thy ſituation in this world, will no longer be of any avail to thy conſolation and ſupport.</p>

               <head>A Teſtimony from <hi>Concord</hi> Monthly-Meeting in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> concerning <hi>PHEBE TRIMBLE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE memory of the juſt is pronounced "Bleſſed;" which we wiſh to be verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following memorial of this our
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:020377_0428_0FAF05CB99C19508"/>
eſteemed friend, by affording an excitement to ſurvivors to walk in her ſteps.</p>
               <p>The days of her youth and early periods of maturer age, were attended with cloſe trials, ſtripping ſeaſons, and deep baptiſms, through all which the Lord her gracious helper (whoſe tender regard is ever manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards his humble depending children) preſerved her, and raiſed her up to be a veſſel in his houſe. About the forty-ſecond year of her age, being in 1759, ſhe ſettled with her huſband William Trimble within the limits of this meeting, to which ſhe was recommended by certificate from Goſhen monthly-meeting, as an approved miniſter, which character ſhe juſtly retained during her ſtay in mutability.</p>
               <p>Her public appearances, tho' generally in few words, were truly acceptable and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being clear, pertinent, comprehenſive and ſavoury, and accompanied with deep humility and gravity of deportment. She was not forward in the exerciſe of her gift, but appeared deſirous to proceed therein under divine direction. At two different times ſhe viſited friends in Maryland and Virginia, and once in North and South-Carolina, in which viſits her goſpel labours were well received.</p>
               <p>Her common deportment was inſtructive; evidencing lowlineſs, meekneſs and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; that it may juſt be ſaid, her
<q>Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was that of a meek and quiet ſpirit.</q>
Her converſation, tho' pleaſant and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, was accompanied with that ſweetneſs
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:020377_0429_0FAF05CC33EB4668"/>
and gravity which rendered it both agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable. Her heart and houſe were open to the reception and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her friends; nor was her benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and humane feelings circumſcribed to thoſe in religious communion with her; but the poor, we believe, of all denominations in the neighbourhood where ſhe lived, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of her kindneſs, and by her removal have loſt a ſympathizing friend.</p>
               <p>During the time of her laſt illneſs, ſhe was much given to ſtillneſs and retiredneſs of mind, being ſometimes uneaſy with friends converſing on temporal ſubjects in her preſence. Her hope and faith in her dear redeemer, we believe did not fail her in this her laſt and trying period; though ſhe was very lowly and humble in her own eſtimation, and at times almoſt diffident of her being worthy of divine regard: Thus in her caſe may be applicably revived, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient interrogation,
<q>If the righteous ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and ſinner appear?</q>
May this awaken profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reflections in the minds of all, eſpecially the careleſs and indifferent.</p>
               <p>On the 14<hi>th</hi> of the ſixth month 1784, ſhe quietly departed this life, in the ſixty-ſeventh year of her age; and on the 16<hi>th</hi> was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Concord, attended by many friends and others, at which time was held a large and ſolemn meeting. And we doubt not but ſhe is gone from works to an happy reward.</p>

               <head>A Teſtimony from the Monthly-Meeting of Friends of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for the <hi>Southern-Diſtrict,</hi> concerning <hi>JOHN REYNELL.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THOUGH none of us were acquainted with him whilſt he reſided in Great-Britain, the land of his nativity, yet we have cauſe to believe, from what himſelf has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that he was early viſited with the offers of divine love, and by wiſely cloſing in therewith, he came to experience preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from many temptations and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith the minds of unwary youth are liable to be enſnared.</p>
               <p>To ſeveral of his particular friends, he, at times, mentioned ſome tranſactions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to his coming to this country, which containing matter of encouragement to faithfulneſs in others, we apprehend may not improperly be here inſerted, viz.</p>
               <p>When about eighteen years of age, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to embark on a voyage to Jamaica, and being thoughtful leſt he might lay down the body at that place, as had been the caſe with many, he received, as he believed, a divine aſſurance that his life ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. During his reſidence there, he had a ſight given him, of a grievous calamity by means of a violent hurricane, to befall the inhabitants of the Iſland as a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their iniquities, which came to paſs according to his proſpect. Soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an occurrence happening which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:020377_0431_0FAF05D0F5D1A620"/>
his being called upon to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a court of judicature, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to take an oath, which he conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly refuſing, it proved for a time, no ſmall trial of his faithfulneſs; and although he had few or none outwardly to look to for ſtrength and encouragement under that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, he was nevertheleſs favoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience divine ſupport to be near, ſo that neither threatning nor perſuaſion could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on him to deviate from our chriſtian teſtimony in that reſpect. Very few of the members of our religious ſociety then reſided on that Iſland, yet a meeting-houſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to friends ſtill remaining in Kingſton, he was not eaſy to omit attending at the times appointed for meeting, though he ſometimes ſat alone therein.</p>
               <p>About the twentieth year of his age he came to Pennſylvania, and after ſettling in this city, he became a ſerviceable member among us both in a religious and civil capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cheerfully employing his talents and much of his time to beneficial and laudable purpoſes, and was often engaged as a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker in reconciling differences.</p>
               <p>As an elder, he approved himſelf in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and uprightneſs in the diſcharge of that important truſt, being well qualified for the ſtation he filled. A good example in diligently attending our religious meetings as long as ability of body permitted, and very uſeful in the exerciſe of the diſcipline. A man of integrity and ſound judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="unknown:020377_0432_0FAF05D1EF23CB78"/>Being favoured with an affluence of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral riches, he endeavoured to fulfil his duty as a good ſteward, by liberally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of his ſubſtance to ſuch as ſtood in need. Beſides his repeated acts of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty throughout the courſe of his life, the many charitable legacies he bequeathed by his will, are further proofs of his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition. So that we believe it may juſtly be ſaid, he was one that
<q>Feared God and hated covetouſneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſpring of the year 1784, his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength evidently impairing, he beheld the proſpect of his approaching diſſolution with the ſerenity and compoſure of a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; and continued gradually declining for ſeveral months, during which time he did not impart much reſpecting his own ſpiritual ſtate, being deſirous to be more in ſubſtance than ſhew, yet found it needful to keep up a ſteady watch until his warfare ſhould be accompliſhed. Two friends viſiting him one evening, he mentioned,
<q>That on look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his paſt life, he was ſenſible of many deficiencies,</q>
yet expreſſed
<q>A hope that all would be well.</q>
On the evening previous to his departure, he ſaid,
<q>I am ready. I feel myſelf happy, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with divine glory;</q>
and expired the 3<hi>d</hi> of the ninth month 1784, aged ſeventy-ſix years. His corps being interr'd the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in friends burying-ground in this city, a ſolemnity covered the minds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at the grave which was truly conſolatory.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THEY were born in Ireland, came into this country with their parents, and ſettled within the limits of New-Garden meeting. About the year 1733 they were joined in marriage, proving true help-meets to each other; and as they advanced in age, grew in grace, and a qualification for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the church in the prime of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a meek and inoffenſive diſpoſition, well beloved and truly uſeful members in the meeting to which they belonged; in dealing with offenders, endeavouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and reſtore, yet careful that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of truth might be preſerved blameleſs.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding their beginning in the world was ſmall, a bleſſing attending their induſtry and frugality, they got a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubſiſtance for themſelves, and to bring up their family; cheerfully and kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining many friends in thoſe early days, and having a near ſympathy with the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and ſervants of the Lord, who were tried and proved with humbling baptizing ſeaſons, were often enabled to ſpeak a word of comfort and encouragement to ſuch; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and helpful to thoſe in affliction, charitable and conſiderate to the poor, many partaking of their bounty, they were nearly united with friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="427" facs="unknown:020377_0434_0FAF05D2C080F3B8"/>Their care over their family, and concern to bring up their children in plainneſs, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, induſtry, and the attendance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious meetings, was great. Katharine thro' weakneſs and infirmity, particularly in old age, often endured much pain in riding to meetings, yet when there, her ſolid innocent countenance and deportment therein were edifying. When near her end, during ſeveral weeks painful ſickneſs, ſhe retained her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, expreſſing reſignation to her allotment; often adviſing her children and thoſe about her to live in love. Some of her laſt expreſſions that could be underſtood, were,
<q>There is reſt and peace prepared for me, where I ſhall ſing hallelujahs to the higheſt!</q>
And after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pauſe, ſaid,
<q>Thy ſweetneſs, O Lord! is great.</q>
She quietly departed the 2<hi>d</hi> of the fourth month 1781, in the ſixty-eighth year of her age, and on the 5<hi>th</hi> was interr'd in friends burying-ground at New-Garden.</p>
               <p>William was ſupported under the trial of this ſeparation, with becoming reſignation to the divine will; having through life been an example of punctuality, juſtice, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and brotherly kindneſs.</p>
               <p>On account of bodily infirmity, which at times made riding hard to bear, he often went on foot, when above ſeventy-five years of age, upwards of four miles to meeting; his faithfulneſs and example wherein, the becoming manner of his ſitting there, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing a watchful ſolid frame of mind,
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:020377_0435_0FAF05D3895E50C0"/>
was very inſtructive. On the 22<hi>d</hi> of the tenth month 1785 (having been for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time much confined at home) he was taken ill, and tho' afflicted with much pain of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his underſtanding was preſerved ſound, and faculties clear. In the morning of the 23<hi>d</hi> to two of his children he ſaid,
<q>There is always ſomething comes to take us out of the world, and if we are but prepared it is the leſs matter;</q>
one of them expreſſing a hope that he did not feel any thing to the contrary; he replied
<q>No, no, I don't, I have a comfortable hope and belief that all will be well.</q>
Remarking ſome little time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on the ſettlement of his affairs, his ſmall beginning, and how he had been favoured through life; he expreſſed his concern and ſympathy for divers friends in ſtraitened circumſtances, and that he had been much exerciſed at times on account of many in ſociety who appeared forward and zealous, but thro' neglect or miſmanagement of their outward affairs, had miniſtered cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; obſerving that it was wiſdom not to appear in ſhew more than in ſubſtance, either in our religious or temporal concerns. The night of the 25<hi>th</hi> he communicated to ſome of his children much ſeaſonable and heart-tendering advice; recommending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to ſtrive for an everlaſting inheritance, whereinto they might enter when done with time; concluding in theſe words,
<q>Love truth, love one another, love friends and all good people, even all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:020377_0436_0FAF05D438365D98"/>
and be careful to hurt none, no not the very meaneſt, if ye can do them no good, ye ſhould do them no harm.</q>
Then mentioning the uncertainty of his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance here, gave directions that his coffin ſhould be plain, no poliſh or ſtain upon it.</p>
               <p>Being very low on the 28<hi>th</hi> and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of his end being near, he ſpoke to ſome of his children, deſiring, when the change came, all might keep ſtill and quiet; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it was an awful time, and ought to be ſo to thoſe about him. Some hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaying, it would be a relief if he might be favoured in his paſſage, his bodily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs being great;
<q>But I muſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, it don't become us to complain, but we may tell each other of our afflictions without complaining or murmuring; for the Almighty has been good to me in my affliction, ſo that we have great cauſe to love him.</q>
A few hours after ſaid,
<q>What manner of perſons ought we to be, to bear every diſpenſation of affliction and trial that comes upon us, as we ought to do?</q>
Saying at another time,
<q>Many tedious days and weariſome nights had been his lot theſe eighteen months paſt.</q>
His ſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his belief that reſt would be very acceptable, he replied,
<q>Yes, an everlaſting reſt.</q>
On the 13<hi>th</hi> of the eleventh month he uttered the following ſupplication,
<q>O Lord God Almighty! if it be thy bleſſed will, mitigate my affliction, and relieve me in my diſtreſs; not my will but thine
<pb n="430" facs="unknown:020377_0437_0FAF05D50F593300"/>
be done.</q>
And a little after ſaid,
<q>The appointed time will come, and it muſt be waited for, he knows beſt the right time; his wiſdom is very great, and care and providence over his poor creatures very great indeed.</q>
To one of his children, taking leave of him, he ſaid, in ſubſtance,
<q>There is great corruption in the world amongſt mankind, and need there is of care in bringing up children, and young people, to reſtrain them; for many are running as the wild aſſes upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</q>
A few days before he departed he ſaid,
<q>It is a comfort to me to have my children with me, and it may be a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to them to ſee me go; I feel eaſy in mind on looking backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I ſee nothing in my way, the Lord has been good to us, and eſpecially to me in my affliction.</q>
Much more he expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſundry times, continuing ſenſible, but gradually weakening, he departed this life, on the 24<hi>th</hi> of the eleventh month 1785, in the eighty-firſt year of his age, having been an elder upwards of 40 years, and having ruled well was worthy of double honour, his memory being of good ſavour. On the 27<hi>th</hi> he was interr'd in friends burying-ground at New-Garden; attended by a large number of people, with whom a ſolid meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was held.</p>

               <p>A CONSIDERABLE time before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, when in health, he ſometimes mentioned to his friends, and frequently to his wife, his proſpect that his time would not be long here, and in or near his laſt ſickneſs, told her that he felt eaſy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he ſhould ſoon be taken from her. Some days before his death he appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding low in mind attended with many doubts reſpecting his paſt and then ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, remaining ſeveral days in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; after which it pleaſed the Lord to manifeſt himſelf to him in ſo extraordinary a manner, that his wife perceiving a change, aſked him how he was; he anſwered I am better than I expected ever to be, my mind is now relieved, and, as a morning without clouds, all appears ſuſhine, mentioning to her and a friend preſent, many trials and temptations he had experienced; at another time ſaying, deep has been the baptiſm I have paſſed through, my ſoul hath been dipt into a feeling ſenſe of the ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, yea, I have paſſed through the valley of the ſhadow of death, which I am now convinced we muſt do before we can experience a glorious reſurrection unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

life. And frequently ſaid, my dear I feel thy ſympathy and love, and ah! how precious do I feel the unity of the church; often mentioning divers of his near friends, and continuing in a ſweet frame of mind, not complaining of pain (tho' the nature of his diſeaſe muſt have occaſioned much) his countenance remaining ſerene and pleaſant to the laſt; a few minutes before his death he ſpoke to this purpoſe,
<q>Give my dear love to friends, and tell them I die in the faith which I lived in, and firmly believe I ſhall ſoon enter into the manſions of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs prepared for the true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Chriſt; and altho' I never did much for the cauſe and teſtimony of truth, I ſhall be with the believers, and that is enough;</q>
ſoon after which he quietly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life, on the 6<hi>th</hi> day of the fifth month 1786, about the fiftieth year of his age; being the next day interr'd in friends burying-ground at Deer-Creek.</p>

<pb n="433" facs="unknown:020377_0440_0FAF05DAA9036F78"/>
he arrived to man's eſtate, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the principle of truth while young, more by inward conviction than inſtrumental means, as he was educated in the way of the epiſcopal church (ſo called) and even when a lad, had to paſs through many trials under his father, for declining that way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and (as he related to his wife and others) he frequently felt great tenderneſs towards the negro children with whom he was brought up, from the proſpect of their ſtate of ſlavery, which much affected him at times before he was ten years of age. He conducted with reputation and ſtability as a uſeful friend, manifeſting a lively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken concern for the maintenance of our diſcipline, the furtherance of our teſtimony againſt an hireling-miniſtry, and ſlave-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as for the doctrine of peace, eſpecially thro' the difficulties which occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the late times of public requiſitions for the purpoſes of war; ſhewing chriſtian fortitude, humility and reſignation under ſufferings and cloſe trials of different kinds which fell to his lot. Sometime before his deceaſe he appeared in public teſtimony, in which he was not forward, but moſtly brief, pertinent and acceptable to friends; being remarkably open to receive counſel as well as to give; we find the remembrance of his diſpoſition and ſervice is ſatisfactory, both among the members of the monthly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he belonged to, and this meeting.</p>

               <head>Abſtract from the Teſtimony of <hi>Concord</hi> Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Meeting as read and approved by <hi>Cheſter</hi> Quarterly-Meeting, held at <hi>Concord</hi> the <hi>14</hi>th of the fifth month <hi>1787,</hi> concerning our dear friend <hi>EDITH SHARPLES,</hi> deceaſed.</head>
               <p>SHE was born the 13<hi>th</hi> day of the fifth month 1743; her parents Nathan and Rachel Yarnall, members of Middletown particular meeting, having been careful to educate her in plainneſs and a diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of religious meetings, ſhe retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thankful remembrance of their care over her, has been often heard to bleſs the Lord on their account, as by their good counſel and wholeſome reſtraint, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to her preſervation out of the vain faſhions and cuſtoms of the world.</p>
               <p>By her own account, her mind was early in life accompanied with earneſt deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of truth, and that ſhe might never do any thing to offend him whom ſhe often found near to her comfort, or that might bring a reproach on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhe made; but giving way to her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vivacity, ſhe frequently indulged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in what with ſome is accounted i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

tempted beyond what they thro' his grace are enabled to bear, made way for her eſcape from under the power of temptation, for which ſhe had, in that day, as on the banks of deliverance, to ſing to the praiſe of his holy name; ſaying,
<q>It is in my heart to praiſe thee O my deliverer! for thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold kindneſſes unto me a poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy worm; for altho', for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou haſt ſeen meet t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bowed before thee, rendering unto thee the praiſe of all thy works; having witneſſed the fulfilling of thy promiſe.</q>
                  <q>But with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee ſaith the Lord thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the twenty-ſixth year of her age ſhe was married to Joſhua Sharples, ſettled within the compaſs of New-Garden month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, of which ſhe became a uſeful member, being qualified for ſervice in the church, whereto ſhe attended with much ſatisfaction to friends, filling the ſtations of overſeer and elder with diffidence under a ſenſe of the weight thereof.</p>
               <p>In the thirty-firſt year of her age ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the miniſtry, and being faithful, grew in her gift, was ſound in doctrine, accompanied with a degree of heart-tendering authority to the careleſs and indolent, yet edifying and conſolatory to the refreſhment of the mourners in Zion.
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:020377_0443_0FAF05DD313EF2E8"/>
In her approaches to the throne of grace in public ſupplication, ſhe was awfully attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deep ſolemnity.</p>
               <p>She was a great lover of the ſcriptures, and well qualified to apply them to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſtruction, being concerned to invite friends and others to a more frequent reading of them. The doctrines of the principle of truth as held by friends ſhe was ſkilful in explaining, and was often exerciſed therein in mixed auditories, endeavouring to lead out of forms to the ſubſtance of true religion. Much of her time was thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the public ſervice of her Lord and maſter, cheerfully giving up to his holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings, but carefully concerned to wait for his putting forth.</p>
               <p>Having peculiar ſervice in viſiting fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſhe was often uſefully engaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and about the year 1778 with divers other friends under appointment from the Weſtern quarterly-meeting, in a general vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to all the meetings belonging thereto, ſhe was exerciſed under a deep concern to labour that a reformation in life and manners might be really effected amongſt the profeſſors of truth. Soon after, being removed within the compaſs of our meeting, ſhe engaged in a like viſit to the meetings in our quarter, wherein, as in other of her goſpel labours, ſhe manifeſted an ardent deſire for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the cauſe of truth, and that ſhe might be favoured to do her days work in the day-time. And ſince, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:020377_0444_0FAF05DE00D3DA60"/>
of friends, viſited moſt of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Southern governments; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligent in the improvement of her time for the ſervice of truth, often drawn into family viſits, and to the afflicted either in body or mind, who experienced the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoling ſympathy of her tender ſpirit, in which and other goſpel labours ſhe reaped the reward of peace and comfort to her own mind. When at home ſhe was not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in attending meetings herſelf, but careful to encourage and aſſiſt her family in their duty therein; in herſelf an example of plainneſs, and mindful to promote a like ſimplicity in thoſe under her direction, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting much concern that her children might be brought up in the truth, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retiring with them for their improvement, her faithfulneſs againſt wrong things in them being conſiſtent with the tenderneſs of an affectionate mother. Great was her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe for the riſing generation, that their hearts might be early dedicated to the Lord, and they thereby preſerved in a conduct conſiſtent with our holy profeſſion. Open and hoſpitable in her houſe, a true help-meet and affectionate wife.</p>
               <p>Shortly after her return from a viſit to friends on the Eaſtern-Shore of Maryland, in the ſixth month 1786, ſhe was brought very low thro' bodily indiſpoſition, but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with inward conſolation and true peace, expreſſing that ſhe felt her mind much weaned from the things of this world,
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:020377_0445_0FAF05DEF4B0AD90"/>
and if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to call her hence ſhe found nothing in her way. On a firſt-day afternoon, divers friends being preſent, after a time of ſilence, ſhe ſpoke to this effect,
<q>I am glad of this opportunity; as I lay on the bed this morning, my mind was carried away to meeting with friends, and I thought if I had wings I could have flown thither for the great love I feel for the members of that meeting. Indeed we have had many favoured opportunities to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and you ſee I am in a poor weak way, and whether I ſhall get out again I have not ſeen, but am reſigned, and feel the reward of peace; but if ſome friends of that meeting are not more faithful to the many gracious viſitations which have been in mercy to them extended, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will overtake them, and they be in danger of miſſing the anſwer of well done.</q>
She recovered and afterwards had many heart-tendering opportunities with friends there, and others not in memberſhip with us, toward whom ſhe was remarkably led in teſtimony, in order that they might be gathered to the fold of reſt.</p>
               <p>About two weeks before her deceaſe ſhe attended ſeveral of the neighbouring meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, expreſſing her ſatisfaction therewith; and on the firſt-day before her departure, was at New-Garden meeting and had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice, having alſo a favoured op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity the ſame evening in a friends fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily where ſhe lodged on her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> home,
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:020377_0446_0FAF05DFE40B0530"/>
at which time ſhe was concerned to revive theſe expreſſions of the Pſalmiſt,
<q>Lord make me to know mine end, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am: Behold thou haſt made my days as an hands breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee.</q>
Which ſhe enlarged on to edification. Next day ſhe got home ſomewhat indiſpoſed, but held up till the day following in the evening of the 16<hi>th</hi> of the firſt month 1787, when ſhe was confined to her bed, and lay in a ſenſible reſigned frame of mind, being, as we believe, well prepared for her awful change, appearing to have nothing to do but to die. Some of the laſt words ſhe was heard to ſay were, 'I believe I am going,' and in about fifteen minutes after, quietly breathed her laſt on the 18<hi>th,</hi> and on the 20<hi>th</hi> was interr'd at Birmingham, aged forty-three years and ſeven months, a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upwards of 12 years.</p>
