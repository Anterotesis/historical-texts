            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I<hi>T is not with any design or desire unnecessarily to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the late Oppressors of that good Protestant People which is in</hi> New England, <hi>that the Authors of the ensuing</hi> Vindication <hi>have published what is herewith emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the</hi> Agents <hi>lately sent from thence could not be faithful to their Trust, if when the People whom they Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent are publickly (as well as privately)</hi> aspersed, <hi>they should not (either by themselves, or by furnishing some other with materials for such an undertaking)</hi> vindicate <hi>those who have been so deeply injured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>his Account which he calls</hi> Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, <hi>he has wrong'd</hi> New England <hi>thereby, in some other particulars besides those insisted on, in the subsequent</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. <hi>For he does endeavour to make the World believe that the</hi> Massachusetts <hi>refused to answer to the</hi> Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto <hi>prosecuted against their</hi> Charter: <hi>Than which Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representation nothing can be more untrue or injurious. An Account concerning that matter hath formerly (and more than once) been made publick, in the which it is most truly affirmed,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That when the</hi> Quo Warranto <hi>was issued out against the Governour and Company of the</hi> Massachusetts
<pb facs="unknown:000575_0003_0FA710A1C8A8C430"/>
                  <hi>Colony in</hi> New England <hi>in the year</hi> 1683. <hi>the then King did by his Declaration enjoyn a few particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to make their Defence at their own Charge, without any publick Stock; which shew'd that there was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to take away that Charter: Yet the Governour and Company appointed an Attorney to answer to the</hi> Quo Warranto; <hi>but the Suit was let fall in the Court of</hi> Kings-Bench, <hi>and a new Suit began by</hi> Scire facias <hi>in Court of</hi> Chancery, <hi>where time was not allow'd to make Defence. The former Attorney for that Colony brought se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Merchants to testifie that in the time allow'd (which was from</hi> April 16. <hi>till</hi> June 18.) <hi>it was impossible to have a New Letter of Attorney returned from</hi> New England. <hi>The then Lord Keeper</hi> North <hi>replied, That no time ought to be given. So was Judgment entred against them before they could possibly plead for themselves.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>By this the Impartial Reader may judge what ingenuity and Veracity is in Mr.</hi> Palmers <hi>Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is lately come forth another</hi> Scandalous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, <hi>called</hi> New England's Faction Discovered. <hi>The Author has not put his Name to it: But it is supposed to be written by a certain person known to be a Prodigy for Impudence and Lying. The Reflections in it not only on</hi> New England <hi>in general, but on particular persons there as well as in</hi> England, <hi>are so notoriously and maliciously false; as that it must needs be much beneath a great Mind to take notice of such</hi> Latrations, <hi>or to answer them any
<pb facs="unknown:000575_0004_0FA710A274A5BCC8"/>
otherwise than with contempt. When we are treated with the Buffoonry and Railery of such ungentiel Pens, 'tis good to remember the old Saying,</hi> Magnum Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae remedium, Negligentia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for what Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>does in his Preface insinuate concerning the</hi> New-Englanders <hi>being</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men, Enemies to Monarchy, and to the Church of England, <hi>that's such a</hi> Sham <hi>as every one sees through it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are none in the World that do more fully concur with the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the Church of</hi> England <hi>contained in the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles, than do the</hi> Churches in New England, <hi>as is manifest from the Confession of their Faith published in the year</hi> 1680. <hi>Only as to</hi> Liturgy and Ceremonies <hi>they differ; for which cause alone it was that they, or their Fathers transported themselves into that</hi> American Desert, <hi>as being desirous to worship God in that way which they thought was most according to the Scriptures. The</hi> Platform of Church Discipline <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto by the Elders and Messengers of the Churches Assembled in a General Synod at</hi> Cambridge <hi>in</hi> New England <hi>in the year</hi> 1647. <hi>sheweth that they are as to</hi> Church-Government <hi>for the</hi> Congregational way. <hi>The judiciously Learned Mr.</hi> Philip Nye <hi>has long since evinced, that no Form of Church-Government (no not that which is Episcopal) is more consistent with Monarchy, or with the King's Supremacy, than that of the</hi> Way-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational,

               <hi>which some will needs call</hi> Independent. <hi>But there are a sort of men, who call those that are for</hi> English <hi>Liberties, and that rejoyce in the Government of Their present Majesties King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>by the name of</hi> Republicans, <hi>and represent all such as Enemies of Monarchy and of the Church. It is not our single Opinion only, but we can speak it on behalf of the generality of Their Majesties Subjects in</hi> New England, <hi>that they believe (without any diminution to the Glory of our former Princes) the</hi> English <hi>Nation was never so happy in a</hi> King, <hi>or in a</hi> Queen, <hi>as at this day. And the God of Heaven, who has set them on the</hi> T<hi>hrone of these Kingdoms, grant them long and prosperously to Reign.</hi>

            <head>THE Revolution in New England justified.</head>
            <p>THE Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> which a sort of men did of late when they thought the World would never change, cry up as Divine Truth, is by means of the happy <hi>Revolution</hi> in these Nations, exploded, and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of it become ridiculous.</p>
            <p>No man does really approve of the <hi>Revolution</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but must justifie that in <hi>New England</hi> also; for the latter was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in compliance with the former, neither was there any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign amongst the <hi>People in New England,</hi> to reassume their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Charter-Government,</hi> until His present Majesties intended descent into <hi>England,</hi> to rescue the Nation from <hi>Slavery</hi> as well as <hi>Popery,</hi> was known to them (for indeed to have attempted it before that would have been madness.) They considered that the men then usurping Government in <hi>New England</hi> were King <hi>James'</hi>s Creatures, who had invaded both the <hi>Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of English Protestants</hi> after such a manner as perhaps the like was never known in any part of the World where the <hi>English</hi> Nation has any Government: And the <hi>Commission</hi> which they had obtained from the Late King <hi>James</hi> was more Illegal and Arbitrary, than that granted to <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Empson</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> 7th. or than it may be was ever before given to any by King <hi>James</hi> himself, or by any one that ever swayed the <hi>English</hi> Scepter, which was a Grievance intolerable; and yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired not to make themselves Judges in a case which so nearly concerned them, but instead of harsher treatment of those who had Tyrannized over them, they only, secured them that they might not betray that Countrey into the hands of <hi>the Late King,</hi> or of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> which they had reason enough to believe (considering their Characters and Dispositions,) they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do. They designed not to revenge themselves on
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000575_0007_0FA710A65B87DA00"/>
their Enemies, which they could as easily have done as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men are able to kill one, and therefore when they secured their Persons, they declared (as in their <hi>Declaration</hi> Printed at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> is to be seen) that they would <hi>leave it to the King and Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>to inflict what punishment they should think meet for such Criminals.</hi> Their seizing and securing the Governour, was no more than was done in <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Huli, Dover, Plimouth, &amp;c.</hi> That such a man as Mr. <hi>John Palmer</hi> should exclaim against it, is not to be wondred at, seeing he was one of the Governours Tools, being of his Council, made a Judge by him, and too much concern'd in some Illegal and Arbitrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: But his Confidence is wonderful, that he should pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in Print that neither himself nor Sir <hi>Edmund Androsse,</hi> nor others of them who had been secured by the People in <hi>New England, had any Crimes laid to their charge,</hi> whereas the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Declaration emitted the very day they were secured, doth plainly set forth their Crimes.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And that they used all imaginable endeavours <hi>to stifle the News of the Prince's Landing in England,</hi> appears not only from the Testimony of the People there, and from the Letters of those now in Government at <hi>Boston,</hi> but from the deposition of Mr. <hi>John Winstow,</hi> who affirms that being in <hi>Nevis</hi> in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1683. a Ship arrived there from <hi>England</hi> with <hi>the Prince of Orange's</hi> Declaration, and intelligence of the happy change of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> which he knew would be <hi>welcom News in New England,</hi> and therefore was at the charge to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

                           <hi>John Winstow</hi> aged 24 years or thereabouts, testifieth and saith, that he being in <hi>Nevis</hi> some time in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> last past, there came in a Ship from some part of <hi>England</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Orange'</hi>s Declarations, and brought news also of his happy proceedings in <hi>England</hi> with his entrance there, which was very welcome News to me, and I knew it would be so to the rest of the people in <hi>New England;</hi> and I being bound thither, and very willing to carry such good news with me, gave four shillings six pence for the said Declarations, on purpose to let the people in <hi>New England</hi> understand what a speedy deliverance they might expect from Arbitrary Power. We arrived at <hi>Boston</hi> Harbour the fourth day of <hi>April</hi> following, and assoon as I came home to my house, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Androsse</hi> understanding I brought the Prince's Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with me, sent the Sheriff to me; so I went along with him to the Governours house, and assoon as I came in, he asked me why I did not come and tell him the news. I told him I thought it not my duty, neither was it customary for any Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger to go to the Governour when the Master of the Ship had been with him before, and told him the news; he asked me where the Declarations I brought with me were, I told him I could not tell, being afraid to let him have them, because he would not let the people know any news. He told me I was a Saucy fellow, and bid the Sheriff carry me away to the Justices of the Peace, and as we were going, I told the Sheriff, I would choose my Justice, he told me, no, I must go before Doctor <hi>Bullivant, one pickt on purpose</hi> (as I Judged) <hi>for the business,</hi> well I told him, I did not care

            <p>By these things it appears that it was absolutely necessary for the people in <hi>New England</hi> to seize Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that so they might secure that territory for their present Majesties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> &amp;c. did <hi>make Laws destructive to the liberty of the Subjects,</hi> is notoriously known, for they made what Laws they pleased <hi>without any consent of the People, either by themselves or representatives,</hi> which is indeed to <hi>destroy the Fundamentals of the English,</hi> and to <hi>Erect a French Government.</hi> We cannot learn that the like was ever practised in any place where the English are Planters, but only where Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> hath been Governour: For whereas in <hi>New England</hi> by constant usage under their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Government, the Inhabitants of each Town did assemble as occasion offered to consider of what might conduce to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their respective Towns, the relief of the poor, or the like, Sir, <hi>E. A. with a few of his council,</hi> made a law prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Town meeting, except once a year, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> on the third Monday in <hi>May.</hi> The Inhabitants of the Countrey were startled at this Law, as being apprehensive the design of it was to prevent the people in every Town from meeting to make complaints of their Grievances. And whereas by constant usage any person might remove out of the Countrey at his pleasure, a Law was made that no man should do so without the Governours leave. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Fishing Boats, coasters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to enter into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound bond, whereby Fees were raised for himself and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000575_0012_0FA710AB736ACBC8"/>
creatures. This Law could not pass at <hi>Boston,</hi> because many of Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s Council there opposed it; but then a <hi>Juncto</hi> of them meeting at <hi>New-York,</hi> passed it; and after that Law was made, how should any dissatisfied persons ever obtain liberty to go for <hi>England</hi> to complain of their being oppressed by <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Governours?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But besides all this, They made Laws for the <hi>Levying Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys without the consent of the People either by themselves or by an Assembly;</hi> for in order to the supporting of their own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they did by an Act bearing date <hi>March</hi> 3. 1686. raise considerable sums of Money on the Kings subjects in that part of his dominions, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> a penny in the pound on all Estates personal or real, twenty pence <hi>per</hi> head as Poll Money, a penny in the pound for goods imported, besides an Excise on Wine, Rum and other Liquors.</p>
            <p>It hath indeed been pleaded that all this was but what the Laws of the Countrey before the change of the Government did allow. But this is vainly pretended, for there was no such Law in force at the time when these sums were levied, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Laws which did authorise it, were repealed <hi>Octob.</hi> 10. 1683. some years before Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and his complices had invaded the Rights and Liberties of the people there. Moreover, in those, parts of the Countrey where there were never any such Laws in force, particularly in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony, this Money was levied, which they heavily complained of. Yet further, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. 1687, they did without any colour of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Law make an additional duty of Impost and Excise, which raised the duty, some ten shillings, some twenty shillings <hi>per</hi> Pipe on Wines, and so on other things. Nay they levied mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys on <hi>Connecticot</hi> Colony contrary to their Charter, which was never vacated, than which nothing more Illegal and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could have been perpetrated by them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They did not only act according to these Illegal Taxes, but they did <hi>inflict severe punishment on those true English men who did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their Arbitrary proceedings,</hi> as shall be made to appear in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances. When the Inhabitants of <hi>Ipswich</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> were required to choose a Commissioner to tax that Town, some principal persons there that could not comply with what was demanded of them, did modestly give their reasons, for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000575_0013_0FA710AC51B19E08"/>
which they were committed to Goal, as guilty of high misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and denied an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and were obliged to answer it at a Court of <hi>Oyer</hi> &amp; <hi>Terminer</hi> at <hi>Boston.</hi> And that they might be sure to be found guilty, <hi>Jurors</hi> were picked of such as were no Freeholders, nay of Strangers; the Prisoners pleading <hi>the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of English men</hi> not to be taxed without their own consent, they were told that <hi>the Laws of</hi> England <hi>would not follow them to the end of the Earth,</hi> they meant the priviledges of the English Law, for the penalties they resolved should follow them <hi>quo jure qudque injurid.</hi> And why should they insist on, and talk of the priviledges of English men, when it had been declared in the Governours Council, that <hi>the Kings Subjects in</hi> New England <hi>did not differ much from Slaves, and that the only difference was, that they were not bought and sold?</hi> But to go on with the matter before us; In as much as the Prisoners mentioned had asserted their English Liberties, they were severely handled, not only imprisoned for several weeks, but fined and bound to their good behaviour; Mr. <hi>John Wise</hi> was fined fifty pound besides costs of Court, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the means of his subsistance, and gave a thousand pound bond for good behaviour. And Mr. <hi>John Appleton</hi> was fined fifty pound and to give a thousand pound bond for good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and moreover declared incapable to bear Office, besides unreasonable Fees. After the same manner did they proceed with several others belonging to <hi>Ipswich.</hi> Likewise the Towns men of <hi>Rowley, Salisbury, Andover,</hi> &amp;c. had the same measure. And the Kings Subjects were not only oppressed thus in the <hi>Massachusetts</hi> Colony, but in <hi>Plymouth.</hi> For when <hi>Shadrach Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </hi> the Town Clerk of <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>N. E.</hi> did, with the consent of the Town, Sign a modest Paper signifying their not being free to raise money on the Inhabitants without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by an assembly, the honest man was for this committed close Prisoner, and after that punished with a Fine of twenty Marks and three Months Imprisonment, and bound to find sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Recognizance to appear the next Court, and to be of the good behaviour. As to the matter of fact, the persons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>these Illegal and Arbitrary Judgments</hi> will not have the face to deny them; if they do, there are <hi>Affidavits</hi> now in <hi>London</hi> which will evince what hath been related whenever there shall be occasion for it.</p>

It is a vanity in Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> to think that he hath answered this by affirming, but not proving, that the <hi>Ipswich-men</hi> assembled themselves in a <hi>riotous manner;</hi> for that saying of his is very false. The World knows that <hi>New England</hi> is not the only place where honest men have in these late days been proceeded against as guilty of <hi>Riots,</hi> when they never deserved such a censure any more than these accused by Mr. <hi>Palmer.</hi> But the truth of what hath been thus far related is confirmed by the following <hi>Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davits.</hi>

                        <p>The Jurors only twelve men and most of them (as is said) Non-freeholders of any Land in the Colony, some of them Strangers and Forreigners, gathered up (as we suppose) to serve the present turn.

                        <p>Being called by those in present Authority to give my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to the Discourse between Sir <hi>Edmund Androsse</hi> and my self, when he came from the Indian War, as he passed through <hi>Salem</hi> going for <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1688/9.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000575_0018_0FA710B7581DF340"/>
of that Discourse. Sir <hi>Edmund Androsse</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being accompanied with the Attorney General <hi>Graham,</hi> Secretary <hi>West,</hi> Judge <hi>Palmer,</hi> the Room being also full of other people, most of them his Attendants, he was pleased to tell me, he would have my judgment about this question; <hi>Whether all the Lands in</hi> New-England <hi>were not the Kings?</hi> I told him I was surprized with such a question, and was not willing to speak to it, that being a Minister, if it was a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about a matter of Religion, I should not be averse, but this being a State matter, I did not look upon it as proper for me to declare my mind in it, therefore entreated again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that I might be excused. Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> replied and urged me with much importunity, saying, Because you are a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, therefore we desire to know your judgment in it, then I told him, if I must speak to it, I would only speak as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister from Scripture and Reason, not medling with the Law. He said, the Kings Attorney was present there to inform what was Law. I then said, I did not understand that the Lands of <hi>N. E.</hi> were the Kings, but the Kings Subjects, who had for more than Sixty years had the possession and use of them by a twofold right warranted by the Word of God. 1. By a right of just Occupation from the Grand Charter in <hi>Genesis</hi> 1st and 9th Chapters, whereby God gave the Earth to the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> to be subdued and replenished. 2. By a right of purchase from the Indians, who were Native Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and had possession of the Land before the English came hither, and that having lived here Sixty years, I did certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know that from the beginning of these Plantations our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entered upon the Land, partly as a Wilderness and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum Domicilium,</hi> and partly by the consent of the Indians, and therefore care was taken to Treat with them, and to gain their consent, giving them such a valuable consideration as was to their satisfaction, and this I told them I had the more certain knowledge of, because having learned the Indian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in my younger time, I was at several times made use of by the Government, and by divers particular Plantations as an Interpreter in Treating with the Indians about their Lands, which being done and agreed on, the several Townships and proportions of Lands of particular Men were ordered, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000575_0019_0FA710B7D0672478"/>
setled by the Government of the Countrey, and therefore I did believe that the Lands of <hi>New-England</hi> were the Subjects Properties, and not the Kings Lands. Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and the rest replied, That the Lands were the Kings, and that he gave the Lands within such limits to his Subjects by a Charter upon such conditions as were not performed, and therefore all the Lands of <hi>New England</hi> have returned to the King, and that the Attorney General then present could tell what was Law, who spake divers things to the same purpose as Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> had done, slighting what I had said, and vilifying the Indian Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, saying, They were Brutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if we had possessed and used the Land, they said we were the Kings Subjects, and what Lands the Kings Subjects have, they are the Kings, and one of them used such an Expression, <hi>Where-ever an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman sets his foot, all that he hath is the Kings,</hi> and more to the same purpose. I told them that so far as I understood, we received only the right and power of Government from the Kings Charter within such limits and bounds, but the right of the Land and Soil we had received from God according to his Grand Charter to the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and with the consent of the Native Inhabitants as I had expressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They still insisted on the Kings right to the Land as before, whereupon I told them, I had heard it was a standing Principle in Law and Reason: <hi>Nil dat qui non habet;</hi> and from thence I propounded this Argument; he that hath no right, can give no right to another, but the King had no right to the Lands of <hi>America</hi> before the English came hither, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could give no right to them. I told them, I knew not of any that could be pleaded but from a Popish Principle, that Christians have a right to the Lands of Heathen, upon which the Pope as the Head of the Christians had given the <hi>West Indies</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but this was disowned by all Protestants. Therefore I left it to them to affirm and prove the kings Title. They replied and insisted much upon that, that the King had a right by his Subjects coming and taking possession of this Land. And at last Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> said with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Either you are Subjects or you are Rebels, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as I understood him according to the whole scope and tendency of his Speeches and Actions, that if we would not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000575_0020_0FA710B841A8A6F0"/>
yield all the Lands of <hi>N. E.</hi> to be the Kings, so as to take Patents for Lands, and to pay Rent for the same, then we should not be accounted Subjects but Rebels, and treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. There were many other various replies and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers on both sides, but this is the sum and substance of that discourse—</p>

Sir <hi>Edmund Androsse</hi> then Governour of <hi>New-England</hi> did inquire of him the said <hi>Lynde</hi> what Title he had to his Lands, who shewed him many Deeds for Land that he the said <hi>Lynde</hi> possessed, and particularly for Land that the said <hi>Lynde</hi> was certainly informed would quickly be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, if he did not use means to obtain a Patent for it. The Deed being considered by Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> he said, it was worded well, and recorded according to <hi>N. E.</hi> custom or words to the same purpose. He further enquired how the Title was derived he the said <hi>Lynde</hi> told him, That he that he bought it of had it of his Father-in-law in Marriage with his Wife, and his said Father from <hi>Charles-towne,</hi> and the said Town from the General Court grant of the <hi>Massachusetts</hi> Buy, and also by purchase from the Natives, and he said, my Title were nothing worth if that were all. At another time after
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000575_0021_0FA710B8F77AD9B0"/>
shewing him an Indian Deed for Land, he said, that their hand was no more worth than a scratch with a Bears paw, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing all my Titles, though every way legal under our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Charter Government. I then petitioned for a Patent for my whole Estate, but Mr. <hi>West</hi> Deputy Secretary told me, I must have so many Patents as there were Counties that I had parcels of Land in, if not Towns, finding the thing so chargeable and difficult I delayed, upon which I had a Writ of Intrusion served upon me in the beginning of the Summer 1688. the Copy whereof is in <hi>Charles-towne'</hi>s Mens complaint, and was at the same time with that of Mr. <hi>James Russel'</hi>s, Mr. <hi>Seawall'</hi>s, and Mr. <hi>Shrimpton'</hi>s, it being for the same Land in part that I shewed my Title unto Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> as above, being my self and those I derived it from possessed, inclosed, and improved for about Fifty years, at which time I gave Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> Attorney General three pounds in Money, promising that if he would let the Action fall I would pay Court char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and give him Ten pound when I had a Patent compleated for that small parcel of Land, that said Writ was served up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for, which I did because a Quaker that had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of it from the Governour, as I was informed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors presence should not have it from me, the said <hi>Lynde,</hi> having about seven Acres more in the same common Field or Pasture, about a Mile from this forty nine Acres near unto the Land that the said Governour gave unto Mr. <hi>Charles Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,</hi> of divers of my Neighbours, which I concluded must go the same way that theirs went, and therefore though desired to be patented by the said <hi>Lynde</hi> with the forty nine Acres, he could not obtain a Grant for it. About the same time Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> Attorney General asked the said <hi>Lynde</hi> what he would do about the rest of his Land, telling him the said <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> that he would meet with the like trouble about all the rest of his Lands that he possessed, and were it not for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours going to <hi>New-York</hi> at this time, there would be a Writ of Intrusion against every Man in the Colony of any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Estate, or as many as a Cart could hold, and for the poorer sort of people said Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> would take other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or words to the same purpose. The said <hi>Lynde</hi> further saith, That after Judgments obtained for small wrongs done

him, tryable by their own Laws before a Justice of the Peace, from whom they allowed no Appeals in small Causes: he was forced out of his own County by Writs of false Judgment; and although at the first superiour Court in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> the thing was so far opposed by Judge <hi>Stoughton</hi> as illegal, as that it was put by, yet the next Term by Judge <hi>Dudley</hi> and Judge <hi>Palmer,</hi> the said <hi>Lynde</hi> was forced to answer <hi>George Farewell</hi> Attorney aforesaid, then saying in open Court in <hi>Charles-town,</hi> that all Causes must be brought to <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> because there was not honest men enough in <hi>Middlsex</hi> to make a Jury to serve their turns, or words to that purpose; nor did <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as appeared by their practice, for they made use of Non-Residents in divers cases there.

                        <p>That notwithstanding the answer made to Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> his demand by some Gentlemen of <hi>Charlestown</hi> on the behalf of the Proprietors, which they judged satisfactory, or at least they should have a further hearing and opportunity to make out their Rights, there was laid out to Mr. <hi>Lidget</hi> adjoining to his Farm in <hi>Charlestown</hi> a considerable tract of Land (as it is said one hundred and fifty Acres) which was of considerable value, and did belong to divers persons, which when it was laid out by Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> there were divers bound marks shewed by the Proprietors, and some of them, and I had Petitioned for a Patent for my particular Propriety, yet the whole tract was laid out to the said <hi>Lidget,</hi> who not only did cut down Wood thereon, without the right owners consent, but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested some for cutting their own Wood, and so they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of any means to use or enjoy their own Land. And notwithstanding there was about twenty Acres of Pasture Land and Meadow taken from the said <hi>Russel,</hi> and given to Mr. <hi>Lidget,</hi> yet afterwards there was a <hi>Writ of Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> served upon a small Farm belonging unto the said <hi>Russel,</hi> unto which the aforesaid Pasture Land did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and had been long improved by <hi>Patrick Mark</hi> his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (and others good part thereof) above fifty years, so that to stop Prosecution, the said <hi>Russell</hi> was forced to Petition for a Patent, he having a Tenant who was feared would comply in any thing that might have been to his prejudice, and so his Land would have been condemned under colour of Law, and given away as well as his Pastorage was without Law. Further the said <hi>Russel</hi> complains, that he having an Island in <hi>Cascobay,</hi> called <hi>Long-Island,</hi> which his honoured Father long since bought of Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and was confirmed to <hi>James Russell</hi> by the General Court, and improved several years by Captain <hi>Davis,</hi> by mowing as Tenant to the said <hi>Russell,</hi> and the said <hi>Russell</hi> hearing it was like to be begged away, caused his Writ to be entred in the Publick Records in Mr. <hi>West'</hi>s Office, which he paid for the Recording of; notwithstanding Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> ordered Capt. <hi>elements</hi> (as he said) to survey the same, and he shewed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000575_0026_0FA710BEEE8FB168"/>
me a Plat thereof, and said, If I had a Patent for it, I must pay three pence <hi>per</hi> Acre, it being 650 Acres. He was further informed, That if the said <hi>Russell</hi> would not take a Patent for for it, Mr. <hi>Usher</hi> should have it—</p>

            <p>Had not an happy <hi>Revolution</hi> happened in <hi>England,</hi> and so in <hi>New-England,</hi> in all probability those few ill men would have squeezed more out of the poorer sort of people there, than half their Estates are worth, by <hi>forcing them to take Patents.</hi> Major <hi>Smith</hi> can tell them, that an Estate not worth 200 <hi>l.</hi> had more than 50 <hi>l.</hi> demanded for a Patent for it. And if their boldness and madness would carry them out to oppress the Rich after such a manner as hath been shewed, what might the Poor look for? Nevertheless, their Tyranny was beyond any thing that hath been as yet expressed: For if men were willing to bring their Titles to their Possessions to a Legal Tryal, they were not only threatned, but fined and persecuted, and used with barbarous Cruelty. When some Gentlemen in <hi>Boston</hi> resolved in a Legal way to defend their Title to an Island there, Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi> threatned that it might <hi>cost them all that they are worth, and something besides,</hi> as appears by the following Affidavit.</p>

            <p>One of Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s Council and Creatures, Petitioned for an Island belonging to the Town of <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and because the Agents of the said Town obtained a voluntary Subscription from the Persons concerned to bear the charge of the Suit; they were treated as Criminals, and against all Law, Illegally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to answer in another County, and not that where the pretended Misdemeanours were committed. And Mr. <hi>Wiswall</hi> the Minister of <hi>Duxbury</hi> having at the desire of some concerned transcribed a Writing which tended to clear the right they had to the Island in Controversie, and also concerning the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said voluntary Subscription, both Transcribed in the Winter 1687. A Messenger was sent to bring him to <hi>Boston</hi> on the 21th <hi>June</hi> 1688. he was then lame in both Feet with the Gout, fitter for a Bed than a Journey, therefore wrote to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praying that he might be excused until he should be able to Travel, and engaged that then he would attend any Court, but the next Week the cruel Officer by an Express Order from Sir <hi>E.

His Sickness forced him to decline a Prison, and to pay the Money. At the next Superior Court he appeared in the same Lame and Sick condition, and the extremity of the Weather cast him into such a violent Fit of Sickness, that he was in the judgment of others nigh unto death, and he himself thought that he should soon be out of their Bonds, and at liberty to lay his Information against his Oppressors before the Righteous Judge of the whole World. After all this having been forced a third time out of his own County and Colony near Forty Miles, he was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Hands and Humours of his Tyrannical Oppressors, who had exposed him to great difficulties, charges, and to 228 Miles Travel in Journeying to and from <hi>Boston,</hi> directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the place where he ought to have been tryed, had he been guilty of any of the <hi>pretended Misdemeanours,</hi> none of which his worst Enemies ever had the Face to read in open Court, or openly to charge him with to this day.

At the same time some of the Council desired Sir <hi>E.</hi> that this <hi>Hope Hood</hi> might be sent for before the Council, to which he replied, that he never had had a quarter of an hours conference with any of them, and that he scorned to discourse with any Heathen of them all, yet all this notwithstanding, at the same time whilst the Council was thus met, did Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdraw himself, and repair to the Prison where this <hi>Hope Hood</hi> was Prisoner, and did there continue with him two or three hours in private, the truth of what is above related is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by sundry Gentlemen that were of Sir <hi>Edmunds</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and were then Ear Witnesses and likewise by others that saw Sir <hi>E.</hi> at the Prison; <hi>and it is now verily believed that at that very time he consulted the mischief that is now acted by the said</hi> Hope Hood and Company.</p>

They let there and at a place called <hi>Dartmouth</hi> twelve or sixteen Miles distant from <hi>Pemyquid</hi> about one hundred and forty Leases, some had eight hundred or ten hundred Acres, few less than a hundred, some but three or four Acres, and all paid 2 l. 10. s. for passing their Grants of 100 Acres of Wood Land, with twenty Acres of Marsh where ever it could be found, but this bred a great mischief among the People; few or none have their Land measured or marked, they were in haste, and got what they could, <hi>they had their Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries amongst the poor people, and frighted them to take Grants,</hi> some came and complained to the Governour, and prayed him to <hi>confirm their Rights, which he refused to do,</hi> the Commission and whole proceeding being Illegal, having notice they were to be under his Government, they resented it, but it served their turn. <hi>The poor have been very much oppressed here,</hi> the Fort run all to ruine, and wants a great deal to repair it, Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> and Mr. <hi>West</hi> laid out for themselves such large lots, and Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> though not there, had a Childs Portion, I think some have eight thousand or ten thousand Acres. <hi>I hear not of one penny rent coming in to the King, from them who have their Grants confirmed at York,</hi> and the five shillings an hundred Acres was only <hi>a Sham</hi> upon the People: at our return we saw very good Land at <hi>Winter Harbour,</hi> enough to make large settlements for many people. The Governour will have it first measured, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000575_0039_0FA710D0F3745D00"/>
then surveyed, and then will dispose of it for settlements, Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> and his Family are setled at <hi>Boston,</hi> he is made <hi>Attorney General, and now the Governor is safe in his</hi> New-York <hi>Confidents,</hi> all others being Strangers to his <hi>Council.</hi> 'Twas not well done of <hi>Palmer</hi> and <hi>West</hi> to tear all in pieces that was setled and granted at <hi>Pemyquid</hi> by Sir <hi>E.</hi> that was the Scene where they <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and displaced at pleasure and were as Arbitrary as the great Turk, Some of the first setlers of that Eastern Country were denied Grants of their own Lands, whilst these men have given the Improved Lands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves,</hi> of which I suppose Mr. <hi>Hutchinson</hi> hath complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In another, <hi>May</hi> the 16th 1689. he says; I must confess there have been <hi>ill men from New-York</hi> who have too much studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the disease of this people, and both in Courts and Councils, they have not been <hi>treated well.</hi>

            <p>Thus does <hi>Edward Randolph,</hi> a Bird of the same Feather with themselves confess the truth, as to this matter, concerning <hi>his Brother</hi> Palmer <hi>and</hi> West.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Oppressive Fees have been extorted by Indigent and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Officers</hi> is declared by Mr. <hi>Hinckley</hi> the present Governour of <hi>New-Plymouth</hi> in his <hi>Narrative of the Grievances and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Their Majesties good Subjects in the Colony of</hi> New-Plymouth <hi>in</hi> New-England, <hi>by the Illegal and Arbitrary Actings in the Late Government under Sir</hi> E. A. which <hi>Narrative</hi> is too large to be here inserted, but it is possible it may be published by it self, whereby it will appear that every corner in the Countrey did ring with complaints of the Oppressions, and (to speak in Mr. <hi>Palmer'</hi>s phrase) <hi>horrible Usages</hi> of these ill Men. Some passages out of Mr. <hi>Hinckley'</hi>s <hi>Narrative</hi> respecting this matter, we shall here Transcribe, whose words are these which follow.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Bill of Cost Taxed by Judge <hi>Palmer</hi> seems also to be the greatest Extortion ever heard of before, as thrice twenty Shillings for three motions for Judgment at the same Term, (and was it not their courtesie they did not move ten times one after another at the same rate) and Taxed also, <hi>five pound for the Kings Attorney, and one and twenty Shillings for the Judges, and ten Shillings for the Sheriff,</hi> and other particulars as by the said Bill appeareth, and that which makes it the greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion is, that the whole Bill of Cost was exacted of every one of them, which each of them must pay down, or be kept Prisoners till they did, though all seven of them were jointly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000575_0040_0FA710D2A28A21F0"/>
informed against in one Information.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Hinckley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cry of poor Widows and Fatherless is gone up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against them on this account; for the Probate of a Will and Letter of Administration above fifty Shillings hath been extorted out of the hands of the Poor, nay they have been sometimes forced to pay more than four Pounds, when not much above a Crown had been due. Let <hi>Andrew Sergeant</hi> and <hi>Joseph Quilter</hi> among many others speak if this be not true, who were compelled to Travel Two Hundred Miles for the Probate of a Will, and to pay the unreasonable and oppressive Fees complained of—</p>
            <p>Besides these things, under Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s Government they had wicked ways to extort Money when they pleased. Mr. <hi>William Coleman</hi> complains (and hath given his Oath accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly) that upon the supposed hired Evidence of one Man he sustained Forty Pound damage in his Estate. And there were complaints all over the Countrey that Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s <hi>Excise-men</hi> would pretend Sickness on the Road, and get a Cup of Drink of the Hospitable People, but privately drop a piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and afterwards made Oath that they bought Drink at those Houses, for which the Innocent Persons were fined most unreasonably, and which was extorted from them, though these Villanies were declared and made known to those then in Power. <hi>William Goodhue, James</hi> and <hi>Mary Dennis</hi> might be produced as Witnesses hereof, with many more. Some of Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s Creatures have said, That such things as these made <hi>his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to stink.</hi> Also <hi>John Hovey</hi> and others complain of sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ten Pound damages by the Extortion of Officers, though never any thing (they could hear of) was charged upon them to this day, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Christopher Osgood</hi> complain of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent to Prison nine or ten days <hi>without a Mittinius, or any thing laid to their charge,</hi> and that afterwards they were forced to pay excessive charges—It would fill a Volume, if we should produce and insert all the <hi>Affidavits</hi> which do confirm the truth of these complaints.</p>
            <p>In the time of that unhappy Government, if the Officers wanted Money, it was but Seizing and Imprisoning the best Men in the Countrey for no fault in the World, and the greedy Officers would hereby have Grist to their Mill. Thus
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000575_0041_0FA710D3519A5130"/>
was <hi>Major Appleton</hi> dealt with. Thus Captain <hi>Bradstreet.</hi> Thus that worthy and worshipful Gentleman <hi>Nathaniel Salsto<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>istal</hi> Esquire was served by them and <hi>barbarously prosecuted,</hi> without any Information or Crime laid to his charge; for he had done nothing worthy of Bonds, but it was the pleasure of Sir <hi>E.</hi> and some others thus to abuse a Gentleman far more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly descended than himself, and one concerned in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>N. E.</hi> before him, but (to his Eternal Renown) one who refused to <hi>accept of an Illegal and Arbitrary Commission,</hi> when in the Reign of the Late K. <hi>James</hi> it was offered to him—</p>
            <p>We have now seen a whole Jury of complaints which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in their Verdict against Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and his Confederates. Were these things to be heard upon the place, where the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses who gave in their <hi>Affidavits</hi> are resident, they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to legal proof, as to every particular which was by <hi>the Agents of the Massachusetts Colony in</hi> N. E. objected against Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and others Seized and Secured by the people there.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there are other matters referring to Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> which caused great, and almost Universal Jealousie of him. For, 1. His Commission was such as would make any one believe that a Courtier in the time of the Late King <hi>James</hi> spoke true, who said Sir <hi>E. A. was sent to</hi> New-England <hi>on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be a Plague to the people there.</hi> For he with three or four more (none of them chosen by the people, but rather by that <hi>Implacable Enemy who prosecuted the</hi> Quo Warranto'<hi>s against their Charters,</hi> had power given them to make Laws, and raise what Moneys they should think meet for the support of their own Government, and he had power himself alone to send the best and most useful Men a Thousand Miles, (and further if he would) out of the Countrey, and to Build Cities and Castles (in the Air if he could) and demolish them again, and make the Purses of the Poor people pay for it all. Such a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was an unsufferable grievance, and no honest Englishman would ever have accepted of it, or acted by it—</p>
            <p>Secondly Jealousies were augmented by his involving the Countrey in a War with the Indians, by means whereof he hath occasioned the Ruine of many Families and Plantations; yea the Death, or Captivity of we know not how many Souls. <hi>For he went (with the</hi> Rose <hi>Frigat, and violently seized, and took,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000575_0042_0FA710D3EEE8A2F0"/>
and carried away, in a time of peace all the Houshold Good; and Merchandises of</hi> Monsieur Casteen <hi>a Frenchman at</hi> Penobscot <hi>who was Allied to the Indians,</hi> having Married the Daughter of one of their <hi>Princes</hi> whom they call <hi>Sagamores</hi> or <hi>Sachems;</hi> and when this was done, it was easie to foresee, and was generally concluded that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> would soon be upon the English, as it quickly came to pass. After the Flame was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and Barbarous Outrages committed by the Indians, Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s managery was such as filled the Countrey with greater fears of an <hi>horrid design.</hi> For Bloody Indians whom the English had secured, were not only dismissed, but rather courted than punished by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It cannot be exprest what just and amazing fears sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> when they had notice of the Late <hi>King James'</hi>s being in <hi>France,</hi> lest Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> whose Governour and Confident he was, should betray them into the Power of the <hi>French King,</hi> other circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to strengthen these fears. The <hi>Mohawks</hi> and other Indians were in hostility against the <hi>French,</hi> and it was very advantagious to the English Interest to have it so, but Sir <hi>E. caused them to make a Peace with the French,</hi> whereby the French Interest in those parts was strengthened, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish weakened. Mr. <hi>Peter Reverdy</hi> (a French Protestant) in his <hi>Memoirs</hi> concerning Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> complains of this.</p>
            <p>After that Sir <hi>E. A. and his Complices</hi> were secured, such reports and informations came to hand, as made <hi>New-England</hi> admire the Divine Providence in accomplishing what was done against the late Oppressors. They then saw the persons from whom they suspected the greatest danger, were now incapable of betraying them—</p>
            <p>If an unaccountable Instinct and Resolution had not animated the Inhabitants in and about <hi>Boston,</hi>to seize on those few men, the People there believe <hi>N. E.</hi> would have been in the hands not of <hi>King William</hi> but <hi>King Lewis e're this day:</hi> For in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1689. several Vessels belonging to <hi>N. E.</hi> were taken near <hi>Cansir</hi> in <hi>America</hi> by some French Men of War. The Prisoners since at liberty, inform, that the French told them, that there was a Fleet of Ships bound from <hi>France</hi> directly for <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>N. E.</hi> but some of them were taken by the <hi>English</hi> Ships of War,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000575_0043_0FA710D4E034FEC0"/>
and three or four of them lost at <hi>New-found-land,</hi> and that Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> had sent to the French King for them to come over, and the Countrey should be delivered up. And the Lieutenant of a French-man of War professed, that if Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> had not been imprisoned, they would then have gone to <hi>Boston.</hi> This shews what a good Opinion the French had of him, and such reports so testified made a stranger impression on the spirits of the People throughout the Countrey: And that the World may see we do not write Fictions of our own, the subsequent <hi>Affidavits</hi> are produced and here inserted.</p>

            <p>But as to one of the Crimes objected against Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and his Arbitrary Complices, <hi>Habemus confitentem reum.</hi> Mr. <hi>Palmer cannot deny but that they levied moneys on the King's Subjects in</hi> New-England, <hi>contrary to the fundamentals of the English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which doth not allow the imposition of Taxes without a <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>New-Englanders</hi> supposed that their late
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000575_0046_0FA710D86CF51FF0"/>
Oppressors had been guilty of no less than a capital Crime by their raising Money in such a way as they did; and we are assured that one of them after he received, and before he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vertue of his illegal Commission from the Late King, professed, that <hi>if ever he had an hand in raising a penny of Money without an Assembly, his neck should go for it;</hi> and yet no man that we know of had a deeper hand in it than this person had. But Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> for the justification of this so soul a business, laies down several Positions which he would have no man deny; One of his Positions is, <hi>That it is a fundamental Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to by all Christian Nations, That the first discoverer of a Countrey inhabited by Infidels, gives a right and dominion of that Countrey to the Prince in whose service and employment the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers were sent.</hi> These are his words, <hi>p.</hi> 17. We affirm, that this <hi>fundamental Point</hi> (as he calls it) is not a <hi>Christian,</hi> but <hi>an unchristian Principle.</hi> It is controverted among the School-men, <hi>an dominium fundatur in gratid. Papists are</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> is) for the <hi>affirmative,</hi> but the <hi>Scripture teaches us to believe</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Heathen Nations, <hi>and the Sons of Adam,</hi> and not <hi>the Children of Israel</hi> only, have a right to the Earth, and to the Inheritance which God hath given them therein, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8. When Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath prov'd that <hi>Infidels</hi> are not the <hi>Sons of Adam,</hi> we shall consent to his notion, that Christians may invade their Rights, and take their Lands from them, and give them to whom they please, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> may give all <hi>America</hi> to the <hi>King of Spain.</hi> But let him know, that the first Planters in <hi>New-England,</hi> had more of conscience and the fear of God in them, than it seems Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath. For they were not willing to <hi>wrong the Indians in their Properties;</hi> for which cause it was that they purchased from the Natives their right to the Soil in that part of the World, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what right they had by vertue of their Charters from the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Palmer'</hi>s Position is clearly against <hi>Jus Gentium &amp; Jus Naturale,</hi> which instructs every man, <hi>Nemini injuriam facere.</hi> He that shall violently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any just cause take from Infidels their Lands, where they plant, and by which they subsist, does them manifest injury. And let us know of Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> if <hi>Christian</hi> Princes have power to dispose of the Lands belonging to <hi>Infidels</hi> in the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000575_0047_0FA710DA634C6850"/>
               <hi>West-Indies,</hi> whether they have the like Dominion over the Lands belonging to the <hi>Infidels in the East-Indies,</hi> and if these <hi>Infidels</hi> shall refuse to consent that such <hi>Christians</hi> shall possess their Lands, that then they may lawfully <hi>Vi &amp; Armis</hi> expel or destroy them, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did! We may send Mr. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> for further instruction in this point to <hi>Balaam's Ass,</hi> which ingenuously acknowledged that her Master (though an Infidel) had a Property in, and right of Dominion over her, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 30. But this <hi>Gentleman</hi> hath some other <hi>Assertions</hi> which he would have us take for <hi>postulata,</hi> and then we shall be his <hi>Slaves</hi> without all peradventures. He tells us in page 17, 18, 19. that the <hi>English Plantations (in particular</hi> New-England) <hi>are no parts of the Empire of</hi> England, <hi>but like</hi> Wales <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>which were Conquered, and belong to the Dominion of the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and that therefore he that wears the Crown, may set up Governments over them, which are Despotick and Absolute, without any regard to</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>and that whereas in</hi> Barbadoes, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, Virginia, <hi>&amp;c. they have their Assemblies, that's only from the favour of the Prince, and not that they could pretend Right to such Priviledges of Englishmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we need no further <hi>discovery of the man.</hi> Could the people of <hi>N. E.</hi> who are zealous for English Liberties ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it long, that such a person as this should be made one of their <hi>Judges,</hi> that so by squeezing them, he might be able to pay his <hi>Debts?</hi> And can any rational man believe, that persons of such Principles did not <hi>Tyrannize</hi> over that people when once they had them in their cruel Clutches, and could pretend the Authority of the late King <hi>James</hi> for what they did? In our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath not done like a Wise man thus to expose himself to the just resentments and indignation of all the <hi>English Plantations.</hi> If ever it should be his chance to be amongst them again, what could he expect but to be lookt on as <hi>communis Hostis,</hi> when he thus openly declares that they have no English Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to them?—That worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> (who was <hi>Attorney General</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the second) had certainly more understanding in the Law than Captain <hi>Palmer,</hi> and yet Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> (we suppose) is not ignorant that when some proposed, that <hi>Jamaica</hi> (and so the other Plantations) might be governed without an Assembly,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000575_0048_0FA710DC4BD59250"/>
               <hi>that excellent Attorney</hi> (not like Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> but like an Englishman) told the then King, <hi>That he could no more Grant a Commission to Levy Money on his Subjects there without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by an Assembly, than they could discharge themselves from their Allegiance to the English Crown;</hi> and what Englishmen in their right Wits will venture their Lives over the Seas to enlarge the Kings Dominions, and to enrich and greaten the English Nation, if all the reward they shall have for their cost and adventures shall be their being deprived of <hi>English Liberties,</hi> and in the same condition with the <hi>Slaves</hi> in <hi>France</hi> or in <hi>Turks!</hi> And if <hi>the Colonies of</hi> N. E. <hi>are not to be esteemed as parts of</hi> England, <hi>why then were the</hi> Quo Warranto'<hi>s</hi> issued our against the Government in <hi>Boston</hi> as belonging to <hi>Westminster</hi> in <hi>Middlesex!</hi> Are the English there, like the <hi>Welsh</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> a Conquered people? When Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath proved that, he hath said something. They have (through the Mercy of God) obtained Conquests over many of their Enemies, both <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to the Enlargement of the English Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. But except Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and the rest of that Crew will say, That his and their <hi>domineering</hi> a while was a <hi>Conquest,</hi> they were never yet a <hi>Conquered People.</hi> So that his alledging the case of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> before English Liberties were granted to them, is an impertinent Story. Besides, he forgets that there was <hi>an Original Contract</hi> between the King and the first Planters in <hi>New-England,</hi> the King promising them, if they at their own cost and charge would subdue a Wilderness, and enlarge his Dominions, they and their Posterity after them should enjoy such Priviledges as are in their Charters expressed, of which that of not having Taxes imposed on them without their own consent was one. Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and his <hi>Brethren Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors</hi> will readily reply, Their <hi>Charter</hi> was condemned. But he cannot think, that the Judgment against their Charter made them cease to be <hi>Englishmen.</hi> And only the Colony of the <hi>Massachusetts</hi> had their Charter condemned. And yet these Men Ventured to Levy Moneys on the Kings Subjects in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticott Colony.</hi> For the which <hi>Invasion of Liberty and Property</hi> they can never answer. Indeed they say the Corporation of <hi>Connecticott surrendred their Charter.</hi> But who told them so? It is certain, that no one belonging to the Government there,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000575_0049_0FA710DDB3D7CA20"/>
knoweth of any such thing; and how their Oppressors should know that <hi>Connecticott</hi> made a Surrender of their Charter when the Persons concerned know nothing of it, is very strange. We can produce that written by the Secretary of that Colony with his own Hand, and also Signed by the present Governour there, which declares the contrary to what these Men (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly as boldly) affirm. Witness the words following.</p>

            <p>Thus did Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> and his Creatures, who were deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Illegal Actions of the Late Unhappy Reigns, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God and Men, commit a Rape on a whole Colony; for which Violence it is hoped they may account, and make reparation (if possible) to those many whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties as well as Liberties have been Invaded by them—</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> in the close of his <hi>partial account of N. E.</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains his Readers with an <hi>harangue</hi> about the <hi>Sin of Rebellion,</hi> and misapplies several Scriptures that so he might make the World believe that the people of <hi>N. E.</hi> have been guilty of wicked <hi>Rebellion</hi> by their casting off the Arbitrary Power of those ill men who invaded Liberty and Property to such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable degree as hath been proved against them. But does he in sober sadness think, that if when Wolves are got among Sheep in a Wilderness, the Shepherds and Principal men there shall keep them from Ravening, that this is the Sin of Rebellion condemned in the Scripture? How or by whose Authority our <hi>Lawyer</hi> comes to play the <hi>Divine</hi> we know not. But since he hath thought meet to take a Spiritual Weapon into his hand, let him know that the Scripture speaks of a lawful and good <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as well as of that which is unlawful. It is said of good <hi>Hezekiah that the Rebelled against the King of Assyria and served him not,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:000575_0051_0FA710DF2D9524C8"/>
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 7. Indeed reviling <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> upbraided him, and said as in <hi>verse</hi> 20. <hi>thou Rebellest</hi> (not unlike to Captain <hi>Palmer</hi>) say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>N. E. thou rebellest. Hezekiahs</hi> predecessours had basely given away the Liberties of the people, and submitted to the <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did like a worthy Prince in casting off a Tyrannical Government, and asserting the Liberty of them that were the Lords People, and God did signally own and prosper him in what he did, and would never permit the <hi>Assyrian</hi> to regain his Tyrannical Power over <hi>Jerusalem</hi> or the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> though for their tryal he permitted their Enemies to make some Devastations among them. The like (we hope) may be the happy case of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> tells us, that <hi>N. E. hath valued it self for the true profession and pure exercise of the Protestant Religion,</hi> but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates that they will be <hi>termed a Land full of Hypocrisie and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Irreligion, and a degenerate wicked people, p.</hi> 39. And is this the <hi>Sincerity and Christian Moderation</hi> which he boasts himself of in his Preface? Surely these are the <hi>Hissings of the Old Serpent</hi> and do sufficiently indicate whose Children the men are that use them. Since he will be at Divinity, let him (if he can) read the <hi>Apologies</hi> written by <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> and there see if <hi>Pagans</hi> did not accuse <hi>Christians</hi> of Old just after the same manner, and with the same Crimes that he wickedly upbraids that Good and Loyal People with. Who are they that use to call the Holiest and most Conscientious men in the World, <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Liars, Rebels, and what not?</hi> but they that are themselves the greatest <hi>Hypocrites, Liars, and Rebels</hi> against Heaven that the Earth does bear? It is hard to believe that Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> does not rebel against the light of his own Conscience, when he affirms as in Page (38) that in <hi>N. E. every thing that hath any relations to their Majesties is neglected, and unregarded without any recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Authority over those dominions.</hi> He cannot be ignorant of the humble <hi>Addresses</hi> which the people in <hi>N. E.</hi> have from time to time made to their present Majesties, acknowledging their Authority. He knows that on the first notice of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties being proclaimed <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> both those now in Government in <hi>N. E.</hi> and the body of the people with them; did (without any command) of their own accord, with the greatest joy proclaim their Majesties in <hi>N. E.</hi> he knows
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000575_0052_0FA710E025B818F0"/>
that their Majesties have no subjects more cordially and zealously devoted to them than those in <hi>N. E.</hi> are, or that do with greater fervour pray for their long and happy Reigns, or that are more willing to expose themselves to the utmost hazards in their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and yet this man that knoweth all this, to cast an <hi>Odium</hi> on that Loyal and Good people, insinuates as if they were <hi>Rebels,</hi> and <hi>disaffected</hi> to the Present Government, and designed to set up an <hi>Independant Common Wealth,</hi> and had <hi>no regard to the Laws of God or Men.</hi> After this lying and malicious rate hath he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest himself—What Rational Charity can be extended so far as to believe that 'tis possible for him to think that what himself hath written is true? When <hi>Sanballat</hi> wrote that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the Jews with him <hi>intended to Rebel,</hi> did he believe what he had written? no, he did not, but <hi>feigned those things out of his own heart.</hi> The like is to be said of those <hi>Sanballats</hi> that accuse the people of <hi>N. E.</hi> with thoughts of Rebellion. And so we have done with Mr. <hi>Palmer.</hi> What hath been said is sufficient to <hi>justify</hi> the <hi>Revolution</hi> in <hi>N. E.</hi> and to <hi>vindicate the People</hi> there from the Aspersions cast upon them by their Enemies. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Worthy Gentlemen have under their hands given an account concerning some of Sir <hi>Edmund'</hi>s <hi>Arbitrary proceedings,</hi> which is subscribed by five (and more would have concurred with them had there been time to have communicated it) of those who were of Sir <hi>Edmunds</hi> Council during his Government there, and for that cause their complaints carry the more weight with them, which shall therefore as a Conclusion be here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</p>
