         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE of late been entertained with ſtrange things from the pulpit, which have cauſed no ſmall uneaſineſs in my mind, with regard to the eſſentials of the Goſpel, leſt they ſhould be brought down, and rendered palatable to the pride of the carnal heart.</p>
            <p>For, in my apprehenſion, thoſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural doctrines, which ſerve to exalt the ſaviour and abaſe the creature, ſuch as the depravity of the human nature, and the rich, free, ſovereign grace of God, in the recovery of loſt ſinners to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by faith in the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, are evidently ſtruck at.</p>
            <p>I therefore ſeriouſly aſk an anſwer to that all-important queſtion—"What muſt I do to be ſaved." <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 30.</p>
            <p>I the rather make this enquiry, as I have lately been taught the following doctrines, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That men in a natural unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate, can do thoſe things which are well-pleaſing and acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:016276_0004_0F9BD1B908F45FA8"/>2. That the ſpecial, effacacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Holy Spirit in converſion are unneceſſary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Which aſſerts an unregenerate man has as much power or ability to take poſſeſſion of the heavenly Canaan, as Iſrael had to take poſſeſſion of the earthly Canaan.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some, ſaith the preacher, hold to an abſolute, perſonal, unconditional e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which (adds he) is abſurd and ridiculous, and bleſſed be God, it is falſe doctrine: For Chriſt did as much for Judas as for St. Paul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am told that the power of the will, though an Arminian tenet, is a good one; that every mans has power within himſelf, from means and motives held up, ſavingly to chuſe or refuſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That if I repent and believe the Goſpel, God has engaged that he will give me a new heart and would cauſe me to walk in his ſtatutes; and if I do not God will break his covenant. As in Deuteronomy.</p>
            <p>From the apoſtle's mentioning the breaking off of the Jews, and grafting in of the Gentiles, I am told, that the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016276_0005_0F9BD1BA5E5D5C78"/>
former diſpenſation was a faith of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the preſent diſpenſation means no more, elſe the apoſtle's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is fooliſhneſs. Conſequently tells me that ſaving grace is unneceſſary for complying with any ordinance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I am taught that creeds, catechiſms, confeſſions of ſaith, church covenants, &amp;c. are a long rope of which the devil has the knot-end. That the devil could not have done ſo much miſchief without them, and that there could not be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation till theſe were thrown aſide. But then he added, that children might be taught the catechiſe, provided the moſt dangerous parts were left out.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I am told on account of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt the divine attributes harmoniſe, juſtice could demand no more: Chriſt partaking human nature his elevated and reſtored it to favour; and the whole human race are upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtanding than Adam in innocency.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The goſpel is a remedial law, brought down to our capacities, and that we are able to obey its precepts.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The depravity of human nature is denied, and original ſin is aſſerted not to be damning.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016276_0006_0F9BD1BB0BA64108"/>12. I have been taught that original ſin and imputed guilt is as unſcriptural as the Indian's philoſophy was unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical, when he ſaid, the world was held up by a great Indian, the Indian ſtood upon a tortoiſe and the tortoiſe ſtood upon nothing.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That an unregenerate man could act a divine faith, or put forth a ſaving act, as well as the regenerate.</p>
            <p n="14">14. I am taught that a ſaying ſaith is an aſſent of the will, founded on the underſtanding, but the conſent of the will was no part of it, illuſtrated by this ſimilitude, '<hi>I believe there is ſuch a place as London, becauſe I have ſeen the hiſtory of it.</hi>' And the life of faith is works: And that God is not the immediate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of faith, but the ſcriptures mediately or by means. And the faith of devils differs not from the faith of believers, but in this, one has works, the other has none.</p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, are the doctrines I have been taught to believe; pray be ſo kind as to give me, in brief, your ſentiments upon them, and you will greatly oblige one, who is <hi>ſearching after Truth.</hi>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY your addreſs you diſcover a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be freed turn error, and to be led into the knowledge of divine truth.</p>
            <p>It will afford me peculiar pleaſure, if I may be happily inſtrumental, in the hand of God, of affording you ſome little aſſiſtance in this moſt weighty concern.</p>
            <p>Your firſt enquiry is, '<hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>' I would direct you to the apoſtle's anſwer, <hi>Believe on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Not that any perſon if left to the inclinations of his own depraved heart, will ever feel a diſpoſition ſavingly to cloſe with Chriſt. <hi>Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God.</hi> Rom. viii. 7. <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> Eph. ii. 8.</p>
            <p>Man is not born a believer, faith ſprings not up of itſelf, from ſome hidden ſeeds in our degenerate nature; but is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a foreign extract, it is of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural birth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016276_0008_0F9BD1BCEF448660"/>None that give credit to the Bible, of even conſult their own experience and obſervation, but muſt confeſs, that this grace of faith is a holy principle, which no man brings into the world with him, for we are born with an evil heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; are all included in the number of the many, who by <hi>one man's diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience were made ſinners.</hi> There is an inbred principle of infidelity, an hidden root of bitterneſs, in the corrupt nature, which we have all derived from apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Adam. Fooliſhneſs, ſays the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man, is bound up in the heart of a child, and nothing can effectually root it out, but the <hi>rod of his ſtrength, who maketh his people willing in the day of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unrenewed men are as much at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in their minds, againſt the grace of God, and the merits of Chriſt, in the ſcripture. account of them, as they are to his holineſs and moral government.</p>
            <p>This appears evident in convicted perſons, when enlightened by the holy ſpirit, they ſee themſelves under a brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en law, and in extreme danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forever, without an intereſt in Chriſt,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016276_0009_0F9BD1BF54349B80"/>
a new heart, and a change from nature to grace: Yet how great is their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the law as a covenant of works, how does the ſpirit of the phariſee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and prevail within them! That however much they may expreſs their deſire toward a ſaviour, and a willingneſs to be juſtified by Chriſt; it is plain they are for compounding matters, mingling law and goſpel, or elſe paſs on in a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way between them: At beſt they are for waſhing their ſins by the tears of repentance, joined with faith in the blood of Chriſt, or elſe hope to make a righteouſneſs of their prayers and duties, thinking by theſe to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the grace of God, to obtain Chriſt, and get entitled to his benefits: At moſt the pride of their ſtubborn hearts will not ſuffer them to come to Chriſt as naked forlorn ſinners, wretched and miſerable, trembling under fearful apprehenſions of their guilt and danger, as worthleſs, helpleſs and hopeleſs in themſelves conſidered, depending alone on the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt for juſtification and acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>Hence it is manifeſt, that holy and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016276_0010_0F9BD1BF87866C10"/>
unfeigned faith, is ſo far from being a connatural principle in us, that by nature we are utter ſtrangers to it, nay enemies againſt it.</p>
            <p>Nor is this ſaith an acquired habit or the natural effect of human endeavours, which we procure to ourſelves, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our own more improvements on natural reaſon and conſcience: For the truly regenerate are <hi>born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man but of God.</hi> John i, 13.</p>
            <p>And when it ſhall pleaſe God to bring you ſavingly to believe in Chriſt, he will give you to ſee that ſalvation is all of grace, of pure, unmingled grace, that all boaſting may be excluded from man, and all the glory redound to his great name. That the law is ſpiritual, but that you are carnal, ſold under ſin He will ſhew you that all works produced by human endeavours and even faith itſelf, as it is the act of the creature, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſet aſide in the grand buſineſs of our juſtification before God; and that you ſtand in the moſt abſolute need of a better righteousneſs than your own even the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt to denominate you righteous before his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016276_0011_0F9BD1C51D26F3A0"/>

He will then hold up a ſaviour to view, ſuch a ſaviour as is exactly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to relieve you under your periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances; and will enable you to hunger and thirſt after Chriſt: He will give you to ſee that in Jeſus the Redeemer all fulneſs dwells; all fulneſs of merit and righteouſneſs, of grace, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and ſalvation; and this for the unworthy, for the moſt guilty among men, for <hi>whoſoever will,</hi> even for the chief of ſinners.</p>
            <p>If you know theſe things by happy experience, may you ſtil go on <hi>rejoicing in Chriſt Jeſus, putting no confidence in the Fleſh.</hi> But if not, may the Lord give you a will, a heart, cordially to accept of Chriſt; may he make bear his arm, and by the powerful operations of the bleſſed ſpirit, effectually draw off your affections from the love of ſin, from the love of the world, and the things of it; may he draw you to himſelf, and ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unite you to Jeſus Chriſt by a faith of divine operation; that you may live to God, honour his great name, and bring
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016276_0012_0F9BD1C78DAF3068"/>
forth much fruit to the praiſe of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace, that hereafter you may join with ſaints and angels in ſublime aſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of praiſe to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the lamb forever and ever.</p>
            <p>As to the doctrines you have been taught, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. "That men in a natural, unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtate, can do thoſe things which are well-pleaſing and acceptable in the ſight of God."</p>
            <p>This appears to me both <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>unſcriptural.</hi> 1. Dangerous for it leads the ſinner to build his hopes for heaven on a falſe foundation, even upon his own works: But what ſay the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. iii. 11. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved; not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Eph. ii. 8, 9. Now if Jeſus Chriſt be the only foundation for men to build the ſalvation of their precious ſouls upon, then to build upon works as a foundation muſt be infinitely dangerous. 2. It is <hi>unſcriptural</hi>; for, ſays Chriſt, John iii. 6. <hi>that which is born of Fleſh, is Fleſh.</hi> And ſays the apoſtle, Rom. viii. 8. <hi>They that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016276_0013_0F9BD1C8B623F088"/>
are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> By being in the fleſh, muſt mean man in his natural unregenerate ſtate, for being born of the fleſh is directly oppoſed by our Saviour himſelf to being born of the ſpirit: He therefore adds, <hi>Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, ye muſt be born again.</hi> We read expreſsly, Heb. xi. 6. <hi>That without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> But man in his natural ſtate has not faith, therefore it is impoſſible for man in his natural ſtate to do thoſe things which are well pleaſing in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. "That regeneration, and the ſpecial effacacious influences of the holy ſpirit in converſion are unneceſſary."</p>
            <p>The former part of this article is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically oppoſite our ſaviour's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with Nicodemus, and to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the whole New-Teſtament and is therefore falſe. And as to the ſpecial, effacacious influences of the holy ſpirit in converſion as unneceſſary, theſe texts may prove the aſſertion unſcriptural, Eph. i. 19, 20. <hi>And what is the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:016276_0014_0F9BD1C94F050820"/>
2 Cor. v. 17. Therefore <hi>if any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature.</hi> With Eph. ii. 1.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. "Which aſſerts, an unregenerate man has as much power, or ability to take poſſeſſion of the heavenly Canaan, as Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had to take poſſeſſion of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canaan."</p>
            <p>If by power, or ability, he means a natural power, I ſhall not contend with him; but if he means a moral power, that men have a heart, a will, while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, to love God, to chuſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to believe in Chriſt, and accept of ſalvation, as offered in the goſpel through him, I muſt deny the aſſertion, and hold it unſcriptural: Elſe why does our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour complain, <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life,</hi> John v. 40. It is repreſented in ſcripture as being given unto men to believe, <hi>Philip.</hi> i. 2, 9: And ſays Chriſt, John vi. 44, <hi>No man can come to me except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. "Some, ſays the preacher, (I had almoſt ſaid impoſter) hold to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, perſonal, unconditional election; which, adds he, is abſurd and ridiculous, and bleſſed be God it is falſe doctrine:

For Chriſt died as much for Judas as for St. Paul."</p>
            <p>That there is a certain remnant that ſhall be ſaved, and this by virtue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is plain from the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. <hi>V<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſels of mercy afore prepared unto glory,</hi> Rom. ix 23. <hi>The election hath obtained,</hi> Rom. xi. 7. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed,</hi> Acts xiii. 48. And 2. Theſſ. ii. 13. <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c. It was requiſite that election ſhould be abſolute, becauſe of the abſoluteneſs of God's decree touching the death of his Son, unto which he was fore-ordained unrepealably. 1. Pet. i. 20. <hi>He was the lamb ſlain from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world,</hi> Rev. xiii. 8. <hi>And it was not poſſible that cup ſhould paſs from him,</hi> Matt xxvi. 39, 42. Now if it be a thing below the prudence of men to lay down the price, without ſecuring the purchaſe; then ſurely the wiſdom of God could not determine the death of his ſon, for men's ſalvation, and yet leave the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe very men at an uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which it muſt have been, if their election had not been abſolute. And that election is perſonal, is plain from this;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016276_0016_0F9BD1CACEF21C60"/>
the deſign of God in the death of Chriſt could not otherwiſe be ſecured. Had the deſign been to purchaſe ſalvation for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, without aſcertaining the perſons that ſhould believe, it had been uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether <hi>any</hi> would be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe uncertain whether any would <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> If <hi>certain</hi> that ſome would <hi>believe,</hi> this certainty muſt be decreed. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing future could be certain otherwiſe; and if it was decreed that <hi>ſome</hi> ſhould believe, the individuals of that ſome muſt be decreed alſo; for faith is the gift of God, and could not be foreſeen in any, but whom he had decreed to give it unto. Which laid together are a good demonſtration that thoſe Chriſt died for, were as well pre-ordained, as that he ſhould die for them, and that definitely and by name.</p>
            <p>It is alſo unconditional.</p>
            <p>To derive election from any root, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the good pleaſure of God, is to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the principal end of man's ſalvation, viz, <hi>the glory of God's grace,</hi> Eph. i. 6, 2, 7. This attribute of all the reſt, he will not have eclipſed, nor infringed upon; it is ſo divinely ſacred, as not to admit the leaſt human touch; for which very
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016276_0017_0F9BD1D13468A040"/>
cauſe, the Lord hath ſo contrived that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deſign of his glory, that all boaſting is excluded, <hi>and no Fleſh ſhall glory in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> 1. Cor. i. 29. But if any thing in the creature, any good works foreſeen, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the cauſality of election, fleſh will glory; and inſtead of excluding man's boaſting, grace itſelf will be excluded. See Rom. xi. 6.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid "Chriſt died as much for Judas as for St. Paul:" This I deny. Judas is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, to be the ſon of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to be eternally loſt: But thoſe for whom Chriſt died are appointed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation through him, 1 Theſſ. v. 9. Chriſt is ſaid expreſly to die for his people, Matt. i. 21. His ſheep, John x. 11, 12. His church, Acts xx. 28. Eph. v. 25. As diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the world, Rom. v. 8. Whence, ſays one, "We may ſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Chriſt died not for all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. Not for thoſe he never knew, whom he hates, whom he hardens, on whom he will not ſhew mercy, who were before of old ordained to condemnation: In a word for a reprobate, for the world for which he would not pray."</p>
            <p>Here perhaps you will object, "How can the offers of ſalvation ba ſaid to be made
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016276_0018_0F9BD1D1C18FD760"/>
with ſincerity to thoſe for whom Chriſt never died?" To this I anſwer in the words of a learned divine. "Thoſe to whom the goſpel is preached, are obliged to believe that Chriſt is God, the ſon of God, the true Meſſiah, &amp;c. according to the tenor of the revelation made to them; and may juſtly be condemned for not believing in him as ſuch, even though he died not for them; for that he died for them, is not what they are obliged to believe, that being no part of the revelation made to them; nor will they be condemned for not believing that he died for them, but for their neglect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and unbelief of him and his goſpel."</p>
            <p n="5">5. "I am told that the power of the will, though an Arminian tenet, is a good one; that every man has power within himſelf from means and motives held up, ſavingly to chuſe or refuſe."</p>
            <p>To this it may be replied, as to unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons they have no will, or moral power, to chuſe and prefer ſpiritual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things; they deſire not the knowledge of God's ways; their carnal minds are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, and are not ſubject to his law, nor can they be ſubject to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpecial grace of God. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> Pſa.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016276_0019_0F9BD1D40FC68360"/>
110.3. <hi>Who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. John i. 13.</p>
            <p n="6">6. "That if I repent and believe the Goſpel, God has engaged that he will give me a new heart, and would cauſe me to walk in his ſtatutes, and if I do not, God will break his covenant, as in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Here it may be obſerved, that no perſon does truly repent and believe in Chriſt, but he that has, a <hi>new heart.</hi> I hope no one will be ſo abſurd as to aſſert, than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſon, while ſuch, can act ſaving faith and evangelical repentence: No, they muſt be created in Chriſt Jeſus, and have the ſpirit of Chriſt put in them firſt. Hence faith and repentance are not conditions of the new heart, but the fruits and gracious exerciſes of it. Theſe by the influences of his ſpirit, God will enable to walk in his ſtatutes, and to perſevere through faith and holineſs unto ſalvation. <hi>For having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.</hi> John xiii. 1. Jer. xxxi. 31.</p>
            <p n="7">7. "From the apoſtle's mentioning, the breaking off of the Jews, and grafting in of the Gentiles, I am told, that the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was a faith of profeſſion, and the preſent diſpenſation means no more, elſe the apoſtle's reaſoning is fooliſhneſs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016276_0020_0F9BD1D531148B70"/>
tells me that ſaving grace is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for complying with any ordinance."</p>
            <p>We may here obſerve, that no diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ever given from God to men admits of hypocriſy; he always requires the heart, and even under the Moſaic diſpenſation, thoſe that were ceremonially polluted, were forbidden to partake of the paſſover, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their profeſſion, And under the holy diſpenſation of the goſpel, the church of Chriſt is called a ſpiritual houſe, and believers are ſaid to be lively ſtones of which it is built, an holy prieſt had to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> ii. 5. But what unfit materials, are hypocritical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, to make up a part of this ſpiritual building? The goſpel therefore requires holineſs of heart and life in all thoſe that make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their faith in Chriſt. <hi>And let every one, that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 19. <hi>God is a ſpirit and they who worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> John iv. 24.</p>
            <p n="8">8. "I am taught that creeds, catechiſms, confeſſions of faith, church covenants, &amp;c. are a long rope of which the devil his the knot-end; that the devil could not have

done ſo much miſchief without them as with them, and that there would not be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation till theſe were thrown aſide, &amp;c." Theſe though not infallible, are to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, ſo far as they agree with the word of God, to be good directories for our ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the mind and will of God; and ought to be made uſe of as ſuch, by us: Which to deny, is to deny the practice of the reformed churches in all periods. As to their being a long rope, &amp;c. I think it a very indecent and unjuſtifiable expreſſion. And as to there being no reformation till theſe are thrown aſide; this we know, there have been glorious out-pourings of the ſpirit in the churches where theſe have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended to, and we hope for ſtill greater. <hi>Hold faſt therefore the form of ſound words.</hi> 2 Tim. i. 12.</p>
            <p n="9">9. "I am told on account of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, the divine attributes har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſe, juſtice could demand no more. Chriſt partaking human nature has elevated and reſtored it to favour; and the whole human race are upon better ſtanding than Adam in innocency."</p>
            <p>That the divine attributes do harmoniſe in the juſtification and ſalvation of them that believe in Chriſt, I hope none will deny.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016276_0022_0F9BD1D619BEF528"/>
But to ſay, that Chriſt by partaking human nature has reſtored it to divine favour, &amp;c. is contradictory to ſcripture and common ſenſe: For if all men are reſtored to the favour of God, then all men will be ſaved, but ſay the ſcriptures, <hi>Many be called, but few choſen,</hi> Mat. xx. 16. vii. 14. And is it not impoſing upon common ſenſe to ſay, that perſons dead in ſin, under the wrath of God, and a moral inability to pleaſe God, which is the ſcripture account of the whole human race by nature, are upon better ſtanding than Adam in innocency, who was holy, in the image, favour and enjoyment of God?</p>
            <p n="10">10. "The goſpel is a remedial law, brought down to our capacities, and that we are able to obey its precepts."</p>
            <p>I find nothing in ſcripture for this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as one obſerves, it is a great miſtake, to ſuppoſe that the conditions of this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary new law are eaſier, than the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the old covenant of works. The caſe is much otherwiſe; he with whom the firſt covenant was made, had ſufficient power and ability to fulfil all its conditions, and fully to come up to all its demands. But fallen creatures are morally incapable of performing ſincere though imperfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016276_0023_0F9BD1D886730FE0"/>
they have naturally no ſincerity, no truth in the inward parts, no principle of new obedience, nor does this pretended covenant ſupply them with any.</p>
            <p n="11">11. "The depravity of human nature is denied, and original ſin aſſerted not to be damning."</p>
            <p>To prove the depravity of human nature ſee Pſalm li. 5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> With Pſa. lviii, 3. Iſa. xlviii, 8. "What is here ſaid of David, ſays a learned divine, is true of all men; ſince every imagination of the thoughts of men's hearts, both in the old and in the new world, is evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi, 5, and 8, 21." And that not only the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are eſtranged from the womb, but the elect of God, are by nature children of wrath even as others, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii, 3. Which ſuppoſe them to be guilty and polluted as others; and indeed how ſhould it be otherwiſe for <hi>that which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh.</hi> That original ſin is not damning appears falſe from this, <hi>All ſin in its own nature is damning, for ſin, every ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the law of God, and is therefore expoſed to its penalty, even to eternal death,</hi> Rom. vi. 23. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore original ſin muſt be damning.</p>
            <p n="12">12. "I have been taught that original ſin
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016276_0024_0F9BD1D906C53338"/>
and imputed guilt, is as unſcriptural as the Indian's philoſophy was unphiloſophical, when he ſaid that the world was held up by a great Indian, the Indian ſtood upon a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe, and the tortoiſe ſtood upon nothing.<note n="*" place="bottom">This was delivered in our pulpit by a tranſient perſon, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to me, that he was as ignorant of the myſteries of the Goſpel, as his Indian was of philoſophy.</note>"</p>
            <p>To prove original ſin, or that we are born ſinners, and imputed guilt, ſee Rom. v. 12. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> Imputed guilt, I think is plain from the 19th verſe, For as by one man's diſobedience, many were made ſinners, ſo, or in like manner, as it might he rendered by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous. Now how do men become righteous? Is it not by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted or made over to the ſoul, upon its receiving him by faith? If ſo, then by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of reaſoning we are made ſinners by Adam's ſin being imputed to us.</p>
            <p n="13">13. "That an unregenerate man could a divine faith, or put forth a ſaving act as well as the regenerate."</p>
            <p>This is to ſay, there may be the act where the habit is not; or that there may be an effect without a cauſe; which are equally
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016276_0025_0F9BD1D9F10CEA50"/>
abſurd: In order to act faith there muſt be the principle: for what ſays our ſaviour, <hi>Firſt make the tree good, then the fruit will be good; for a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. "I am taught that a ſaving faith is an aſſent of the will founded on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but the conſent of the will was no part of it; illuſtrated by this ſimilitude, <hi>I believe there is ſuch a place as London be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſeen the hiſtory of it.</hi> And the life of faith is works: And that God is not the immediate author of faith, but the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mediately, or by means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the faith of devils differs not from the faith of believers, but in this, one has works, the other has none."</p>
            <p>According to this, an hiſtorical faith, or the faith of aſſent, is ſaving. Hence the greateſt profligate that barely aſſents to this, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, has ſaving faith— O monſtrous! If you ſet under ſuch a miniſtry, I pity you, and the poor people there. The conſent of the will is eſſential to a ſaving faith; how can I be ſaid truly to believe in Chriſt, except I receive him with my whole heart, and moſt cheerfully conſent that Chriſt with all his benefits ſhall be mine, and I with all the powers of my
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016276_0026_0F9BD1DE2F768728"/>
ſoul, will be his, and for him? This faith will work by love and purify the heart; and any thing ſhort of this is but a dead faith: <hi>To them that believe Chriſt is precious,</hi> but to thouſands that give their aſſent to the Bible as true, he is not precious: 'They ſee neither form nor comlineſs in him, why they ſhould deſire him:' <hi>But to as many as receive him, to them he gives power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſons of God, even to as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his name,</hi> John i. 12. And have not theſe the faith of conſent think you? He adds, "the life of faith is works." I anſwer, no; good works, or holineſs, are the neceſſary effects of a ſaving faith; but Chriſt is the life of faith, hence he is called the <hi>believer's life.</hi> He is the grand object of faith; hence, ſays he, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is the immediate author of faith; <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, and though faith comes by hearing, yet barely hearing or attending on the means, does not produce faith, this is the ſpecial and immediate work of the ſpirit of God upon the ſoul, hence we read of Lydia, "whoſe heart the Lord," not men nor means, "opened." Notwithſtanding it is the duty of all to attend upon the means,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016276_0027_0F9BD1E0333BC0D0"/>
for in this way God ordinarily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates this ſpecial grace: In the diſpoſals of ſaving faith he acts as ſovereign, he gives it to whom he will and is under no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but his more good pleaſure to beſtow it upon any. The faith of believers is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially different from that of devils in this—"They have an apprehenſion, or ſenſe, of the ſupreme <hi>holy beauty</hi> and <hi>comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of divine things, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in their own nature.

            <p>THE Council was opened by the Moderator with prayer. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee from the church in New-Braintree waited upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, informing them, that ſome perſon had matters of grievance, which they were deſirous of laying before the council. It was reſolved to give them an hearing forthwith. The aggrieved accordingly appeared, and exhibited a paper, in which they, in general, repreſented Mr. <hi>Daniel Foſter,</hi> Paſtor elect of New-Braintree, as holding ſome principles in his public diſcourſes, and private converſation, which are not agreeable to truth, and of a dangerous tendency. The complainants having no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular articles of charge, committed to writing, were directed by the Council to withdraw, and commit to writing, what were particular matters of grievance; which having done, they laid the paper before the council, and ſerved Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> with a copy. The Council then adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Wedneſday morning 7 o'clock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, October</hi> 28. The council met according to adjournment. The aggrieved and Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> then appeared before the Council. The articles of grievance were then read, and Mr. <hi>Foſter's</hi> anſwer to them; and both parties were fully heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Articles of Grievance, were as follows,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. None will ever be excluded happineſs, but thoſe that exclude themſelves as moral agents, infants included, the reaſon he gave, becauſe where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound; and it was not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to think, that God would make a world, and then let the Devil run away with it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In denying election, and in ſaying that Chriſt died as much for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das as for St. Paul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no enmity in man naturally againſt God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Original ſin is not damning.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:016276_0029_0F9BD1E208CA2AF8"/>5. That an unrenerate man could act a divine faith, or put forth a ſaving act as well as the regenerate.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In a funeral diſcourſe, Mr. Foſter ſaid, it would not be aſked in the great day how men believed, but how they obeyed.</p>
            <p>The following is Mr. FOSTER'S REPLY to the allegations brought againſt him.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>Laſt evening, 10 o'clock, I was waited upon with a copy of what a number of perſons are pleaſed to call maſters of grievance, ſigned Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Matthews.</p>
                  <p>I am very ſorry thoſe aggrieved had not bethought themſelves in time, and favoured me with a copy of their allegations before the <hi>punctum temporis,</hi> of my being called upon to appear before this venerable body to anſwer for myſelf, touching thoſe things whereof they accuſe me. A proper time to prepare for his own defence, being ever granted the vileſt malefactors: But though treated with ſuch neglect and contempt, yet for the intereſt of truth, and being willing to grant my opponents a hearing, though in point of honour and even good manners, they are not entitled to ſuch a favour, I will proceed to obſerve ſomething upon the matters exhibited againſt me.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is alledged that I ſaid in a diſcourſe from Gen. 3, and 9. as aſſerted in the firſt article of charge.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to all which, I appeal to my notes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They alledge that I deny election, and ſaid that Chriſt died as much for Judas as for St. Paul. In a reſtrained ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They alledge that I ſaid from the goſpel feaſt, there is no enmity in man againſt God. This I fully deny as aſſerted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſay that in private I ſaid, original ſin was not damning. This I own as my ſentiment, though I do not recollect I ever ſaid ſo.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, they charge me with ſaying as in the 5th article. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which, I ſuppoſe he may act faith with divine aſſiſtance, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the greateſt ſaint; neither can act without it.—If theſe brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies are not ſatisfactory I crave the liberty of enlargement, before the venerable Council, as I have here no proper time to reply in a formal manner.</p>

            <p>The Council being by themſelves, then received from Mr. FOSTER a CONFESSION of his FAITH, which was read, and accepted as orthodox. Which was as follows, viz.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p n="1">1. I believe there is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I believe that when God made man, he gave him a law, holy, juſt and good, and that man had full power to keep that law; that man by ſin broke the divine law, fell under the wrath of God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God did not leave man to periſh in this ſtate of ſin, but was ſelf-moved to provide a ſaviour, his own eternal ſon.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. That God has appointed a day in which he will judge the world by Jeſus Chriſt according to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That all who in time comply with the goſpel, ſhall in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be acquitted and rewarded with eternal life.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That the ſcriptures of the old and new Teſtament are the word of God, a perfect rule of faith and life.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I believe a Trinity in the God-head as the ſcriptures teach.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I believe that God does fore-know all things that do in time come to paſs.</p>
                  <p n="10">10.

            <p>The Council then proceeded to conſider by themſelves, the articles of charge, article by article.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt article of charge, it was <hi>voted,</hi> that it ought not to be any bar in the way of the Council's proceeding to ordination.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond article Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> ſaid, that he never did in the moſt remote ſenſe, deny election; and in the confeſſion of faith, exhibited before the Council, he owns expreſsly the doctrine of election. Mr. <hi>Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> explained himſelf, and mentioned what he meant, by "Chriſt dying as much for Judas as for St. Paul." He ſaid Chriſt by his death, put all men into a ſalvable ſtate, ſo that the offers of ſalvation were with ſincerity made to Judas, as well as to Paul and others, and that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Judas was not ſaved as well as others, was, that he wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chriſt, and would not come to him that he might have life.<note n="‡" place="bottom">I rather conceive Judas believed not, becauſe he was not one of Chriſt's ſheep. See <hi>John. x. 26,</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Voted,</hi> that this article as explained, is no juſt bar in the way of the Council going on to ordain Mr. <hi>Foſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the third article, viz. That "there is no enmity in man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally againſt God." Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> fully denied this as aſſerted; and then proceeded to ſay, "That the natural man had framed in his mind an unjuſt repreſentation of the moral character of God, and being conſcious
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016276_0031_0F9BD1E522EA2FC8"/>
he had broke God's law, and that juſtice was armed againſt him, and was bound to puniſh him, he therefore hated God; but that his enmity againſt God was not pointed againſt his true or whole character, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his character as <hi>law-giver</hi> and <hi>judge</hi>; and that the holy ſpirit of God, in regeneration, removes from the mind theſe falſe apprehenſions of God's character, by which means the ſinner is brought to love God."<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot but look upon this as a ſh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> divinity, and if no bar to ordination, really I dont know what might be termed one.</note> 
               <hi>Voted,</hi> That this is no bar in the way of proceeding to ordination.</p>
            <p>As to the fourth article, in which Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> is charged with ſaying in private, that "original ſin is not damning." Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> allowed that all ſin, in its own nature is damning, and that the reaſon why original ſin is not damning, is becauſe of the mediation of Chriſt and an intereſt therein, and that men are not delivered from the condemnation of ſin, whether original or actual, till they are ſavingly intereſted in Chriſt. <hi>Voted,</hi> that this article of charge as explained by Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> is not only no bar againſt his ordination, but ſound divinity.</p>
            <p>As to the fifth article, in which the paſtor elect is charged with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome performance, that an unregenerate man can act a divine faith, or put forth a ſaving act, as well as the regenerate: He anſwers, "I ſuppoſe he may act faith, equally with the greateſt ſaint; and that neither can act it without." He adds, "That no one ever acted faith, previous to ſome real, ſpiritual change: That his deſign in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance referred to, is no more than this, that we have an entire depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon God, and that we are not ſufficient of ourſelves to do any thing ſpiritually good, without divine aſſiſtance." <hi>Voted,</hi> that this fifth article is no bar againſt proceeding to ordination.</p>
            <p>As to the laſt article, in which the paſtor elect is charged with ſaying, in the funeral ſermon of Madam <hi>Ruggles</hi> deceaſed, "That it would not be aſked in the great day, how we believed, but how we obeyed." Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> objected againſt the legality of the charge, as he had not been ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a copy of it: However, upon its being moved that on the whole, it might be beſt, he conſented to ſay ſomething to it. He granted readily, "That the righteouſneſs and merits of Chriſt, was the ſole ground of a ſinner's juſtification: And that where good men are ſaid to be juſtified in the great day by their works, ſuch works had faith in Chriſt as their principle." <hi>Voted,</hi> That the explanation above is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the Council.</p>
            <p>The council then proceeded, to examine the paſtor elect, as to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents upon the moſt important points of religion, and the motives that influenced him to undertake the miniſtry; and they voted their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction upon theſe heads.</p>
            <p>It was then voted by the council, that the way is clear to proceed to the ordination of the paſtor elect. The following miniſters were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the enſuing ſervices, viz. Rev. <hi>Dan Foſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
