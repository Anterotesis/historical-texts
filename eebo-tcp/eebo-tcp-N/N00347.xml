            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I<hi>T may be thought a thing superfluous and altogether needless to trouble the Age with any thing of this nature, after so many excellent Treatises have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited on this Subject: nor am I so much a stranger to my self, as to think that any thing of mine can make an addition of light thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have only this to say, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self is of such moment to be known by all Christians, that it must needs be the duty of such Ministers as would approve themselves to be Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to be much in asserting and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb facs="unknown:000423_0003_0FA5AA1A37EEE8A0"/>
it to their Auditories, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to establish them in the knowledg and belief of it: which I having accordingly endeavoured in the following Sermons, it found that acceptance in the Preaching, that I was desired to let it come abroad: and considering that the smalness of the Book might invite some to read it, that would not allow themselves time to peruse larger tracts on the Subject; or to be at the expense to purchase them: as also that the divers ways of handling the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is found to be of profit, by reason of the various inclinations of men to entertain things, I was the rather willing to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I knew not but this also might possibly be of some service; especially, since in it I made it my endeavour to avoid all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy or dispute, and laboured with all plainness to suite expressions to common capacities. I hoped it might on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count yield some advantage to more unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christians, to whose perusal I do more especially recommend it. This I am fully perswaded of, that a right conception of the Doctrine of Justification, is of as great
<pb facs="unknown:000423_0004_0FA5AA1B0DD0BE40"/>
necessity to the making one a sound and stable Christian as any one thing in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: and if this small piece may any way be serviceable to the faith of any, I shall not think my labour in vain; which that it may, I commend it to his grace on whom all good success depends;</hi>

            <p>THe Justification of a Sinner before God, is (as one great mystery of the Gospel, and Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Angels; so) that after which every one of the posterity of fallen men hath great reason to be earnestly inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive; it being the foundation of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent peace with God, and the ground of our appearing before him with joy in the great day of Accounts. How much <hi>Pauls</hi> heart and thoughts were taken up with this solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, the Text and Context will make to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000423_0006_0FA5AA1C95317DC8"/>
appear; for having told us how highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged he was, <hi>verse</hi> 4, 5, 6. and how willingly he parted with those priviledges, <hi>verse</hi> 7. yea, and how resolutely he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to despise every thing of his own, <hi>vers:</hi> 8. <hi>beginning:</hi> he proceeds to render the reason why he so did; and that is drawn up in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars, and all relating unto Christ: <hi>q. d.</hi> I do ask this for Christs sake: there are therefore three ends here specified.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To know Christ,</hi> vers. 8. which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he declares to be a very <hi>excellent thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>be entituled to Christ, to win him,</hi> to get him for his own, <hi>verse</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To be found in him,</hi> Text: <hi>q. d.</hi> that my relation to him may be real; that there hath been a certain and unquestionable implanting of me into Christ; not only such as will give me the denomination of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian among men, but that will prove me to be one of his in the day of judgment. And to let us see that it is no insignificant or mean design that he is so intent upon, he gives us an account of the advantage that he promised to himself hereby, or what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits he expected to receive, as the fruits
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000423_0007_0FA5AA1D5E0D1998"/>
of this interest in Christ, and these are three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Justification by Faith in him,</hi> Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Communion with him,</hi> verse 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A Glorious Resurrection in the last day,</hi> verse 11.</p>
            <p>The first of these is that which is to be the subject of the ensuing discourse.</p>
            <p>In the words of the Text then, we have presented to us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. An expression of <hi>Pauls</hi> great aim, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
               <hi>to be found in Christ;</hi> and this should be the reach of every one that would be a Christian indeed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As an Exposition of what he means by this option of his, so a reason given of this desire, in the sequel of the verse: It is, <hi>q. d. By being found in Christ.</hi> I intend being interested in his Righteousness; or the reason why I would be upon tryal found united to Christ, is, that I may have his Righteousness reckoned to me as mine own; that I may be acquitted and justified in the great day upon his account. The words
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000423_0008_0FA5AA1E441D6FB0"/>
therefore clearly held out unto us, the whole substance of the great point of Justification, or the way wherein a sinner comes to be Justified before God, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In general, he must be <hi>found in Christ:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. More specially or explicitly:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He must have a <hi>Righteousness</hi> for the matter of his <hi>Justification;</hi> as appears in the setting of an affirmative against the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: <hi>not having mine own, but, &amp;c.</hi> one is denied or removed to make way for the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Righteousness which he is thus sollicitously reaching after, is expressed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, <hi>not mine own Righteousness, which is of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Affirmatively, <hi>but that, &amp;c. i. e. The Righteousness of Christ,</hi> whose Righteousness is to be looked upon as the <hi>Mevitorious</hi> and <hi>Matertal Cause</hi> of our <hi>Jaustification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Author of this Righteousness is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000423_0009_0FA5AA1FF0D69428"/>
here declared, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>God, the Righteousness which is of God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The instrument of our Justification by this Righteousness is declared; and that is <hi>Faith, which is of God by Faith,</hi> and the object of this Faith is also signified, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Christ, through the Faith of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his <hi>own Righteousness of the Law, Paul</hi> intends his <hi>Personal Righteousness,</hi> performed by his own endeavours, and accommodated to the tenour of the Covenant of Works. By <hi>the Righteousness which is of God,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends both that which God hath devised and procured for us, and confers upon us freely, and that also which was wrought by a Divine Person, even the Eternal Son of the Eternal Father: <hi>By the Faith of Christ,</hi> he intends not the Faith which Jesus Christ exerted, or his personal and inherent Faith, but the Faith which both hath the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ for its object, and also flows from or is wrought by Christ, as the efficient of it in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>What further explication the words may
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000423_0010_0FA5AA20371B0A58"/>
require, will be taken notice of in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the Subject.</p>
            <p>I shall not take up all that might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the words, but endeavour to pick up something out of them, which may lead us to that which I intend, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> a little enquiry into the great article of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Hence,</p>
            <q>
               <p>DOCTRINE,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Justification of a Sinner before God, flows not from his own legal</hi> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>but from the</hi> Righteousness of <hi>Christ,</hi> freely <hi>impated</hi> by <hi>God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>That <hi>Paul</hi> is here speaking of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is very plain and evident; for he fully describes to us the quality of that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which he would appear in before Gods Tribunal; and no other reason can be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred why he should be so careful about his Righteousness then; but upon the account of his standing justified, and escaping of <hi>Condemnation;</hi> nay, though he names not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000423_0011_0FA5AA20F46F66A0"/>
the word, yet his terms are the very descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justification by him else where,</p>
            <p>In the opening of this great Truth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may be made into these things:</p>

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000423_0013_0FA5AA261992E000"/>
of the allusion, and comparing it by these several steps that are taken in this process in order to such an issue. Here then these things may be observed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Justification presupposeth a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Tryal.</hi> The Apostle is here referring to the day of Judgment, and tells us that he would then be found in Christ, when he comes upon his last Tryal, that so he may be able to stand it out, and find an absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Gods Tribunal. If there were no Judgment wherein men are to appear, and give up their accounts, there would be no need of their Justification: but <hi>Paul</hi> lives in expectation of such a thing, and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so given us to understand that all men have as much reason to expect it as he, it being a truth of which there is not the least ground to make any doubt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>it is appointed for men once to die, and after that the Judgment:</hi> Now if men must be judged, they must then first be tryed, how else shall a Righteous Judgment proceed?</p>
            <p n="2">2 That in this Tryal <hi>there is a question sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:</hi> and this question must be, whether the man whocomes upon his Tryal, be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000423_0014_0FA5AA2884C44E70"/>
of the breach of the Law by which he is to be tryed, or no. For all judgments must have a relation to some Law, which is to be the Rule of Tryal, and according unto which the man must be found guilty or not guilty. In order to such a process, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that there be a <hi>Case</hi> made, and this <hi>Case</hi> referred to, or examined and compared by the Law, and thus there must be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count taken of the person, and a distinct en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be made into all such matters as may be alledged either for or against him, hence that, 1 Pet. 4. 5. <hi>Who shall give account to him that is ready to judg both the quick and the dead.</hi> Giving an account, implies an examination of a case; and the question can be no other than this, <hi>Whether the man be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of a breach of Law,</hi> whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> have any such hold of him as to condemn him; or any thing wherein he is guilty to lay to his Charge; or whether he stands clear of it, and it hath nothing whereof to accuse him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Justification is properly the <hi>act of the Judge of the Court.</hi> The mans clearing must proceed according to his Sentence, and none can do it authentically but he. It will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000423_0015_0FA5AA2A2884C1C8"/>
his Cause pleaded, to declare themselves for him, and to say that it is good, innocent and faultless; all this cannot justify him, but his case is still depending until the Judg himself speaks, and his Sentence only determines it. Justification is an act of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Pilate</hi> speaks in the quality of a Judg, John 19. 10. <hi>Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</hi> God only can justify a Sinner, for he is the mouth of his own Law, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the dispensation of it to himself, and to his Son (who is also God) who acts by Commission from his Father, <hi>all Judgment therefore is given to Jesus Christ,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of it remains with him, John 5. 22 <hi>The Father hath committed all Judgment to the Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The proper <hi>essence of Justification</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Absolution of the person from guilt.</hi> Justification in this respect properly stands in opposition to Condemnation, which is the detaining of a person under guilt, and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that guilt upon him, hence we have the opposition express, Prov. 17: 15: <hi>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000423_0016_0FA5AA2AC7FFAB20"/>
the Just:</hi> Now guilt is properly an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation binding a person over to suffer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for some Transgression which he is fallen under; Condemnation is a passing of a Sentence formally upon such an one, adjudging of him so to suffer: and there is only this difference between these two, guilt proceeds immediately from the Law, and is the Sentence of that; Condemnation is the Sentence of the Judge, and proceeds from him, as one that hath the power in his hand of putting the Law in execution. Hence, Justification in reference to this, is the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of any such obligation, or the Judges free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the person under Tryal, from the Law, a delivering him out of its hands, a removal of condemnation from him, so Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is therefore no more condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to those that are in Christ;</hi> it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the person not guilty; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he sets the person out of danger of being hurt by the Law, and that by an <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> declaration, Signifying that upon tryal and through examination of the case, the Law hath nothing against him who hath <hi>done nothing worthy of death or bonds:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The pronouncing of him Righteous:</hi> I therefore name this as a distinct part of jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000423_0017_0FA5AA2B70C32398"/>
from the other, because, though it doth contain that under it, (for if I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare such an one to be righteous, I do neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily and by consequence affirm him not to be guilty, because righteousness and guilt are inconsistent) yet there is here somthing more in it; for there is not only a negative Righteousness consisting in innocency, (which in some cases is enough to free a man from condemnation among men) but there is also a positive Righteousness requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Law of God, and it was the condition of a glorious reward; and this is a part of our Evangelical Justification, or it is contained in the Sentence of the Judge, that we have this positive Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; not only that the man is not worthy of condemnation, because he hath not broken the Law, but that he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of life, because he hath kept it, see Rev. 3. 4. <hi>They shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> And though the former of these doth most properly answer the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the word, yet because they are both inseparable each from the other, and also each of them is imputative, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suitably looked upon as the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of our Justification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000423_0018_0FA5AA2C54EB1A40"/>
How much this manifestly differs from Sanctification, (though by some they are confounded) might largly be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but it is needless here to insist, only in brief, the one is imputed, the other is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; the Righteousness of the one is in Christ subjectively, of the other in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; the one is an act, the other is a work; the one a judicial act, the other a Phisical work, the one works a Relative, the other a substantial change; the one is perfect at once, the other gains its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by degrees; the one dischargeth a man from guilt, the other frees him from polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the one declares him righteous, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes him holy; and thus briefly for the thing which we are enquiring after, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz</hi>
               </abbr> Justification, according to the right notion of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It follows to make it to appear, <hi>that it is impossible that our Justification should flow from our legal Righteousness:</hi> and in order to the making out of this assertion, we may for an introduction, first enquire what is meant by our Righteousness of the Law, and then what it is for our Justification to flow from this Righteousness; And here,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:000423_0019_0FA5AA2D18092AF0"/>
1. Our own Righteousness of the Law intends <hi>anything that is done by us, what her it spring from a principle of common Morality, or be performed by the vertue of special inherent sanctifying grace:</hi> Paul in this Text hath an eye unto both these, for we have him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the former in <hi>vers.</hi> 7. and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of the latter, in ver. 8. whatsoev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er personal act or work of Obedience we do, whether in our state of unregeneracy or of Regeneration, as it is a work, and bears a respect unto the Law of God, is called our Righteousness, in opposition to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For our Justification to flow from this, is as much as <hi>that this should be the matter of our Justification;</hi> or that for, and in respect of which the Judge is to pass a Sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us according to the tenour of the Law; or that this should be the ground and reason of the Sentence which he passeth upon us: for otherwise, there is no scruple to be made but that every true Believer doth sincerely desire to be found in a Righteousness which is according to the Law of God, and to be full <hi>of good works: he would be sanctified throughout,</hi> and perfectly conformed to Gods
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000423_0020_0FA5AA2DB4AA6430"/>
holy will, he makes it his study every day to live unto God, and desires to be found so doing when he shall be summoned to appear before his judge: but he hath no mind to be found in it as his trust his reliance, that which he would be tried by, and stand or fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> according as it shall be found.</p>
            <p>Now that this cannot justifie us, or be the matter of our justification; or that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteousness and good works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it, will not merit and procure this for us, is the thing to be evidenced and will appear if we lay together these conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That God in the Justification of a Sinner acts the part of a Judge, and Justifies the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner judicially, or as a righteous judge, i. e.</hi> he doth it in the way of a process, and upon tryal, and according unto equity: He doth not act the part of a Father in this case who may connive at, pity and overlook faults and weaknesses in his Child, but of a judge that takes the Law for his Rule, and <hi>cloaths himself with Righteousness as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Thus is the Relation which God stands in unto man according to the tenour of the first Covenant, and the respect which
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000423_0021_0FA5AA2E843B7F00"/>
condition bears unto it; for under that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant every sinner stands until he becomes a believer, and from which [believing] he must be delivered by this act of justification, and that in such a way as the Law may not be violated, or any injury be offered to it; but the sinner must be fairly discharged from it.</p>
            <p>Now in a Judge it is requisite.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That be he of a discerning eye;</hi> That so he may be able to see into the whole case, to state it right, and to understand the true and full sense of the Law which referrs to it, and to compare the matter of fact with the mind of the Law, that so he may not miss it in his final determination; for the justice or equity of the conclusion hath alwayes an inseparable dependance upon the premises; and such God is declared to be, <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>His eyes behold, his eye lids try the Children of men:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he be impartial in the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> That he do not willingly, purposely, or negligently overlook any thing that is of the least moment in the case, but search into all matters to the very bottom: that he be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or blinded and so induced to connive or wink at any action, or let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> any evidence
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000423_0022_0FA5AA31D3C4FD48"/>
for favour or affection; but laying aside all undue favour or respect of persons, to keep to, and throughly survey the case, and lay it open in all its true colours, and cease not till he comes to the full knowledg of it: thus <hi>Job</hi> faith he did when he was a Judge, <hi>Job</hi> 29.16. <hi>The cause which I knew not I Searched out,</hi> and this the Apostle ascribes to, or asserts concerning God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>for there is no respect of persons with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That he be just and righteous in passing the sentence, after he hath taken an account of the whole case:</hi> That he condemn not the innocent, nor justifie the wicked; <hi>Solomon</hi> acquaints us that both of these are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. and if he hates these things in others, we may be sure that he will not do them himself; nor is he indeed worthy to be acknowledged a Judge, that doth not make it his business in matters of judgment to administer impartial Justice, hence that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Shall not the Judg of all the Earth do right?</hi> and the conclusion that follows from hence is, that in a legal Justification, the person justified must be without fault; or he must be first justified by the Law, before he can be so by the Judge: all this therefore is requisite to the Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000423_0023_0FA5AA332B8094D8"/>
of a Sinner according to the Law of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, that if a man be justified by his own righteousness, there must necessarily be these two qualifications found in it, <abbr>

               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the actions and works themselves by which he is judged be found perfect:</hi> not only to have some conformity to the Law, that will not be sufficient, but they must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and fully quadrate therewithal: they must be throughly righteous, and they must not be chargeable with any defect, they must not in the least point fall short; but being laid by the rule of trial, they must answer it in all its dimensions without any the least imperfection, for the Law will not lose one tittle of its own; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 18. <hi>One jot or tittle of the Law shall not pass till all be fulfilled.</hi> that is accusation enough against any for God to have to say to us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. <hi>I have not found thy works perfect before God:</hi> There must therefore be discovered in them, not only the matter of a duty compleat, but also that love to God in it which is required, and that is with all the <hi>heart, and soul, and strength and might;</hi> and the least degree wanting in it of this, will bring it under a censure, and make it, when weighed in the ballance, be found too light.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000423_0024_0FA5AA33BB118178"/>
2. <hi>That the person thus tried, be not found guilty of transgression in any other points of the Law; or at least that full satisfaction hath been made by him for every such default:</hi> There must be no Debts standing out, no arrearages unpaid: for upon the presumption that there be many perfectly good deeds done, yet if there be other deeds that have been faults, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> faulty, the Law will not bate them: if a man hath kept the Law in every other point but one, and that one be alledged against him he cannot be justified; for if he have no persisted in all, it declares him to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Cursed is every one that continue not in all things written in the book of the Law to do them:</hi> Hence we have that plain asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2. 10. <hi>Who soever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offence in one point, is guilty of all:</hi> and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That Justification is properly one entire and perfect act, and therefore must needs flow from an entire and perfect principle.</hi> My meaning is, that it must proceed from the whole case as it is taken together, and not separately Justification doth not divide, and say thus far the man is righteous, only herein he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

state of the case together, and in one single sentence it saith, either that the man is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, or that he is unrighteous. It is not to be denied that in the sentence past for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, there is respect had to the offence, and according as it is aggravated, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the doom is more moderate or more severe, so that there are different degrees of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but as to the mans state, upon the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance taken of the whole, he is alwayes either acquitted or condemned; if acquitted he is throughly absolved from the Law, if condemned, the Law takes hold of him: Here then it is to be observed as a necessary conclusion, <hi>that Justification requires the whole case to be good, whereas unto Condemnation, one Article proved against him is sufficient,</hi> as <hi>Jam</hi> 2. 10. forecited; and the reason is, because Justification is of the person who exposeth himself to the Law by one delinquency.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence it will appear that mens inherent Righteousness; or legal, and the exercise of it, cannot justifie them,</hi> if we shall consider,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Let me here premise this, That by meriting or deserving, I intend a Covenant <hi>M</hi>erit, or a coming up to the terms of the Covenant, according to which men are to be justified or condemned; that which fully satisfies the demands of the Law of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, upon our account, doth properly Merit for us; for a <hi>Covenant merit is nothing else but a fulfilling of these Covenant Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon which the promises of it depend:</hi> Now every serious soul would willingly be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this account; he would be informed in this point, how the righteousness of one can answer for another who hath none of his own; yea, how one mans Righteousness can deserve Justification for a great many,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000423_0031_0FA5AA3E9E378110"/>
who are themselves sinners: and there can be no rational settlement of the soul in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and comfort, without some good satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this point: And let me answer this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> It doth not proceed from the Righteousness of Christ barely consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Obedience of a meer man to the Moral Law: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If Chirsts had been a meer man, or onely an humane person, he had owed all his active Obedience to the Law for himself, or upon his own account.</hi> The law of nature obliged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very meer Son of <hi>Adam</hi> to full, perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant obedience to all the commands of God and when he had done all, he had done but his duty, and could have challenged the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant reward for none but himself: It is but a just debt which every man ows to God, to love him with all his heart, <hi>S</hi>oul, <hi>strength and might, and his neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Mat.</hi> 22, 37, 38. and if Christs humane nature had been a person by it self, this had been his case, he would have had so much work to do upon his own score, that he would have had no room to have done any thing for any else besides himself.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:000423_0032_0FA5AA3F00F894B8"/>
2. <hi>Neither could the passive obedience of a meer man be of virtue sufficient to satisfie for the offences of many.</hi> The eternity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners sufferings is a full proof for this, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death is not a distinct sort of death contained in the curse, but only an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal continuane of the other; for if Justice could take satisfaction of a meer creature in any measure of time, there would be good ground of hope that the damned might a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> length have a Jayl. Delivery; for Justice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res no more then satisfaction, though it will have that to the utmost, <hi>Luke</hi> 12 <hi>ult.</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot take it in measure upon a finite creature, it is necessarily compensated by the duration; so that if Christ had been a meer man, though he should have <hi>died for our offences,</hi> yet he could never have <hi>risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for our Justification,</hi> but must have been detained an eternal Prisoner, and never have crost the accounts, or taken out the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Positively,</hi> there are three things which go in to make up the merit of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness for sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Righteousness it self which he hath performed in Obedience to the Law.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The Office which this person sustained in this performance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Righteousness it self which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for our Justification, must be that which, fully and in all the parts of it answers the terms of the Covenant which was between God and man at the first.</hi> The Law of that Covenant was the rule of Justice and Righteousness between these two parties and he that will either do or suffer u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Humane Nature which was assumed by the Son of God, made him one answerable to the Law.</hi> The Covenant was made with man, the Obedience due to it was required of man; and therefore it must be a man that must do and die; no other kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no not an Angel, would have sufficed or answered the Covenant, the Son of God

therefore became a man, assumed a true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, and a true reasonable soul, was the Son of <hi>David; the word was made flesh, John</hi> 1. 14. and by this way he was fitted to be under the Law, and responsible to it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our account, and therefore the Apostle puts them together as things inseparable. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>made of a woman, made under the Law</hi> for as if he had been a meer humane person he could not have sustained the place of a surety for us, so except he had taken out humane nature, he could not have done the work of a surety upon our account <hi>Paul</hi> therefore puts a great deal of weight up on this consideration, Heb 2. 16. <hi>for verily be took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham:</hi> we must therefore study the Incarnation of Christ if we would be clear in the nature of his merits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Divine Nature which assumed the Humane into his Person, put an infinite vertue, and value into his Obedience;</hi> for the humane nature losing its Personality in the person of the Son of God, hereupon all the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which he performed is accounted (and that properly) <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi> and that is one reason why it is so called in our Text, and 2 Cor 5. 21. it is not of God only

be ordaned it, nor yet because he did accept it of his hands, but mainly because the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that did it was God: upon this score al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is his blood called <hi>the blood of God,</hi> Acts 20. 28. <hi>The Church of God which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his own blood,</hi> and hereby it came to pass that the Obedience of Christ was of greater worth by far, than the Obedience of all the world could have been, because he was a Divine Person that did it: and from hence it came to pass that there was enough in it to merit for a great many, even a whole world, <hi>the blood of Redemption</hi> is therefore called <hi>precious blood,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18. and there we have found a valuable price to merit, that which hath in it enough to answer for the Justification of Sinners, but still this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the former yet falls short of the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al meriting of it, there is yet somthing more wanting, but that also is supplied by Christ, hence consider.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Office of this person, and that was Mediatorial,</hi> see it expressed in 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.</hi> It was the Office of a surety that he bare, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is so called, Heb. 7. 22. he was set up and anointed unto that very business,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000423_0038_0FA5AA45F9BFE7B0"/>
that he might reconcile God and man again, whom the sin of man had separated each from the other: So that <hi>Jesus Christ neither lived for himself, nor died for himself,</hi> but he went through both for us, and that as he was constituted a <hi>Mediator;</hi> and that is that which properly rendred his work of: Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Satisfactory and Meritorious, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would in no wise have turned to our account: So that in Christ we are not only to consider his personal fitness to be a Redeemer, and to satisfie Justice fully for us, and that he was made man, and took our nature upon him, and was compleatly furnished with all these graces in his humane nature, whereby he was carried through the work which he was engaged in: but we are also to eye his deputation or appointment to this work in the Covenant of Redemption, which past between his Father and him in the days of Eternity, and in the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Covenant we are to observe these two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What was done by God the Father in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the bringing of it about,</hi> and that was, he made a proposal of the work to him, and exhibited before him a promise of this reward on the condition of his performance of it;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000423_0039_0FA5AA4766C51450"/>
those are the words of the Father, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.13 when he shall make his soul an offering for sin, his soul shall see his seed; and they are a declaration of the terms of the Covenant: the Apostle assures us that he took not this Office upon him without a special call given him unto it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. and there was a great deal of reason for this; for fallen man was Gods Prisoner, and it was at his pleasure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would accept of an attonement for sinners at the hand of another in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. It was not a matter of meer Debt, where if the money be paid, the Creditor hath no reason but to be satisfied, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not trouble his Debtor any further; but the case was properly Criminal, man had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited himself, his life to divine Justice, and it lies in the breast of the Judge whether he will take another in exchange to dy for him, and let him go free; if he refuseth such a Ransom, and resolve that he who hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded shall in person suffer the smart of it, none can lay injustice to his charge: If therefore there had not been an agreement about this between the Father and Son, there had been no efficacy of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What was done by Jesus Christ in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it; and that was, he both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000423_0040_0FA5AA47F4B8E320"/>
the work, and went through with it:</hi> he accepted the offer and condition that was proposed to him, and did all that was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on his part for the purchasing of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 7, 8. <hi>Then I said I come, in the volume of the Book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will Oh God!</hi> Phil. 2. 7, 8. <hi>He made himself of no reputation,</hi> &amp;c. So that in this way God made himself a Debtor to Christ by a free promise, that he would justifie all such for whom he should make satisfaction, and that his righteousness should stand for their justification, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg shall my righteous Servant justifie many.</hi> And thus by this Covenant, the righteousness of Christ came to be, not only equivalent in vertue and worth, but the very actual price of the ransome of Sinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Who gave himself a ransom:</hi> and Christ not only vertually but actually, properly, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Covenant, merited the pardon of sin and life eternal for all of Gods Elect; he is therefore said to <hi>purchase them with his blood, Act.</hi> 20.28. and his Death is called a <hi>Ransom, Mat</hi> 20.28. and a <hi>Propitiation</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2 and Christ is said to be <hi>made of God unto us, our Righteousness,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.20.

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000423_0041_0FA5AA48B3CE4888"/>
the work he had done, and thereward to be enjoyed, yet he had merited by Covenant; so, much more the Lord Jesus Christ, having done and suffered that which was vertually meritorious for us, and doing this under a Covenant of Life, he must of necessity me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it for us: so that all his redeemed ones are worthy to live, in as much as he hath bought their lives for them, and fully satisfied the justice of God upon that score: and thus we have a brief account of the way in which the Righteousness of Christ merits our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

to whose charge nothing could be laid, there would need no great ado for that: his own righteousness would stand up for him, it would plead his innocence, challenge the discharge of the Law, and his active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were sufficient, for the man was never obnoxious: but it is another manner of thing when it comes to the justifying of a condemned sinner, who hath transgressed the Law, and thereby incensed and opened its mouth against him; and here is a great deal more required to prepare the way that Justice may give such a man an acquittance: and as a sinner can have no righteousness of his own personal, so there must be a manifold Righteousness in him who will obtain this favour for him.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. When another person hath done this for a man, and is accepted in which he hath done upon this account, and the man is

If another man offer himself to bear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of an Offender, and the Judg hath consented to such an exchange, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly inflicted the penalty upon him instead of the other, he now imputes this to the prime Offender, and so he is delivered from the sentence of the Law, as having thus sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied it: though in the latter case there is this difference from the former; <abbr>

               </abbr> That such a proffer to bear the punishment in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is not of it self sufficient, except the Judg shall see cause to accept of it, but if he doth, it sufficeth: and this is that which is done when God justifieth a Sinner, <abbr>

that the words <hi>counted, reckoned or imputed,</hi> are used at least ten times in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and now it may not be amiss, briefly to enquire after the way in which Christs Righteousness comes to be justly imputed to us, and reckoned as ours, unto our Justification; and this may be taken up in the consideration of these few following Conclusions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Son of God assumed our nature, not for any perfection which it added unto him, but for the redemption and salvation of Gods Elect.</hi> His own divine Person was not any whit perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or made better or more compleat and happy by this Assumption; for he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> being Redeemed; if we had not been lost, &amp; must either be recovered again, or undone the Son of God would have had no occasion for his incarnation: we stood in absolute need of it, and could not have been saved without it, and his great love to us put him upon such a thing: this business therefore
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000423_0063_0FA5AA64CB493C88"/>
was engaged in for us, <hi>Isai.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> plainly tells us what he came into the world for, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Jesus Christ came to save sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Jesus Christ to the end that he might be a Redeemer to mankind, took upon him to be a Surety for men,</hi> He is therefore called the Surety of the new and better Covenant, in which the salvation of mankind is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and laid up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 22. now the proper work belonging to a Surety as such, is to take upon him the state, and to bear the penalty which is due to the person or persons for whom he thus becomes a Surety; he is to stand in their room, and whatsoever it be that that the Law hath to lay to their charge and to doom them for, he is to stand to all the hazard of it, and undergo it; to pay their Fines, to bear their punishment in their stead, or for them <hi>i. e.</hi> in way of Exchange; for there is an Exchange that is made when a Surety comes in the room of a principal Debtor. The Lord Jesus Christ took upon him this Office, namely, to stand in the room of Gods Elect, to ly liable to the Law in all its suits and demands, and for this is he said <hi>to be made sin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21.</p>

3. <hi>God the Father accepted of this. Suretyship of Jesus Christ upon the account of his Elect:</hi> God the Father is, according to Scripture Language, looked upon as the supream Judge (not exclusively as shutting out the Son and Holy Ghost, but inclusively; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Deity is offended by sin, and every person is equally interested in the satisfaction that is to be made; but only the Word of God is wont to ascribe works par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to that person wherein his order and manner of working doth especially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) Jesus Christ God man is Judge, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ:</hi> But he is a delegated Judge his Kingdom is a Mediatory Kingdom, and he must resign it again, when the work so laid upon him shall be accomplished, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26,27. his Father put this Judgment into his hands, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>The Father judgeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of himself to become a Surety, and to look to all the consequences which will result from such a thing, and accordingly either to receive or reject him; and in such exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges persons are wont to take care at least that there shall be no disadvantage or loss arising therefrom; and the Great God saw and considered, that Justice would fit in the highest State, when it led the Son of God in triumph: That Christ should be put under the Law, and made to bear the rigour of it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Never did Justice sit in such State, or appear in such Majesty, as when it arreigned, condemned, and did execution upon the Son of God. <hi>When Gods Sword was awakened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the man that was his fellow,</hi> (so is he called by God himself, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7.) he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

God therefore volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily accepted of this; and how could he but

Christ therefore, taking upon him the person of his Elect, to answer and satisfie for them, and God receiving him in this quality, having before deputed him to it, it was as much in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000423_0067_0FA5AA6C98A05DF8"/>
the exact rigor of God's Justice, as if they themselves had done and suffered in their own persons.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Hence, the Lord Jesus, when he had gone through with, and finished the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, received a full acquittance in the name of Gods Elect.</hi> That the Son of God, after he had done and suffered, was actually acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is evident, for otherwise he had never so risen from the dead in such a glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is recorded of him. Justice, which had him its Prisoner, under the bonds of Suretyship, would never have knockt off his Bonds, and set him at liberty on any other account, but because it had received satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from him: and what satisfaction could that be, but the compleat answering of the obligation wherein he stood bound: he had made no personal forfeiture of himself by any Transgression; <hi>for he did no sin, neither was there any guile found in him:</hi> it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore satisfaction for us, according to all that which was required of us: so that his acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was in the respect that he stood Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and on that score it was our acquittance, we were discharged in it, and thus much is intended in that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>He was delivered for our offenses, and raised again for our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:000423_0068_0FA5AA6CB85900C8"/>
Intimating, that as he had never been condemned but for us, so his Justification was for us: as he had never died, if our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence had not procured it, so when he arose from the dead, he brought with him a full discharge for his people.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Hence, when God accepts any into favour, and pardons their sins, it is upon the meer account of the righteousness of Christ.</hi> It is a true and bare respect which God hath to his obedience, he fixeth his eye upon that, when he doth this, and for the sake thereof he doth it: That God seals a Pardon, and gives evidence of it to the Souls and Consciences of any of the Children of men, upon their believing, fetcheth its reason from hence, because Christ was righteous: we therefore find such an expression in the Scripture, of our being, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. <hi>Having Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and forgiveness through his blood,</hi> ver. 7.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>From the premises it naturally follows, that Christs Righteousness is made ours by imputation;</hi> or, that that very individual Righteousness of his, which he in person performed as our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the righteousness which is reckoned to be ours, so as that we are justified before God upon the account of that, and no other: and

               </abbr> that he only who could pay our debts of Active and Passive Obedience to the Law, could possibly be our Justification before God, and this there was none but Christ could do: and therefore God who justifieth, must needs as a righteous judge have a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to his Righteousness in his proceeding to justifie us: we could not obey the Law

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That it doth not take from, but encrease the greatness of the free grace of it, that the Righteousness which is imputed to us, was to Jesus Christ a costly Righteousness:</hi> the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a benefactor discover it self, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of that upon others for nothing but their accepting of it, which cost him a great summe to purchase for them, more than it would if he had only parted with that which stood him in nothing at all: The Doctrine of Christs Satisfaction for the working out of a Righteousness for us, by the which we might be justified, doth not derogate from, but greatly illustrate the Doctrine of the free grace of God: if a man Redeem a

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Because till God imputes the Righteousness of Christ unto him, the sinner is in no better a state than the rest of mankind: he is a child of wrath by nature as well as they, Eph.</hi> 2. 3. all the difference which there is made betwixt them, proceeds meerly from Gods good will and until that breaks out, there is no intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal difference between the one and the

other: It is true, God makes him holy too but yet he was as faulty in himself till God came to do this for him: if therefore God is righteous in withholding of this imputation from all the rest of mankind, that had an equal goodness in them with those that are justified, the imputation of Christs Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness unto them for their Justification must needs be free grace, for, what other reason can enter into mans thoughts to conceive, why two that are every way themselves a like, and one hath nothing in him more to engage the good will of God to him than the other, should have such a vastly different dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of Providence dispensed to them, that the one should be justified, and the other left under condemnation? if it be said that the one believes, and the other believes not, it is readily answered, that this faith was given him for his Justification.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That there are several sorts of Faith made mention of in the Scripture, is easily obvious unto such as are acquainted with it; but there is one sort only by which we are Justified; and I shall not here need to take notice of any other, nor enquire after any other, nor enquire after any other consideration of this Faith besides what is proper to it as it justifies; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it may be thus described: <hi>Justifying Faith is a particular receiving of Christ in the promise of special mercy, by a confidence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Soul upon him, for all that good
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:000423_0086_0FA5AA7F6E9B84C0"/>
which be hath purchased, and God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In clearing up of this description we may observe these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the next and immediate object of Justifying Faith is Jesus Christ.</hi> Faith that justifies closeth in with the person of Christ; not barely considered as he is the second person in the Trinity, but as he is God-man-Mediator. Justification is one piece of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ in his benefits; now our Union to him. Christ himself must be ours, if ever his Righteousness come to be ours; <hi>he is therefore called the Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Jer.</hi> 23. 6. and is said to be made <hi>Righteousness</hi> it self unto us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. which expressions refer to his person: so that when once we have gotten an interest in him, and are really entituled to him, we are then, and not till then, invested with a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which will clear us from all guilt, and declare us to be righteous; for in him it is that we are to have it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 24. <hi>In the Lord have I Righteousness and Strength,</hi> and ver. 25. <hi>In the Lord shall the seed of Israel be justified:</hi> on this account it is that <hi>Paul</hi> in our Text concludes upon this, that if he can but
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000423_0087_0FA5AA7F802A3898"/>
be found in him, he is then safe enough, as having a Righteousness to friend, which will justifie him perfectly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That which gives the soul the advantage to take hold of the person of Christ, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of special mercy in the which he is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> It is not to be denied that the whole Scripture is serviceable to the Faith of Gods Elect; and it all some way or other leads to Christ; and for this reason is the Scripture called <hi>the word of Faith:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. and it is all of it to be believed, because it is all true, and confirmed by the Testimony of God himself; it is the word of him who is the Truth; and it is all profitable, and there are various uses to which it serveth, both in the drawing of men to Christ, to believe in him, and in the building of them up in their most holy Faith, and for the direction of them how they ought to serve him in all things; see 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. But yet every portion of Scripture doth not alike nextly serve to give the sinner an advantage to lay hold upon Jesus Christ. The Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s parts, and these serve nextly to various ends and uses, though all of them contribute something to the helping forward of the glory of God in the happiness of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000423_0088_0FA5AA80E6F079B0"/>
man: There are recorded in it many histories; and these serve partly for holy example, and partly for solemn caution to men: there are moral precepts, there are sharp reproofs, there are severe threatnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of which have their particular profit and will serve, either to the preparing of a sinner for this closure with Christ by faith, or for the helping of a believer home to the heavenly Kingdom: But that which nextly and most proper gives us the advantage and encouragement to believe in Christ, is that special revelation which God hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make of him, in the which revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he gives us to understand, that as he is a compleat and all sufficient Saviour, so he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites sinners to come to and accept of him, and put their trust in him, and engageth to all such as so do, that they shall in and by him obtain the pardon of Sin, and peace with God; that if they will but take Christ on his terms, he shall be theirs: hence it is that by the promise we are said to be <hi>parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and it was upon a promise that <hi>Abraham believed, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness, Gen.</hi> 15. 5, 6. and such a promise is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary mediam for faith to come to Christ and take hold of him by. For Sin, which all
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000423_0089_0FA5AA80FAA025F0"/>
the children of men are naturally guilty of, and separated between God and man, and all mankind was for Sin under a severe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: so that they lead no hold of God at all, but were quite knockt off from any such thing: and now how shall they believe that this God will pardon them, and be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto them without some encouragement. The alone and bare consideration of Gods power to do them this kindness, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, because there is a dreadful curse stands between to dishearten them from taking hold of that; and until it be removed they may be certain that God will never be so propositions to them. It must therefore be only a word of promise that can offer a Sinner any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement at all. <hi>To believe that God will accept of and pardon us in Christ, before such time as he hath declared himself willing to do it, is not faith but frenzy:</hi> because before the word of promise did break out, there was nothing else but wrath, and a sentence of condemnation to be read or heard of for the Sinner; here therefore is the first peeps hole of hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That property of Faith whereby it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, is that it helps the soul to rely upon Christ for all the good which is laid up in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:000423_0090_0FA5AA81B855B508"/>
this reliance, trust or confidence is the proper justifying act of Faith. It is true, at there is a promise revealed to the soul, by which he comes to take hold of Christ by Faith, so there are two things necessarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required to this confidence: As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he have the understanding or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the things that are promised, and of the terms of the promise:</hi> there can be no jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Faith without this; the object must be revealed to the man, or otherwise it can not be relied upon by him; without the knowledge he cannot close in with the good of the promise, an ignorant faith is a great contradiction: <hi>Paul</hi> knows whom he hath trusted; our Saviour Christ speaking to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> tells her, <hi>John</hi> 4. 22. <hi>Ye worship ye know not what? we worship what we know:</hi> Faith is the act of a reasonable creature; now the natural motion of the will in man, is by the light of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which is to be eyes unto it, and hence Faith is said <hi>to come by hearing, Rom.</hi> 10. 17. and that there is <hi>no believing in him of whom men have not heard, ver:</hi> 14. now hearing is counted the sense of discipline, because by it the understandings of men are
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000423_0091_0FA5AA82A87ECE58"/>
wont to be informed in the notion of the things that they are told of:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That in his Judgment, he yield a credit and assent to the Truth of these things that he knows,</hi> for although an historical Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, will not amount to a justifying Faith, yet there must of necessity be such a Faith in order to the other, and without this there cannot be any of that in the man.</p>
            <p>He that doth not give credit to the truth of the promise, will never rely upon it for mercy and salvation; <hi>he that comes to God,</hi> (i. e, in Faith) <hi>must believe that he is,</hi> and <hi>that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, Heb,</hi> 12.6. It is therefore one great part of Gospel work, to enlighten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings in the knowledge of Christ, and of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great things purchased by him to be conferred upon his people, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18, 19. and if ever we come to take hold of the promise by Faith, and of Christ in it, we are to believe that God is true in all that he faith, that his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony carries its own credit with it, because it is the Word of God who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye; and that this word of promise is his word; and that there is salvation
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000423_0092_0FA5AA833A423328"/>
sufficient in Jesus Christ who is exhibited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> us in this promise, and that this salvation shall without fail be bestowed upon all such as do believe in him, according unto it: that he who hath promised is faithful, and will also perform: without a free and full assent to, &amp; credit of all this, there is no hope that a soul should be perswaded really to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self upon the word of promise.</p>
            <p>But still this is not all that is requisite, nay there may be all this, yet not a saving faith that therefore which is the proper distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing note of this faith, in that upon all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the soul is carried forth to close with, and cast it self upon Christ as he is revealed in the promise. I am not here speaking of the strength by which this is done, but only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the act it self; and to make the thing more distinct, let me propose these things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is not the promise it self, but that which is promised in it, which is the object of Justifying Faith.</hi> The promise it self is not our Justification, but it is a medium to it, or it brings something along with it, that is by it offered unto us, which is able to justifie us, and that is Christ and his Righteousness:
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000423_0093_0FA5AA841B00A4B8"/>
It therefore contains in it a revelation of that great mystery of Salvation by Jesus Christ. The promise indeed makes offer to the children of Men of a pardon of sin, and of reconciliation unto God; but this is not all, but together with such an offer made, it exhibits the way by which, and the Author by whom it is to be enjoyed, and that is no other but Jesus Christ: so that the promise in the proper notion of it, is nothing else at an instrument of bringing Jesus Christ to the Soul, and helping it to its closing in with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Jesus Christ is in the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise offered to every one in particular, that is priviledged to hear it, upon a Gospel condition.</hi> A general <hi>bears</hi> a true respect to all and every of the individuals that are contained under it; when the Gospel of Jesus Christ is Preached to a company of sinful men, and it is proclaimed to them, and in their audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>That whosoever will may came and drink of the waters of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veryone who is a thirsty may come and buy and eat,</hi> &amp;c.

I may come if I will, the invitation is made to me, why then should I neglect to accept it, or shut out my self by unbelief? such is the Gospel promise: and it is also made up on a condition, there are the terms annexed to it, there is the way declared in which the good promised may be obtained: for God in bringing Sinners home to Christ, bring them under a new Covenant Relation, and the promise that is revealed in it, is the gray encouragement of the Covenant, giving men to understand what shall be the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that shall accrue to them by putting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Faith doth not justifie us, as it hath any worth or merit of its own in it, to deserve or earn Justification for us:</hi> they do very grosly mistake themselves, who think that
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:000423_0099_0FA5AA8F388C6120"/>
Faith hath every way the same consideration in the new Covenant, which obedience or works had in the Old: It is true, it is the <hi>condition</hi> of this as obedience was the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the other: but yet there is this plain and manifest difference, that in the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God had a proper respect to the work of Obedience, as that which had a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant merit in it, or for which man was to have been justified, if he had continued in it, <hi>Rom</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Moses describeth the Righteousness, which is of the Law, that the man that doth these things shall live by them.</hi> But in the process of Gospel Justification, <hi>it is Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which stands to answer in the room of ours, and not our Faith: So that <hi>the merit of our Justification is in the object, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Christ; and not in the act of Faith:</hi> If we believe in him, he then stands to answer for us to our Judg, and all his earnings are made over to us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>believing,</hi> and placed to our account.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence it follows naturally, that Faith hath no natural or proper vertue in it self to justifie a Sinner;</hi> for that which hath <hi>in it self</hi> a real <hi>virtue</hi> to justifie, must answer the Law in all its demands, whereas <hi>Faith in it self</hi> answers to none of them: there is no such thing as a legal obedience <hi>in Faith,</hi> for <hi>it is</hi> the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:000423_0100_0FA5AA90067D50E0"/>
of <hi>Faith</hi> to fly from the Law unto Grace and therefore it never designs a personal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of the Law, but seeks a deliverance from it in and through <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and that is the <hi>priviledge</hi> of believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>ye are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> Faith fetcheth in all <hi>virtue</hi> from abroad: and in truth it justifies a man no more, than the look of a bitten <hi>Israelite</hi> upon the Brazen Serpent healed him: now it was not the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the look, but the vertue that was put into the Brazen Serpent that healed him who so looked upon it, else he might have looked long enough before he had been cured: so <hi>it is</hi> not the vertue of believing, but of <hi>Christ</hi> who <hi>is believed in,</hi> that justifies. Faith <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> a sinner, as the Womans touch of Christs Garment healed her Issue of Blood, and that was the vertue, not of the touch, but of Christ, which issued from him upon her tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him; and therefore he declares that <hi>he felt vertue to go out of him,</hi> upon that exertion of her <hi>Faith</hi> in so <hi>touching him,</hi> Luk. 8.46.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And from the premises it follows, that Faith doth not justifie as it is a work;</hi> for if it did so, then it would either have merit, or at least vertue in it to justifie, but we see that it hath neither. Faith is, in large sense
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:000423_0101_0FA5AA9190FB4658"/>
a work; it is an act of Obedience to God, it is an answering to the Gospel command; it is in it self, as it is habitually rooted in the soul, one of the graces of sanctification, and as it exerts it self in the acts of believing, it is an exercise of holiness: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Faith of all that hear the Gospel, that is <hi>his command that they believe in the name of the Son Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. but in this sense it cannot justifie: for then we must not only be justified by believing, but this priviledge must be bestowed upon us for believing; for if it answer faith as a work, then it comes as wages; but justifying Faith excludes all works, and therefore cannot it self justifie as a work; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a man is justified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law:</hi> faith is the condition of the New Covenant, and a Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its denomination from the quality of its condition, if then faith should justifie as a work, it were but a New Covenant of works, whereas it is in truth a Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Neither doth Faith justifie as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal applier of the Justification which is procured by Christ, unto us;</hi> it is not to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the highest cause of the application of the benefit to our persons: this also was to

exalt it above its place, and give it a prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence beyond its due.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Righteousness by which we are to be justified, is already wrought out and perfected</hi> and if so, then there is nothing of ours that can justifie us by addition to, or being a complement of that Righteousness: for is hath been made to appear, that it is alone, Christs Righteousness; it admits of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it, or compleating of it, it needs no eiking out, for then he should not save to the uttermost.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence there is nothing of ours that can have any hand in our Justification, but only that which is instrumental to make this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ to become actually ours: we</hi>

Now because the oringing in of a Surety to stand in the place of the man himself, is the proper Foundation on which the Gospel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is built; hence it is also a truth, that some men shall be judged by the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi> according as they are found in Christ rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and entituled to his satisfaction,

but still, the enquiry concerning such as these also will be, whether or no the Law hath been answered by them or for them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the command of it hath been perfectly fulfilled, or whether the sin that hath been committed against it, hath been satisfied for, and the due deserved punishment hath been born for it? and therefore Christ faith, that <hi>be come not to destroy the Law but fulfill it; and though Heaven and Earth shall pass, yet the law shall stand,</hi> Mat 5. 17, 18. yea when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are past as a scroll, &amp; folded up as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Word of God shall endure. There are too many that indulge themselves with a fond expectation, that there shall be some more remiss and easie rule of trial brought in at that day; because Jesus Christ is the Judg; but they wofully deceive themselves: God is of one mind, the Rule given to Man and under which he Covenanted, is a unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Rule. There is indeed a way which infinite Wisdom hath found out, and made the discovery of, whereby a sinful Man may be made able to stand the dint of that Trial, and be justified in it; and this indeed is the great glory of the Gospel, that it hath made such a discovery as this is, even a way in which mercy may be agreed with Justice, in and by Jesus Christ: but there is no way to
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:000423_0130_0FA5AAB64047CED0"/>
avoid this Trial: the Law Book is one of those Books that must and will be opened in order to that solemn Process which shall be made in the day of Accounts, and there will be no waving of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider from hence, <hi>That you must have a Righteousness, and not only so, but such an one as will fully answer the Law too, if ever you hope to be justified at that day:</hi> It is a vain thing for any men to pretend to an hope, that they shall do well enough then, and yet never concern themselves about the getting of a Righteousness that may then stand to answer for them: there are many that plead God is merciful, and they feed themselves up with fond hopes, that he will have pity upon and not reject the works of his hands, and this is all they have to comfort themselves with in the contemplation of the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoning: but this is an empty Plea; Justice is one of his Attributes as well as mercy, and he will not be merciful any farther than as he can be just too: and further, remember, it is a Court of Judgment where you must stand, and a Bar of Justice at which you must plead; and if you be not found to have a righteous cause then, all the Pleas for Mercy which you can make will be too late: for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent indeed it is a precious day of Grace, and
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:000423_0131_0FA5AAB70C8B5978"/>
in it Jesus Christ is sitting upon a Throne of Grace, and the humble prostrate confessions of true Penitents may avail for sinners, with him who now delights in mercy; and if men would be perswaded to embrace this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and improve it in making of their piece with him, it would be well for them: but when once he comes to sit upon the exalted Throne of Judgment, and shall put on righteousness for a Garment, the case will then be altered, and if you shall upon Examination be found too light, there will be no more room for repentance.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>You must be wholly broken off from, and utterly reject all trust or confidence in your own Righteousness:</hi> The Righteousness of Christ is not provided for, or applied unto <hi>righteous persons but sinners:</hi> his medicine is not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be administred to those that are sound <hi>and whole, but such as are sick of sin, Luk.</hi> 5. 31. this is not spoken, as if we were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that any of <hi>Adams</hi> children are in themselves whole and righteous, no, the contagion of sin hath fallen upon every one of the race, that is born into the world by natural generation: but it is to let us know, that there are a great many who have still a fond conceit of themselves, as vainly to think they are sound enough, righteous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, sufficiently able to do for themselves and as long as they are of this opinion, they are strangers to the righteousness of Christ: This is the great thing which the Spirit of God hath to do with poor sinners, in order to the bringing of them unto a Saviour, to empty them of their self conceitedness, and high opinions of their own abilities and worth:
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:000423_0140_0FA5AAC3F1906A60"/>
and it is a far easier thing to convince men of the error of their wickedness, and to drive them to their performance of legal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and their reformations, then (after they have taken up a course of these, and to their own apprehension much profited in them) to remove them from, and destroy their carnal confidence in them. This is the great stumbling block that lies between conviction of sin, and true Conversion: there are very few (if any) of Sinners that have been awakened with the Law, and so far wrought upon by it, as to think some thing must be done to get rid of the curse of it, but turn in here first, and try what is to be done by legal repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and endeavour to establish a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of their own, and the misery is, the greatest number of sober Professors take up and tarry here, and can be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten no farther; and so they perish at last: for the destruction of then is equally unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either by being drowned in the wide sea of prophaness, or being swallowed up in the sands of a legal Righteousness: here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for your help in this case, let me speak to three things.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>How far a man may be said to trust in his own Righteousness?</hi> This is well to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for there be many who think that they are gotten off from this; when as indeed they are not; and so they please themselves with their own deceivings. It is hardly to be thought that any who have lived all their time under the clear light of the Gospel, should be so far deluded, as wholly to deny any dependance upon the Grace of God, or to think that they can of themselves make satisfaction to a righteous Law for the sin they are guilty of: and you shall find none but if it be asked to them, will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they have some need of, and use for Christ; and this shallow acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment makes them presently to conclude in themselves, that they are not the legallists, or self confident men that are here pointed at: but you must know that if there be any self reliance in this point, if in any respect you look upon your own doings serviceable to procure you the favour of God in Christ, this lies as a block in your way. Now besides there (if there be any such) who suppose
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:000423_0142_0FA5AACB04276A60"/>
themselves of themselves able to do so as to merit eternal life; there are others also who do really lean upon their legal Righteousness for Justification; and they are such as these:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>All those that dare not come to Christ in their sins for his mercy; but they must have some reformations, and some specious duties of their own laid in, to bring with them, before they can come to him: and when they suppose themselves to have gotten something of this kind, now they can from them take heart, and by looking upon them take some confidence in their coming:</hi> This very thing manifestly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that men are not as yet fitted for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel dispensation of Grace; for that bids men to come in their unworthiness, and when they have nothing at all of theirs to commend them to God; but these must have some worthiness for which they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or else they dare not to adventure: and though men here plead for evangelical works, as those which they only design; <abbr>

<pb n="139" facs="unknown:000423_0143_0FA5AACD86F3A5D8"/>
let the enquiry be made, what is all this for? why do they not dare to come to Christ in the present state, but must wait for these dispositions? why thus it is, they are afraid that Christ will not accept of them, such as they are, but if they were thus of so, could but find in themselves these desired frames, then they should have encouraging hopes, that he would bid them welcom; and here is a trusting in their own Righteousness so far as to hope that they may without Christ get something that may commend them to him for his Righteousness: and though it is certain that God in converting a sinner, doth so far make discoveries of him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to let him see his absolute need of a Saviour, else he would never believe in him for Salvation; yet these are alwayes not soul filling, but soul emptying discoveries, and till men can come plumply up to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice as the Publican, and say with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Lord be merciful to me a Sinner,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but sin in themselves, looking for all mercies to derive from his undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved favour and good will, they are not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so clear of their own, as to be ready to rely on the Righteousness of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>

3. <hi>Such as acknowledg professedly all they have to be of Grace, and yet do look upon it that they are through Grace enabled to do that themselves which stand for their Justification, at least in part:</hi> There are a great many who can speak high in the commendation of rich and free Grace; but what Grace is it that they make so much talk of? not that which hath provided us with a Righteousness in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but that which hath provided us with a Sanctification in our selves; in the exerting whereof, through the renewing of the Spirit, we are enabled to merit the favour of God: and although Christ hath made satisfaction for our sins, and born our hell for us, yet still we may earn heaven by what we do; though yet we would not rob God of the Glory of this, but pay him this honourable acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that we received it from him, (and so did <hi>Adam,</hi> his Original Righteousness with which he was to have earned his happiness) and that without him we can do nothing: but let it be made so fair and plausible as men will, and lickt up into the best shape they can put it into; still it is to trust in our own Righteousness, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Righteousness inhereet which is destructive to the way of Gospel Justification, which calls us off to a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness without us, to one that must be imputed

them &amp; gratifie their desires in every point: now all these you must get off from, if ever you would be priviledged with a right and title to the Righteousness of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For help to break this confidence, I shall only offer these two Directions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Labour and pray hard for a right discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Law of God, and he frequent in the comparing of your selves by it.</hi> The most of men have entertained carnal conceptions about the Law, and that occasions their taking up of confiding thoughts in themselves: they have not made a discovery of the exceeding great latitude of it, and that makes them to think it an easie matter to pay all observance to it: and when men are thus perswaded, they can live very well satisfied in themselves: whereas a clear beam of this light darted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Consciences, would be a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt to them, and strike them down dead: what faith <hi>Paul?</hi> Rom. 7 9. <hi>I was alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law once: but when the Commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</hi> It killed his Pride, and Self-conceitedness. The right understanding, and impartial application of the Law of God to our selves, will bring us to take up other kinds of thoughts about our selves, and about our duties, then formerly we were wont to have: it will make known
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:000423_0148_0FA5AAD141D135C0"/>
unto us the great imperfection that there is in our best, that when we have done all we are unprofitable; and the sin that cleaves to them; yea and it will convince us of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal impotency to the doing of that which is good; it will shew in the wandrings of our hearts, the deadness of our affections, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stains and spots that are upon our clearest performances; his light rightly used will shew us all, and enforce us to confess the utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of our standing a Trial before the all-seeing Judge under this shelter; because we shall have the clearest evidence, that if the Law be that according to which we must be tried, it will certainly Cast and Condemn us.</p>
               <p n="2"> 2. <hi>Be perswaded and assured, that as long as you do either for the whole, or for any fast of your Justification place your trust in your own Righteousness, Christ will never offer you his to justifie you:</hi> There is no dividing or parting of stakes in this matter: Christ is resolved, that he will either be a whole Saviour, or none at all; there shall no person or thing come in to share with him in the honour of this, but he will do the whole work, and he will have the whole glory of it: man must be utterly lost, before he will come to seek him up, he must be a bankrupt, a beggar, a
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:000423_0149_0FA5AAD22099C788"/>
prodigal that hath spent all, and hath not an husk to live upon, before he will entertain him: It is therefore one part of the work of the Spirit whom Christ sends, <hi>to convince the world of Righteousness, John</hi> 16 9 <hi>i. e.</hi> firstly of the Righteousness of the Law in all its demands and sentences, that it requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that it threatens nothing but <hi>what</hi> is according to the strictest equity, and there can be no fault found with it; and then of the only Righteousness of Jesus Christ, that is able to answer both the commands and menaces of the Law: that, that and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is fitted up to respond for man to the Law. They therefore who come to Jesus Christ must deny themselves, and abjure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing of their own, or he will none of them: so that as long as men have in their apprehension a way of their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, they are too many to be saved by him: and the truth is, to believe in Christ alone for Justification, is altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with a mans having any confidence in the flesh. If then you account it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of any moment to be found having a righteous cause at that day; and when you have examined your selves, and made proof of your own hearts and lives, and upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al found by experience, that you are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000423_0150_0FA5AAD682987978"/>
defective of a personal Righteousness to that end, you here see what it is that is incumbent on you to do, <hi>i. e.</hi> you must trample upon all your own rags, throw <hi>them</hi> off as filthy and noisom things; let them be so to you, and then think how much more they are so to God, and now come as nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Christ as ever you were born: and to the naked and destitute it is, that he makes the offers of these white Robes of his own Righteousness, which shall hide all their spots cover all their imperfections, and present them clear of all offence, so that Justice it self must needs acquit and justifie them.</p>
               <p>But you may say, <hi>how shall I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have thus utterly rejected mine own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?</hi> and if there be so vast a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon this matter, it is of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to be rightly informed in the truth of this conclusion, and this brings me to the next, <abbr>

by the review of what we have been doing, so far we confide in it: but when not only our sins serve to abuse us before God, and lay us in the dust before him, but those very duties wherein are most consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious in obeying God, do by our looking upon them, help to make us see what worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less nothings we are: when we gather up out of every one of them something <hi>to make</hi> us see how little cause there is why God should look towards us, and to wonder at his rich condescendency to accept of any thing at our hands: and this is a good token of Humiliation: Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that large contribution was made tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the building of the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 13, 14. <hi>We thank thee, and praise thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name, but who am I? and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after this sort?</hi> and the Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. <hi>we all are as an unclean thing, and our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness are as filthy rags,</hi> every prayer, every Sabbath, every Ordinance in which we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, do all help to let us see how unworthy we are of Gods favour; how full of death, and of a body of death, we are; and that there is and can be nothing in us, that can commend in any wise unto God.</p>
