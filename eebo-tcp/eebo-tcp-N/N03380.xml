            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>IT may poſſibly be deemed by ſome, a very unaccountable Procedure for ſuch a Junior, in this Publick Manner, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the World with any of my Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I confeſs, the Conſideration of my Youth (upon which account, that may be looked upon as Arrogance in Me, which wou'd be well accepted of in another, whoſe Time and Experience in the World had given him a greater Liberty) has been the greateſt Stumbling Block to my ſelf in the Way of this Publication. But I think it ought to be remembred, that where Recommending Age is wanting, the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Importance of the Subject offer'd to the Publick, is a ſufficient Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and may paſs for a tolerable <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature</hi>: Likewiſe, my Publick and Sacred Character, as a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt, may allow me, at leaſt, the Liberty
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004117_0003_1003CDD379ADD2C8"/>
of being as extenſively Uſeful as I can, of purſuing ſuch Methods as have a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Tendency to promote Mens Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But I preſume, a true Account of the Reaſons of the Publication, and my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Deſign in it, will be its beſt Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It is not only deſigned for the benefit of ſuch as I have no other Way of acceſs to, and are deſtitute of better Helps for their Inſtruction in theſe great Truths of the Goſpel, but cheifly for the Benefit of ſuch as are my ordinary Hearers: and ſure, any Miniſter may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the good of thoſe he is related to in that Capacity, in any Method conducive thereto, without a Criminal Imputation.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſes here preſented to your View, as the Title-page informs you, are Sermons which I had before preached at <hi>Middletown,</hi> a part of my preſent charge; After I had preached them, conſidering the great Weight and Importance of the Doctrines contained in them, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Neceſſity of being acquainted with

Divine Truths indeed frequently addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Human Underſtanding under a very great Diſadvantage, becauſe it is often bribed and byaſſed, either by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a perverſe Will; whence it is that diſengenuous Minds immediately ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to believe that to be falſe, which they would unwillingly have to be True: but Truth will be Truth whether we will or not; and therefore it is neceſſary that the Reader lay aſide all ſuch Corrupt Byaſſes, and bring with him a Judgment ingenuouſly diſpoſed to yield to ſufficient Evidence.</p>

How know you but ſomething has been ſpoken, at ſuch times when you had opportunity of being preſent, which the Lord might have bleſſed to your Converſion and Eternal Happineſs, had you been there, and then happy ſhould you be indeed; but alas! by your Wicked Neglect, you are like to be your own Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ruin. All the plauſible Excuſes with which you endeavour to blind your ſtupid Conſciences, are nothing but diſguiſed Shifts: You'll ſay, it's like, <hi>You can ſerve the Lord as well at home and do as much for the good of your Souls as if you went to hear the Word:</hi> But do you ſpend the Day in the Service of the Lord at Home? do you ſpend the Sabbath in a Religious and holy Manner? I appeal to your own Breaſts, if it it is not otherwiſe: I call upon your Conſciences to witneſs againſt you. You'll, perhaps, read a few Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Bible</hi> in a formal careleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and perhaps a part of ſome other Book, and this is all you do for the moſt part that looks like Religion; The reſt of the Lord's Day you ſpend, ſome part of it in ſleeping and lolling upon your Beds, much

            </p>
            <p>Now, tho' (as I hinted before) there is a ſimilitude between a Perſons being in a ſtate of Condemnation before God in this Life, and a Perſon's being condemned by a human Law, before his Trial, or Judicial Sentence from the Judge; yet there is this great Diſſimilitude; a Perſon, in the latter Caſe, may from the ſecrecy

of his Tranſgreſſion, or upon many other accounts, hope that he ſhall never be brought to Trial, or, that the Crime can't be proved againſt him, and ſo, having to do with finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, like himſelf, that he ſhall eſcape the Execution of the Law; but none of theſe relieving Apprehenſions can have any Place here. We have to do with an infinitely juſt God, who will ſee to the Execution of his <hi>Law,</hi> upon thoſe that are held under Condemnation by it. A God of eternal Truth, who will do all that he has ſpoken; an Omniſcient and All-knowing <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who ſees the moſt concealed Actions and boſom Thoughts, and regiſters all the Sinners iniquities in the <hi>Book</hi> of his infallible Remembrance. So that he may truly ſay with <hi>Job, Chap</hi> 14.16, <hi>Thou numbreſt my ſteps, doſt thou not watch over my Sins? My Tranſgreſſion is ſealed up in a Bag, and thou ſeweſt up mine Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Sum of what I have ſpoken upon this Head is, that a State of Condemnation, which all Unbelievers are in, is ſuch as God, by that Method which he has conſtituted and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed to proſecute Sin in, adjudges to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Hell</hi> for ever, which Puniſhment, the condemned Perſon (continuing in that State) can by no means eſcape, as the guilty ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may before a human Bar.</p>

This Doctrine of the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, is a Truth very clearly maintained in the holy Scriptures, how much ſo ever it is diſ-reliſhed by many in our Day, who are unwilling to ſubmit to ſuch a humbling Conſideration. Through a great part of the 5th Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Apoſtle very evidently maintains it. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. he tells us, <hi>That by One Man ſin entred into the World, and Death by ſin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men; for that all have ſinned.</hi> The meaning of which Paſſage, I think, is plainly this, That by the Tranſgreſſion of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin was imputed to the whole World of his Poſterity; by which Imputation of Sin and Guilt, as they became ſubject to all other Miſeries, ſo particularly to Death; and hence it is, that all men Dye, becauſe they are looked upon as Sinners, by virtue of that Tranſgreſſion. The Reaſon which the Apoſtle aſſigns why Perſons Dye, is becauſe they have ſinned; but Experience abundantly witneſſes, that many dye before they come to a capacity of ſinning actually, and therefore he muſt mean Sinners by Imputation, and not by actual

Imitation. To the ſame purpoſe he tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>That in</hi> Adam <hi>all Dye.</hi> And in the 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> He expreſſes it very fully, <hi>by the Offence of One, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 19.

            <p>Thus you ſee, this Doctrine of Original Guilt is no Human Invention, but is learned from the Oracles of <hi>God.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. I would further add, That the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin to his Poſterity is evident from the Effects of it upon them; of which theſe two are obvious, to every one, <hi>viz.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death, and the moral Corruption of Human Nature. <hi>By Sin Death entered into the World,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> The World had been a ſtranger to Death had it not been for ſin; and therefore, we find it entailed upon Man after the Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3, 19. <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt ſhalt thou Return.</hi> The Reaſon why Death paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon all, is <hi>because all have ſinned, Rom</hi> 5, 12. and we ſee Death, with a numerous train of painful Diſeaſes, paſſes upon multitudes that have never ſinned actually, or, (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> phraſes it, <hi>v.</hi> 15.) <hi>after the ſimilitude of Adams Tranſgreſſion</hi>; and therefore, it muſt be becauſe of their concern in his Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>No leſs certainly is our Original Depravity a Judicial Effect of the Sin of our firſt Parent. That Mankind univerſally are averſe to Holineſs, and prone to Sin by nature, is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004117_0024_1003CE6A9F8F8378"/>
evident to every Eye that is not ſtone blind. So ſoon as they ſet out upon the Stage of Action, ſo ſoon they begin to go away from <hi>God.</hi> They have not a knowledge of Divine Spiritual Things ſufficient to determine their Wills to moral Goodneſs, and light them in the Ways of <hi>God.</hi> And if in any Inſtance it is otherwiſe, it is owing to the ſupernatural Renewing Grace of <hi>God,</hi> who can infuſe the Principles of Sanctification and the New Nature as ſoon as he pleaſes. In ſhort, it is obvious, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind come into the World altogether unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and unfit to attain the great End of their being, <hi>viz.</hi> the active Glorifying of <hi>GOD,</hi> and are bent the Backward way.

Active Glorifying of <hi>GOD</hi> for yielding a Rational Service to his Maker; and enjoying a rational Happineſs in Him the Fountain of all Felicity. How comes it then that he now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears altogether ſo unfit for the purſuit of this noble End? ſhall we impeach the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs in this Caſe? Of this no other Satiſfactory Reaſon can be given, but the Intereſt which all Mankind have in the firſt Transgreſſion; upon this Account <hi>God,</hi> in a Judicial Way, <hi>creates</hi> them deſtitute of the Principles and Powers of true Holineſs.</p>
            <p>What degrees of Puniſhment Mankind are condemned to, barely upon the Account of the Tranſgreſſion of our firſt Parents, I neither do nor can determine; But this is certain, that thereby we loſt all Claim and Title to the happy Enjoyment of <hi>God,</hi> were condemned to eternal Exile from his comfortable and glorious Preſence, and are, naturally, diveſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of his beautiful moral Image, having a darken'd Underſtanding and perverſe Will; averſe to Holineſs, and proneneſs to Evil encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and leading to all manner of Sin againſt the very dictates of Reaſon and Conſcience; by which Actual Tranſgreſſion the Soul is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to an aggravated and inconceivably dreadful Damnation. Thus, by the Fall we are plunged in a Deluge of Miſery and Wo, fallen into a courſe of Actual Rebellion againſt <hi>GOD,</hi> and thereby expoſed to the juſt and <hi>Awful</hi> Revenge of his offended Majeſty for

ever; ſo that we ſtood in the moſt abſolute need of a Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Let none here be ſo brutiſhly ignorant, as to say, <hi>How can we be the Worſe for</hi> Adam's <hi>Tranſgreſſion, at this Diſtance of Time? A Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Act that was committed almoſt Six Thouſand Years ago?</hi> Conſider, that one Day is with the <hi>Lord</hi> as a Thouſand Years, and a Thouſand Years as one Day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 <hi>v.</hi> 8.

If GOD at firſt, in his unſearchable Wiſdom determined this Method to proceed with Mankind in, to find them Guilty upon the Tranſgreſſion of their firſt Parent, what mean Conceptions muſt ſuch have of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty who think that this Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt fall thro' length of Time, without taking any farther notice of it?</p>
            <p>Neither let the Difficulty of conceiving how the Sin of our firſt Parents could, in a rational way, be imputed to their Poſterity, Prejudice any againſt the Reality and Truth of it; for ſeeing it is expreſly revealed by GOD, it, ſurely, becomes us to believe it upon his Authority, and Rather charge our ſelves with Ignorance, than his Word with <hi>Falſhood.</hi> But yet this Caſe will admit of reaſonable Satisfaction, by conſidering, that all <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity were equally involved and concerned with himſelf in that Covenant which God at firſt made with him, and himſelf conſtituted their Head and Repreſentative therein; So that according to his Behaviour, it was to fare with them.

The ſubſtance of this Covenant is briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. and the Tenor of it was, a Promiſe of an immortal Life of Happineſs, in the bleſſed Favour and Enjoyment of <hi>God,</hi> to him and all his Off-ſpring, upon condition of his Obedience, and a Threatning of the contrary Miſeries, upon condition of his Diſobedience. Now, according to the Terms of this Covenant, upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, Guilt and Condemnation plainly and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followed upon all the human Race.

            <p>But here the greateſt Queſtion of all is, <hi>How it can comport with the Juſtice and Goodneſs of</hi> God <hi>to involve all Mankind in ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, made with their firſt Parents, that has iſsued ſo much to their Diſadvantage, and that without their Perſonal Conſent?</hi>

But it is highly to be preſumed, that had our Repreſentative,

               <hi>Adam,</hi> perſevered in his Obedience, and we now enjoyed the happy Conſequences of it, we had been ready enough to applaud the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom and Goodneſs appearing in ſuch a Method. So that there is no room for thoſe Tragical Out-cries in the World of injuſtice, in the Caſe of original Guilt. And whereas the <hi>Lord</hi> declares, <hi>That the Child ſhall not ſuffer for the Father</hi>'s <hi>Sin,</hi> it is ſpoken with reference to the Sin of our near Parents, who, tho' they bear a natural, yet ſtand in no ſuch covenant Relation to us, as our firſt Parents did.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly ſome of my hearers may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, <hi>That tho' the whole human Race did become guilty and condemned, upon them firſt Parents Tranſgreſſion, yet all that Guilt is taken off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from all Mankind, thro' the the Death of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſo that none come into this World and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the human Nature in a State of Condemnation.</hi> Such would do well to conſider, when it was that this Guilt was done away; whether before or immediately after the Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If it be ſaid, that it was taken away from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſoon as the Covenant of Grace was publiſhed to <hi>Adam,</hi> after the Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. or at any other Time before the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; how then could the Apoſtle, ſay in his Day, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2<hi>s</hi> 3. <hi>WE ALL were by Nature the Children of Wrath, even as OTHERS.</hi> It could not be taken away only after the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for his Death was of the ſame Virtue and Efficacy ſince the Fall of Man to this Day.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004117_0030_1003CE864D8EEAB0"/>
It was thro' his Mediation and Death, that the Godly in all Ages were ſaved, even before, in reality, he died: And hence he is ſaid to be <hi>ſlain from the Foundation of the World, Rev.</hi> 13.8. In ſhort, if original Guilt was wholly taken away then, upon the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Goſpel muſt have been turned altogether into a new Model, from what it ever was before, agreeable to this new Article; whereas it has always been ſubſtantially the ſame, only under different Modes of Adminiſtrations, and in different Degrees of Light and Clearneſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>God preached the Goſpel before unto</hi> Abraham, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3) ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi> And I may ſay, that he preached before the Goſpel unto <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.15. ſaying, <hi>The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall Bruiſe the Serpent</hi>'s <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, we ſee that very deplorable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the firſt Tranſgreſſion, do yet remain upon Mankind, (as I have already obſerved.) And how theſe Effects Judicially inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man, on the Account of the firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ſuch as will certainly, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſupernatural preventing Grace, lead him to a very dreadful Damnation, (as natural Blindneſs, Stupidity and a depraved Will, do many) how, I ſay, ſuch Effects can remain, and yet all the Guilt be taken away, is hard to imagine.</p>
            <p>That paſſage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, even ſo in</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſhall all be made alive,</hi> is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004117_0031_1003CE88A1BC71B0"/>
nothing to this purpoſe; for the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking only of the Reſurrection of the Dead at the laſt Day, as appears through the whole Chapter. The being <hi>made alive,</hi> which he here ſpeaks of, is ſuch whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is a Partaker; for it immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next Verſe, <hi>But every Man in his own order; Chriſt the firſt Fruits, afterwards, ſays he, they that are Chriſt</hi>'s (and the Time when they are to be made alive is) <hi>at his coming,</hi> and that is at the End of the World, <hi>Then cometh the End, ſays he, when he ſhall have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo the Meaning of the Words is plainly to this purpoſe, that as by <hi>Adam</hi> all his Poſterity were ſubject to Natural Death, in a way of Judgment, ſo by <hi>Chriſt</hi> all his ſeed, <hi>i. e.</hi> they that are <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, as <hi>v.</hi> 23. ſhall be quickened and raiſed from the Dead, in a way of Mercy and Love, to the full Conſummation of their Happineſs. This verſe is only another way of phraſing the ſame Thing that he had ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Since by Man came Death, by Man came alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another place of Scripture alſo is made uſe of in this caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>As by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free Gift came upon all Men to Juſtification of Life.</hi> For the right Underſtanding of this Scripture, you muſt obſerve, that the Apoſtle compares the Offence or Diſobedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004117_0032_1003B2CA331F3438"/>
the Righteouſneſs or Obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the firſt Place, in that neither of them were meerly Perſonal, but both of publick Influence: Herein, he obſerves, they exactly agree; and therefore he ſays, <hi>As by the Offence of one, Even ſo by the Righteouſne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of One.</hi> And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> he compares them, not as to the Extent of their Influence, that is, as to the Number of Perſons to whom they extend in their Effects, but as to the Efficacy and Power of it And in this part of the compariſon, he obſerves, that the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> has much the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that it is much more Powerful in its Effects, than the Diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi>; for tho' the Diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> was of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Efficacy to Condemn, yet the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> exceeds in Power, in that it is of ſufficîent Efficacy to Juſtifie after this Condemnation, and that to everlaſting Life; as he that reſcues a Captive from an Enemy, muſt be ſtronger than he. This is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Deſign of the Apoſtle, through this whole Context. To this purpoſe he ſays, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>For if by One Man</hi>'s <hi>Offence, Death reigned by One, much more they which receive abundant of Grace, and of the Gift of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall reign in Life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And then the Meaning of this 18 <hi>v.</hi> is, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, ſeeing it is ſo that the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is of much more Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy and Virtue, than the Diſobedience of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004117_0033_1003CE907633FDE8"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi>; therefore it is plain, that as all thoſe upon whom the Offence of <hi>Adam</hi> came, were Condemned by it, ſo, all thoſe upon whom the free Gilt, by the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes, are juſtified thereby, and delivered from this Condemnation, with ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Juſtification as is followed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life. Or, to vary a little from the very Words, As all thoſe to whom the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed, are thereby condemned, ſo all thoſe to whom the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is imputed, muſt thereby be delivered from that Condemnation, juſtified and glorified So that the Apoſtle's deſign, is not to ſignify, that as many as were condemned by <hi>Adam,</hi> are juſtified by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is much more Efficacious than <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience; ſo that thoſe to whom it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, muſt thereby be juſtified from their Condemnation in <hi>Adam,</hi> and reſtored to that Life which they had loſt in him.<note n="*" place="bottom">As if a Man, intending to ſet forth the great Power of Heat beyond Cold, ſhould ſay, The Cold indeed ſeizes all Things with ſuch Power as to harden them; but the Sun comes upon all Things with ſuch Power, as to ſoften them again, even, when under the Power of the Cold.

            <p>It remains then an unſhaken Truth, that all Mankind come into this World in a State

The delivering of Mankind barely from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Guilt had been of ſmall Service, (indeed of none at all) to ſuch as live to any Years, unleſs the inherent Depravity of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were removed with it, and <hi>God</hi>'s moral Image, in which they were at firſt Created, again Reſtored upon them, and ſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made againſt their ſinning actually in their own Perſons.

This condemning Sentence of the <hi>Law,</hi> is that which is called the <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> which it iſſues out upon the Subject, ſo ſoon as ever he has, in the leaſt, failed of perfect and exact Obedience to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 10. <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe, for it is Written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things, which âre writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> Here you ſee the <hi>Law</hi> curſes and condemns the Sinner, and that if he ſhould but break it in one particular, <hi>if he do not All things which are written in the Book of the Law</hi>; yea, <hi>if he
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004117_0036_1003CE9BDAB60EF8"/>
continues not in</hi> this perfect Obedience, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſwerves from the <hi>Law</hi> in one Point, he is condemned by it. The <hi>Law</hi> will juſtify upon no other Terms, but an exactly perfect Obedience, without the leaſt Flaw. If there is one Failure in it, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is rejected and laid under the Curſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2, 10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet Offend in one Point, he is Guilty of all, i. e.</hi> he is as really condemned by the <hi>Law,</hi> and laid under the Curſe, as if he had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly broken every Precept: For it is a ſtriking at the Foundation of the whole <hi>Law,</hi> a contemning of that Authority upon which the whole is eſtabliſhed. And if this be ſo, then Oh! what an awfully aggravated Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt ſuch be expoſed to, who are yet in their condemned State, and have Thouſands of Tranſgreſſions to anſwer for! Who ſpend their whole Lives in Sin, as all unconverted Perſons do. The Furnace is daily waxing hotter for you, as you heap up the Meaſure of your Sins. Sin is not ſuch a light and trivial Thing, as blind and ſtupid people Imagine: It is ſoon committed, and ſoon forgotten, and they don't commit it, as they think out of any miſchevious Deſign, but only for ſome perſonal Satisfaction and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: And multitudes of Things wherein they come not up to the Strictneſs of the Divine <hi>Law,</hi> are only the Infirmities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, common to Man, which the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004117_0037_1003B34ADAB5A580"/>
Divine Majeſty, will eaſily overlook. With theſe, or ſuch like thoughts, if not with a more irrational and brutiſh Banter, they plaiſter over the Filthyneſs, the Deteſtable and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Nature of Sin, that that may not be diſcovered by them; But, Oh! Sirs, there is an infinite Evil in Sin; which the Damned ſee and feel. It is the Rebellion of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, endowed with Rational Powers for a very contrary End, againſt the Author of its Being; againſt infinite Majeſty and eternal Sovereignity. And thoſe who can Sin ſo lightly againſt <hi>God,</hi> and be ſo ſtupidly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned about it, diſcover the Enmity and Hatred, that is in their Hearts againſt him. They hate his Holineſs, and ſo his very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in all Sin there is an inexpreſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit; ſo that it deſerves an inexpreſſible Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and accordingly <hi>God</hi>'s Holy <hi>Law</hi> dooms the Sinner to it. Thoſe indeed, who have received <hi>Chriſt</hi> by a true Faith, whereby they are Sanctified and made ſincerely Holy, (bleſſed be the gracious <hi>God</hi>) are brought out of this Condemnation, thro' his anſwering the <hi>Law</hi> for them: So that there is <hi>No Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8.1. but Unbelievers have no intereſt in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is by the <hi>Faith of Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 8.9. and ſo ſtill ſtand condemned by the <hi>Law,</hi> under the Damning Guilt of all their Sins: <hi>For as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe.</hi>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:004117_0038_1003B2E3CB0A5EC8"/>Thus I have ſhown you, how Unbelievers have come into this Condemned State, which they are in: But yet this does not fully reach the Deſign of this Head, which is, alſo, to ſhow how they come to be at preſent in this State of Condemnation, and that, when others are in a juſtified Eſtate, who have been actual Tranſgreſſors, and by Nature the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath, even as they. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> They are kept in their condemned State, by their Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Now Unbelief has a two-fold Influence upon a Sinners Condemnation, <hi>viz.</hi> Privative and Poſitive, the 1<hi>ſt.</hi> has a Privative influence upon it, as it keeps them under their former Guilt, in their antecedent Condemnation, which they were brought into by the Imputation of the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trrnſgreſſion and their own perſonal Sin; and ſo deprives them of being juſtified: And that without the Conſideration of its making any addition to their Guilt. The only Relief of guilty Sinners, from their Condemnation, is thro' the Righteouſneſs and Mediation of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But, according to <hi>God</hi>'s wiſe Conſtitution in the Goſpel, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of</hi> God <hi>abideth on him.</hi> The Wrath of <hi>God</hi> abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on him. He does not ſay, it then comes on him, but it abides on him; ſignifying, that it was upon him before on other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and ſtill Continues ſo by reaſon of Unbelief, whereby he comes ſhort of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Remedy. To the ſame Purpoſe our <hi>Lord</hi> tells us in our Text, <hi>he that believeth not it condemned already</hi>; and the Reaſon of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Condemned State follows, <hi>becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of</hi> God. And then 2<hi>dly,</hi> Unbelief has a poſitive Influence upon the Sinners Condemnation, <hi>i. e.</hi> it not only keeps him under his former Condemnation, but it adds to it, as a Crime; by aggravating and heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Guilt. How much heavier muſt it make the Sinners Condemnation, when he will not humbly acknowledge his condemned deplorable Condition by Sin, and heartily receive the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> wholly depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for his Relief, as he is offered to him by the <hi>Lord</hi> of his infinite Compaſſion for that End, at leaſt not uſing all poſſible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to do ſo, but proudly ſlights Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Mercy, and refuſes his only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>And now you ſee <hi>Brethren,</hi> that Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſuch as are not united to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith, are condemned both by the <hi>Law,</hi> and by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> ſays, <hi>He that performs not all
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004117_0040_1003B2EDCC2B47B8"/>
Things, which are written in the Book of the</hi> Law, <hi>ſhall be Damned, Gal</hi> 8.10. This is the Curſe which it pronounces againſt him: But the Unbeliever has not done this. It's true there is an Appeal from the <hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>; wherein Life and Salvation through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is offered to Guilty and condemned Sinners that receive him by Faith, but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſays, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be Damned, Mar.</hi> 16.18. and he has not complied with the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; and ſo is condemned by it. And there is no other Court of Grace to appeal to, and Oh! how dreadful is it when a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's laſt Remedy flaſhes the Fire of Hell in his Face.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> I proceed now to improve this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I have been inſiſting upon, by ſome Practical Inferences drawn from it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> If it be ſo that all Unbelievers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exception, are in a <hi>condemned</hi> State; then it Informs us, that <hi>juſtification</hi> cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by our own Righteouſneſs. No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by their ſtricteſt obedience to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> can be delivered from that Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which they are laid under by it. The <hi>Lord</hi> does not ſay, the profane Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, or the careleſs Unbeliever, that makes no Practice of the Duties of Religion, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but <hi>He that believeth not,</hi> indefinitely, without any Limitation, be he who he will, or do he what he will, Until he believes in <hi>Chriſt</hi> he is Condemned, and the Wrath
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004117_0041_1003CECB4FF1E4D8"/>
of <hi>God</hi> abideth on him: And indeed, <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> by our own Righteouſneſs and <hi>Perſonal obedience,</hi> is inconſiſtent with the very Nature of Faith; wherein the Believer rejects all Dependance upon his own Goodneſs and Obedience, and leans entirely on the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Redeemer. Moreover, you have heard, that whoſoever would be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that Way, by a <hi>Law</hi> of Righteouſneſs, muſt produce a compleat one, without the leaſt Imperfection; upon no other Terms can any Perſon be juſtified by his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. The <hi>Law</hi> will have a compleat exact Righteouſneſs, in every Point and Degree, or none at all: If there is a defection in it, the <hi>Law</hi> is ſo far from juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it poſitively Condemns. And the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in this Form, is no other than his wiſe Eſtabliſhment, which he has enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to ſtand by. And therefore, <hi>as many as are of the Works of the</hi> Law, <hi>are under the Curſe,</hi> becauſe they have not done all Things which the <hi>Law</hi> required; for it ſays, <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in All Things which are written in the Book of the</hi> Law, <hi>to do them.</hi> Unbelievers are ſo far from perfectly fulfiilling the <hi>Law,</hi> that, the Truth is, no Perſon can yield any Obedience, that is any way pleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> till he is firſt juſtified: <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Renovation</hi> always go together, and the one is never without the other; and ſo an Unjuſtified Perſon, being an Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004117_0042_1003CED828E471E0"/>
Perſon, cannot obey God in any Thing, with a <hi>Goſpel</hi> Sincerity; all his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience flowing from an unſanctified Heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>They that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> And how then can all their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, remove their Condemnation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to <hi>God</hi>'s Love? When his holy Eye ſees no Beauty but much Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> What has been ſpoken, clearly Informs us of the great Blindneſs and Stupid Ignorance of ſuch as Think they are in no great Danger; becauſe they are ſmall Sinners. From hence they derive the Peace and ſecure Quiet of their Conſciences, that they are not Guilty of ſuch groſs Immoralities as many others, they have taken care to abſtain from ſuch Things as are offenſive to <hi>God,</hi> and have committed but little Sin againſt the divine Majeſty; And therefore, they think they can be in no great Danger of Periſhing, but if any are in a ſafe State, ſure they muſt.

And 1ſt, ſuch as have never been ſo throughly convinced of their Condemned, Wretched, Undone and Helpleſs Condition, as humbly and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to receive <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for their only Saviour, rejecting all other Dependance, and deriving the only Peace of their Conſciences and Comfort of their Souls from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Mediation and Righteouſneſs; theſe I ſay, are Unbelievers, and yet in their Sins. Herein conſiſts the very Subſtance and Life of Juſtifying Faith; it is the Souls flying under a ſence of Guilt and impending Wrath to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as his only Relief; ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> is the alone Foundation of the Believers Hope, inward Peace and Confidence toward <hi>God, Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>We rejoice in Chriſt JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, and have no Confidence in the Fleſh, Eph.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>In whom we have Boldneſs and Acceſs with Confidence, by the Faith of him.</hi> So that thoſe who have

never been heartily and feelingly ſenſible of their Miſery and Undoneneſs in themſelves, have never come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith; for the Whole will not apply to the Phyſician, but the Sick. And ſuch as make any Thing elſe but the Redeemer's Merit the Foundation of their Peace, thinking well of their Condition, either becauſe they are Guilty of little Sin, or becauſe they Perform the external Duties of Religion, are ſorry for their Sins, or the like, are utter Strangers to a ſaying Faith. Neither is it enough to profeſs, and ſuperficially believe that you are miſerable and undone without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that no other way you can poſſibly be ſaved but thro' his Mediation; Perſons may maintain all this, and profeſs it as their Judgment, and yet never, in reality, came to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but reſt on ſomething elſe, Unleſs the Diſpoſitions and Actings of your Hearts be agreeable to theſe Truths, unleſs you ſo believe them as to be anſwerably affected by them, what ſignifies your Orthodox Belief: It is but a dead Faith, that will not profit you. And yet, alas! this is all the Faith that many Profeſſors content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with. They Think well of themſelves becauſe they profeſs theſe great Truths of the Goſpel, as the Articles of their Faith, and pity ſuch as don't know ſo much, or maintain a contrary Opinion; but a true Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a ſenſible and lively Operation of the Soul, wherein the Perſon is affected ſuitably to what he believes, and does, in an active manner, lean,

with deep Poverty of Spirit, upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and him alone for his Deliverance from Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Wrath, for Reconciliation and Peace with God.

the Pardon of Sin and inſtating the Sinner again into the Love and Favour of God, ſo that he is again entitled to that Eternal Bleſſedneſs which he had forfeited by Sin, as fully as if he had never Sinned; that, I ſay, is fitly called a Righteouſneſs, and that upon two Accounts: 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Becauſe Righteouſneſs conſiſting in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience to Gods Law, was the only Condition upon which Gods Favour and our Eternal Happineſs was at firſt promiſed; hence therefore, whatſoever anſwers in the Place of that Perſonal Perfect Righteouſneſs, is fitly called by the ſame Name, is as much as it ſupplies the Place of it, and anſwers to the ſame End. And 2<hi>dly,</hi> whatſoever is ſufficient to obtain the foreſaid Ends, is called <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it is ſuch in its own Nature; for nothing can be available to the Juſtification of a condemned Sinner but a perfect Conformity unto, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillment of the Law, both in us Precept and Penalty; So anſwering the Demands and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the Law lays in againſt the Sinner: Thus, the Merit of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in both theſe Reſpects, as it obtains that End for us, when received by Faith, which a Perſonal Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In this Verſe two Things are to be taken notice of, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> A great benefit by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in theſe Words, <hi>Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs</hi> And, 2<hi>dly,</hi> the Perſons to whom it belongs, <hi>every one that believeth.</hi> Here then we muſt enquire what is meant by <hi>Chriſts</hi> being the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs? And <hi>firſt,</hi> Negatively, the meaning is not that he has diſanulled, abrogated and taken away the Law, ſo as Believers are rendred Lawleſs, and no more bound to Obedience; For ſays the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law thro' faith</hi>? God forbid: yea, <hi>We eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> It's true, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this ſenſe, was the End of the Ceremonial Law conſiſting of Sacrifices, Offerings, &amp;c. But the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of the Law in general, eſpecially of the Moral Law, comprized in the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and underſtands the <hi>End of the Law,</hi> in another ſenſe, when he ſays, <hi>he is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs</hi>; That is, he is ſo the End of it as to furniſh the Sinner with a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſufficient to anſwer the Demands of it for his Juſtification This way he is the End of it; which is quite another Thing than the Aboliſhing of it. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s further evident from the Apoſtle's limitation, <hi>to them that believe</hi>; for n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Law. Again, it is plain, that the Law which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, is that Law by the obeying of which the Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> in the former Verſe, looked to be juſtified, which was the Moral as well as the Ceremonial Law. I am not ſaying, that the Ceremonial Law is not here at all intended, but that it is not only intended; and that <hi>by the End of it,</hi> is not meant its abrogation, otherwiſe than by a neceſſary conſequence. And therefore in the next Place, poſitively, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>End of the Law for Righteouſneſs,</hi> in reſpect of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, as it was inſtituted and deſigned for the End, to typifie and prefigure him in his Mediatorial Office. As his Mediatorial Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was the End which the Waſhings, Sacrifices and Incenſe of the Ceremonial Law pointed at and held forth. This was the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Blindneſs of the Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> that they lean'd upon their Ceremonial Obſervances as proper Atonements for their Sins in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that their Guilt was thereby taken away. And the Apoſtle here Informs them, that the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is that alone by which a Sinner can be juſtified, which all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Ceremonial Blood and Incenſe, with many other Things of that Law only ſignified and pointed at. They were never deſigned for the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Sinners by any proper Virtue of their own, but to ſhadow forth the great Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt: For it is not poſſible that the blood of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sins, Heb.</hi> 10 4. In Chriſt only is that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which can deliver the Soul from the Guilt and Condemnation of Sin, and whereby all that truly believe in him are juſtified: It was not in all the Ceremonial Services of the Law; they only pointed at and referred to it in him; and thus he is the End of the Ceremonial Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
            <p>And then as to the Law in general, <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs,</hi> in two reſpects, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> By anſwering the End for which the Law was given, by fullfilling it, and ſo working out a Righteouſneſs for the Juſtification of thoſe who had broken it. The Law was given for that End, that it ſhould be obeyed, and that Man by obeying it, ſhould have everlaſting Life; Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſubmitted himſelf to the Law, and perfectly obeyed it in what it required of the Sinner, both as to its Precept and Penalty; and by that Obedience has wrought a ſufficient Righteouſneſs for Believers to obtain Eternal Life by. And ſo when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>End of the Law for Righteouſneſs,</hi> in this ſenſe the meaning is, that by his Obedience which he has yielded to it, he has obtained for Sinners that End for which the Law was given, and which they ſhould have attained by it, had man never ſinned, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfilled it, <hi>viz.</hi> Everlaſting Life and Happineſs, This is the Language and Tenor of the Law, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> man which doth theſe Things ſhall

live by them, Rom.</hi> 10.5. So that the End which the Law propoſed to the ſubjects to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by it, was Eternal Life and Happineſs: And the Righteouſneſs which it required, for the obtaining of this End, was a perfect obedience to it, upon the leaſt defect it lays the Perſon under condemnation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. But all mankind have wofully broken the Law of <hi>GOD</hi>; either, repreſentatively, in their firſt Parent, or both repreſentatively, in him, and Perſonally themſelves; and therefore can never obtain Happineſs by the Law, that is, upon the Law's terms of an abſolutely Perfect and Perſonal Obedience. Now the Lord <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> has perfectly obeyed the Law, in the utmoſt of its demands upon the Sinner, which Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, by God's appointment, for a Juſtifying Righteouſneſs to thoſe who by Faith receive him, ſo that thereby they obtain that Life and Happineſs which was at firſt propoſed upon the terms of the Law, but is now utterly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attainable that way. And thus he is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 3.4. But then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>s Precept, whereby it requires Obedience, and its Penalty, whereby it requires Puniſhment for Diſobedience. Now tho' <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not the End of the Precept of the Law, ſo as to take away the Believers Obligation to Obedience; yet, he is the End of the Penalty, Malediction and Curſe of the Law, ſo as to take
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004117_0067_1003CF94CB074DA0"/>
away their Obligation to puniſhment. He takes away the Law's Proceſs againſt them; So that it no longer requires Puniſhment or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of them, he having ſatisfied and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the Penalty of the Law in their Room, and thereby furniſhed them with a ſufficient Righteouſneſs to anſwer all the Charges and <hi>demands</hi> which the <hi>law</hi> has to lay in againſt them, as Bars in their Way to Happineſs and Glory. The Laws Penalty has no more to require of them; according to <hi>Gal,</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt has redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> And tho' the Law, as to its Precept, remains an unalterable Rule of Righteouſneſs, and ſo requires Obedience from Believers; yet, it is not required as the Term or Condition of their Juſtification before GOD Their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is put altogether upon another Foot, than it was in the Law, or Covenant of Works: The Spotleſs Obedience which the <hi>Lord JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> paid to the Precept of the Law being accepted in the Room and Place of the Obedience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that Covenant in the caſe of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>And thus is he the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth And here it is to be obſerved, that in all theſe Senſes, the general Scope and deſign of the Words is the ſame, <hi>viz</hi> That the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby a Sinner can only be Juſtified and delivered from the Condemnation of the Law, is in <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> To him alone the Sinner muſt come for it, or be forever undone</p>

thro' <hi>the Redemption that is in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> 2<hi>dly</hi> God requires that Sinners comply with that Way which himſelf has appointed, believe in it, and depend upon it; otherwiſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Juſtified by it.

               <p>A Second Propoſition which this Text affords us, is, <hi>That Sinners Dependance upon their own Righteouſneſs for Juſtification keeps them out of the way which GOD has appointed for that End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſition has a very clear Foundation in the Text, <hi>Going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, they have not ſubmitted themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of GOD.</hi> And Chap. 7.31, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Iſrael which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs.</hi> They were ſeeking after a Righteouſneſs whereby they could be abſolved from the Guilt of their Sins, and inſtated in the Love and Favour of God, but they did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it.

Now, from hence it is evident, that altho' Perſons be never ſo circumſpect, diligent and careful in obeying the Laws and Commands of God, yet, if they depend upon that to recommend them to Gods ſaving Favour, and ſo make a Saviour of their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, putting it in the Place of Chriſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I ſhow'd you how they came into it, by which it is clearly evident, that all Mankind were equally under the ſame Condemnation, having broken God's Righteous Law, which, without reſpect of Perſons, condemns the Breakers of it. And my deſign now, from this Paſſage of holy Scripture, is to ſhow you, the Way whereby Sinners can only be delivered out of this deplorable Eſtate. The Method which God has provided and eſtabliſhed for that end. Now as the inherent Depravity and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul, the corrupt Quality and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Sinner is Remedied by Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſo his Condemned State is Remedied by Juſtification. It is the delivering of the Sinner from his Condemnation to Hell, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling him, upon the contrary, to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heaven. I ſhall endeavour to give you a juſt View of it under this Definition, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtification is a Judicial Act of GOD, wherein he acquits the Sinner of his Guilt, and gives him a Title to Eternal Happin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In this Definition you may eſpecially obſerve two things concerning Juſtification. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> The parts of it, which are Two; or, there are two
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004117_0079_1003CFB0883DECA0"/>
things done for the Perſon in Juſtification; He is freed from Guilt, and entitled to Glory. By <hi>Guilt</hi> underſtand the Sinner's Obligation to the Puniſhment of Hell, which comes by the Condemning Sentence of the Law, which he is fallen under. Now in <hi>Juſtification</hi> this <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sentence</hi> is taken off and ſo his Liableneſs and Obligation to Puniſhment. According to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is now no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> So that when a Sinner is ſaid to be acquitted of his Guilt, abſolved or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, the meaning is, that the Condemning Sentence of the Law which he was under, is taken off, and he is ſecured againſt the danger of Hell's Puniſhment, which before he was bound over to. The Goſpel ſupperſedes the Law, and over-rules it, as it were, ſo as it pronounces the Perſon Free, who by the Law was ſentenced to Death; thus ſays, the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me Free from the Law of Sin, and Death.</hi> And yet the Law and Goſpel do not oppoſe each other; For none are acquited by the Goſpel until the Laws Demands upon them, are anſwered; as you ſhall farther hear, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>The other part of Juſtification, is the giving to the Sinner a Title and Claim to Eternal Happineſs. This is done for him in his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for Eternal Happineſs, in the Glorious Enjoyment of <hi>GOD,</hi> was at firſt promiſed to Man upon the Terms of the Law, the terms
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004117_0080_1003CFB2EF782920"/>
of Perfect Perſonal Obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. And therefore, a Title to Life being once granted in the firſt Covenant, it muſt be again reſtored to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Sinner in the very Act of Juſtification; becauſe it is a pronouncing him Free from all the Changes and Accuſations of the Law, which it has to lay in againſt him, as Bars to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that happy and Eternal Life which it firſt promiſed. Had the Condition of the Law or firſt Covenant been fulfilled, Eternal Life had thereby been obtained; and therefore, nothing can hinder any Man from the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it but the Laws objecting againſt him, as not having fulfilled the Condition upon which it was promiſed; and ſo, when all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Law are anſwered, and the Sinner is freed from them, as fully as if he had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Condition of the Law, a Title to Life muſt neceſſarily be again reſtored.</p>
               <p>In thoſe two things conſiſts what is done for the Sinner in his Juſtification. And hence you may eaſily underſtand what is meant by theſe Paſſages of Scripture which ſpeak of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and Remiſſion of Sins, the blotting out of Iniquity, the covering of Sin, and the like: All which belong to the head of Juſtification. The meaning is, that the Lord will look over the Sinner<hi>'s</hi> Sin, in his way of dealing with him, as to his Eternal State, as if it had never been; as if he had perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctly fulfilled the Law, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from that Puniſhment which his Sin expoſed him to, and giving him that Titdle to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004117_0081_1003CFB4741CE1A0"/>
Life and Happineſs which his Sin had forfeited. From what has been ſaid, you may alſo obſerve, that Juſtification does not conſiſt in any thing that is wrought in the Sinner, as to his Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and Quality; that belongs to Sanctification, but in what is done for him, reſpecting his State, which is what is cheifly intended when it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Act, rather than a Work of <hi>GOD.</hi> It is neceſſary that you conſider this, and underſtand Wherein Juſtification conſiſts, and ſo carry a right Notion of it along with you, through the whole of this Diſcourſe; otherwiſe it will be no wonder if you don't underſtand what may be ſpoken of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> In the Definition you have the general Nature of Juſtification; when it is called a <hi>Judicial Act of GOD</hi>: whereby is ſignified, that God proceeds in it as a Judge, paſſing this Abſolving Sentence upon Trial, when the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is firſt acquitted by the Law. In Juſtifying a Sinner, The Lord has regard to his own Law; he will ſee that all the Demands which the Law has upon him, are anſwered, before, he will, or can Juſtifie him, juſtly, conſiſtently with his own Law, According to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>whom GOD hath ſet forth to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thro' Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Remiſſion of Sins — to declare,</hi> I ſay, at this time, <hi>his Righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> In theſe Words the Apoſtle obſerves the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> Death for a Sinner's Juſtification,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004117_0082_1003CFB60D08C2F0"/>
to maintain and manifeſt God's Righteouſneſs and Juſtice, as well as his other Perfections therein: ſo, clearly intimating, that he could not be juſt in juſtifying a Sinner, unleſs the Law had been thus ſatisfied. God at firſt conditionally annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Penalty to his Law; that in caſe ſin ſhould be committed, it ſhould infallibly be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; that the Sinner ſhould not be relieved unle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the Penalty were fully ſuſtained: This was the Method which God determined, and engaged himſelf to proſecute ſin in; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he cannot Juſtifie a Sinner, juſtly, without Acting contrary to his own Appointment and eſtabliſh a Law, unleſs the Penalty be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in his behalf, by an Undertaker for him. Thus it was neceſſary that Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that you ſee, all the claims of the Law muſt be anſwered to the extent, before a Sinner can be juſtified. Hence that <hi>Matt.</hi> 5, 18. <hi>Till Heaven and Earth paſs, one Jot or one Tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</hi> The Law will not abate one jot or its Demands, but all muſt be fulfilled.

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004117_0083_1003B37118F3D140"/>
in this point that are in the World, whereby Perſons look to any Thing elſe for their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before GOD, proceeds from a groſs Ignorance of the true Nature of Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Having ſet before you a breif and juſt View of the Nature of Juſtification, I come now to ſhow you what that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is, thro' which alone this great Benefit can be obtained, as the Material and Meritorious Cauſe of it. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Negatively,</hi> It is not the eſſential Righteouſneſs of his Nature, whereby he is eternally Righteous, &amp; Holy. Neither, 2<hi>dly,</hi> His Righteouſneſs in the Adminiſtration of his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or Mediatorial Government which he daily exerciſes in the World. Nor yet, 3<hi>dly,</hi> Is it the Inherent Righteouſneſs or Sanctification of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers, which he works in them by his <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> This Righteouſneſs indeed, is in all thoſe that are Juſtified, ſo as none are Juſtified but they are alſo Sanctified and Holy: But yet their Holineſs and inherent Goodneſs is not that Righteouſneſs by which they are juſtified. It is rather the Fruit than the Cauſe of their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. None are truly Sanctified before they are juſtified: Juſtification and the New Nature always go together, and its diſcovering it ſelf in its proper Acts immediately follows the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Juſtification. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. In Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, God is ſaid to Juſtifie the Ungodly. A Believers Inherent Righteouſneſs can never anſwer the Demands of the Law for him, and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004117_0084_1003CFB955B2A448"/>
therefore, cannot be his juſtifying Righteouſneſs. It is neceſſary to take away the Power and Dominion of Sin in the Heart; But can never take away the Guilt of Sin. I am as much for Holineſs of Heart and Life, as any can be, and ſay, that without it no man ſhall ſee the Lord, being altogether loathſome in his ſight, and unfit for the enjoyment of him; So that <hi>except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of GOD</hi>; and therefore, it concerns you, with the utmoſt earneſtneſs and diligence, to ſeek after Holy and Sanctîfied Hearts, that you may be enabled to glorifie God, and fitted for the glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him. But, tho' you muſt ſeek the Graces of God's holy Spirit for your Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, you muſt look to ſomething elſe for your Juſtification; for your Deliverance from Guilt and Condemnation, and entitling you to the Glory of God; for Reconciliation and Peace with him. There are ſome that will ſpeak very plauſibly of Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt only, but when they fully explain themſelves, they mean nothing elſe but the inherent Righteouſneſs of the Godly, which Chriſt works in them, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they call it his Righteouſneſs: which bewrays a very great Ignorance of the Nature of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>But in the next Place, <hi>Poſitively,</hi> The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Chrîſt,</hi> which only is available for a Sinner's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſtification, conſiſts in what he has done and ſuffered when he was in the World, in
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004117_0085_1003CFBCC26B52E0"/>
the Room and behalf of Sinners. And ſo, it is generally divided into his active and paſſive Obedience. By his <hi>active Obedience</hi> is underſtood his obeying the Precept of the Law, by a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Perfect Holineſs. This Obedience of his was abſolutely Perfect, without the leaſt Defect; ſo that the Father teſtified of him, <hi>that in him he was well pleaſed,</hi> and himſelf ſays, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.29. <hi>I do always thoſe Things that pleaſe him.</hi> By his <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> is meant, that Obedience which he yielded to the Penalty of the Law, in bearing that Puniſhment which it required of the Sinner: Which was not only his dying upon the Croſs, and ſuſtaining many other greivous Sufferings inflicted upon him by his Malicious Enemies, but his Bearing the Lawful Weight of Gods Wrath it ſelf in his Soul. God the Father laid his own Hand upon him: it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he put him to Grief, and made his very Soul an Offering for Sin, <hi>Jeſ.</hi> 53.10. This infinite Preſſure and Load upon his Spirit was that which made him ſay, <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death, Matt.</hi> 26.38. This was that inexpreſſible Agony of his Soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuch a Sweat of Blood from his ſacred Body, as he lay in the Night upon the cold Earth: for he fell both upon his Knees and upon his Face. <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.37. He was forſaken of his Father, as to the ſenſible Comforts and Supports of his Love, in the midſt of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Miſeries; which occaſioned that bitter
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004117_0086_1003CFBE7092F790"/>
Out-cry upon the Croſs, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.46. Eli Eli Lama Sabachtha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. So great and weighty was the Load of Sufferings which our deareſt <hi>Saviour</hi> bore, both in his Body and his Soul, that it would have over-preſs'd and cruſhed a World of Creatures under it; but he being God as well as Man, his Divine Nature ſupported the Human under it, ſo as it did not fail before it. Now, both this <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>paſſive Obedience</hi> of Chriſt make up that one compleat Righteouſneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby Believers are Juſtified, And both are neceſſary in order to Juſtification: His Paſſive Obedience, to deliver Sinners from the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Hell, and all obligation to it. The Law of God binds over the Sinner to a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Puniſhment, which muſt be ſuſtained, either in his own Perſon, or by a ſurety in his Room, So that it is the Sufferings of Chriſt alone that can deliver Sinners from the Condemnation of the Law. According to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law; being made a Curſe for us.</hi> Hence ſays the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Pet,</hi> 2.24. <hi>His own ſelf bare our Sins, in his own Body, on the Tree. i. e</hi> He bore the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to our Sins, which otherwiſe we muſt have ſuffered for ever. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 3.18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins, the Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi> The Law of GOD cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mned them to Puniſhment, Chriſt ſuffered it for them; and hence it is that they are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed And then, as the Paſſive Obedience of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004117_0087_1003B375AA7581C0"/>
Jeſus Chriſt is neceſſary to anſwer the Penalty of the Law for the Sinner, and ſo deliver him from Puniſhment; ſo, alſo, the Active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt is neceſſary to anſwer the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Law for him, and ſo entitle him to Eternal Glory. For the Condition upon which Eternal Life was at firſt promiſed, was no other than Perfect Obedience; which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition muſt be fulfilled before the promiſed Life can be obtained. But, alaſs, Mankind have univerſally failed in the Performance of this Condition; <hi>for all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of GOD, Rom.</hi> 3.23. And the Law ſtill objects againſt the Sinner, and holds him deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any Claim to happineſs, or intereſt in it, nay, lays an infallible Bar in the way, while its Condition is not fulfilled. Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus has perfectly fulfilled it, in the Diſcharge of his Mediatorial Undertaking; and hence it is the Believers are entitled to Glory; thro' his performing the Condition of the Law, his Obedience being accepted for them: <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one Mans Diſobedience many were made Sinners; So by the Obedience of One ſhall many</hi> be made Righteous, As by <hi>Adam's</hi> diſobedience all his Poſterity were look'd upon as Sinners, and ſo deprived of all Tittle to the promiſed Life; So by Chriſt's Obedience all Believers are look'd upon as Righteous, as if they had fulfilled the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law; and ſo are entitled to eternal Life. Chriſt has anſwered the Condition of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004117_0088_1003CFC008A8A4F0"/>
the Law for them; were it not ſo, we ſhould all be moſt undone Creatures: We ſhould never ſee the Face of God in Peace. Thus I have ſhown you that Righteouſneſs of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Chriſt,</hi> whereby he is the End of the Law, to every one that believeth. I have ſet it before you in both its parts, anſwering to the two parts of a Sinner's Juſtification; and pointed out to you, particularly, how the one anſwers the other.</p>
               <p>And now I am advanced to the <hi>Third General Head propoſed,</hi> which was to confirm the Truth of the Doctrine, and prove, <hi>That the only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which God has eſtabliſhed for the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Condemned Sinner, is this Righteouſneſs of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth of this ſufficiently appears from what has been already ſaid under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Head; but for the fuller Confirmation of it, I ſhall take the Proof of it under a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſideration by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe you my obſerve, That the whole current of the Scripture runs this way. The whole New-Teſtament, wherein God has clearly revealed the Goſpel-Method of Salvation, very evidently flows in this Channel, attributing a Sinner's Deliverance from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Wrath, and his Title to Glory and Happineſs to the Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone, as the ſole Cauſe thereof. It cannot be more fully and plainly expreſſed, than it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004117_0089_1003CFC273AA93E8"/>
Juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Jeſus Chriſt; whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> See alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> It is Chriſt that hath delivered the Godly from the Curſe of the Law; and that by being made a Curſe for them, by bearing that Puniſhment for them, which they were condemned to. To the ſame purpoſe is that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Ho hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Rom. 5.8, 9. <hi>But God commendeth his Love towards us in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt dyed for us; much more then, being now Juſtified by his Blood, we ſhall be ſaved from Wrath thro' him; for if when we were Enemies, we were Reconciled to God by his Son,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, he ſays, <hi>Juſtified by his Blood, and Reconciled to God by his Death.</hi> And verſ. 19. he tells us, <hi>That by the Obedience of Chriſt ſhall many be made Righteous.</hi> But were I particularly to mention all the Paſſages of Scripture that ſpeak to this purpoſe, I ſhould recite a great part of the New Teſtament, with much of the Old; Through the whole 53<hi>d Chapter</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is this Truth clearly revealed, of a <hi>Sinner's Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Promiſed Meſſiah; hence <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. he is call'd, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, I ſhall further confirm this Truth by the following Induction, <hi>viz.</hi> A Sinner
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004117_0090_1003B37B1A119D50"/>
muſt be juſtified, either without any Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation at all, to anſwer the Law as a Satisfaction to Juſtice, or by <hi>his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> his Works of Obedience to the Law, or by <hi>his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>Righteouſneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Dream of being helped by the <hi>Merits of Superrogatory Works of Others,</hi> I hope, it is generally exploded in theſe parts of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> A Sinner cannot be juſtified without any Juſtification made to the Law. For, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That would be contrary to Gods own Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you have heard. To ſpeak with due Reverence of the divine Majeſty, he has not reſerved to himſelf that Power. Whether the Lord might have ſo ordered it, conſiſtently with the Juſtice of his Nature, as <hi>That Sin could have been pardoned without any Juſtification,</hi> I ſhall not diſpute; but, it is plain, that for holy and wiſe Ends, he has ordered it otherwiſe. He is very expreſs in the Law, <hi>In the Day Thou ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had it not been altogether vain and needleſs for

Chriſt to have laid down his Life, and bore ſuch a load of Sufferings, if the great end of it could have as well been obtained without it? And this Conſequence the Apoſtle looks upon as moſt abſurd and unreaſonable; and ſo proves, that Perſons cannot be juſtified by their own Righteouſneſs, becauſe this Conſequence would alſo then follow, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If Righteouſneſs came by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We can never be juſtified by our own Righteouſneſs by our exacteſt Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the divine Law. This fully appears by the very Nature of Juſtification, as it is a <hi>Judicial Act of God,</hi> wherein all the Claims of the Law muſt be anſwered, which <hi>Our beſt Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> can never do.

See alſo Gal. 2.16. <hi>Knowing that a Man is not Juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Chriſt, even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be Juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the Works of the Law: For by the Works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be Juſtified.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <hi>If Righteouſneſt come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> And Chap. 3.10, to 14. <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe; for it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> but that no Man is Juſtified by the Law in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:004117_0092_1003CFC752B137A0"/>
it is evident. <hi>For the Juſt ſhall live by Faith; And the Law is not of Faith: but the Man that doth them ſhall live in them; Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> How fully does the h. <hi>Apoſtle</hi> diſclaim all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon his own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.9. when he counts all things but <hi>Dung that he might win Chriſt, not having his own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is by the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> That is, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is received and depended upon by Faith.</p>
               <p>There are many Objections and Cavils brought in here, by ſuch as are going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, and will not ſubmit themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God; They will ſay, doubleſs, <hi>If our Obedience to Gods Law will not Juſtifie us, if it will not avail to deliver us out of Condemnation, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> eſſential Glories and Peerleſs Perfections of his Nature, were Reaſon enough without any more, to engage us to the pureſt Obedience to his holy Law; and would effectually do ſo, if Sin had left any ingenuity in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Altho' our obedience to God is not the Procuring Cauſe of our Juſtification, yet it is the Way which God has appointed to ſeek for an intereſt in Chriſt's Juſtifying Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in. It is the only Way in which God has given any encouragement to Sinners to obtain Juſtification, thro' the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo as that while they continue in a courſe of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and do not humbly and heartily ſeek for an Intereſt in Chriſt, in the Way of his Commands, they may ſurely expect to come ſhort of it; and ſo periſh in their Sins, It is morally impoſſible that a Sinner ſhould be unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt (without which he cannot be juſtified by him) while he goes on in a courſe of Oppoſition to him. A Sinners Humble, Hearty and Perſevering Application to GOD, with a due ſenſe of his preſent Undone Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for the divine Mercy thro' the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is the Way to come to Chriſt, and get an intereſt in his Righteouſneſs for his Juſtification: So that it is a falſe Conſequence from the Doctrine I am confirming, <hi>That our earneſt Endeavour
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004117_0094_1003CFC8D99869F8"/>
to ſeek God and ſerve him, are Needleſs and to no Purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further, Conſider, <hi>Thirdly</hi> That all thoſe who are united to Chriſt by Faith and ſo Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Righteouſneſs have a new Nature implanted in them, whereby they make holineſs their choice; their Hearts in freely and ſweetly determined for it, and ſet upon it, they have a very dear love for the Lord JESUS, on whom their Eyes are fixed for their Salvation; So that they want above all things to Pleaſe and ſerve him. Thus, the Principle and Spring of their Obedience is not a blind Expectation of procuring their Juſtification by it, tho' they don't allowedly put any truſt in it for that End; yet they yield to God a more full and free Obedience, from the purer Principle of a ſincere Love which is the only true Obedience that is pleaſing to God: and indeed, no Perſon is ever truly Holy until he rejects all dependance upon his own Righteouſneſs, and leans on Chriſt alone: His Obedience is never ſincere till then; but flows from baſe and ſelfiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples altogether. It is plain, that ſuch as make uſe of the Objections I am ſpeaking to, and think they would be at no pains to ſerve God, if thereby they could not, at leſt in part, be Juſtified, it is plain, (I ſay) that they are only obeying for their own Ends, from a Principle of Self-love, and not from any Affectionate Regard or pure love to God; and ſo their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which they are ſo highly concerted
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:004117_0095_1003CFCAD47AA918"/>
of, is altogether unſound, loathſome unclean in the Eyes of GOD.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that the Doctrine of a <hi>Sinner's Juſtification thro' the Merits of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, and the impoſſibility of it by his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> is no enemy to the practice of Holineſs; but is that which only advances it.</p>
               <p>Again, it may be objected, that David <hi>expreſſes great Confidence in his own Righteouſneſs, and attributes much to it, Pſ.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Judge me, O Lord, according to my Righteouſneſs, and According to mine Integrity that is in me,</hi> And Pſ. 18.20, <hi>The LORD rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me according to my Righteouſneſs, according to the cleanneſs of my Hands hath he recompenſed me.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> in theſe Places is not ſpeaking of the Juſtification of his Perſon before God, as it that were the Effect of his Righteouſneſs; but of God's Kindneſſes to him in the courſe of his Providence; eſpecially, in delivering him from his unjuſt Enemies, and exalting him above them. This is what he means by <hi>being rewarded according to his Righteouſneſs.</hi> And by <hi>his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> he, particularly, means his Righteouſneſs in the cauſe between him and his Enemies, that he had given them no juſt Provocation, and in a meek becoming manner he had bore all their unjuſt and cruel Treatment. And ſo, in the 7<hi>th Pſalm</hi> (which was compoſed on the account of the wicked Words of <hi>Cuſh</hi> the <hi>Benjaminites</hi> againſt him, as you may ſee in the Title pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the <hi>Pſalm</hi>) he prays that God would, Judicially, in a way of Juſtice interpoſe between
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004117_0096_1003B38625B8A1A8"/>
him and his Enemies, and deliver him from them, as he was altogether innocent in the caſe, between them; and then he praiſes the LORD that he had done ſo, in the 18 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which was a <hi>Pſalm of Thanks-giving,</hi> when the Lord had delivered him from the Hand of <hi>Saul</hi> and all his Enemies. Theſe expreſſions of <hi>David</hi> are to be underſtood in the ſame ſenſe with thoſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.22.23.</p>
               <p>It is farther objected, <hi>that God has made ſincere Obedience the Condition of our obtaining eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and has made many glorious Promiſes to it.</hi> It's true, there are many precious Promiſes made to the Godly, and to them only; but they are made to them thro' JESUS CHRIST, and upon the account of his Mediation. And they are made to the Godly, and none elſe, becauſe all thoſe that are Juſtified thro' the Redemption that is in JESUS Chriſt, and none elſe, are Godly; and hence, tho' the Promiſe of eternal Life is not given to any, but only upon the account of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, yet it is made to the Qualification of ſincere Piety; becauſe only they who are ſincerely Pious have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Righteouſneſs, and are Juſtified by it; and their Sanctification and Holineſs is the ſure and only Evidence of their Juſtification, whereby they can diſcover their Title to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have been at to glorifie him here, and the more they have ſuffered on that account, the greater ſhall their Glory be hereafter, 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 4.17. which may be a very moving Encouragement to them: But it was not any goodneſs in them which at firſt gave them a Title to the Heavenly Glory; That they obtained only thro' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers Righteouſneſs; tho' for their higher degrees of Holineſs and Serviceableneſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they ſhall receive the gracious and undue Reward of a higher Glory in the other Life: But what is all this to the delivering of the Soul firſt out of his Condemned State, the freeing him from his Guilt and Obligation to the Puniſhment of Hell, and making him an Heir of God? What is all this to the anſwering the Demands of the Law for him, both in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Penalty; all which is done for him in his Juſtification. Sure I am, the Scriptures never attribute this to any Righteouſneſs in us; no, not to the goodneſs of the holieſt Man on Earth, but only to the Righteouſneſs and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Obedience of our dear Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>Once more; Many to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, are ready to ſay, <hi>that we muſt be Juſtified by our own Righteouſneſs, becauſe at the laſt Day we ſhall be judged and rewarded according to our Works.

And, notwithſtanding ſuch as have been more Eminent in Holineſs ſhall receive a more Glorious Reward; yet it is a reward, not of Debt, but of Grace: And (as I have, but now, ſhow'd you) is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus I have Conſidered ſome of the moſt Material and common Arguments that are made uſe of to maintain Juſtification by a Perſonal Inherent Righteouſneſs, and proven, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained that Way.</p>

poſitively and really depends upon the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, for his reconciliation and Peace with GOD. Juſtifying faith conſiſts not only of negatives: The true Believer, as he rejects all other dependance, ſo, he poſitively, with a ſweet Satiſfaction of Soul reſts on Jeſus Chriſt. By a poſitive real Act of his Soul he lays hold on him, as the only ſure Foundation and Pillar for his ſinking Soul to be ſupported and upheld by: So the Church is repreſented, <hi>Can.</hi> 8.5. leaning upon her beloved.</p>
            <p>That I may more fully open up to you the Nature of <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> as it is revealed in the holy Scriptures, I ſhall briefly ſhow you,</p>

            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> you muſt conſider, the Terms here generally made uſe of to ſignifie the Souls acting of Faith on Chriſt, are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a Corporal Senſe; as when we conceive of the leaning of one Body upon another. We cannot, in this groſs notion, lean or reſt on Chriſt; But the Believer relies upon Chriſt by
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:004117_0109_1003D02786C6A268"/>
the Aſſent of his Mind, and the free Conſent of his Will. In theſe two Acts of the Soul, is compriſed the whole of <hi>ſaying Faith.</hi> His Aſſent is nothing elſe but his firm belief and certain undoubted Perſwaſion of the Truth of theſe things which God has revealed in the Goſpel, eſpecially concerning his Undone Condition by Sin, and abſolute need of a Saviour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Way of Recovery and Salvation thro' the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt only. Theſe great Truths he certainly and firmly believes, with a particular Application to himſelf, ſo as to be anſwerably affected by them; he ſo believes them as to feel the Power of them upon his Heart, producing thoſe Affections and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they have a native tendency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in him, and which the true Belief of them will certainly effect. In this aſſent is neceſſarily included a diſtinct Knowledge, of the Things believed. The blind implicite Faith which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Teach as ſufficient to Salvation (<hi>viz.</hi> if Perſons do but believe as the Church believes, <hi>i. e.</hi> if they believe that the Church believes Right, tho' they don't know one thing diſtinctly which the Church does believe) is of no value. It is altogether inſufficient to ſanctifie the Heart, not having the leaſt rational Tendency, as a means, that way: whereas a true Faith purifies the Heart. <hi>Acts</hi> 15, 9. And overcomes the World, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5, 4. Alſo, it makes the Soul Spiritual and Heavenly, that before was Baſe and Earthly, led away with the Honours, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits

and ſordid Pleaſures of the World; it breaks the Intereſt which theſe Things of the World had in the Heart; but ſurely a blind Faith, without the Knowledge of Goſpel-Truths, can never Effect this; it is by beholding in the Goſpel, as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord, that the Soul is changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord, according to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 18 There can be no true Faith in Chriſt without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Knowledge of the Subſtance of the Goſpel. The Perſon that believes in Chriſt, perceives and underſtands that it is the Report of the Goſpel, and as firmly believes it to be God's Truth, that he is a guilty and condemned Creature by the Law of God which he has broken, helpleſs and undone in himſelf, that the only way of Relief is thro' the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of JESUS Chriſt; there he muſt come, and have an Intereſt in it, or periſh: He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends that Chriſt has laid no Bar againſt him in the Goſpel, more than others, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf a Saviour to the moſt Guilty, Wretched and Undone.</p>
            <p>And, then, the ſecond and Compleating Act of Faith is the Conſent of the Will, whereby the poor and humbled Sinner freely conſent, and Chearfully Complies to take Chriſt for his Saviour; and to lean the whole weight of his guilty Soul and all his Eternal Concerns upon him. The Perſon, ſeeing his Condemned Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

poor in Spirit, altogether ſtrip'd, and left quite empty of all hopes of Relief from himſelf: And, ſeeing the way of Salvation thro' Chriſt, which is revealed in the Goſpel, he heartily cloſes with it, and, by a ſenſible lively Act of his Soul receives Chriſt, and leans upon him for his only Saviour, with a ſweet Satisfaction he rolls over himſelf upon Chriſt to ſave him, thro' the Virtue of his Merits and continual Interceſſion, He is well pleaſed with this way of Salvation thro' Chriſt, and lays up all his hopes in him. And this Faith in Chriſt is not only a tranſient paſſing Act, but a ſettled Habit and abiding Principle in the Soul, which is often, more or leſs, in a ſenſible feeling Exerciſe, in a Believer's Heart; So that <hi>the whole Life which he now lives in the Fleſh, he lives by the faith of the Son of God, who loved him and gave himſelf for him,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
            <p>Now this Knowledge of the Truths of Gods Word, which diſcovers the miſerable Undone Condition of the Soul without Chriſt, and the Way of Salvation thro' his Mediation and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, with the Powerful Belief of them, and the hearty unfeigned Conſent of the Will to this Way of Salvation, whereby the Soul freely quits all other hold, and ſweetly rolls it ſelf over on <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Chriſt,</hi> is the ſubſtance and Sum of Saving Faith.

               </gap>ſts and leans on the Son of God, and him only for his Eternal Salvation, has his Eyes fixed upon his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone for it, and makes him the ground of

all his Hope, and the Foundation of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards God.</p>
            <p>From thoſe Things you may ſee the Reaſon, why this Grace is ſo frequently in Scripture expreſſed by the terms of <hi>Knowing, believing,</hi> and ordinarily by this Name of <hi>Faith,</hi> which properly ſignifies the <hi>Believing of ſome Doctrinal Propoſition</hi>; and not only by the terms of, <hi>leaning, depending, truſting,</hi> &amp;c. The Reaſon is, becauſe it conſiſts in a knowing and certain Belief of the Goſpel-Revelation of the Way of Salvation thro' Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, together with the Souls free and affectionate Compliance with it's And in this Faith, the Soul neceſſarily receives Chriſt for his Saviour, and reſts upon him.</p>

Lord JESUS; upon what Ground and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement he leans on Chriſt with ſuch Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Peace; ſo as, Rejecting all other Dependance, to adventure his guilty Soul wholly upon him. And in the firſt Place, <hi>Negatively,</hi> you muſt conſider, that he takes not his Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Conſideration of any peculiar Privileges, or Perſonal Righteouſneſs of his own, thinking thereby to recommend himſelf to Chriſt, or render himſelf any way worthy of his Righteouſneſs; for this is but a more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of ſeeking Juſtification by Works, by our own Righteouſneſs; and laying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it upon ſomething in our ſelves, and not entirely upon Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But, in the next Place <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> The Progreſs of Faith in Chriſt is much according to theſe ſeveral Steps, 1ſt. The Soul ſees that he is brought into a Miſerable and condemned State by Sin: That he is a moſt undone Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forever, unleſs he can find ſome way of Relief, wherein he ſhall obtain a full Removal of his awful Guilt, and total Diſcharge of his Obligation to Puniſhing and vindictive Juſtice, 2<hi>dly.</hi> He ſees and is ſure that there is no other way of Relief for him but thro' the Mediation and Righteouſneſs of the Redeemer Chriſt; according to the Scripture, and theſe places in particular, among others, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20 to 26.

thro' Chriſts Righteouſneſs; That GOD will receive him to his Love and Mercy, Poor, Wretched and Hell-deſerving as he is, in his beloved Son. And this Encouragement, and Ground of Truſt in Chriſt he takes, not from a conceit of any Worthineſs in himſelf or his own Doings (as I have but now ſaid) which will Recommend him to his Acceptance; But, from the All-ſufficiency and Fullneſs which he diſcovers in Chriſt himſelf, and the free Offers of him in the Goſpel. He ſees that Chriſt is an All ſufficient Saviour, able to ſave them to the utmoſt that come unto God by him; ſeeing he has offered himſelf for ſin, a Sacrifice of infinite Value; and poured out his Soul unto Death; and not only ſo, but, has riſen again from the Dead, and aſcended up into Glory, ſits at the Right Hand of the Majeſty on High, and now <hi>ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> He diſcovers likewiſe that Chriſt is fully and freely offered in the Goſpel, as a Saviour; to the moſt Unworthy and Hell-deſerving. As, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55 1. <hi>Ho, every one that Thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye buy and eat, yea, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price,</hi> Matt. 11, 28. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy lader, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Now, ſure, here is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough for the convinced Sinner to receive Chriſt; and a ſufficient Foundation for his Truſt in him And thus, the poor humbled Soul ſeeing that he is Miſerable and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004117_0118_1003D0500AB827E8"/>
Undone by Sin, and that there is no other way of Relief or Help for him, and a high Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, at leaſt, this way, conſidering the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Redeemer, and the Freeneſs of his Offer; He lets go all other Dependance, and Reſolves to venture himſelf entirely upon the Lord JESUS; to him he will cleave, and will not let him go; for there is none elſe that can help him; like a Man among the devouring Waves in the open Ocean that lays faſt hold upon a ſingle Plank that's by him, with which he will not part, utterly diſpairing of help any other way. The Caſe of the Soul in believing, ſometimes, is much like that of the four Lepers at the Gate of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when the City ſuffered a Seige from the Enemy without, and a cruel Famine within, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 57.3.4. <hi>There were four Leprous Men at the entring in of the Gate; And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nner ſees himſelf in the ſame ſtrait; but he has much more Ground offered him in the Goſpel to truſt in Chriſt for his Relief than theſe men had to confide in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Army; he conſiders, like them, that if he ſits ſtill where
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004117_0119_1003D05270E26398"/>
he is, he ſhall die; if he continues in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned State in which he is without Chriſt, he ſhall ſurely die; and if he goes any where elſe but to Chriſt, he ſhall die there; If he truſts to his own Righteouſneſs, depends upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Obedience and Reformation, that cannot ſave him, but he ſhall die there alſo. Thus being reduced to the greateſt Extremity, and upholding the Glorious Encouragement opened in the Goſpel of Relief and Help in Jeſus Chriſt, he joyfully lays hold on him for his Saviour, and there he reſts his weary Soul. And this is ſaving Faith, called, the <hi>Faith of Adherence</hi> or <hi>Dependance only,</hi> being ſhort of a bright and full Aſſurance; yet it has very precious and ſweet Effects: It cauſes the Soul to dart out the beams of a pure and tranſcendant Love to the Glorious God: It Introduces a ſweet Joy into the Soul, and brings a balmy Peace to the wounded Conſcience, in proportion to the degree of Faith and Truſt which the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in Jeſus Chriſt. I pray you to compare theſe things with the experiences of your own Souls, as I paſs along, and examine whether ever you have ſo received Chriſt. <hi>O Sirs</hi>! It is much to be truly ſenſible of your utter Undone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without Chriſt, and abſolute need of him, that nothing elſe can help the condemned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Without a ſenſe of this, it is impoſſible to come to Chriſt; the Soul is not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

renders the Sinner no way more worthy of Chriſt, yet it's neceſſary to put the Soul in the way to cloſe with Chriſt, and believe in him. It's neceſſary in order to the acting of Faith upon him. But to proceed,</p>

The GOD of Truth, who cannot deceive, has po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively promiſed, that whoſoever comes to Chriſt in this manner, and leans his guilty Soul wholly upon him, be he never ſo Vile.

<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004117_0121_1003D0544E803820"/>
upon him with the greater Confidence, for he has the ſure Word of God for his Warrant, the Infallible Promiſe of <hi>Jehovah</hi> for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Faith, When he has a ſight of this Security for his Acceptance in Chriſt, and the Acting of his Faith in Chriſt thereupon, is ſo full and ſenſible as to be clear to his own View, then it is the Faith of Aſſurance, and he is as ſure that GOD is reconciled to him in Chriſt, as that there is a God, or that himſelf lives upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>Thus, I have laid before you the Nature of a true and ſaving Faith: and from what has been ſaid upon it, you may conceive how humble, low and baſe in his own ſight a true Believer is: How deeply ſenſible of his Wretchedneſs and Poverty in himſelf. Hence you may ſee what a ſtrong and unſpeakable Love muſt needs fill his Heart to the Gracious God, who has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſuch a Remedy for ſo undone and vile a Creature. O Sirs, his Heart within him burns with the pureſt Love to the Dîvine Majeſty: How exceeding dear is Chriſt to his Soul! well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>To you that believe he is precious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. Chriſt is to him as <hi>the Apple Tree among the Trees of the Wood</hi>: His very Name is as <hi>Ointment poured forth, Cant.</hi> 3.4. What a ſweet Peace and Satisfaction poſſeſſes his Soul in leaning upon his Saviour! In a Word, how freely and fully does he give up himſelf to Chriſt, to ſerve him while he lives to be for him, and none elſe forever. And now,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:004117_0122_1003D05607F51818"/>2<hi>dly.</hi> I proceed to ſhow you the neceſſity of faith in Chriſt, in order to Juſtification thro' his Righteouſneſs. That it is indiſpenſibly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to this End, is beyond diſpute with all that underſtand and believe the Scriptures. But I am to conſider upon what account it is ſo neceſſary: what is the concern which it has in the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Sinner, upon the account of which he cannot be juſtified without it. Here then you muſt know that Faith is not concerned in Juſtification, as a Qualification that is any Way meritorious of it: Nothing has any Hand or part in Juſtification, as a Merit or Price, but the Righteouſneſs of the Lord JESUS, as I have ſufficiently made arpear, which is ſo full and ſufficient that nothing elſe is neceſſary this way. To Chriſt belongs the whole honour and praiſe of the Purchaſe of Salvation. But Faith is concerned in Juſtification, as the Hand or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which receives the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and applies it to the Soul, according to the wiſe Conſtitution and Appointment of God in the Goſpel. Upon this account it is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Juſtification. By Faith the Soul lays hold on Chriſt for its Saviour; and as the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receives Chriſt and depends upon his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the Lord then imputes his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs him; that is, he receives it for him, and accepts him upon the account of it, as fully as if he had produced a Righteouſneſs ſufficient of his own. The Lord now looks upon it as the Believer's Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eouſneſs, he having laid
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004117_0123_1003D05B971D9E28"/>
hold upon it, as his only Juſtifying Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and put all his hopes in it, This is the Way which the Lord, has appointed, for the Sinner's intereſt in Chriſt's Juſtifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> By his receiving and laying hold upon it by Faith: ſo that as ſoon may a Man be ſaved from drowning by a Plank in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without laying hold upon it, as ſoon may a Begger be enriched by an Alms offered him, without putting forth his Hand to receive it, as a Perſon can be Juſtified by Chriſt, without receiving him by Faith. And indeed, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon be expected that any ſhould be benefited by the Goſpel-Method of Grace and Salvation without their hearty Compliance with it: The Lord will ſave none in any way againſt their Wills; and none do conſent and agree to this Way of Salvation thro' Chriſt, which God has appointed, until they embrace Chriſt, and cloſe with him by Faith, but are ſtill for being ſaved ſome other Way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, <hi>O Sirs,</hi> there is no other Way in which you can be ſaved; and therefore, if you agree not unfeignedly to this, you are eternally Undone.

               <hi>Third</hi> General Head propoſed, which was, to lay before you ſomething of the Glory and Excellency of this Method which God has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the Juſtification of a condemned Sinner: it conſiſts you ſee of two parts: of <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Purchaſe</hi> upon Chriſts part and Faith in the ſame, on our part.

the beauty of it in both theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, as to the <hi>Meritorious cauſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, the Obedience and Suffering of the Son of God</hi>: This is certainly a Scheme every way worthy of God to project for the Recovery of a Fallen and Condemned Creature; for in it his adorable Perfections receive a very Glorious Diſplay. How glorious does his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom appear in it! The Law of God, or the firſt Covenant Treaty of God with Man, requires a perfect Obedience in all things, and at all times, as the Condition of Eternal Life; Thie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition muſt be fulfilled; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Eternal Life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained; but Mankind has here uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally come ſhort, and ſo is condemned to a privative Miſery, the loſs of Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs forever. And as upon conſideration of the bare non-performance of the Condition of Life, Man is ſhut out of Heaven, and deprived of a a glorious Immortality by this firſt Covenant; ſo, upon conſideration of his tranſgreſſing the Law of GOD, he is by the Law, according to the tenor of this Covenant, condemned to that poſitive Puniſhment which his Sin deſerves, which is very dreadful and unſpeakable, and which muſt be ſuſtained. Now Man is utterly incapable to anſwer theſe Demands of the Law for his Recovery; and there is no other Creature able to anſwer the Law for him, nor willing to undertake it: Which Way then ſhall the Law be anſwered, and yet the Sinner relieved? He can not anſwer it himſelf any other Way
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:004117_0125_1003D05D1DC619D0"/>
than by ſuffering Eternally: And ſuppoſing he could in a limited duration bear all that poſitive Puniſhment which the Law doomed him to, for his Sin, yet he could have no acceſs to the glorious everlaſting Enjoyment of GOD; becauſe he had failed in his Obedience, and not fulfilled the Condition upon which this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was promiſed: O then how ſhall both the Law be anſwered, and the poor Sinner ſaved! Would not this one Queſtion have put the whole Creation to ſilence? and eternally Non-plus'd the higheſt reach of Creature-Thought? The Reſolution of it exceeds the utmoſt bounds of all Creature-Invention. It would appear utterly impoſſible that the Law could be anſwered any other way than by the Sinners falling a Sacrifice to vindictive Juſtice. But, <hi>O Sirs,</hi> behold and admire the aſtoniſhing Wiſdom of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whereby he has made fooliſh the Wiſdom of the World: The Second Perſon in the glorious Godhead, the eternal Son of God, who is God equal with the Father, takes upon him our Nature, a human body and Soul into a Perſonal Union with himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and thereby becomes capable of fulfilling the Law which Sinners had broken, and bearing its awful Penalty; and the infinite Dignity of his Perſon adds an infinite Value to his Mediation; So that the Law is fully anſwered in the utmoſt of its Demands, and a door of Hope opened for Guilty and Wretched Creatures.
