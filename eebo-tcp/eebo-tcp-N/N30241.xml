            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I NEED make no Apology for troubling your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with this. As your Lordſhip was pleaſed to make me the chief Subject Matter of your <hi>laſt Paſtoral Letter,</hi> I think it my Duty to anſwer it in the beſt Manner I can.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is to be highly commended, for the Care you have taken in Watching over the Souls of thoſe who are committed to your Lordſhip's Charge— <hi>Luke-warmneſs</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> are the two Rocks, againſt which even well-meaning People are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſplitting. All ought to be Thankful to that Pilot, who will teach them to ſteer a ſafe and middle Courſe.—I would gladly hope, that <hi>a Zeal for God in the Diſcharge of your Duty, and a hearty Concern for the Safety of Souls</hi> moved your Lordſhip to write.— Theſe are the Principles, I truſt, which now excite me to direct this Anſwer to your Lordſhip. And, bleſſed be God, that I can write with ſomewhat of that Love and Meekneſs which becomes a Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, and with all that Humility and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which is due from a Presbyter to a Biſhop of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lukewarmneſs</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> my Lord, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Bane of true Chriſtianity. I thank your Lordſhip again for your kind Cautions againſt them. The only Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery is,
<q>Whether there was any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for your Lordſhip's warning the People of your Dioceſs againſt running into either of theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, upon account of any Thing I have either ſpoken or wrote?</q>
Your Lordſhip thinks there was,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040180_0003_10163308D5A7EE18"/>
and you quote Paſſages out of my Journal to prove it; if it can be proved, I will ask publick Pardon, both of your Lordſhip and Them with all my Heart.</p>
            <p>As for your Cautions againſt <hi>Lukewarmneſs,</hi> I am not much concerned in them. You do not ſeem to point at me in particular; unleſs it is where your Lordſhip, (<hi>Page</hi> 10) informs your People. <hi>That a diligent Attendance on the Duties of the Station where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Providence has placed them, is in the ſtricteſt Senſe, the ſerving of God.</hi> None but thoſe who condemn me unheard, can juſtly charge me with affirming to the contrary.</p>
            <p>However, I beg Leave to obſerve, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (<hi>Page</hi> 8) calls that a very imperfect State of Chriſtianity, which is no State of Chriſtianity at all. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 13. v. 5. ſays, <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, Prove your own ſelves.</hi> And that they might have a certain Rule, whereby to judge whether they were in the Faith, truly ſo called, or not, immediately adds, <hi>Know ye not your ownſelves how that Chriſt Jeſus is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</hi> So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule,
<q>He that finds, he has hitherto contented himſelf with a bare bodily At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon the Publick Worſhip of God, and following his daily Employment on other Days, and with abſtaining from the more groſs and notorious Acts of Sin, and from doing any Hurt or Injury to his Neighbour, and has reſted finally upon theſe as the Whole of that Chriſtianity requires of him,</q>
is ſo far from being in a very <hi>imperfect State,</hi> as your Lordſhip is pleaſed to affirm, (<hi>Page</hi> 8) that he is in no Stae of Chriſtianity at all. No, my Lord, he is a <hi>Reprobate, i. e.</hi> one who at preſent is out of a State of Salvation, nor can he ever have any Aſſurance that he is in a State of Salvation, till he <hi>Knows that Jeſus Chriſt is in Him, by the Indwelling of his Holy Spirit.</hi> If I have miſtaken your Lordſhip's Expreſſion, I will freely beg your Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:040180_0004_1016330BC08DC4F8"/>Another Thing, My Lord, to me ſeems darkly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in (<hi>Page</hi> 8) (Oh! let not your Lordſhip be angry, for indeed I will endeavour to ſpeak with all Gentleneſs and Humility) Your Lordſhip's Words are theſe, <hi>Nor need they any other Evidence beſides thoſe</hi> Good Diſpoſitions <hi>they find in their Hearts, that the Holy Spirit of God co-operates with their honeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſubdue Sin and grow in Goodneſs.</hi> If by <hi>Good Diſpoſitions,</hi> your Lordſhip only means <hi>Good Inclinations or Deſires,</hi> I deny <hi>That</hi> to be a ſufficient Evidence, that <hi>the Spirit of God co-operates with their honeſt Endeavours to ſubdue Sin and grow in Goodneſs.</hi> For there is a great Difference between <hi>Good Deſires</hi> and <hi>Good Habits.</hi> Many have <hi>One,</hi> who never attain to the <hi>Other.</hi> Many have good Deſires to ſubdue Sin, and yet reſting in thoſe good Deſires, Sin has always had Dominion over them. A Perſon ſick of a Fever may deſire to be in Health, but that Deſire is not Health itſelf. In like Manner many have good Diſpoſitions or Deſires to be Good, but that is not Goodneſs it ſelf. And conſequently Men need more Evidence than good Diſpoſitions, to prove to themſelves or others,
<q>That the Holy Spirit of God co operates with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Endeavours to ſubdue Sin.</q>
If by Good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, your Lordſhip means Good Habits wrought in the Heart by the Spirit of God, ſuch as <hi>Peace, Love, Joy, Long-ſuffering, Goodneſs, Truth,</hi> &amp;c. I then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree a Man needs no other Evidence. For theſe are the proper and genuine Fruits of the Spirit itſelf.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip immediately adds,
<q>Nor that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in their Courſe, and praying to God for his Aſſiſtance, and relying upon the Merrits of Chriſt for the Pardon of all ſuch Sins, Failings, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, as are more or leſs unavoidable in this mortal State.</q>
I beg leave to ask your Lordſhip, whether this does not favour too much of the common Divinity, viz. That we are to do ſomething for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or, in other Words, that we have partly a Righteouſneſs of our own, and that Jeſus Chriſt is to make UP the Deficiencies of that Righteouſneſs?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040180_0005_1016330DD8DFEB80"/>
What elſe can your Lordſhip Mean, by ſaying
<q>That we muſt rely on the Merrits of Chriſt, for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all ſuch Sins as are more or leſs unavoidable in this mortal State?</q>
Did Jeſus Chriſt come into the World, My Lord, only to ſave us from the Guilt of ſuch Sins as are more or leſs unavoidable in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal State? The Scriptures every where affirm, <hi>That Man hath no Righteouſneſs of his own: That there is none Righteous, no not one: That all Our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is as filthy Rags</hi>; and that Jeſus Chriſt died not only to ſave us from the Guilt of all ſuch Sins, Failings and Infirmites, as are more or leſs unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this mortal State, but from all willful Sins, and alſo from that original Corruption, which every Man naturally engendred of the Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> brings into the World with him. I hope I have not miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or overſtrained your Lordſhip's Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>I come now to your Lordſhip's Caution againſt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</hi> For that I ſuppoſe your Lordſhip intended more particularly againſt me.</p>
            <p>And here, my Lord, I beg leave to obſerve, That, in my Opinion, your Lordſhip has by no Means been clear enough in your Definition of the Word <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the fair Rules of Writing, was it not firſt Incumbent on your Lordſhip to ſhew, that the Word <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> had a good as well as bad Meaning: That it ſignifies no more than <hi>a Perſon in God,</hi> and conſequently every Chriſtian, in the proper Senſe of the Word, is an <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi>? For St. <hi>Peter</hi> writes, <hi>That to us are given exceeding great and precious Promiſes, that by theſe we might be Partakers of the divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our Church ſays, If we receive the Sacrament worthily, we are one with Chriſt and Chriſt with us, we dwell in Chriſt and Chriſt in us. For which ſhe has ſufficient Warrant from our Lord's Prayer, John 17.20. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on Me through their Word.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040180_0006_1016331099A08818"/>
Father art in me and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>I in them and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>That the Love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them and I in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed your Lordſhip's Definition of <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm,</hi> when examined, does not convey any ill Idea at all.
<q>
                  <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> is a ſtrong Perſwaſion on the Mind, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, by immediate Impulſes and Impreſſions of the Spirit of God.</q>
Had your Lordſhip ſaid, a ſtrong, but Groundleſs, Perſwaſion, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, it would have been to your Lordſhip's Purpoſe. But to affirm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reſtriction, that a ſtrong Perſwaſion that we are guided in an extraordinary Manner by immediate Impulſes, is <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> in the worſt Senſe of the Word, when your Lordſhip yourſelf ſays, (<hi>Page</hi> 54)
<q>There is no doubt but God, when he pleaſes, can work upon the Minds of Men by extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,</q>
to me ſeems a little inconſiſtent.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip proceeds thus.
<q>And this is owing chiefly to the Want of diſtinguiſhing aright between the ordinary and extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit. The extraordinary Operations were thoſe by which the Apoſtles and Others, who were entruſted with the firſt Propagation of the Goſpel, were enabled to work Miracles, and ſpeak with Tongues in Teſtimony, that their Miſſion and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine were from God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, by extraordinary Operations, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip means the ſame as being guided in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Manner juſt above. And if ſo, according to your Lordſhip's own Definition, I am no <hi>Enthuſiaſt.</hi> For I never did pretend to theſe extraordinary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of working Miracles of ſpeaking with Tongues, in Teſtimony that my Miſſion and Doctrine were from God; I only lay claim to the ordinary Gifts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit, which your Lordſhip. (<hi>Page</hi> 20) ſays, '<hi>Still continue.</hi>' And what Need was there
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040180_0007_1016331431BEC1A8"/>
then, my Lord, that the People of your Dioceſe ſhould be Cautioned againſt <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> on my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</p>
            <p>But your Lordſhip farther adds, the ordinary Gifts, However real and certain in themſelves, are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcernable than by their Fruits and Effects. Had your Lordſhip ſaid, No otherwiſe diſcernable to others than by their Fruits and Effects, it would have been right. But if your Lordſhip means they are no otherwiſe diſcernable to ourſelves, in my Opinion it is wrong: For it is poſſible, my Lord, for a Perſon to feel and diſcern theſe ordinary Gifts and Influences of the Spirit in himſelf, when there is no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of diſcovering them to others. For Inſtance, on Suppoſition that your Lordſhip was aſſiſted by the bleſſed Spirit in writing your Paſtoral Letter—might not your Lordſhip be ſenſible of an inward Joy and Complacency, wrought by that ſelf ſame Spirit, which was not then diſcernable to others? So likewiſe it is poſſible for another to feel Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, with the reſt of his Fruits, which at that Time may not be diſcernable to others; and which they who have never experienced the like may not believe, though a Man declare it unto them. I hope, my Lord, theſe Reaſonings carry with them their own Evidence.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, (<hi>Page</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) your Lordſhip has taken Pains to collect ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out of the publick Liturgy, to prove the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Regeneration or our New-Birth, to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Your Reaſon for ſo doing, appears (<hi>Page</hi> 25)
<q>to arm your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt any Suggeſtions, as if our Church were regardleſs of the Doctrine of Regeneration and New-Birth, as if there were Need for any Member of it to ſeek elſewhere for a more Spiritual Service.</q>
If this, my Lord, was intended to arm your People againſt any ſuch Suggeſtions made by me; indeed your Lordſhip does not do me Juſtice. As your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I find, has done me the Honour to peruſe my third Journal, your Lordſhip may remember this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040180_0008_10163315EAA54450"/>
(<hi>Page</hi> 39) that, after I had baptized an Adult, I proved the Neceſſity of the New-Birth, from the Office of our Church.</p>
            <p>In my Sermon upon the <hi>Indwelling of the Spirit of God,</hi> which I have made bold to ſend your Lordſhip with this Letter, you will find I have quoted the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our own Church Offices, to prove the Doctrine of the New-Birth, as your Lordſhip does in your Paſtoral Letter. My conſtant Way of preaching is, firſt, to prove my Propoſitions by Scripture, and then to illuſtrate them by the Articles and Collects of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Thoſe that have heard me, can Witneſs, how often I have exhorted them to be conſtant at the publick Service of the Church. I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on it my ſelf, and would read the Publick Liturgy every Day, if your Lordſhips Clergy would give me Leave. What further Satisfaction can your Lordſhip require, that I do not ſuggeſt to your Lorſhip's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<q>as if our Church were regardleſs of the Doctrine of Regeneration and New-Birth, and as if there were Need for any Member of it, to ſeek elſewhere for a more Spiritual Service?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the following Paragraph, your Lordſhip has the ſame Inſinuation, as though I wanted to introduce Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Prayer, and to lay aſide the publick Liturgy of our Church. For after your Lordſhip had been ſpeaking againſt Praying by the Spirit, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the Scripture no where tells us, that Prayer is the ſingle Work of the Spirit, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſays to your People, <hi>You have great Reaſon to be thankful to God for a publick Service prepared to your Hands.</hi> My Lord, I never ſaid to the Contrary. But does not your Lordſhip ſeem to inſinuate at the ſame Time, that we are not to depend on the Spirit of God to enable us to pray Extempore, either in Publick or Private? That Prayer is not the ſingle Work of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own, I readily confeſs. But that the Spirit of God does aſſiſt true Chriſtians to pray Extempore now, as well as formerly, is undeniable if the Scriptures be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040180_0009_101633179B439D40"/>
true. For what ſays the Apoſtle? <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Interceſſion for us with Groanings, that cannot be uttered.</hi> And this is founded upon a general Promiſe made to all Gods People. <hi>Zacharias</hi> 12.10, <hi>I will pour upon the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>the Spirit of Grace and of Supplication.</hi> And I believe, my Lord, we may appeal to the Experience of all true Chriſtians, whether or no they did not find the Spirit of Supplication, or a Power of Praying without a Form, encreaſe in Proprotion to the encreaſe of God's Grace or Holy Spirit in their Hearts. This is all, my Lord, that I pretend to: And where is the Impropriety of this, when your Lordſhip confeſſes in the ſame Page, <hi>that the Spirit of God does parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly aſſiſt us, in a due Performance of Religious Offices?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, as your Lordſhip ſeems to deny the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit in our particular Addreſſes at the Throne of Grace, ſo your Lordſhip ſeems to deny it alſo in our particular Actions.
<q>In like Manner, your Lordſhip ſays, we are firmly perſwaded in general, that we live under the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Influence of God's Holy Spirit, and that he both excites and enables us to do Good. But that this or that Thought or Action is an Effect of the ſole Motion or immediate Impulſe of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own Mind.</q>
My Lord, whoever affirmed, that there was no Co-operation of our own Minds, together with the Impulſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God? Your Lordſhip adds,
<q>Or that the Holy Spirit, and our natural Conceptions, do reſpectively contribute to this or that Thought or Actions, in ſuch a Meaſure or to ſuch a Degree; theſe are Things we dare not ſay.</q>
Indeed, my Lord, <hi>I dare ſay them.</hi> For if there be any ſuch Thing as a particular Providence, why may we not expect particular Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from God's Holy Spirit in particular Caſes? Does not our Church, my Lord, teach us to pray, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:040180_0010_101621E74D7B9578"/>
God's Holy Spirit may in all Things direct and rule our Hearts? But your Lordſhip ſays, <hi>We dare not ſay this, becauſe our Saviour has told us, that we know no more of the working of the Spirit, than we know of the Wind, from whence it commeth or whither it goeth.</hi> Neither need we know any more of them; but you muſt allow, that we know as much. Cannot your Lordſhip feel the Wind then? Does not your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip know when it makes any Impreſſion upon your Body? So eaſy it is for a Spiritual Man to know when the Holy Spirit makes an Impreſſion upon his Soul. Without acknowledging this, all the Expreſſions of being led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit, and ſuch like, muſt be only ſo many Words without any real Meaning. Your Lordſhip acknowledges, that the Holy Spirit does act in general, and why not in the particular Actions of our Lives alſo? For can the One be without the Other? Does it not frequently happen my Lord, that the Comfort and Happineſs of our whole Lives depend on one particular Action? And where then, my Lord, is the Abſurdity of ſaying, that the Holy Spirit may, even in the minuteſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, direct and rule our Hearts? I have been the more particular, my Lord, on this Part of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Letter, becauſe if this be proved, many of your Lordſhip's Objections againſt my Journals will fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 27. Your Lordſhip has the following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.
<q>God forbid that in this profane and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Age, every thing that has an Appearance of Piety and devotion, ſhould not be conſidered in the moſt favourable Light that it is capable of. But at the ſame Time, it is ſurely very proper, that Men ſhould be called upon for ſome reaſonable Evidence of a Divine Commiſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I take it for granted, that I am one of thoſe Men whom your Lordſhip thinks ſhould be called upon for ſome reaſonable Evidence of a Divine Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, what reaſonable Evidence does your Lordſhip require? Did I not receive Letters dimiſſory
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:040180_0011_10163320935AE520"/>
from your Lordſhip's own Hands to be ordained Prieſt? Did I not, when ordained Deacon affirm, <hi>That I was inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to take upon me that Office and Miniſtration?</hi> Did not my Lord of Glouceſter, when he ordained me Prieſt, ſay unto me, <hi>Receive thou the Holy Ghoſt, now committed unto thee by the Impoſition of our Hands, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> And is not this, my Lord, a reaſonable Evidence that I act by a Divine Commiſſion? If this be not true, muſt not all thoſe whom your Lordſhip, or the other Biſhops ordain, act only by a human Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Nay, (to uſe the Words of Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> in his Paſtoral Letter) <hi>Muſt not they who are ordained Lie not only unto Man but unto God, by ſaying,</hi> They are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhip in any wiſe diſputes my acting by a Divine Commiſſion, you diſclaim your own Divine Right and Authority; nor can you poſſibly avoid the Dilemma, of either allowing my Divine Commiſſion, or denying your own. After your Lordſhip has inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated a Demand for the Evidences of my Divine Commiſſion, immediately follows theſe Words, <hi>When they tell us of extraordinary Communications they have with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by extraordinary Communications, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip means the extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit, as working Miracles, and ſpeaking with Tongues; your Lordſhip may aſſure yourſelf, I never pretend to any Such Thing.—If, by extraordinary Communications, your Lordſhip means more Aſſiſtances and Comforts from God at ſome Times than I have at others, (which is all I mean by extraordinary Communications) I own the Charge. And what is there, my Lord, extraordinary in that?</p>
            <p>Again, your Lordſhip ſays, (<hi>Page</hi> 28) <hi>When they talk in the Language of thoſe who have a ſpecial and immediate Miſſion from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And does your Lordſhip, and the reſt of the Biſhops, ordain any without obliging them firſt to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040180_0012_10163322B749CB18"/>
give good Proofs, that they have a Special Call or Immediate Miſſion from God to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? If ever you ſo do, my Lord, do not your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip lay Hands too ſuddenly upon Men?</p>
            <p>(<hi>Page</hi> 29.) Your Lordſhip writes thus.—<hi>When they profeſs to think and act under the Immediate Guideance of a Divine Inſpiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And does not your Lordſhip think and act by the ſame Rule? Why otherwiſe does your Lordſhip Pray when you adminiſter the Holy Communion, <hi>that God would cleanſe the Thoughts of our Hearts by the Inſpiration of his Holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(<hi>Page</hi> 31) Your Lordſhip ſays, <hi>When they ſpeak of their Preaching and Expounding, and the Effects of them, as the ſole Work of a Divine Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And would your Lordſhip have me aſcribe any thing in the leaſt to myſelf?</p>
            <p>The Good that is done upon Earth, doth not God do it Himſelf? Does not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of ourſelves to think any thing as of ourſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God?</hi> And where then, my Lord, is the Abſurdity of aſcribing the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Expounding and Preaching to the ſole Work of a Divine Power?</p>
            <p>Again, (<hi>Page</hi> 33) <hi>When they boaſt of ſudden and ſurprizing Effects as wrought by the Holy Ghoſt, in Conſequence of their Preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, my Lord, is the Enthuſiaſm of ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion? Has your Lordſhip been a Preacher in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for ſo many Years, and have you never ſeen any ſudden or ſurpriſing Effects conſequent upon your Lordſhips Preaching? Was this my Caſe, ſhould I not have Reaſon to doubt, my Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had any more than a bare human Commiſſion? Or might I not take up the Prophet's Lamentation, <hi>Oh my Leaneſs, my Leaneſs</hi>! My Lord, the Goſpel, like its Author, is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day and forever; and, if preached as it ought to be, will prick Numbers to the Heart, and extort the Cry of the trembling Goaler, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040180_0013_1016332541D64A88"/>
ſurely Now, as it did Seventeen Hundred Years ago.</p>
            <p>Theſe then are the ſudden and ſurprizing Effects, my Lord, I always deſire to have, and heartily pray God your Lordſhip and all your Clergy may always ſee ſuch Effects in Conſequence of their Preaching.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Page</hi> 34) <hi>When they claim the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have ſaid about my Succeſs, God has been pleaſed to fiulfil already. What I have ſaid about Sufferings, they who without Cauſe are my Enemies, are fulfilling daily. And as for the Promiſes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in my Journal, I freely own there are ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promiſes which God has ſo ſtrongly impreſſed and does ſtill impreſs on my Heart, that I verily believe they will be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Page</hi> 35.) <hi>When they ſpeak of themſelves in the Language, and under the Character of Apoſtles of Chriſt, and even of Chriſt himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I am not to ſpeak in an Apoſtolical Language, why did my Lord of Glouceſter give me an Apoſtolical Commiſſion, <hi>Whoſe Sins thou doſt forgive, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; and whoſe Sins thou doſt retain, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi> And I hope, my Lord, uſing the Words which Jeſus Chriſt uſed, is not taking upon me the Character of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Page</hi> 36.) <hi>When they profeſs to plant and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a New Goſpel, as unknown to the generality of Miniſters and People in a Chriſtian Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, my Lord, in one Senſe, mine is a New-Goſpel, and always will be Unknown to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Miniſters and People, even in a Chriſtian Country, if your Lordſhip's Clergy follow your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Directions. For what ſays your Lordſhip (Page 46.) <hi>I hope that when Miniſters 'Preach to you of Juſtification by Faith alone, which is aſſerted in the ſtrongeſt Manner by our Church, they explain it in ſuch a Manner as to leave no doubt upon your Mind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Works are a neceſſary Condition of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified in the Sight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:040180_0014_10163327BA7FB928"/>But pray, my Lord, where has the Scripture made good Works a Neceſſary Condition of our being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Sight of God? St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved, thro' Faith, not of Works, and that leaſt any Man ſhould boaſt; for Eternal Life is the Gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip exhorts your Clergy to preach Juſtification by Faith alone, and quotes the 11th Article of our Church, which tells us, <hi>we are juſtified by Faith only, and not for our own Works or Deſervings.</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">See the <hi>11</hi>th, <hi>12</hi>th, and <hi>13</hi>th Articles of our Church</note> At the ſame time your Lordſhip bids them, <hi>explain it in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to leave no Doubt upon their Minds, whether good Works are a neceſſary Condition of their being juſtified in the ſight of God.</hi> Your Lordſhip, in my Opinion, could not well be guilty of a greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency. This, my Lord, is truly a New Goſpel. I am ſure it is not what the Apoſtles Preached; and it is as contrary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Doctrine of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Tenour of the Goſpel, as Light is contrary to Darkneſs. Had your Lordſhip inſiſted on your Clergy's preaching up good Works as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Fruit and Conſequence, inſtead of a neceſſary Condition of our being juſtified, your Lordſhip would have uſed your Authority aright. For we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſhew forth or declare to others, that we have a True Faith by our Works. And the 12th Article of our Church ſays, <hi>that Good Works follow after Juſtification</hi>; and how then, my Lord, are they <hi>a neceſſary Condition of our Juſtification?</hi> No, my Lord, Salvation (if the Goſpel be true) is the free Gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt. Faith is the Means whereby that Salvation is applied to our Hearts, and good Works are the neceſſary Fruits and Proof of that Faith.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, This is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and it is becauſe the generality of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do not Preach this Doctrine, that I am

reſolved, God being my Helper, to continue inſtant in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, to declare IT unto all Men, let the Conſequence, as to my own private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be what they will.</p>
            <p>As for your Lordſhips's blaiming me for raſhly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Clergy for their Practice, none are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned but my <hi>Indolent, Earthly-minded, Pleaſure-taking</hi> Brethren, (<hi>Page</hi> 39.) And ſurely your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will not ſtand up in their Defence.

            <p>Would Time permit, I could now proceed to ſatisfy your Lordſhip more particularly about the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Benjamin Seward</hi>; but as that is done in a Letter ſent to my Lord of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and publiſhed in my laſt Journal; and as I am now to embark in a few Hours, I hope your Lordſhip will excuſe me, if I only add my hearty Prayers for your Lordſhip's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal Welfare, and ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>
