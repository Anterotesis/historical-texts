            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that there are ſo many Reprobates, at a Time when there are ſo many fine Men to lead them into Light;</q> when perhaps the Fellow they have been commending, is no more than a poor Taylor, ſprung from a Shopboard; or an inſpired Snob, who has ſold his Awl and Ends to purchaſe a few of Mr. — Sermons, from which he can bawl out—<hi>Fly! fly! fly to the Mountains! Death, Hell, Revenge! the Devil is at your Heels!</hi>—and ſuch like blaſphemous Stuff, is all that comes from them; by which they take in the Ignorant and Unwary, deceive the Silly, and lead away many fooliſh Women, who are oftener inſpired with the outward than the inward Man.</p>

whiningly and confuſedly, as in a Scavenger's Shovel, and ſcatters them abroad; Free-will being canted off the Corner of the ſame. This is the Marrow of Methodiſm! Bigotry is the main Beam, ſupported by Stupidity;—for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that would draw Crowds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together to hear,—to hear what? nothing at all—to hear an old Woman; for their very Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is no more, as I ſhall in its proper Place prove, from a late Diſcourſe<note n="*" place="bottom">At Phil—el—ia.</note>.—Incoherent, Phraſes, Sham-crying, and Diſtortion of Phiz, with bawling out, <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> ten Times in a Sentence, and a little Memory, are the Qualifications, and the only ones, neceſſary for a Methodiſt Preacher.</p>

I'm forced to ſay, I have very lately heard many abſolute Contradictions, and little leſs than Untruths from thence! But it is no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if we will but conſider who it comes from: A Man as I ſaid before, who delights in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diviſions, tramples on Order; dubbs a Man a Prieſt (As Kite ſays of a Gentleman) in the drawing of a Triger.—The Prieſthood, by all ſenſible People, at all Times, was looked upon as ſacred; and it is declared to be ſo both in the Old and New-Teſtament: For Inſtance,<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Numb. xvith Chapter.</note> 
               <hi>Korah, Dathin,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were ſwallowed up, and two hundred and fifty burnt for pretending to aſſume the Office! We likewiſe read in the New-Teſtament that certain Perſons<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Acts xix, 14.</note> ſeeing the Miracles performed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Name of our bleſſed Lord, endeavoured (tho' vainly) to aſſume the ſame Authority, and made uſe of the Name of the Apoſtles, and that of our Saviour, to caſt out Devils.—The Conſequence was; the Man in whom the evil Spirit was, overcame them and made them fly ſtark naked and wounded; and theſe were ſeven in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. A Man would think, that two ſuch Marks of the divine Wrath, given at two different Times, and to different People, and ſo great a Period between, was ſufficient to deter any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from aſſuming the like again; as any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul muſt expect and know, that, ſooner or later the divine Hand, at his own appointed Time, would puniſh ſuch Audaciouſneſs, and

not let ſuch glaring Crimes paſs with Impunity.</p>
            <p>Many more Inſtances might be brought to prove the Sacredneſs of the Prieſthood, but I ſhall only mention an Injunction of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, who foreſaw the Diviſions that would happen; it may be called a Prophecy, which in this Age, is fully verified,—it runs thus: <q>Now I beſeech you Brethren, mark them which cauſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctine which ye have learned, and avoid them.— For they that are ſuch ſerve not our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but their own Belly, and by good and fair Speech deceive the Hearts of the Simple.<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Romans xvi, <hi>17</hi> and <hi>18.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That Methodiſm (as they call it) is a Doctrine contrary to what we have been taught, is very certain; that it cauſes Diviſions and Offences is as true; for what we have from the Holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the Apoſtles, and all regular Divines, is Holineſs, Humility, Meekneſs, and Salvation for all Mankind that follow its glorious Precepts. Mr. — and his Crew of P—k-P—ts, deals Damnation round the World, ſends Souls to Hell, that when living, their Bodies was not a Span long!<note n="(k)" place="bottom">At London, Portſmouth, &amp;c.</note> Preaches abſolute Predeſtination; damns a Man before he is born; denies it when called upon; falls into the ſame again, and yet is credited by many ſimple Ones.</p>
            <p>That they are Miniſters of their <hi>Own Bellies,</hi> is as certain as their falſe Doctrine: For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; A certain Man beging or (rather Robing)

the World under Pretence of an O—n-H—e in G—a, and putting it in his Purſe. It is true, there is ſuch a Houſe, but it is affirmed, that there is not above ſix People in it. A fine Place to build ſuch a Houſe; amongſt Wolves and Bears! there may be O—'s enough of that kind. A fine Handle he made of it, and a very pretty Farce he acted. We have no Occaſion to go out of this Province for the Verity of this; for it is well known how he cram'd his Pockets at his Departure.— His Doctrine is full of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, Craft and Deſign; his Deſign being no other than plundering the Purſe, deceiving the Underſtanding; and, under Pretence of unite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Parties in one, ſets all Sectaries together by the Ears, that he may have an Oppertunity of picking up Pence from the Whole.</p>
            <p>It is well known that the ſame Perſon, when in a neighbouring Province,<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Boſton.</note> preached down the wearing of Rings and other Ornaments of Gold, declaring them to be <hi>a Prophanation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our bleſſed Lord;</hi> by which Means many weak People were induced to pull off thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and preſent them to him, as an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He very ſoon after, at a well known Place,<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Philadelphia.</note> recommended the wearing of Rings, as fit Ornaments for thoſe that were enligtened by the <hi>New-Birth;</hi> turned Ring-Merchant and ſold them!— The Lumber-Houſe, near T—m-Court, is, as it were, a Play-Houſe, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the Gallery without a Ticket.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Another Inſtance of the Belly;—An inſpired Taylor in the Iſle of Wight (a Prieſt of the <hi>New Light</hi>) often viſited an honeſt Farmer's Wife, in Abſence of the Huſband, under Prentence of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening her Underſtanding, and adminiſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual Comfort to her. One certain Day, his Viſit being over and Leave taken, he was met at the Door by the honeſt Man, who, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Coat ſtick out, demanded what he had under it? The <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Farmer ſhook him, and down droped a Gammon of Bacon! Fine Piety! the Fellow received a hearty Drubbing, the Courtecy of the Horſe-Pond, and loſt his Bacon; or rather the Farmer found his.</p>
            <p>I think this proves them Miniſters of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a Vengeance. Thoſe Facts alone, are ſufficient to prove them not Miniſters of the Goſpel; for, if we believe the Apoſtle before mentioned, we muſt look upon them as Deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Aliens, but they have every Mark about them foretold by that learned Diſciple; a ſmooth Tongue, a deceitful Heart, and leading away the Unwary and Simple, are Terms that juſtly belong to them. Mr. — has them all himſelf, and that to Perfection; and inculcates them firmly both in the Minds of his underling Ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berdaſhers, and nonſenſical Hearers.—They are likewiſe known to lead away many weak and ſimple Women; indeed all that follow them ought to be called ſo, for if they are not ſo at their firſt ſetting out, they will not follow him

long before they will be either mad, ſtupid, ſimple, or in Diſpair! Therfore I ſay, Beware, leſt you ſhould be obliged to build more Cells for poor Wretches, drove beſide themſelves by this pernicious Doctrine, or perhaps (which is worſe) have Occaſion to go there yourſelves.— The miſerable Effects that their mad, enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic, wild and rambleing Way of preaching has produced, cannot but be too well known in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Place where it has gained any Footing. It has cauſed Suicide in all its Shapes, inſtitigated ſome to hang, others to drown, others to cut the Throats of themſelves, ſome to burn Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and others to throw themſelves off of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, beſides filling Mad-Houſes, Hoſpitals and Jails: And it is no wonder it has this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if we conſider the Principles of <hi>abſolute Predeſtination,</hi> which leaves no Room for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for a poor Sinner, that by <hi>that</hi> was doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be damn'd five Thouſand Years before he was born;—he cannot, ſays the Enthuſiaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, no he was doomed a Reprobate from the Begining of Time. This is ſtrikeing hard at two of the nobleſt Attributes of the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Juſtice, and his Mercy. Yet this is the Doctrine that is taught by Methodiſm, and bellowed over the World, by a Sett of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that would better adorn the G-ll—s than a Pulpit. Their Chief, it is allowed has Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but his Judgment has been araigned, and found not weighty enough to regulate his mad and extravagant Fondneſs for Fame, which laſt

ſeems to be his ruling Principle. It is hardly known how far this Principle will carry thoſe who are enthuſiaſtically fond of it. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of reading of one of their Caſt of Mind, that ſet the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> on Fire, for no other Purpoſe but to endeavour to preſerve his Name to Poſterity; to defeat which, the Senate decreed his Name ſhould never be mentioned or wrote. I hope the Reader will pardon this Digreſſion. But to return: It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies not a Straw where they take their Text, for they ramble over the World, from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> from thence to <hi>Scotland, Virgnia, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Church, in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Kirk, and here every Thing, but good at Nothing, but ſowing Diſention and Diſcord; encouraging Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to run from their Huſbands, and Children from their Parents: Theſe are known Facts, and may be found in a certain Perſon's Journal. They make it their Buſineſs to whine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cloak of Religion (the greateſt Cloak in the World) to inſinuate themſelves into every Houſe that will let them; having gained Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, they ingratiate themſelves into the Favour of the Women, in order to introduce a <hi>Love-Feaſt;</hi> which is this, they meet in an

Evening at a Chriſtian Friend's Houſe by Pairs, and Feaſt both <hi>Spiritually</hi> and <hi>Temporally;</hi> it begins with Hymns and Spiritual Songs, and then a Lecture; after this they refreſh their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites with good wholeſome Viands; when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently (as by Accident) they are all left in the Dark, and then (if they Pleaſe) each may feaſt on their Partners. I do not imagine this <hi>Feaſt</hi> has made its entry here as yet; and ſome may doubt its Veracity, but I aſſure the Readers it is common in <hi>England,</hi> and we, who have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted behind the <hi>Grand Scenes,</hi> cannot but know the Craft and Deceit carried on there.</p>
            <p>The whole Plan is Craft and Deceit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though cloaked and blended with Superſtition, ever ſo cunningly, cannot eſcape a diſcerning Eye; or indeed any Eye that is not blinded by Enthuſiaſm.—I remember an eaſtern Proverb which I have formerly read;—ſays <q>its not good to jeſt with God, Death, or the Devil; for the Firſt neither can nor will be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Second mocks all Men, one Time or other; and the Third puts an eternal Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſm on all thoſe that are too familiar with him.</q>—That Methodiſm Jeſts with all three is very evident,—with our bleſſed Lord, in rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his holy Goſpel and making Diviſions and Offences in his Church, and tearing the ſacred Order, enjoined to be obſerved in it, all to Pieces. —They have amongſt them tore ſo large a rent in Religion, that its almoſt impoſſible to be repaired;—They jeſt with Death, in pretending
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009444_0012_0F749165DB8AC030"/>
to be always wiſhing for his Stroke, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it on the Inſtant; but I am perſuaded was he to make his grim Appearance, the ſtouteſt of them all would plead for a Reſpite,—They are continually jeſting with the Devil, for they are pretending to be conſtantly buffeting him from Place to Place, and from Poſt to Pillar. —Says one of them ſome Time ago; <hi>I have, (call me what they pleaſe) done ſome good in my Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; for I have drove the Devil out of</hi> Tat—ham <hi>Court, where he formerly kept his chief Reſidence, and have ſet up a Taber—e for</hi> Chriſt.—If he has drove Satan from thence, there ſtill remains deviliſh Works enough there: But its but very lately, one declared himſelf Turn-key of Hell; <hi>Says he, (after telling before, that we all deſerved Damnation) did any one tell you this Morning, when you was coming to hear me, that I ſhould preach Damnation to you! if they did I'll deceive you and them; I won't my dear Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I want to frighten you, but I will do it by ſhewing the Love of</hi> Chriſt! <hi>Had I a Mind to open Hell-Gates, I might frighten you for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but you would fall into the ſame Way again,</hi> —Query could he open them without a Key? Since I have mentioned this Remark, I ſhall be ſo bold as to make a few more on that famous Diſcourſe, in which, <hi>Deſign</hi> appeared thro' the Whole.—The very Prayer was ſuch; after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with one of our Collects, he began to pray for the <hi>Sectaries of whatever Denomination that their Paſtors might labour in the good Work
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009444_0013_0F7491666C125558"/>
and ſow good Seed, and that they would prepare the Ground for the ſame, ſo that it might grow, and ſome produce Twenty, ſome Fifty, and ſome an Hundred Fold;—then for the Reverend Gentleman of the Regular Churches; His Honour; the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, Magiſtrates, and all inferior Officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them;</hi> and who after that,—<hi>His Moſt Sacred Majeſty, the Royal Family, Privy Counſellors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> By which its plain to be ſeen, that in order to ingratiate himſelf in the Opinions of the Inhabitants of this City; he either forgot or trampled on the Duty he owed to his Majeſty; placing Conſtables, Bomb-Baily's, and even the Hangman before him; he would not have dared, bold as he is, to have ſaid this in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subject of the Diſcourſe is known to be the only Foundation we have to rely on, that of our Bleſſed Saviour.—But, in order to pleaſe ſome Sectaries, here he ſtruck a ſevere Blow at the very Foundation of Chriſtianity, I mean Baptiſm.—Theſe are his Words or the Purport of them.—<hi>Perhaps you think you are Chriſtians, becauſe you were baptized? Is that your Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is a watry Foundation; and did you ever know any Thing ſtand that was founded in the Water?</hi> its true, <hi>'Tis an Ordinance of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>but 'tis an Ordinance founded on Water:</hi> He then recommends us to obtain Chriſt in our Hearts, and, in his mad Way, inſiſts on all being of his Opinion; wiſhes for the Voice of an Arch-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to make all the World hear him at once.— And then he ſays, <hi>What you want to go to Heaven!
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009444_0014_0F74916730F6E598"/>
do you, for what? You imagine Heaven to be a fine Place I ſuppoſe? But its no ſuch Thing—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if you read the Revelations, you will there find it to be a fine Place; the Streets paved with Gold, and the Gates of Emerald and precious Stones: The avaritious Man would be glad to go to ſuch a Heaven, if he could unhinge the Gates and keep them to himſelf!—The Gameſter there too would be very well ſatisfied!—The Ladies would expect Balls and Aſſemblies there too; ſuch a Heaven as this would pleaſe the worldly Man, but Heaven is no ſuch Place.</hi>—It's allowed by thoſe that beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Works of St. <hi>John</hi> the Divine, that there is a Myſtery couched under this Sentence, that they were not able to penetrate the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: However, no Man of Senſe ever deny'd its being a fine Place; nor none was ever Fool enough to think he could unhinge and keep the Gates to himſelf: Its a Place prepared for for the juſt Men made perfect, where is promiſed Happineſs and Fullneſs of Joy for ever more, in Company with Chriſt and his Angels;—Would any Thing but a mad crack-brained Enthuſiaſt deny this being a fine Place? ſurely no; but they will affirm any Thing: For after taking a Trip to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and acquainting <hi>us with the laſt Moments of an inſpired young Clergyman, who was perfectly ſure of Thouſands and Thouſands of Crowns of immortal Glory being placed on his Head, in leſs than an Hour.</hi> He then tells us of <hi>a Woman in</hi> Virginia, <hi>who, twenty Year ago, when talking of the New-Birth, ſaid it muſt be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009444_0015_0F749167C86BDE58"/>
after this Life was ended: And of an inſpired young Man, whoſe laſt Words were, he was afraid the Foundation was not laid in his Father's Heart: Do, Sir, pray for my Father; that the Foundation may me laid in his Heart:</hi> He ſays, <hi>You will call this Enthuſiaſm I ſuppoſe! I wiſh all were ſuch Enthuſiaſts! But do you know what an Enthuſiaſt is? Enthuſiaſm is God in you!</hi> But I tell <hi>him</hi> he is miſtaken in his Definition: An Enthuſiaſt in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is one that vainly imagines he is inſpired by the Spirit of God; when he is only actuated by the Warmth of his own over-heated Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>After giving his Difinition of Enthuſiaſm, he ſnarls out <q>Would you go to Heaven with the Devil in your Bellies?</q>—Then we are led into a Garden to view <hi>"a fine Cobweb,"</hi> from thence to a <hi>Tyburn</hi> Execution; poor Lord <hi>F—s</hi> muſt be hauled over the Coals, and his Aſhes raked up to prove his Foundation;—jumbling and filling each Interval in a confuſed Manner with his "<hi>Love for Chriſt;</hi>—" and his <q>dear, dear Philadelphia.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, I am quite weary of repeating his Jargon; the whole being a Mixture of, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whimſical Salvation and abſolute Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.—</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome Perſons may think I have been too ſatiracal; but if they will but conſider what it was wrote for, I am perſuaded they will think there is not a drop too much Gall made uſe of.— The Deſign was to paint Methodiſm in its na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009444_0016_0F7491688CA263E8"/>
and odious Colours, in order to prevent its pernicious Effects ſpreading any farther. Glad ſhould I be could I live to ſee theſe Diviſions at an End, and thoſe Renagadoes return to the Church, eſtabliſhed by our noble Conſtitution. As a Member of the Church, I declare I am no Hypocrite, nor am I fond of Fame; but let us not be leſs than ourſelves, that is MEN. There is no Reaſon we ſhould be impoſed on by fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reports of deſigning Men, or give Credit or Faith to every credulous Fool.— It is hoped ſome abler Pen will take the Cauſe in Hand, ſo that an entire Stop may be put to it; in that Hope I reſt, and beg an impartial Judgment on this my firſt Eſſay.</p>
