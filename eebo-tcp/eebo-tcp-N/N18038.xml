            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>AS it is poſſible the mere Engliſh reader may have a different idea of romance from the author of theſe little volumes; and may conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expect a kind of entertainment not to be found, nor which was even intended, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages; it may not be improper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a few words concerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to have ſeen hitherto attempted in our language.</p>
                  <p>THE EPIC, as well as the DRAMA, is divided into tragedy and comedy. HOMER, who was the father of this ſpecies of poetry, gave us a pattern of both theſe, though that of the latter kind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loſt; which Ariſtotle tells us, bore the ſame relation to comedy which his Iliad bears to trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And perhaps, that we have no more inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it among the writers of antiquity, is owing to the loſs of this great pattern, which had it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, would have found its imitators equally with the other poems of this great original.</p>
                  <p>AND farther, as this poetry may be tragic or comic, I will not ſcruple to ſay it may be likewiſe either in verſe or proſe: for tho' it wants one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which the critic enumerates in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent parts of an epic poem, namely metre; yet, when any kind of writing contains all its other parts, ſuch as fable, action, characters, ſentiments,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023370_0003_0FBF3B0646525110"/>
and diction, and is deficient in metre only; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſeems, I think, reaſonable to refer it to the epic; at leaſt, as no critic hath thought proper to range it under any other head, or to aſſign it a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar name to itſelf.</p>
                  <p>THUS the Telemachus of the archbiſhop of Cambray appears to me of the epic kind, as well as the Odyſſey of Homer; indeed, it is much fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more reaſonable to give it a name common with that ſpecies from which it differs only in a ſingle inſtance, than to confound it with thoſe which it reſembles in no other. Such are thoſe voluminous works, commonly called Romances, namely, Clelia, Cleopatra, Aſtraea, Caſſandra, the Grand Cyru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and innumerable others, which contain, as I apprehend, very little inſtruction or entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Now a comic romance is a comic epic-poem in proſe; differing from comedy, as the ſerious epic from tragedy: its action bring more extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and comprehenſive; containing a much larger circle of incidents, and introducing a greater vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of characters. It differs from the ſerious ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance in its fable and action, in this; that as in the one theſe are grave and ſolemn, ſo in the other they are light and ridiculous: it differs in its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, by introducing perſons of inferior rank, and conſequently of inferior manners, whereas the grave romance ſets the higheſt before us; laſtly, in its ſentiments and diction; by preſerving the ludicrous inſtead of the ſublime. In the diction, I think, burleſque itſelf may be ſometimes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; of which many inſtances will occur in this work, as in the deſcription of the battles, and ſome
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023370_0004_0FBF3B070A0A2508"/>
other places, not neceſſary to be pointed out to the claſſical reader; for whoſe entertainment thoſe parodies or burleſque imitations are chiefly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> tho' we have ſometimes admitted this in our diction, we have carefully excluded it from our ſentiments and characters: for there it is never properly introduced, unleſs in writings of the burleſque kind, which this is not intended to be. Indeed, no two ſpecies of writing can differ more widely than the comic and the burleſque: for as the latter is ever the exhibition of what is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and unnatural, and where our delight, if we examine it, ariſes from the ſurpriſing abſurdity, as in appropriating the manners of the higheſt to the loweſt, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſo in the former, we ſhould ever confine ourſelves ſtrictly to nature, from the juſt imitation of which will flow all the pleaſure we can this way convey to a ſenſible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And perhaps there is one reaſon why a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic writer ſhould of all others be the leaſt excuſed for deviating from nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince it may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo eaſy for a ſerious poet to meet with the great and the admirable; but life every where fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes an accurate obſerver with the ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE hinted this little concerning burleſque; becauſe I have often heard that name given to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which have been truly of the comic kind, from the author's having ſometimes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in his diction only; which, as it is the dreſs of poetry, doth, like the dreſs of men, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh characters, (the one of the whole poem, and the other of the whole man) in vulgar opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any of their greater excellencies: but ſurely
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023370_0005_0FBF3B09465258E0"/>
a certain drollery in ſtile, where the characters and ſentiments are perfectly natural, no more conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the burleſque, than an empty pomp and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of words, where every thing elſe is mean and low, can entitle any performance to the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true ſublime.</p>
                  <p>AND I apprehend, my lord Shafteſbury's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of more burleſque agrees with mine, when he aſſerts, there is no ſuch thing to be found in the writings of the ancients. But perhaps, I have leſs abhorrence than he profeſſes for it: and that not becauſe I have had ſome little ſucceſs on the ſtage this way; but rather, as it contributes more to exquiſite mirth and laughter than any other; and theſe are probably more wholeſome phyſic for the mind, and conduce better to purge away ſpleen, melancholy, and ill affections, than is generally imagined. Nay, I will appeal to common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, whether the ſame companies are not found more full of good humour and benevolence, after they have been ſweetened for two or three hours with entertainments of this kind, than when ſoured by a tragedy or a grave lecture.</p>
                  <p>BUT to illuſtrate all this by another ſcience, in which, perhaps, we ſhall ſee the diſtinction more clearly and plainly: let us examine the works of a comic hiſtory-painter, with thoſe performances which the Italians call Caricatura; where we ſhall find the true excellence of the former to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the exacteſt copying of nature; inſomuch that a judicious eye inſtantly rejects any thing <hi>outrè</hi> any liberty which the painter hath taken with the features of that <hi>alma mater.</hi>—Whereas in the Caricatura we allow all licence. Its aim is to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023370_0006_0FBF3B0CC56ACB88"/>
exhibit monſters, not men; and all diſtortions and exaggerations whatever are within its proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                  <p>Now what Caricatura is in painting, Burleſque is in writing; and in the ſame manner the comic writer and painter correlate to each other. And here I ſhall obſerve, that as in the former the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeems to have the advantage; ſo it is in the latter infinitely on the ſide of the writer: for the Monſtrous is much eaſier to paint than deſcribe, and the Ridiculous to deſcribe than paint.</p>
                  <p>AND tho' perhaps this latter ſpecies doth not in either ſcience ſo ſtrongly affect and agitate the muſcles as the other; yet it will be owned, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a more rational and uſeful pleaſure ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to us from it. He who ſhould call the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hogarth a burleſque painter, would, in my opinion, do him very little honour: for ſure it is much eaſier, much leſs the ſubject of admiration, to paint a man with a noſe, or any other feature of a prepoſterous ſize, or to expoſe him in ſome abſurd or monſtrous attitude, than to expreſs the affections of men on canvas. It hath been thought a vaſt commendation of a painter, to ſay his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures ſeem to breathe; but ſurely it is a much greater and nobler applauſe, that they appear to think.</p>
                  <p>BUT to return—The Ridiculous only, as I have before ſaid, falls within my province in the preſent work.—Nor will ſome explanation of this word be thought impertinent by the reader, if he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders how wonderfully it hath been miſtaken, even by writers who have profeſs'd it: for to what but
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023370_0007_0FBF3B11616BA618"/>
ſuch a miſtake, can we attribute the many attempts to ridicule the blackeſt villainies; and what is yet worſe, the moſt dreadful calamities? What could exceed the abſurdity of an author, who ſhould write the comedy of Nero, with the merry incident of ripping up his mother's belly; or what would give a greater ſhock to humanity, than an attempt to expoſe the miſeries of poverty and diſtreſs to ridicule? And yet, the reader will not want much learning to ſuggeſt ſuch inſtances to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES, it may ſeem remarkable, that Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle, who is ſo fond and free of definitions, hath not thought proper to define the Ridiculous. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, where he tells it is proper to comedy, he hath remarked that villainy is not its object: but he hath not, as I remember, poſitively aſſerted what is. Nor doth the Abbe Bellegarde, who hath written a treatiſe on this ſubject, tho' he ſhews us many ſpecies of it, once traced it to its fountain.</p>
                  <p>THE only ſource of the true Ridiculous (as it appears to me) is affectation. But tho' it ariſes from one ſpring only; when we conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſtreams into which this one branches, we ſhall preſently ceaſe to admire at the copious field it affords to an obſerver. Now affectation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from one of theſe two cauſes; vanity or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy: for as vanity puts us on affecting falſe characters, in order to purchaſe applauſe; ſo hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy ſets us on an endeavour to avoid cenſure, by concealing our vices under an appearance of their oppoſite virtues. And tho' theſe two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are often confounded, (for there is ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in diſtinguiſhing them) yet, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023370_0008_0FBF3B1245E5B078"/>
from very different motives; ſo they are as clearly diſtinct in their operations, for indeed, the affectation which ariſes from vanity is nearer to truth than the other; as it hath not that violent repugnancy of nature to ſtruggle with, which that of the hypocrite hath. It may be likewiſe noted, that affectation doth not imply an abſolute negation of thoſe qualities which are affected: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' when it proceeds from hypocriſy, it be nearly allied to deceit; yet when it comes from vanity only, it partakes of the nature of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for inſtance, the affectation of liberality in a vain man, differs viſibly from the ſame affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the avaricious; for tho' the vain man is not what he would appear, or hath not the virtue he affects, to the degree he would be thought to have it; yet it ſits leſs aukwardly on him than on the avaricious man, who is the very reverſe of what he would ſeem to be.</p>
                  <p>FROM the diſcovery of this affectation ariſes the Ridiculous—which always ſtrikes the reader with ſurpriſe and pleaſure; and that in a higher and ſtronger degree when the affectation ariſes from hypocriſy, than when from vanity: for, to diſcover any one to be the exact reverſe of what he affects, is more ſurpriſing, and conſequently more ridiculous, than to find him a little defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the quality he deſires the reputation of. I might obſerve, that our Ben Johnſon, who of all men underſtood the Ridiculous the beſt, hath chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed the hypocritical affectation.</p>
                  <p>Now from affectation only, the misfortunes and calamities of life, or the imperfections of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may become the objects of ridicule. Surely
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023370_0009_0FBF3B1B6058A7A8"/>
he hath a very ill-framed mind, who can look on uglineſs, infirmity, or poverty, as ridiculous in themſelves: nor do I believe any man living, who meets a dirty fellow riding through the ſtreets in a cart, is ſtruck with an idea of the Ridiculous from it; but if he ſhould ſee the ſame figure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from his coach and ſix, or bolt from his chair with his hat under his arm, he would then begin to laugh, and with juſtice. In the ſame manner, were we to enter a poor houſe, and behold a wretched family ſhivering with cold, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing with hunger, it would not incline us to laughter (at leaſt we muſt have very diabolical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if it would:) but ſhould be diſcover there a grate, inſtead of coals, adorned with flowers, empty plate or china diſhes on the ſide-board, or any other affectation of riches and finery either on their perſons or in their furniture; we might then indeed be excuſed for ridiculing ſo fantaſtical an appearance. Much leſs are natural imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the object of deriſion: but when uglineſs aims at the applauſe of beauty, or lameneſs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to diſplay agility; it is then that theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate circumſtances, which at firſt moved our compaſſion, tend only to raiſe our mirth.</p>
                  <p>THE poet carries this very far;
<q>
                        <l>None are for being what they are in fault,</l>
                        <l>But for not being what they would be thought.</l>
                     </q>
Where if the metre would ſuffer the word Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to cloſe the firſt line, the thought would be rather more proper. Great vices are the proper objects of our deteſtation, ſmaller faults of our pity: but affectation appears to me the only true ſource of the Ridiculous.</p>

BUT perhaps it may be objected to me, that I have againſt my own rules introduced vices, and of very black kind, in this work. To which I ſhall anſwer; firſt, that it is very difficult to purſue a ſeries of human actions, and keep clear from them. Secondly, that the vices to be found here, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the accidental conſequences of ſome human frailty or foible, than cauſes habitually exiſting in the mind. Thirdly, that they are never ſet forth as the objects of ridicule but deteſtation. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are never the principal figure at that time on the ſcene; and laſtly, they never produce the intended evil.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus diſtinguiſhed Joſeph Andrews from the productions of romance-writers on the one hand, and burleſque writers on the other, and given ſome few very ſhort hints (for I intended no more) of this ſpecies of writing, which I have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be hitherto unattempted in our language; I ſhall leave to my good-natured reader to apply my piece to my obſervations, and will detain him no longer than with a word concerning the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in this work.</p>
                  <p>AND here I ſolemnly proteſt, I have no intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vilify or aſperſe any one: for though every thing is copied from the book of nature, and ſcarce a character or action produced which I have not taken from my own obſervations and experience; yet I have uſed the utmoſt care to obſcure the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by ſuch different circumſtances, degrees and colours, that it will be impoſſible to gueſs at them with any degree of certainty; and if it ever happens otherwiſe, it is only where the failure characterized is ſo minute, that it is a foible only which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himſelf may laugh at as well as any other.</p>

As to the character of Adams, as it is the moſt glaring in the whole, ſo I conceive it is not to be found in any book now extant. It is deſigned a character of perfect ſimplicity; and as the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart will recommend him to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured; ſo I hope it will excuſe me to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his cloth; for whom, while they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their ſacred order, no man can poſſibly have a greater reſpect. They will therefore excuſe me, notwithſtanding the low adventures in which he is engaged, that I have made him a clergyman; ſince no other office could have given him ſo many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of diſplaying his worthy inclinations.</p>

                        <p>IT is a trite but true obſervation, that examples work more forcibly on the mind than precepts: and if this be juſt in what is odious and blamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is more ſtrongly ſo in what is amiable and praiſe-worthy.

Such are the hiſtory of John the Great, who, by his brave and heroic actions againſt men of large and athletic bodies, obtained the glorious appellation of the Giant-killer; that of an earl of Warwick, whoſe chriſtian name was Guy; the lives of Argalus and Parthenia; and, above all, the hiſtory of thoſe ſeven worthy perſonages, the Champions of Chriſtendom.

                        <p>But I paſs by theſe and many others, to mention two books lately publiſhed, which repreſent an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable pattern of the amiable in either ſex.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023370_0014_0FBF3B275CA04EE0"/>
who borrows his lights, as the common method is, from authentic papers and records. The reader, I believe, already conjectures I mean the lives of Mr. Colley Cibber, and of Mrs. Pamela Andrews. How artfully doth the former, by inſinuating that he eſcaped being promoted to the higheſt ſtations in church and ſtate, teach us a contempt of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grandeur! how ſtrongly doth he inculcate an abſolute ſubmiſſion to our ſuperiors! Laſtly, how completely doth he arm us againſt ſo uneaſy, ſo wretched a paſſion as the fear of ſhame! how clearly doth he expoſe the emptineſs and vanity of that phantom, reputation!</p>
                        <p>What the female readers are taught by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of Mrs. Andrews, is ſo well ſet forth in the excellent eſſays or letters prefixed to the ſecond and ſubſequent editions of that work, that it would be here a needleſs repetition. The authentic hiſtory with which I now preſent the public, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the great good that book is likely to do, and of the prevalence of example which I have juſt obſerved: ſince it will appear that it was by keeping the excellent pattern of his ſiſter's virtues before his eyes, that Mr. Joſeph Andrews was chiefly enabled to preſerve his purity in the midſt of ſuch great temptations. I ſhall only add, that this character of male-chaſtity, though doubtleſs as deſirable and becoming in one part of the human ſpecies, as in the other, is almoſt the only virtue which the great apologiſt hath not given himſelf, for the ſake of giving the example to his readers.</p>

                        <p>MR. Joſeph Andrews, the hero of our enſuing hiſtory, was eſteemed to be the only ſon of Gaffer and Gammer Andrews, and brother to the illuſtrious Pamela, whoſe virtue is at preſent ſo famous. As to his anceſtors, we have ſearched with great diligence, but little ſucceſs; being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to trace them farther than his great-grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, who, as an elderly perſon in the pariſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members to have heard his father ſay, was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent cudgel-player. Whether he had any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors before this, we muſt leave to the opinion of our curious reader, finding nothing of ſufficient certainty to rely on. However, we cannot omit inſerting an epitaph which an ingenious friend of ours hath communicated.

The words are almoſt out of the ſtone with anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

To wave therefore a circumſtance, which, though mentioned in conformity to the exact rules of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography, is not greatly material; I proceed to things of more conſequence.

                        </argument>
                        <p>MR. Abraham Adams was an excellent ſcholar. He was a perfect maſter of the Greek and Latin languages; to which he added a great ſhare of knowledge in the Oriental tongues, and could read and tranſlate French, Italian, and Spaniſh. He had applied many years to the moſt ſevere ſtudy, and had treaſured up a fund of learning, rarely to be met with in a univerſity. He was beſides a man of good ſenſe, good parts, and good nature; but was at the ſame time as entirely ignorant of the ways of this world, as an infant juſt entered into it could poſſibly be. As he had never any intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſo he never ſuſpected ſuch a deſign in others. He was generous, friendly, and brave to an exceſs; but ſimplicity was his characteriſtick: he did, no more than Mr. Colley Cibber, apprehend any ſuch paſſions as malice and envy to exiſt in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which was indeed leſs remarkable in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try parſon, than in a gentleman who hath paſt his life behind the ſcenes a place which hath been ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thought the ſchool of innocence; and where a very little obſervation would have convinced the great apologiſt, that thoſe paſſions have a real exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the human mind.</p>
                        <p>His virtue, and his other qualifications, as they rendered him equal to his office; ſo they made him an agreeable and valuable companion, and had ſo much endeared and well recommended him to a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023370_0019_0FBF3B334D880128"/>
that at the age of fifty, he was provided with a handſome income of twenty three pounds a year: which, however, he could not make any great figure with; becauſe he lived in a dear county, and was a little incumbered with a wife and ſix children.</p>
                        <p>It was this gentleman, who having, as I have ſaid, obſerved the ſingular devotion of young Andrews, had found means to queſtion him concerning ſeveral particulars; as how many books there were in the New Teſtament? which were they? how many chapters they contained? and ſuch like; to all which, Mr. Adams privately ſaid, he anſwered much better than Sir Thomas, or two other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring juſtices of the peace could probably have done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adams was wonderfully ſolicitous to know at what time, and by what opportunity the youth became acquainted with theſe matters: Joey told him, that he had very early learnt to read and write by the goodneſs of his father, who, though he had not intereſt enough to get him into a charity-ſchool, becauſe a couſin of his father's landlord did not vote on the right ſide for a church-warden in a borough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, yet had been himſelf at the expence of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a week for his learning. He told hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that ever ſince he was in Sir Thomas's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he had employed all his hours of leiſure in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good books; that he had read the Bible, the Whole Duty of Man, and Thomas a Kempis; and that as often as he could without being perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had ſtudied a great book which lay open in the hall-window, where he had read, <q>as how the devil carried away half a church in ſermon-time, without hurting one of the congregation; and as how a field of corn ran away down a ſteep hill with all the trees upon it, and covered another

man's meadow.</q> This ſufficiently aſſured Mr. Adams, that the good book meant could be no other than Baker's Chronicle.</p>
                        <p>The curate, ſurprized to find ſuch inſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and application in a young man, who had never met with the leaſt encouragement, aſked him, if he did not extremely regret the want of a liberal education, and the not having been born of parents, who might have indulged his talents and deſire of knowledge? To which he anſwered <q>He hoped he had profited ſomewhat better from the books he had read, than to lament his condition in this world. That for his part, he was perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the ſtate to which he was called, that he ſhould endeavour to improve his talent, which was all required of him, but not to repine at his own lot, nor envy thoſe of his betters.</q> 
                           <q>Well ſaid, my lad, replied the curate, and I wiſh ſome who have read many more good books, nay, and ſome who have written good books themſelves, had profited ſo much by them.</q>

                        <p>Adams had no nearer acceſs to Sir Thomas or my lady, than through the waiting gentlewoman; for Sir Thomas was too apt to eſtimate men merely by their dreſs, or fortune; and my lady was a woman of gaiety, who had been bleſs'd with a town edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and never ſpoke of any of her country neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by any other appellation than that of the Brutes. They both regarded the curate as a kind of domeſtick only, belonging to the parſon of the pariſh, who was at this time at variance with the knight; for the parſon had for many years lived in a conſtant ſtate of civil war, or, which is perhaps, as bad, of civil law, with Sir Thomas himſelf and the tenants of his manor. The foundation of this quarrel was a modus, by ſetting which aſide, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

of ſeveral ſhillings <hi>per annum</hi> would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to the rector: but he had not yet been able to accompliſh his purpoſe; and had reaped hitherto nothing better from the ſuits than the pleaſure (which he uſed indeed frequently to ſay was no ſmall one) of reflecting that he had utterly undone many of the poor tenants, though he had at the ſame time great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoveriſhed himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Slipſlop the waiting-gentlewoman, being herſelf the daughter of a curate, preſerved ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for Adams; ſhe profeſſed great regard for his learning, and would frequently diſpute with him on points of theology: but always inſiſted on a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be paid to her underſtanding, as ſhe had been frequently at London, and knew more of the world than a country parſon could pretend to.</p>
                        <p>She had in theſe diſputes a particular advantage over Adams: for ſhe was a mighty affecter of hard words, which ſhe uſed in ſuch a manner, that the parſon, who durſt not offend her by calling her words in queſtion, was frequently at ſome loſs to gueſs her meaning, and would have been much leſs puzzled by an Arabian manuſcript.</p>
                        <p>Adams therefore took an opportunity one day, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a pretty long diſcourſe with her on the eſſence, (or, as ſhe pleaſed to term it, the incence) of matter, to mention the caſe of young Andrews; deſiring her to recommend him to her lady as a youth very ſuſceptible of learning, and one whoſe inſtruction in Latin he would himſelf undertake; by which means he might be qualified for a higher ſtation than that of a footman; and added, ſhe knew it was in his maſter's power eaſily to provide for him in a better manner. He therefore deſired, that the boy might be left behind, under his care.</p>
                        <p>"La, Mr. Adams," ſaid Mrs. Slipſlop, <q>do you,

think my lady will ſuffer any preamble about any ſuch matter? She is going to London very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, and I am confidous would not leave Joey behind her on any account; for he is one of the genteeleſt young fellows you may ſee in a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's day, and I am confidous ſhe would as ſoon think of parting with a pair of her grey mares; for ſhe values herſelf as much on the one as the other.</q> Adams would have interrupted but ſhe proceeded: <q>And why is Latin more neceſſitous for a footman than a gentleman? It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that you clergymen muſt learn it, becauſe you can't preach without it: but I have heard gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay in London, that it is fit for nobody elſe. I am confidous my lady would be angry with me for mentioning it; and I ſhall draw myſelf into no ſuch delemy.</q> At which words her lady's bell rung, and Mr. Adams was forced to retire; nor could he gain a ſecond opportunity with her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their London journey, which happened a few days afterwards. However, Andrews behaved very thankfully and gratefully to him for his intended kindneſs, which he told him he never would forget, and at the ſame time received from the good man many admonitions, concerning the regulation of his future conduct, and his perſeverance in innocence and induſtry.</p>

of life. His hair was cut after the neweſt faſhion, and became his chief care: he went abroad with it all the morning in papers, and dreſſed it out in the afternoon. They could not, however, teach him to game, ſwear, drink, nor any other genteel vice the town abounded with. He applied moſt of his leiſure hours to muſic, in which he greatly improved himſelf; and became ſo perfect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur in that art, that he led the opinion of all the other footmen at an opera, and they never condemned or applauded a ſingle ſong contrary to his approbation, or diſlike. He was a little too forward in riots at the play-houſes and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: and when he attended his lady at church (which was but ſeldom) he behaved with leſs ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devotion than formerly: however, if he was outwardly a pretty fellow, his morals remained entirely uncorrupted, though he was at the ſame time ſmarter and genteeler than any of the beaus in town, either in or out of livery.</p>
                        <p>His lady, who had often ſaid of him that Joey was the handſomeſt and genteeleſt footman in the kingdom, but that it was pity he wanted ſpirit, began now to find that fault no longer; on the contrary, ſhe was frequently heard to cry out, Ay, there is ſome life in this fellow. She plainly ſaw the effects which the town-air hath on the ſobereſt conſtitutions. She would now walk out with him into Hyde-Park in a morning, and when tired, which happened almoſt every minute, would lean on his arm, and converſe with him in great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity.

                        <p>But though their virtue remains unſullied, yet, now and then ſome ſmall arrows will glance on the ſhadow of it, their reputation; and ſo it fell out to lady Booby, who happened to be walking arm-in-arm with Joey one morning in Hyde-Park, when lady Tittle and lady Tattle, came accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by in their coach. Bleſs me, ſays lady Tittle, can I believe my eyes? Is that lady Booby? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſays Tattle. But what makes you ſurprized? Why, is not that her footman, replied Tittle?

During the firſt ſix days the poor lady admitted none but Mrs. Slipſlop, and three female friends, who made a party at cards: but on the ſeventh ſhe ordered Joey, whom, for a good reaſon, we ſhall hereafter call JOSEPH, to bring up her tea-kettle. The lady being in bed, called Joſeph to her, bade him ſit down, and having accidentally laid her hand on his, ſhe aſked him, if he had ever been in love? Joſeph anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome confuſion, it was time enough for one ſo young as himſelf to think on ſuch things. As young as you are, replied the lady, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced you are no ſtranger to that paſſion; 'Come Joey,' ſays ſhe, 'tell me truly, who is the happy 'girl whoſe eyes have made a conqueſt of you?' Joſeph returned, that all the women he had ever ſeen, were equally indifferent to him. 'O then,'

ſaid the lady, <q>you are a general lover. Indeed, you handſome fellows, like handſome women, are very long and difficult in fixing: but yet you ſhall never perſuade me that your heart is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſceptible of affection; I rather impute what you ſay to your ſecrecy, a very commendable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and what I am far from being angry with you for. Nothing can be more unworthy in a young man than to betray any intimacies with the Ladies.</q> 'Ladies!' madam, ſaid Joſeph, <q>I am ſure I never had the impudence to think of any that deſerve that name.</q> 
                           <q>Don't pretend to too much modeſty, ſaid ſhe, for that ſometimes may be impertinent: but pray, anſwer me this queſtion. Suppoſe a lady ſhould happen to like you; ſuppoſe ſhe ſhould prefer you to all your ſex, and admit you to the ſame familiarities as you might have hoped for, if you had been born her equal, are you certain that no vanity could tempt you to diſcover her? Anſwer me honeſtly, Joſeph; have you ſo much more ſenſe, and ſo much more virtue, than your handſome young fellows generally have, who make no ſcruple of ſacrificing our dear reputation to your pride, without conſidering the great obligation we lay on you, by our condeſcenſion and confidence? Can you keep a ſecret, my Joey?</q> "Madam, 'ſays he, <q>I hope your ladyſhip can't tax me with ever betraying the ſecrets of the family; and I hope, if you was to turn me away, I might have that character of you.</q> 
                           <q>I don't intend to turn you away, Joey, ſaid ſhe, and ſighed, I am afraid it is not in my power.</q> She then raiſed herſelf a little in her bed, and diſcovered one of the whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt necks that ever was ſeen; at which Joſeph bluſhed. 'La!' ſays ſhe, in an affected ſurprize,

what am I doing? I have truſted myſelf with a man alone, naked in bed; ſuppoſe you ſhould have any wicked intentions upon my honour, how ſhould I defend myſelf?</q> Joſeph proteſted that he never had the leaſt evil deſign againſt her. 'No,' ſays ſhe, <q>perhaps you may not call your deſigns wicked; and perhaps they are not ſo.</q>—He ſwore they were not. <q>You miſunderſtand me,</q> ſays ſhe; <q>I mean, if they were againſt my honour, they may not be wicked; but the world calls them ſo. But, then, ſay you, the world will never know any thing of the matter; yet would not that be truſting to your ſecrecy? Muſt not my reputation be then in your power? Would you not then be my maſter?</q> Joſeph begged her ladyſhip to be comforted; for that he would never imagine the leaſt wicked thing againſt her, and that he had rather die a thouſand deaths than give her any reaſon to ſuſpect him. 'Yes,' ſaid ſhe, <q>I muſt have reaſon to ſuſpect you. Are you not a man? and without vanity I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſome charms. But perhaps you may fear I ſhould proſecute you; indeed I hope you do; and yet heaven knows I ſhould never have the confidence to appear before a court of juſtice; and you know, Joey, I am of a forgiving temper. Tell me, Joey, don't you think I ſhould forgive you?</q> 'Indeed, Madam,' ſays Joſeph, <q>I will never do any thing to diſoblige your ladyſhip.</q> 'How,' ſays ſhe, <q>do you think it would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige me then? Do you think I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer you?</q> 
                           <q>I don't underſtand you, Madam,</q> ſays Joſeph. 'Don't you?' ſaid ſhe, <q>then you either are a fool or pretend to be ſo; I find I was miſtaken in you. So get you down ſtairs, and never let me ſee your face again: your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Dear Pamela, don't tell any body: but ſhe ordered me to ſit down by her bed-ſide, when ſhe was in naked bed; and ſhe held my hand, and talked exactly as a lady does to her ſweet-heart in a ſtage-play, which I have ſeen in Covent-Garden, while ſhe wanted him to be no better than he ſhould be.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023370_0030_0FBF3B539F864448"/>
to bring the reader a little better acquainted. She was a maiden gentlewoman of about forty-five years of age, who having made a ſmall ſlip in her youth, had continued a good maid ever ſince. She was not at this time remarkably handſome; being very ſhort, and rather too corpulent in body, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what red, with the addition of pimples in the face. Her noſe was likewiſe rather too large, and her eyes too little; nor did ſhe reſemble a cow ſo much in her breath, as in two brown globes which ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before her; one of her legs was alſo a little ſhorter than the other, which occaſioned her to limp as ſhe walked. This fair creature had long caſt the eyes of affection on Joſeph, in which ſhe had not met with quite ſo good ſucceſs as ſhe probably wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho', beſides all the allurements of her native charms, ſhe had given him tea, ſweetmeats, wine, and many other delicacies, of which, by keeping the keys, ſhe had the abſolute command. Joſeph, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had not returned the leaſt gratitude to all theſe favours, not even ſo much as a kiſs; tho' I would not inſinuate ſhe was ſo eaſily to be ſatisfied: for ſurely then he would have been highly blameable. The truth is, ſhe was arrived at an age when ſhe thought ſhe might indulge herſelf in any liberties with a man, without the danger of bringing a third perſon into the world to betray them. She imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by ſo long a ſelf-denial, ſhe had not only made amends for the ſmall ſlip of her youth above hinted at: but had likewiſe laid up a quantity of merit to excuſe any future failings. In a word, ſhe reſolved to give a looſe to her amorous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to pay off the debt of pleaſure ſhe found ſhe owed herſelf, as faſt as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>With theſe charms of perſon, and in this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind, ſhe encountered poor Joſeph at the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023370_0031_0FBF3B58ACB0FE88"/>
bottom of the ſtairs, and aſked him if he would drink a glaſs of ſomething good this morning. Joſeph, whoſe ſpirits were not a little caſt down, very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and thankfully accepted the offer; and together they went into a cloſet, where having delivered him a full glaſs of ratifia, and deſired him to ſit down, Mrs. Slipſlop thus began:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Sure nothing can be a more ſimple contraſt in a woman, than to place her affections on a boy. If I had ever thought it would have been my fate, I ſhould have wiſhed to die a thouſand deaths ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than live to ſee that day. If we like a man, the lighteſt hint ſophiſticates. Whereas a boy propoſes upon us to break through all the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of modeſty, before we can make any oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon him.</q> Joſeph, who did not underſtand a word ſhe ſaid, anſwered, 'Yes, Madam;—' 'Yes, Madam,' replied Mrs Slipſlop, with ſome warmth, <q>Do you intend to reſult my paſſion? Is it not enough, ungrateful as you are, to make no return to all the favours I have done you: but you muſt treat me with ironing? Barbarous monſter! how have I deſerved that my paſſion ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and treated with ironing?</q> 'Madam,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Joſeph, <q>I don't underſtand your hard words: but I am certain, you have no occaſion to call me ungrateful: for ſo far from intending you any wrong, I always loved you as well as if you had been my own mother.</q> 'How, ſirrah!' ſays Mrs. Slipſlop in a rage: <q>Your own mother? Do you aſſinuate that I am old enough to be your mother? I don't know what a ſtrippling may think: but I believe a man would refer me to any greenſickneſs ſilly girl whatſomdever: but I ought to deſpiſe you rather than be angry with you, for

referring the converſation of girls to that of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſenſe.</q> 'Madam,' ſays Joſeph, <q>I am ſure I have always valued the honour you did me by your converſation; for I know you are a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of learning.</q> 'Yes, but Joſeph,' ſaid ſhe, a little ſoftened by the compliment to her lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <q>If you had a value for me, you certainly would have found ſome method of ſhewing it me; for I am convicted you muſt ſee the value I have for you.

                        <p>As when a hungry tigreſs, who long has tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the woods in fruitleſs ſearch, ſees within the reach of her claws a lamb, ſhe prepares to leap on her prey; or as a voracious pike of immenſe ſize, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys thro' the liquid element a roach or gudgeon, which cannot eſcape her jaws, opens them wide to ſwallow the little fiſh; ſo did Mrs. Slipſlop prepare to lay her violent amorous hands on the poor Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, when luckily her miſtreſs's bell rung, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the intended martyr from her clutches. She was obliged to leave him abruptly, and to defer the execution of her purpoſe till ſome other time. We ſhall therefore return to the lady Booby, and give our reader ſome account of her behaviour, after ſhe was left by Joſeph in a temper of mind not greatly different from that of the inflamed Slipſlop.</p>

                           <p>Sayings of wiſe men. A dialogue between the lady and her maid; and a panegyric, or rather ſatire, on the paſſion of love, in the ſublime ſtile.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is the obſervation of ſome antient ſage, whoſe name I have forgot, that paſſions operate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently on the human mind, as diſeaſes on the body, in proportion to the ſtrength or weakneſs, ſoundneſs or rottenneſs of the one and the other.</p>
                        <p>We hope therefore a judicious reader will give himſelf ſome pains to obſerve, what we have ſo greatly laboured to deſcribe, the different operations of this paſſion of love in the gentle and cultivated mind of the lady Booby, from thoſe which it effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the leſs poliſhed and coarſer diſpoſition of Mrs. Slipſlop.</p>
                        <p>Another philoſopher, whoſe name alſo at preſent eſcapes my memory, hath ſomewhere ſaid, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions taken in the abſence of the beloved object, are very apt to vaniſh in its preſence; on both which wiſe ſayings, the following chapter may ſerve as a comment.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner had Joſeph left the room in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we had before related, than the lady, enraged at her diſappointment, began to reflect with ſeverity on her conduct. Her love was now changed to diſdain, which pride aſſiſted to torment her. She deſpiſed herſelf for the meanneſs of her paſſion, and Joſeph for its ill ſucceſs. However, ſhe had now got the better of it in her own opinion, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined immediately to diſmiſs the object. After much toſſing and turning in her bed, and many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquies, which, if we had no better matter for our

reader, we would give him; ſhe at laſt rung the bell as above-mentioned, and was preſently attended by Mrs. Slipſlop, who was not much better pleaſed with Joſeph than the lady herſelf.</p>
                        <p>Slipſlop, ſaid lady Booby, when did you ſee Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph? the poor woman was ſo ſurprized at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſound of his name, at ſo critical a time, that ſhe had the greateſt difficulty to conceal the confuſion ſhe was under, from her miſtreſs; whom ſhe anſwered, nevertheleſs, with pretty good confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though not entirely void of fear or ſuſpicion, that ſhe had not ſeen him that morning. <q>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,</q> ſaid lady Booby, <q>he is a wild young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</q> 'That he is,' ſaid Slipſlop, <q>and a wicket one too. To my knowledge he games, drinks, ſwears, and fights eternally: beſides, he is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly indicted to wenching.</q> 'Ay!' ſaid the lady, <q>I never heard that of him.</q> 'O madam,' anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other, <q>he is ſo lewd a raſcal, that if your ladyſhip keeps him much longer, you will not have one virgin in your houſe except myſelf. And yet I can't conceive what the wenches ſee in him, to be ſo fooliſhly fond as they are: in my eyes, he is as ugly a ſcarecrow as ever I upheld.</q> 'Nay,' ſaid the lady, 'the boy is well enough.'—<q>La, Ma'm, cries Slipſlop, I think him the ragmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt fellow in the family.</q> 'Sure, Slipſlop,' ſays ſhe, <q>you are miſtaken: but which of the women do you ſuſpect?</q> 'Madam,' ſays Slipſlop, <q>there is Betty the chambermaid, I am almoſt convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is with child by him.</q> 'Ay!' ſays the lady, <q>then pray pay her her wages inſtantly. I will keep no ſuch ſluts in my family.</q> 
                           <q>And as for Joſeph, you may diſcard him too.</q> 
                           <q>Would your ladyſhip have him paid off immediately?</q> cries Slipſlop, <q>for perhaps, when Betty is gone, he may
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023370_0035_0FBF3B61DA686040"/>
mend; and really the boy is a good ſervant, and a ſtrong healthy, luſcious boy enough.</q> 
                           <q>This morning,</q> anſwered the lady with ſome vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. 'I wiſh Madam,' cries Slipſlop, <q>your ladyſhip would be ſo good as to try him a little longer.</q> 
                           <q>I will not have my commands diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q> ſaid the lady; <q>ſure you are not fond of him yourſelf.</q> 'I Madam?' cries Slipſlop, reddening, if not bluſhing. <q>I ſhould be ſorry to think your ladyſhip had any reaſon to reſpect me of fondneſs for a fellow; and if it be your pleaſure, I ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it with as much reluctance as poſſible.</q> 
                           <q>As little, I ſuppoſe you mean,</q> ſaid the lady; <q>and ſo about it inſtantly.</q> Mrs. Slipſlop went out, and the lady had ſcarce taken two turns, before ſhe fell to knocking and ringing with great violence. Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlop, who did not travel poſt-haſte, ſoon returned, and was countermanded as to Joſeph, but ordered to ſend Betty about her buſineſs without delay. She went out a ſecond time with much greater alacrity than before; when the lady began immediately to accuſe herſelf of want of reſolution, and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the return of her affection with it's pernicious conſequences: ſhe therefore applied herſelf again to the bell, and reſummoned Mrs. Slipſlop into her preſence; who again returned, and was told by her miſtreſs, that ſhe had conſidered better of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was abſolutely reſolved to turn away Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph; which ſhe ordered her to do immediately. Slipſlop, who knew the violence of her lady's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and would not venture her place for any Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis or Hercules in the univerſe, left her a third time; which ſhe had no ſooner done, than the little god Cupid, fearing he had not yet done the lady's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, took a freſh arrow with the ſharpeſt po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

heart: in other and plainer language, the lady's paſſion got the better of her reaſon. She called back Slipſlop once more, and told her, ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſee the boy, and examine him herſelf; therefore bid her ſend him up. This wavering in her miſtreſs's temper probably put ſomething into the waiting-gentlewoman's head, not neceſſary to mention to the ſagacious reader.</p>
                        <p>Lady Booby was going to call her back again, but could not prevail with herſelf. The next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration therefore was, how ſhe ſhould behave to Joſeph when he came in. She reſolved to preſerve all the dignity of the woman of faſhion to her ſervant, and to indulge herſelf in this laſt view of Joſeph (for that ſhe was moſt certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it ſhould be) at his own expence, by firſt inſulting, and then diſcarding them.</p>
                        <p>O Love, what monſtrous tricks doſt thou play with thy votaries of both ſexes! How doſt thou deceive them, and make them deceive themſelves! Their follies are thy delight! Their ſighs make thee laugh, and their pangs are thy merriment!</p>
                        <p>Not the great Rich, who turns men into mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, wheelbarrows, and whatever elſe beſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours his fancy, hath ſo ſtrangely metamorphoſed the human ſhape; nor the great Cibber, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds all number, gender, and breaks thro' every rule of grammar at his will, hath ſo diſtorted the Engliſh, language, as thou doſt metamorphoſe and diſtort the human ſenſes.</p>
                        <p>Thou putteſt out our eyes, ſtoppeſt up our ears, and takeſt away the power of our noſtrils; ſo that we can neither ſee the largeſt object, hear the loudeſt noiſe, nor ſmell the moſt poignant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume. Again, when thou pleaſeſt, thou canſt make a mole-hill appear as a mountain; a Jew's
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023370_0037_0FBF3B6D1CE487B8"/>
harp ſound like a trumpet, and a daizy ſmell like a violet. Thou canſt make cowardice, brave, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice generous, pride humble, and cruelty, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted. In ſhort, thou turneſt the heart of man inſide out, as a juggler doth a petticoat, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt whatſoever pleaſeth thee out from it. If there be any one who doubts all this, let him read the next chapter.</p>

                           <p>In which, after ſome very fine writing, the hiſtory goes on, and relates the interview between the lady and Joſeph; where the latter hath ſet an example, which we deſpair of ſeeing followed by his ſex, in this vicious age.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>NOW the rake Heſperus had called for his breeches, and having well rubbed his drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy eyes, prepared to dreſs himſelf for all night; by whoſe example his brother rakes on earth like wiſe leave thoſe beds, in which they had ſlept away the day.

In vulgar language, it was in the evening when Joſeph attended his lady's orders.</p>
                        <p>But as it becomes us to preſerve the character of this lady, who is the heroine of our tale; and, as we have naturally a wonderful tenderneſs for that beautiful part of the human ſpecies, called the fair ſex; before we diſcover too much of her frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our reader, it will be proper to give him a lively idea of the vaſt temptation, which overcame all the efforts of a modeſt and virtuous mind; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

pity than condemn the imperfection of human vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                        <p>Nay, the ladies themſelves will, we hope, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by conſidering the uncommon variety of charms, which united in this young man's perſon, to bridle their rampant paſſion for chaſtity, and be at leaſt as mild as their violent modeſty and virtue will permit them, in cenſuring the conduct of a woman, who, perhaps, was in her own diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as chaſte as thoſe pure and ſanctified virgins, who, after a life innocently ſpent in the gaieties of the town, begin about fifty to attend twice <hi>per diem</hi> at the polite churches and chapels, to return thanks for the grace which preſerved them formerly amongſt beaus, from temptations perhaps leſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful than what now attack the lady Booby.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Joſeph Andrews was now in the one and twentieth year of his age. He was of the higheſt degree of middle ſtature. His limbs were put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with great elegance, and no leſs ſtrength. His legs and thighs were formed in the exacteſt proportion. His ſhoulders were broad and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but yet his arms hung ſo eaſily, that he had all the ſymptoms of ſtrength without the leaſt clum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. His hair was of a nut-brown colour, and was diſplayed in wanton ringlets down his back. His forehead was high, his eyes dark, and as full of ſweetneſs as of fire. His noſe a little inclined to the Roman. His tee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>is beard was only rough on his chin and upper lip; but his cheeks, in which his blood glowed, were overſpread with a thick down. His countenance had a tenderneſs joined with a ſenſibility inexpreſſible. Add to this the moſt perfect neatneſs in his dreſs, and an air,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023370_0039_0FBF3B70D53002E0"/>
which to thoſe who have not ſeen many noblemen, would give an idea of nobility.</p>
                        <p>Such was the perſon who now appeared before the lady. She viewed him ſome time in ſilence, and twice or thrice before ſhe ſpake, changed her mind as to the manner in which ſhe ſhould begin. At length, ſhe ſaid to him, <q>Joſeph, I am ſorry to hear ſuch complaints againſt you; I am told you behave ſo rudely to the maids, that they cannot do their buſineſs in quiet; I mean thoſe who are not wicked enough to hearken to your ſolicitations. As to others, they may perhaps not call you rude: for there are wicked ſluts who make one aſhamed of one's own ſex; and are as ready to admit any nauſeous familiarity as fellows to offer it; nay, there are ſuch in my family; but they ſhall not ſtay in it; that impudent trollop, who is with child by you, is diſcharged by this time.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>As a perſon who is ſtruck through the heart with a thunderbolt, looks extremely ſurpriſed, nay, and perhaps is ſo too—thus the poor Joſeph received the falſe accuſation of his miſtreſs; he bluſhed and looked confounded, which ſhe miſinterpreted to be ſymptoms of his guilt and thus went on:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Come hither, Joſeph: another miſtreſs might diſcard you for theſe offences; but I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for your youth, and if I could be certain you would, be no more guilty—Conſider, child, (laying her hand careleſly upon his) you are a handſome young fellow, and might do better; you might make your fortune.</q>—<q>Madam, ſaid Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, I do aſſure your ladyſhip, I don't know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any maid in the houſe is man or woman. Oh fie! Joſeph</q> anſwered the lady, <q>don't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit another crime in denying the truth. I could pardon the firſt; but I hate a lyar.</q> 'Madam
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023370_0040_0FBF3B7309497100"/>
cries Joſeph, <q>I hope your ladyſhip will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at my aſſerting my innocence: for by all that is ſacred, I have never offered more than kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</q> 'Kiſſing!' ſaid the lady with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of countenance, and more redneſs in her cheeks, than anger in her eyes, <q>do you call that no crime? kiſſing, Joſeph, is as a prologue to a play. Can I believe a young fellow of your age and complexion will be content with kiſſing? No, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, there is no woman who grants that, but will grant more; and I am deceived greatly in you, if you would not put her cloſely to it. What would you think, Joſeph, if I admitted you to kiſs me?</q> Joſeph reply'd, <q>he would ſooner die than have any ſuch thought.</q> 'And yet, Joſeph,' returned ſhe, <q>ladies have admitted their footmen to ſuch famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities; and footmen, I confeſs to you much leſs deſerving them; fellows without half your charms: for ſuch might almoſt excuſe the crime. Tell me therefore, Joſeph, if I ſhould admit you to ſuch freedoms, what would you think of me?—tell me freely.</q> 'Madam,' ſaid Joſeph, <q>I ſhould think your ladyſhip condeſcended a great deal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low yourſelf.</q> 'Pugh!' ſaid ſhe, <q>that I am to anſwer to myſelf: but would not you inſiſt on more? Would you be contented with a kiſs?

                        <p>
                           <q>SLIPSLOP, ſaid the lady, I find too much reaſon to believe all thou haſt told me of this wicked Joſeph; I have determined to part with him inſtantly; ſo go you to the ſteward, and bid him pay him his wages.</q> Slipſlop, who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved hitherto a diſtance to her lady, rather out of neceſſity than inclination, and who thought the knowledge of this ſecret had thrown down all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between them, anſwered her miſtreſs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pertly, <q>She wiſhed ſhe knew her own mind; and that ſhe was certain ſhe would call her back again, before ſhe was got half-way down ſtairs.</q> The lady replied, <q>ſhe had taken a reſolution, and was reſolved to keep it.</q> 'I am ſorry for it', cries Slipſlop; <q>and if I had known you would have puniſhed the poor lad ſo ſeverely, you ſhould never have heard a particle of the matter. Here's a fuſs, indeed, about nothing</q> 'Nothing!' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned my lady; <q>Do you think I will counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance lewdneſs in my houſe?</q> 
                           <q>If you will turn away every footman,</q> ſaid Slipſlop, <q>that is a lover of the ſport, you muſt ſoon open the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door yourſelf, or get a ſet of mophrodites to wait upon you; and I am ſure I hated the ſight of them even ſinging in an opera.</q> 'Do as I bid you', ſays my lady, <q>and don't ſhock my ears, with your beaſtly language.</q> 'Marry-come-up,' cries Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlop,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023370_0044_0FBF3B7C139398C0"/>
                           <q>People's ears are ſometimes the niceſt part about them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The lady, who began to admire the new ſtyle in which her waiting-gentlewoman delivered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by the concluſion of her ſpeech, ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat of the truth, called her back, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what ſhe meant by the extraordinary degree of freedom in which ſhe thought proper to indulge her tongue. 'Freedom!' ſays Slipſlop, <q>I don't know what you call freedom! Madam; ſervants have tongues as well as their miſtreſſes. Yes, and ſaucy ones too, anſwered the lady; but I aſſure you I ſhall bear no ſuch impertinence. Impertinence! I don't know that I am imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</q> ſays Slipſlop. 'Yes indeed you are,' cries my lady; <q>and unleſs you mend your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, this houſe is no place for you.</q> 
                           <q>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners!</q> cries Slipſlop, <q>I never was thought to want manners nor modeſty neither; and for places, there are more places than one; and I know what I know.</q> 
                           <q>What do you know, miſtreſs?</q> anſwered the lady. <q>I am not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tell that to every body,</q> ſays Slipſlop, any more than I am obliged to keep it a ſecret.' I deſire you would provide yourſelf, anſwered the lady. 'With all my heart,' replied the waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlewoman; and ſo departed in a paſſion, and ſlapped the door after her.</p>
                        <p>The lady too plainly perceived that her waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlewoman knew more than ſhe would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have had her acquainted with; and this ſhe imputed to Joſeph's having diſcovered to her what paſſed at the firſt interview. This therefore blew up her rage againſt him, and confirmed her in a reſolution of parting with him.</p>
                        <p>But the diſmiſſing Mrs. Slipſlop was a point not ſo ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y to be reſolved upon: ſhe had the utmoſt,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023370_0045_0FBF3B7E5DB1BEE0"/>
tenderneſs for her reputation, as ſhe knew on that depended many of the moſt valuable bleſſings of life; particularly cards, making curt'ſies in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places, and, above all, the pleaſure of demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reputations of others, in which innocent amuſement ſhe had an extraordinary delight. She therefore determined to ſubmit to any inſult from a ſervant, rather than run a riſk of loſing the title to ſo many great privileges.</p>
                        <p>She therefore ſent for her ſteward, Mr. Peter Pounce; and ordered him to pay Joſeph his wages, to ſtrip off his livery, and turn him out of the houſe that evening.</p>
                        <p>She then called Slipſlop up, and after refreſhing her ſpirits with a ſmall cordial which ſhe kept in her cloſet, ſhe began in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Slipſlop, why will you, who know my paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate temper, attempt to provoke me by your anſwers? I am convinced you are an honeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and ſhould be very unwilling to part with you. I believe likewiſe you have found me an indulgent miſtreſs on many occaſions, and have as little reaſon on your ſide to deſire a change. I can't help being ſurprized therefore, that you will take the ſureſt method to offend me: I mean repeating my words, which you know I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deteſted.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The prudent waiting-gentlewoman had duly weighed the whole matter, and found on mature deliberation, that a good place in poſſeſſion was better than one in expectation. As ſhe found her miſtreſs therefore inclined to relent, ſhe thought proper alſo to put on ſome ſmall condeſcenſion; which was as readily accepted: and ſo the affair was reconciled, all offences forgiven, and a preſent of a gown and petticoat made her as an inſtance of her lady's future favour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="47" facs="unknown:023370_0046_0FBF3B7FCBCE4720"/>
She offered once or twice to ſpeak in favour of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph: but found her lady's heart ſo obdurate, that ſhe prudently dropt all ſuch efforts. She conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there were ſome more footmen in the houſe, and ſome as ſtout fellows, tho' not quite ſo handſome as Joſeph: beſides, the reader hath already ſeen her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der advances had not met with the encouragement ſhe might have reaſonably expected. She thought ſhe had thrown away a great deal of ſack and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats on an ungrateful ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcal; and being a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the opinion of that female ſect, who hold one luſty young fellow to be near as good as another luſty young fellow, ſhe at laſt gave up Joſeph and his cauſe, and with a triumph over her paſſion high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commendable, walked off with her preſent, and with great tranquility paid a viſit to a ſtone-bottle, which is of ſovereign uſe to a philoſophical temper.</p>
                        <p>She left not her miſtreſs ſo eaſy. The poor lady could not reflect without agony, that her dear repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was in the power of her ſervants. All her comfort, as to Joſeph, was, that ſhe hoped he did not underſtand her meaning; at leaſt, ſhe could ſay for herſelf, ſhe had not plainly expreſs'd any thing to him; and as to Mrs. Slipſlop, ſhe imagined ſhe could bribe her to ſecrecy.</p>
                        <p>But what hurt her moſt was, that in reality ſhe had not ſo entirely conquered her paſſion; the little god lay lurking in her heart, tho' anger and diſdain ſo hoodwinked her, that ſhe could not ſee him. She was a thouſand times on the very brink of revoking the ſentence ſhe had paſſed againſt the poor youth. Love became his advocate, and whiſpered many things in his favour. Honour likewiſe endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vindicate his crime, and pity to mitigate his puniſhment; on the other ſide, pride and revenge ſpoke as loudly againſt him; and thus the poor lady
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023370_0047_0FBF3B81484DE678"/>
was tortured with perplexity, oppoſite paſſions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting and tearing her mind different ways.</p>
                        <p>So I have ſeen, in the hall of Weſtminſter, where ſerjeant Bramble hath been retained on the right ſide, and ſerjeant Puzzle on the left, the balance of opinion (ſo equal were their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ees) alternately incline to either ſcale. Now Bramble throws in an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>e's ſcale ſtrikes the beam; again, Bramble ſhares the like fate, overpowered by the weight of Puzzle. Her Bramble hits, there Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle ſtrikes; here one has you, there t'other has you, 'till at laſt all becomes one ſcene of confuſion in the tortured minds of the hearers; equal wagers are laid on the ſucceſs, and neither judge nor jury can poſſibly make any thing of the matter; all things are ſo enveloped by the careful ſerjeants in doubt and obſcurity.</p>
                        <p>Or as it happens in the conſcience, where ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and honeſty pull one way, and a bribe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity another.—If it was our preſent buſineſs only to make ſimilies, we could produce many more to this purpoſe: but a ſimile (as well as a word) to the wiſe.

                              <p>HOPING you are well, what news have I to tell you! O Pamela, my miſtreſs is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in love with me—That is, what great folks call falling in love, ſhe has a mind to ruin me; but I hope I ſhall have more reſolution and more grace than to part with my virtue to any lady upon earth.</p>
                              <p>Mr. Adams hath often told me, that chaſtity is as great a virtue in a man as in a woman. He ſays he never knew any more than his wife, and I ſhall endeavour to follow his example. Indeed, it is owing entirely to his excellent ſermons and advice, together with your letters, that I have been able to reſiſt a temptation, which he ſays no man complies with, but he repents in this world, or is damned for it in the next; and why ſhould I truſt to repentance on my death-bed, ſince I may die in my ſleep? What fine things are good advice and good examples! But I am glad ſhe turned me out of the chamber as ſhe did: for I had once almoſt forgotten every word parſon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams had ever ſaid to me.</p>
                              <p>I don't doubt, dear ſiſter, but you will have grace to preſerve your virtue againſt all trials; and I beg you earneſtly to pray, I may be enabled

to preſerve mine; for truly it is very ſeverely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by more than one: but, I hope I ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py your example, and that of Joſeph my name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake: and maintain my virtue againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                        <p>Joſeph had not finiſhed his letter, when he was ſummoned down ſtairs by Mr. Peter Pounce, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his wages; for, beſides that out of eight pounds a year he allowed his father and mother four, he had been obliged, in order to furniſh himſelf with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical inſtruments, to apply to the generoſity of the aforeſaid Peter, who on urgent occaſions, uſed to advance the ſervants their wages: not before they were due, but before they were payable; that is, perhaps, half a year after they were due, and this at the moderate praemium of fifty per cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a little more; by which charitable methods, together with lending money to other people, and even to his own maſter and miſtreſs, the honeſt man had from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in a few years amaſſed a ſmall ſum of twenty thouſand pounds or thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph having received his little remainder of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and having ſtript off his livery, was forced to borrow a frock and breeches of one of the ſervants: (for he was ſo beloved in the family, that they would all have lent him any thing) and being told by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he muſt not ſtay a moment longer in the houſe than was neceſſary to pack up his linen, which he eaſily did in a very narrow compaſs; he took a very melancholy leave of his fellow-ſervants, and ſet out at ſeven in the evening.</p>
                        <p>He had proceeded the length of two or three ſtreets, before he abſolutely determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether he ſhould leave the town that night, or, procuring, a lodging, wait till the morning.

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of ſeveral new matters not expected.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT is an obſervation ſometimes made, that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our idea of a ſimple fellow, we ſay, he is eaſily to be ſeen through: Nor do I believe it a more improper denotation of a ſimple book. Inſtead of applying this to any particular performance, we chuſe rather to remark the contrary in this hiſtory, where the ſcene opens itſelf by ſmall degrees; and he is a ſaga ous reader who can ſee two chapters before him.</p>
                        <p>For this reaſon we have not hitherto hinted a matter which now ſeems neceſſary to be explained; ſince it may be wondered at, firſt, that Joſeph made ſuch extraordinary haſte out of town, which hath been already ſhewn; and ſecondly, which will be now ſhewn, that inſtead of proceeding to the habitation of his father and mother, or to his beloved ſiſter Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela, he choſe rather to ſet out full ſpeed to the lady Booby's country ſeat, which he had left on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to London.</p>
                        <p>Be it known then, that in the ſame pariſh where this ſeat ſtood, there lived a young girl whom Joſeph (tho' the beſt of ſons and brothers) longed more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently to ſee than his parents or his ſiſter. She was a poor girl, who had formerly been bred up in Sir John's family; whence, a little before the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to London, ſhe had been diſcarded by Mrs.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023370_0051_0FBF3B9559D21B80"/>
Slipſlop on account of her extraordinary beauty: for I never could find any other reaſon.</p>
                        <p>This young creature (who now lived with a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the pariſh) had been always beloved by Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, and returned his affection. She was two years only younger than our hero. They had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted from their infancy, and had conceived a very early liking for each other, which had grown to ſuch a degree of affection, that Mr. Adams had with much ado prevented them from marrying, and perſuaded them to wait, till a few years ſervice and thrift had a little improved their experience, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them to live comfortably together.</p>
                        <p>They followed this good man's advice, as indeed his word was little leſs than a law in his pariſh; for as he had ſhewn his pariſhoners by an uniform be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of thirty-five years duration, that he had their good entirely at heart; ſo they conſulted him on every occaſion, and very ſeldom acted contrary to his opinion.</p>
                        <p>Nothing can be imagined more tender than was the parting between theſe two lovers. A thouſand ſighs heaved the boſom of Joſeph; a thouſand tears diſtilled from the lovely eyes of Fanny, (for that was her name) tho' her modeſty would only ſuffer her to admit his eager kiſſes, her violent love made her more than paſſive in his embraces; and ſhe often pulled him to her breaſt with a ſoft preſſure, which tho' perhaps it would not have ſqueezed an inſect to death, cauſed more emotion in the heart of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, than the cloſeſt Corniſh hug could have done.</p>
                        <p>The reader may perhaps wonder, that ſo fond a pair ſhould during a twelvemonth's abſence never converſe with one another; indeed there was but one reaſon which did, or could have prevented them; and this was, that poor Fanny could neither
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023370_0052_0FBF3B9723D877C8"/>
write nor read; nor could ſhe be prevailed upon to tranſmit the delicacies of her tender and chaſte paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by the hands of an amanuenſis.</p>
                        <p>They contented themſelves therefore with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent enquiries after each other's health, with a mutual confidence in each other's fidelity, and the proſpect of their future happineſs.</p>
                        <p>Having explained theſe matters to our reader, and, as far as poſſible, ſatisfied all his doubts, we return to honeſt Joſeph, whom we left juſt ſet out on his travels by the light of the moon.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who have read any romance or poetry an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or modern, muſt have been informed, that love hath wings; by which they are not to underſtand, as ſome young ladies by miſtake have done, that a lover can fly; the writers, by this ingenious allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, intended to inſinuate no more, than that lovers do not march like horſe-guards; in ſhort, that they put the beſt leg foremoſt; which our luſty youth, who could walk with any man, did ſo heartily on this occaſion, that within four hours, he reached a famous houſe of hoſpitality well known to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern traveller. It preſents you a lion on a ſign-poſt: and the maſter, who was chriſtened Timotheus, is commonly called plain Tim. Some hath conceived that he hath particularly choſen the lion for his ſign, as he doth in countenance greatly reſemble that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous beaſt, tho' his diſpoſition favours more of the ſweetneſs of the lamb. He is a perſon well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among all ſorts of men, being qualified to render himſelf agreeable to any; as he is well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in hiſtory and politicks, hath a ſmattering in law and divinity, cracks a good jeſt, and plays won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully well on the French horn.</p>
                        <p>A violent ſtorm of hail forced Joſeph to take ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this inn, where he remembered Sir Thomas
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023370_0053_0FBF3B988C574188"/>
had dined in his way to town. Joſeph had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeated himſelf by the kitchen fire, than Timothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, obſerving his livery, began to condole the loſs of his late maſter; who was, he ſaid, his very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and intimate acquaintance, with whom he had cracked many a merry bottle, aye many a dozen in his time. He then remarked, that all thoſe things were over now, all paſt, and juſt as if they had never been; and concluded with an excellent obſervation on the certainty of death, which his wife ſaid was indeed very true. A fellow now arrived at the ſame inn with two horſes, one of which he was leading farther down into the country to meet his maſter; theſe he put into the ſtable, and came and took his place by Joſeph's ſide, who immediately knew him to be the ſervant of a neighbouring gentleman, who uſed to viſit at their houſe.</p>
                        <p>This fellow was likewiſe forced in by the ſtorm; for he had orders to go twenty miles farther that evening, and luckily on the ſame road which Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph himſelf intended to take. He therefore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this opportunity of complimenting his friend with his maſter's horſes, (notwithſtanding he had received expreſs commands to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) which was readily accepted, and ſo after they had drank a loving pot, and the ſtorm was over, they ſet out together.</p>

                        <p>NOTHING remarkable happened on the road, till their arrival at the inn to which the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023370_0054_0FBF3B9A164F0770"/>
were ordered; whither they came about two in the morning. The moon then ſhone very bright; and Joſeph making his friend a preſent of a pint of wine, and thanking him for the favour of his horſe, notwithſtanding all entreaties to the contrary, proceeded on his journey on foot.</p>
                        <p>He had not gone above two miles, charmed with the hopes of ſhortly ſeeing his beloved Fanny, when he was met by two fellows in a narrow lane, and ordered to ſtand and deliver. He readily gave them all the money he had, which was ſomewhat leſs than two pounds; and told them he hoped they would be ſo generous as to return him a few ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to defray his charges on his way home.</p>
                        <p>One of the ruffians anſwered with an oath, yes, we'll give you ſomething preſently: but firſt ſtrip and be d—n'd to you.—Strip, cry'd the other, or I'll blow your brains to the devil. Joſeph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that he had borrowed his coat and breeches of a friend, and that he ſhould be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of making any excuſe for not returning them, replied, he hoped they would not inſiſt on his cloaths, which were not worth much, but conſider the coldneſs of the night. You are cold, are you, you raſcal! ſays one of the robbers, I'll warm you with a vengeance; and damning his eyes, ſnapt a piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol at his head: which he had no ſooner done, than the other levelled a blow at him with his ſtick, which Joſeph, who was expert at cudgel-playing, caught with his, and returned the favour ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully on his adverſary, that he laid him ſpraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at his feet, and at the ſame inſtant received a blow from behind, with the but-end of a piſtol from the other villain, which felled him to the ground, and totally deprived him of his ſenſes.</p>
                        <p>The thief, who had been knocked down, had
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023370_0055_0FBF3B9C4ED60110"/>
now recovered himſelf; and both together fell to belabouring poor Joſeph with their ſticks, till they were convinced they had put an end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o his miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being: They then ſtript him entirely naked, threw him into a ditch, and departed with their booty.</p>
                        <p>The poor wretch, who lay motionleſs a long time, juſt began to recover his ſenſes as a ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coach came by. The poſtilion hearing a man's groans, ſtopt his horſes, and told the coachman, he was certain there was a dead man lying in the ditch; for he heard him groan. 'Go on, ſirrah,' ſays the coachman, <q>we are confounded late, and have no time to look after dead men.</q> A lady, who heard what the poſtilion ſaid, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heard the groan, called eagerly to the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſtop and ſee what was the matter. Upon which he bid the poſtilion alight, and look into the ditch. He did ſo, and returned, <q>That there was a man ſitting upright as naked as ever he was born.—O J—ſus,</q> cry'd the lady, <q>A naked man! Dear coachman, drive on and leave him.</q> Upon this the gentlemen got out of the coach; and Joſeph begged them to have mercy upon him: For that he had been robbed, and almoſt beaten to death. 'Robbed,' cries an old gentleman; <q>Let us make all the haſte imaginable, or we ſhall be robbed too.</q> A young man who belonged to the law anſwered, <q>He wiſhed they had paſſed by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any notice; but that now they might be proved to have been laſt in his company; if he ſhould die, they might be called to ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his murder. He therefore thought it adviſable to ſave the poor creature's life, for their own ſakes, if poſſible; at leaſt, if he died, to prevent the jury's finding that they fled for it.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023370_0056_0FBF3BA0F1CA0C48"/>
He was therefore of opinion, to take the man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coach, and carry him to the next inn.</q> The lady inſiſted, <q>That he ſhould not come into the coach. That if they lifted him in, ſhe would herſelf alight: for ſhe had rather ſtay in that place to all eternity, than ride with a naked man.</q> The coachman objected, <q>That he could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to be taken in, unleſs ſomebody would pay a ſhilling for his carriage the four miles.</q> which the two gentlemen refuſed to do. But the lawyer, who was afraid of ſome miſchief happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf if the wretch was left behind in that condition, ſaying, no man could be too cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in theſe matters, and that he remembered very extraordinary caſes in the books, threatened the coachman, and bid him deny taking him up at his peril; for that if he died, he ſhould be indicted for his murder; and if he lived, and brought an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him, he would willingly take a brief in it. Theſe words had a ſenſible effect on the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was well acquainted with the perſon who ſpoke them; and the old gentleman above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, thinking the naked man would afford him frequent opportunities of ſhewing his wit to the lady, offered to join with the company in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mug of beer for his fare; till partly alarmed by the threats of the one, and partly by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the other, and being, perhaps, a little moved with compaſſion at the poor creature's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who ſtood bleeding and ſhivering with the cold, he at length agreed; and Joſeph was now advancing to the coach, where, ſeeing the lady, who held the ſticks of her fan before her eyes, he abſolutely refuſed, miſerable as he was, to enter, unleſs he was furniſhed with ſufficient covering, to prevent giving the leaſt offence to decency. So
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023370_0057_0FBF3BA2EE838438"/>
perfectly modeſt was this young man; ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty effects had the ſpotleſs example of the amiable Pamela, and the excellent ſermons of Mr. Adams, wrought upon him.</p>
                        <p>Though there were ſeveral great coats about the coach, it was not eaſy to get over the difficulty which Joſeph had ſtarted. The two gentlemen complained they were cold, and could not ſpare a rag; the man of wit ſaying, with a laugh, that charity began at home; and the coachman, who had two great coats ſpread under him, refuſed to lend either, leſt they ſhould be made bloody; the lady's footman deſired to be excuſed for the ſame reaſon, which the lady herſelf, notwithſtanding her abhorrence of a naked man, approved; and it is more than probable, poor Joſeph, who obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhered to his modeſt reſolution, muſt have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, unleſs the poſtilion, (a lad who hath been ſince tranſported for robbing a henrooſt) had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſtript off a great coat, his only garment, at the ſame time ſwearing a great oath (for which he was rebuked by the paſſengers) <q>That he would rather ride in his ſhirt all his life, than ſuffer a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creature to lie in ſo miſerable a condition.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Joſeph, having put on the great coat, was lifted into the coach, which now proceeded on its jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. He declared himſelf almoſt dead with the cold, which gave the man of wit an occaſion to aſk the lady, if ſhe could not accommodate him with a dram. She anſwered with ſome reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <q>She wondered at his aſking her ſuch a queſtion; but aſſured him ſhe never taſted any ſuch thing.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The lawyer was enquiring into the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the robbery, when the coach ſtopt, and one of the ruffians putting a piſtol in, demanded their
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023370_0058_0FBF3BA3C6D8E630"/>
money of the paſſengers; who readily gave it them; and the lady, in her fright, delivered up a little ſilver bottle, of about a half pint ſize, which the rogue, clapping it to his mouth, and drinking her health, declared it held ſome of the beſt Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes he had ever taſted: this the lady afterwards aſſured the company was the miſtake of her maid; for that ſhe had ordered her to fill the bottle with Hungary-water.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the fellows were departed, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, who had, it ſeems, a caſe of piſtols in the ſeat of the coach, informed the company, that if it had been day-light, and he could have come at his piſtols, he would not have ſubmitted to the robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he likewiſe ſet forth, that he had often met highwaymen when he travelled on horſeback, but none ever durſt attack him; concluding, that if he had not been more afraid for the lady than for himſelf, he ſhould not have now parted with his money ſo eaſily.</p>
                        <p>As wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> is generally obſerved to love to reſide in empty pockets, ſo the gentleman, whoſe ingenuity we have above remarked, as ſoon as he had parted with his money, began to grow wonderfully face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. He made frequent alluſions to Adam and Eve, and ſaid many excellent things on figs, and fig-leaves; which, perhaps, gave more offence to Joſeph than to any other in the company.</p>
                        <p>The lawyer likewiſe made ſeveral very pretty jeſts, without departing from his profeſſion, He ſaid, <q>If Joſeph and the lady were alone, he would be more capable of making a conveyance to her, as his affairs were not fettered with any incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; he'd warrant, he ſoon ſuffered a recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by a writ of entry, which was the proper way to create heirs in tail; that for his own part, he
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023370_0059_0FBF3BA7962520E0"/>
would engage to make ſo firm a ſettlement in a coach, that there ſhould be no danger of an eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</q> with an inundation of the like gibberiſh, which he continued to vent till the coach arrived at an inn, where one ſervant-maid only was up in readineſs to attend the coachman, and furniſh him with cold meat and a dram. Joſeph deſired to alight, and that he might have a bed prepared for him, which the maid readily promiſed to perform; and being a good-natured wench, and not ſo ſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh as the lady had been, ſhe clapt a large faggot on the fire, and furniſhing Joſeph with a great coat belonging to one of the hoſtlers, deſired him to ſit down and warm himſelf, whilſt ſhe made his bed. The coachman, in the mean time, took an opportunity to call up a ſurgeon, who lived within a few doors: after which, he reminded his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers how late they were, and after they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leave of Joſeph, hurried them off as faſt as he could.</p>
                        <p>The wench ſoon got Joſeph to bed, and promiſed to uſe her intereſt to borrow him a ſhirt; but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, as ſhe afterwards ſaid, by his being ſo bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he muſt be a dead man: ſhe ran with all ſpeed to haſten the ſurgeon, who was more than half dreſt, apprehending that the coach had been overturned and ſome gentleman or lady hurt. As ſoon as the wench had informed him at his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that it was a poor foot-paſſenger who had been ſtript of all he had, and almoſt murdered; he chid her for diſturbing him ſo early, ſlipped off his clothes again, and very quietly returned to bed and to ſleep.</p>
                        <p>Aurora now began to ſhow her blooming cheeks over the hills, whilſt ten millions of feathered ſongſters, in jocund chorus, repeated, odes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

times ſweeter than thoſe of our laureat, and ſung both the day and the ſong; when the maſter of the inn, Mr. Tow-wouſe, aroſe, and learning from his maid an account of the robbery, and the ſituation of his poor naked gueſt, he ſhook his head, and cried, good lack-a-day! and then ordered the girl to carry him one of his own ſhirts.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Tow-wouſe was juſt awake, and had ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out her arms in vain to fold her departed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, when the maid entered the room. <q>Who's there? Betty?</q> 'Yes, Madam.' <q>Where's your maſter?</q> 
                           <q>He's without, Madam; he hath ſent me for a ſhirt to lend a poor naked man, who hath been robbed and murdered.</q> 
                           <q>Touch one, if you dare, you ſlut,</q> ſaid Mrs. Tow-wouſe; <q>your maſter is a pretty ſort of a man to take in naked vagabonds, and clothe them with his own clothes. I ſhall have no ſuch doings.—If you offer to touch any thing, I'll throw the chamber-pot at your head. Go, ſend your maſter to me,</q> 'Yes, Madam,' anſwered Betty. As ſoon as he came in, ſhe thus began: <q>What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Tow-wouſe? Am I to buy ſhirts to lend to a ſet of ſcabby raſcals?</q> 
                           <q>My dear, ſaid Mr. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe this is a poor wretch.</q> 'Yes' ſays ſhe, <q>I know, it is a poor wretch; but what the devil have we to do with poor wretches? the law makes us provide for too many already. We ſhall have thirty or forty poor wretches in red coats ſhortly.</q> 'My dear,' cries Tow-wouſe, this man hath been robbed of all he hath' Well then,' ſays ſhe, <q>where's his money to pay his reckoning? Why doth not ſuch a fellow go to an ale-houſe? I ſhall ſend him packing as ſoon as I am up, I aſſure you.</q> My dear ſaid he, 'common charity won't ſuffer you to do that.'
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:023370_0061_0FBF3BAA88F79010"/>
Common charitty, a f—t!' ſays ſhe, <q>common charity teaches us to provide for ourſelves, and our families; and I and mine won't be ruined by your charity, I aſſure you.</q> 'Well,' ſays he, <q>my dear, do as you will when you are up; you know I never contradict you.</q> 'No,' ſays ſhe, <q>if the devil was to contradict me, I would make the houſe too hot to hold him.</q>

The ſurgeon had likewiſe at laſt viſited him, and waſhed and dreſt his wounds, and was now come to acquaint Mr. Tow-wouſe, that his gueſt was in ſuch extreme danger of his life, that he ſcarce ſaw any hopes of his recovery.—'Here's a pretty kettle of fiſh,' cries Mrs. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe, <q>you have brought upon us!

                           <p>What happened to Joſeph during his ſickneſs at the inn, with the curious diſcourſe between him and Mr. Barnabas the parſon of the pariſh.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS ſoon as Joſeph had communicated a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular hiſtory of the robbery, together with a ſhort account of himſelf and his intended journey, he aſked the ſurgeon, if he apprehended him to be in any danger: To which the ſurgeon very honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, <q>He feared he was; for that his pulſe was very exalted and feveriſh, and if his fever ſhould prove more than ſymptomatic, it would be impoſſible to ſave him.</q> Joſeph fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deep ſigh, cried, <q>Poor Fanny, I would I could have lived to ſee thee! but God's will be done.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſurgeon then adviſed him, if he had any worldly affairs to ſettle, that he would do it as ſoon as poſſible; for tho' he hoped he might recover, yet he thought himſelf obliged to acquaint him he was in great danger; and if the malign concoction of his humours ſhould cauſe a ſuſcitation of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he might ſoon grow delirious and incapable to make his will. Joſeph anſwered, <q>That it was impoſſible for any creature in the univerſe to be in a poorer condition than himſelf: for ſince the robbery, he had not one thing of any kind whatever, which he could call his own. I had, ſaid he, a poor little piece of gold, which they took away, that would have been a comfort to me in all my afflictions; but ſurely, Fanny, I want nothing to remind me of thee. I have
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023370_0063_0FBF3BAF132A8E20"/>
thy dear image in my heart, and no villain can ever tear it thence.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Joſeph deſired paper and pens to write a letter, but they were refuſed him; and he was adviſed to uſe all his endeavours to compoſe himſelf. They then left him; and Mr. Tow-wouſe ſent to a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman to come and adminiſter his good offices to the ſoul of poor Joſeph, ſince the ſurgeon deſpaired of making any ſucceſsful applications to his body.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barnabas (for that was the clergyman's name) came as ſoon as ſent for; and having firſt drank a diſh of tea with the landlady, and afterwards a bowl of punch with the landlord, he walked up to the room where Joſeph lay; but finding him aſleep, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to take the other ſna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>er; which when he had finiſhed, he again crept ſoftly up to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door, and having opened it, heard the ſick man talking to himſelf in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>O moſt adorable Pamela! moſt virtuous ſiſter! whoſe example could alone enable me to withſtand all the temptations of riches and beauty, and to preſerve my virtue pure and chaſte, for the arms of my dear Fanny, if it had pleaſed heaven that I ſhould ever have come unto them. What riches, or honours, or pleaſures can make us amends for the loſs of innocence? Doth not that alone afford us more conſolation, than all worldly acquiſitions? What but innocence and virtue could give any comfort to ſuch a miſerable wretch as I am? Yet theſe can make me prefer this ſick and painful bed to all the pleaſures I ſhould have found in my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's. Theſe can make me face death without fear; and though I love my Fanny more than ever man loved a woman, theſe can teach me to reſign my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the divine will without repining. O thou delightful charming creature! if heaven had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023370_0064_0FBF3BB29787ED00"/>
thee to my arms, the pooreſt, humbleſt ſtate, would have been a paradiſe; I could have lived with thee in the loweſt cottage, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the palaces, the dainties, or the riches of any man breathing. But I muſt leave thee, leave thee for ever, my deareſt angel! I muſt think of another world; and I heartily pray thou may'ſt meet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this.</q>—Barnabas thought he had heard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; ſo down ſtairs he went and told Tow-wouſe he could do his gueſt no ſervice; for that he was very light-headed, and had uttered nothing but a rhapſody of nonſenſe all the time he ſtayed in the room.</p>
                        <p>The ſurgeon returned in the afternoon, and found his patient in a higher fever, as he ſaid, than when he left him, though not delirious; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Mr. Barnabas's opinion, he had not been once out of his ſenſes ſince his arrival at the inn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barnabas was again ſent for, and with much difficulty prevailed on to make another viſit. As ſoon as he entered the room, he told Joſeph, <q>He was come to pray by him, and to prepare him for another world: in the firſt place therefore, he hoped he had repented of all his ſins.</q> Joſeph an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>He hoped he had; but there was one thing which he knew not whether he ſhould call a ſin; if it was, he feared he ſhould die in the commiſſion of it; and that was the regret of parting with a young woman, whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heart ſtrings.</q> Barnabas bad him be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, <q>that any repining at the divine will was one of the greateſt ſins he could commit; that he ought to forget all carnal affections, and think of better things.</q> Joſeph ſaid, <q>That neither in this world nor the next, he could forget his Fanny; and that
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023370_0065_0FBF3BB50345B908"/>
the thought, however grievous, of parting from her for ever, was not half ſo tormenting, as the fear of what ſhe ſhould ſuffer, when ſhe knew his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</q> Barnabas ſaid, <q>That ſuch fears argued a diffidence and deſpondence very criminal; that he muſt diveſt himſelf of all human paſſions, and fix his heart above.</q> Joſeph anſwered, <q>That was what he deſired to do.</q> He then queſtioned him concerning his forgiveneſs of the thieves.—Joſeph, with a very heavy ſigh, replied, He feared <q>that was more than he could do: for nothing would give him more pleaſure than to hear they were taken.</q> 'That,' cries Barnabas, <q>is for the ſake of Juſtice.</q> 'Yes,' ſaid Joſeph, <q>but if I was to meet them again, I am afraid I ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them, and kill them too, if I could.</q> 'Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs anſwered Barnabas, <q>it is lawful to kill a thief: but can you forgive them as a chriſtian ought?</q> Joſeph deſired to know what that forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was. 'That is,' anſwered Barnabas, <q>to forgive them as—as—it is to forgive them as—in ſhort it is to forgive them as a chriſtian.</q> Joſeph replied, 'He forgave them as much as he could.' Well, well, ſaid Barnabas, 'that will do.' He then demanded of him, <q>if he remembered any more ſins unrepented of; and if he did, he deſired him to make haſte and repent of them as faſt as he could: that they might repeat over a few prayers together.</q> Joſeph anſwered, <q>He could not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any great crimes he had been guilty of, and that thoſe he had committed he was ſincerely ſorry for.</q> Barnabas ſaid that was enough, and then proceeded to prayer with all the expedition he was maſter of, ſome company then waiting for him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Joſeph complained he was dry, and deſired a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tea; which Barnabas reported to Mrs. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe, who anſwered, <q>She had juſt done drinking it, and could not bear to be ſlopping all day;</q> but ordered Betty to carry him up ſome ſmall beer.</p>
                        <p>Betty obeyed her miſtreſs's commands; but Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, as ſoon as he taſted it, ſaid, he feared it would increaſe his fever, and that he longed very much for tea: To which the good-natured Betty anſwered, he ſhould have tea, if there was any in the land; ſhe accordingly went and bought him ſome herſelf, and attended him with it: where we will leave her and Joſeph together for ſome time, to entertain the reader with other matters.</p>

                           <p>Being very full of adventures, which ſucceeded each other at the inn.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT was now the duſk of the evening, when a grave perſon rode into the inn, and committing his horſe to the hoſtler, went directly into the kitchen, and having called for a pipe of tobacco, took his place by the fire-ſide; where ſeveral perſons were likewiſe aſſembled.</p>
                        <p>The diſcourſe ran altogether on the robbery which was committed the night before, and on the poor wretch, who lay above in the dreadful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which we have already ſeen him. Mrs. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe ſaid, <q>She wondered what the devil Tom Whipwell meant by bringing ſuch gueſts to her houſe, when there were ſo many ale houſes on the road proper for their reception. But ſhe aſſured him, if he died, the pariſh ſhould be at the expence of the funeral.</q> She added, <q>Nothing would ſerve the fellow's turn but tea, ſhe would aſſure him.</q> Betty, who was juſt returned from her charitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023370_0067_0FBF3BC264420738"/>
anſwered, ſhe believed he was a gentleman, for ſhe never ſaw a finer ſkin in her life. <q>Pox on his ſkin!</q> replied Mrs. Tow-wouſe, <q>I ſuppoſe that is all we are like to have for the reckoning. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no ſuch gentlemen ſhould ever call at the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</q> (which it ſeems was the ſign of the inn.)</p>
                        <p>The gentleman lately arrived diſcovered a great deal of emotion at the diſtreſs of this poor creature, whom he obſerved to be fallen not into the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate hands. And indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouſe had given no utterance to the ſweetneſs of her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nature had taken ſuch pains in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that Hogarth himſelf never gave more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to a picture.</p>
                        <p>Her perſon was ſhort, thin, and crooked. Her forehead projected in the middle, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in a declivity to the top of her noſe, which was ſharp and red, and would have hung over her lips, had not nature turned up one end of it. Her lips were two bits of ſkin, which, whenever ſhe ſpoke, ſhe drew together in a purſe. Her chin was peaked; and at the upper end of that ſkin, which compoſed her cheeks, ſtood two bones, that almoſt hid a pair of ſmall red eyes. Add to this a voice moſt wonderfully adapted to the ſentiments it was to convey, being both loud and hoarſe.</p>
                        <p>It is not eaſy to ſay, whether the gentleman had conceived a greater diſlike for his landlady, or compaſſion for her unhappy gueſt. He enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very earneſtly of the ſurgeon, who was now come into the kitchen, whether he had any hopes of his recovery? he begged him to uſe all poſſible means towards it, telling him, <q>it was the duty of men of all profeſſions, to apply their ſkill gratis for the relief of the poor and neceſſitous.</q> The ſurgeon anſwered, <q>he ſhould take proper care;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023370_0068_0FBF3BC39C4B4940"/>
but he defied all the ſurgeons in London to do him any good.</q> 'Pray, Sir,' ſaid the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, 'What are his wounds?—Why, <q>do you know any thing of wounds?</q> ſays the ſurgeon (winking upon Mrs. Tow-wouſe) <q>Sir, I have a ſmall ſmattering in ſurgery,</q> anſwered the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. 'A ſmattering,—ho, ho, ho!' ſaid the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, 'I believe it is a ſmattering indeed.</p>
                        <p>The company were all attentive, expecting to hear the doctor, who was what they call a dry fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, expoſe the gentleman.</p>
                        <p>He began therefore with an air of triumph: <q>I ſuppoſe, Sir, you have travelled.</q> 
                           <q>No really Sir,</q> ſaid the gentleman. <q>Ho! then you have practiſed in the hoſpitals perhaps.</q>—'No, Sir,' <q>Hum! not that neither? Whence, Sir, then, if I may be ſo bold to enquire, have you got your knowledge in ſurgery?</q> 'Sir', anſwered the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <q>I do not pretend to much; but the little I know, I have from books.</q> 'Book!' cries the doctor.—'What, I ſuppoſe you have read Galen and Hippocrates!' 'No, Sir, ſaid the gentleman. 'How! you underſtand ſurgery,' anſwers the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, 'and not read Galen and Hippocrates' 'Sir,' cries the other, <q>I believe there are many ſurgeons who have never read theſe authors.</q> 
                           <q>I believe ſo too,</q> ſays the doctor, <q>more ſhame for them: but thanks to my education I have them by heart, and very ſeldom go without them both in my pocket.</q> 'They are pretty large books, 'ſaid the gentleman. 'Aye,' ſaid the doctor, <q>I believe I know how large they are better than you.</q> (At which he fell a winking, and the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny burſt into a laugh.)</p>
                        <p>The doctor purſuing his triumph, aſked the gentleman, <q>if he did not underſtand phyſic as well
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023370_0069_0FBF3BC5A49B8178"/>
as ſurgery.</q> 'Rather better,' anſwered the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. 'Aye, like enough,' cries the doctor, with a wink. 'Why, I know a little of phyſic too.' I wiſh I knew half ſo much,' ſaid Tow-wouſe, I'd never wear an apron again.' <q>Why I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, landlord,</q> cries the doctor, <q>there are few men, though I ſay it, within twelve miles of the place, that handle a fever better.—<hi>Veniente ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currite merbo:</hi> that is my method.—I ſuppoſe, brother, you underſtand <hi>Latin?</hi> A little,</q> ſays the gentleman. <q>Aye, and Greek now I'll warrant you: <hi>Ton dapomibo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The gentleman, who had not the leaſt affection for joking, very contentedly ſuffered the doctor to enjoy his victory; which he did with no ſmall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: and having ſufficiently ſounded his depth, told him, <q>he was thoroughly convinced of his great abilities; and that he would be obliged to him, if he would let him know his opinion of his patient's caſe above ſtairs.</q> 'Sir,' ſays the doctor, <q>his caſe is that of a dead man—The contuſion on his head has perforated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal membrane of the occiput, and divelicated that radical ſmall minute inviſible nerve, which coheres to the pericranium; and this was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a fever at firſt ſymptomatic, then pneumatic; and he is at length grown deliriuus, or delirious as the vulgar expreſs it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>He was proceeding in this learned manner, when a mighty noiſe interrupted him. Some young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the neighbourhood had taken one of the thieves, and were bringing him into the inn. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023370_0070_0FBF3BC714C52F38"/>
ran up ſtairs with this news to Joſeph: who begged they might ſearch for a little piece of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken gold, which had a ribband tied to it, and which he could ſwear to amongſt all the hoards of the richeſt men in the univerſe.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding the fellow's perſiſting in his innocence, the mob were very buſy in ſearching him, and preſently, among other things, pulled out the piece of gold juſt mentioned; which Betty no ſooner ſaw, than ſhe laid violent hands on it, and conveyed it up to Joſeph, who received it with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of joy, and hugging it in his boſom, declared, he could now die contented.</p>
                        <p>Within a few minutes afterwards, came in ſome other fellows, with a bundle which they had found in a ditch, and which was indeed the cloaths which had been ſtripped off from Joſeph, and the other things they had taken from him.</p>
                        <p>The gentleman no ſooner ſaw the coat, than he declared he knew the livery; and, if it had been taken from the poor creature above ſtairs, deſired he might ſee him: for that he was very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the family to whom that livery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</p>
                        <p>He was accordingly conducted up by Betty: but what, reader, was the ſurprize on both ſides, when he ſaw Joſeph was the perſon in bed; and when Joſeph diſcovered the face of his good friend Mr. Abraham Adams!</p>
                        <p>It would be impertinent to inſert a diſcourſe which chiefly turned on the relation of matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well known to the reader: for as ſoon as the curate had ſatisfied Joſeph concerning the perfect health of his Fanny, he was on his ſide very inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive into all the particulars which had produced this unfortunate accident.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="72" facs="unknown:023370_0071_0FBF3BC88A86B3C0"/>
To return therefore to the kitchen, where a great variety of company were now aſſembled from all the rooms of the houſe, as well as the neighbourhood: ſo much delight do men take in contemplating the countenance of a thief.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tow-wouſe began to rub his hands with pleaſure, at ſeeing ſo large an aſſembly; who would he hoped, ſhortly adjourn into ſeveral apartments, in order to diſcourſe over the robbery, and drink a health to all honeſt men. But Mrs. Tow-wouſe, whoſe misfortune it was commonly to ſee things a little perverſely, began to rail at thoſe who brought the fellow into her houſe; telling her huſband, <q>they were very likely to thrive, who kept a houſe of entertainment for beggars and thieves.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The mob had now finiſhed their ſearch; and could find nothing about the captive likely to prove any evidence; for as to the cloaths, tho' the mob was very well ſatisfied with that proof; yet, as the ſurgeon obſerved, they could not convict him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not found in his cuſtody; to which Barnabas agreed, and added, that theſe things were <hi>bona waviata,</hi> and belonged to the lord of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>
                        <p>'How,' ſays the ſurgeon, <q>do you ſay theſe goods belong to the lord of the manor?</q> 'I do,' cried Barnabas. 'Then I deny it,' ſays the ſurgeon. <q>What can the lord of the manor have to do in the caſe? Will any one attempt to perſuade me that what a man finds is not his own?</q> 
                           <q>I have heard (ſays an old fellow in the corner) juſtice Wiſeone ſay, that if every man had his right, whatever is found belongs to the king of London.</q> 
                           <q>That may be true,</q> ſays Barnabas, <q>in ſome ſenſe: for the law makes a difference between things ſtolen and things found: for a thing may be ſtolen that
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023370_0072_0FBF3BCACEAEDD88"/>
never is found; and a thing may be found that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſtolen. Now goods that are both ſtolen and found are <hi>waviata;</hi> and they belong to the lord of the manor.</q> 
                           <q>So the lord of the manor is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of ſtolen goods,</q> (ſays the doctor;) at which there was a univerſal laugh, being firſt begun by himſelf.</p>
                        <p>While the priſoner, by perſiſting in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, had almoſt (as there was no evidence againſt him) brought over Barnabas, the ſurgeon, Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe, and ſeveral others to his ſide; Betty inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that they had over-looked a little piece of gold, which ſhe had carried up to the man in bed; and which he offered to ſwear amongſt a million, aye, amongſt ten thouſand. This immediately turned the ſcale againſt the priſoner; and every one now concluded him guilty. It was reſolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to keep him ſecure that night, and early in the morning to carry him before a juſtice.</p>

                           <p>Shewing how Mrs. Tow-wouſe was a little mollified; and how officious Mr. Barnabas and the ſurgeon were to proſecute the thief: with a diſſertation accounting for their zeal, and that of many other perſons not mentioned in this hiſtory.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BETTY told her miſtreſs, ſhe believed the man in bed was a greater man than they took him for: for beſides the extreme whiteneſs of his ſkin, and the ſoftneſs of his hands, ſhe obſerved a very great familiarity between the gentleman and him; and added, ſhe was certain they were intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, if not relations.</p>
                        <p>This ſomewhat abated the ſeverity of Mrs. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe's

countenance. She ſaid, <q>God forbid ſhe ſhould not diſcharge the duty of a Chriſtian, ſince the poor gentleman was brought to her houſe. She had a natural antipathy to vagabonds: but could pity the misfortunes of a Chriſtian as ſoon as another.</q> Tow-wouſe ſaid, <q>If the traveller be a gentleman, tho' he had no money about him now, we ſhall moſt likely be paid hereafter; ſo 'you may begin to ſcore whenever you will.</q> Mrs. Tow-wouſe anſwered. <q>Hold your ſimple tongue, and don't inſtruct me in my buſineſs. I am ſure I am ſorry for the gentleman's misfortune with all my heart; and I hope the villain who hath uſed him ſo barbarouſly will be hanged. Betty, go, ſee what he wants. God forbid he ſhould want any thing in my houſe.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Barnabas and the ſurgeon went up to Joſeph, to ſatisfy themſelves concerning the piece of gold. Joſeph was with difficulty prevailed upon to ſhew it them; but would by no entreaties be brought to deliver it out of his own poſſeſſion. He however atteſted this to be the ſame which had been taken from him; and Betty was ready to ſwear to the finding it on the thief.</p>
                        <p>The only difficulty that remained, was how to produce this gold before the juſtice: for as to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Joſeph himſelf, it ſeemed impoſſible; nor was there any great likelihood of obtaining it from him: for he had faſtened it with a riband to his arm, and ſolemnly vowed, that nothing but irreſiſtible force ſhould ever ſeparate them; in which reſolution, Mr. Adams clenching a fiſt rather leſs than the knuckle of an ox, declared he would ſupport him.</p>
                        <p>A diſpute aroſe on this occaſion concerning evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not very neceſſary to be related here; after which the ſurgeon dreſt Mr. Joſeph's head; ſtill
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:023370_0074_0FBF3BD0C9A44AD0"/>
perſiſting in the imminent danger in which his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient lay; but concluding with a very important look, <q>that he began to have hopes; that he ſhould ſend him a ſanative ſoporiferous draught, and would ſee him in the morning.</q> After which Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas and he departed, and left Mr. Joſeph and Mr. Adams together.</p>
                        <p>Adams informed Joſeph of the occaſion of this journey which he was making to London, namely, to publiſh three volumes of ſermons; being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, as he ſaid by an advertiſement lately ſet forth by a ſociety of bookſellers, who propoſed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, any copies offered to them, at a price to be ſettled by two perſons: but tho' he imagined he ſhould get a conſiderable ſum of money on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which his family were in urgent need of, he proteſted he would not leave Joſeph in his preſent condition: finally, he told him, <q>he had nine ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and three pence half-penny in his pocket, which he was welcome to uſe as he pleaſed.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This goodneſs of parſon Adams brought tears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Joſeph's eyes; he declared he had now a <q>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon to deſire life, that he might ſhew his gratitude to ſuch a friend.</q> Adams bade him <q>be chearful; for that he plainly ſaw the ſurgeon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ignorance, deſired to make a merit of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, tho' the wounds in his head, he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were by no means dangerous; that he was convinced he had no fever, and doubted not but he would be able to travel in a day or two.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words infuſed a ſpirit into Joſeph; he ſaid, <q>he found himſelf very ſore from the bruiſes, but had no reaſon to think any of his bones injured, or that he had received any harm in his inſide; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that he felt ſomething very odd in his ſtomach: but he knew not whether that might not ariſe from
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:023370_0075_0FBF3BD258CC82C0"/>
not having eaten one morſel for above twenty-four hours.</q> Being then aſked if he had any inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to eat, he anſwered in the affirmative. Then parſon Adams deſired him to name what he had the greateſt fancy for; whether a poached egg, or chicken broth: he anſwered, <q>he could eat both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well; but that he ſeemed to have the greateſt appetite for a piece of boiled beef and cabbage.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Adams was pleaſed with ſo perfect a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had not the leaſt fever; but adviſed him to a lighter diet, for that evening. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly eat either a rabbit or a fowl, I never could with any tolerable certainty diſcover which; after this, he was, by Mrs. Tow-wouſe's order, conveyed into a better bed, and equipped with one of her huſband's ſhirts.</p>
                        <p>In the morning early, Barnabas and the ſurgeon came to the inn, in order to ſee the thief conveyed before the juſtice. They had conſumed the whole night in debating what meaſures they ſhould take to produce the piece of gold in evidence againſt him: for they were both extremely zealous in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' neither of them were in the leaſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the proſecution; neither of them had ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any private injury from the fellow, nor had either of them ever been ſuſpected of loving the publick well enough to give them a ſermon or a doſe of phyſick for nothing.</p>
                        <p>To help our reader therefore as much as poſſible to account for this zeal, we muſt inform him, that, as this pariſh was ſo unfortunate as to have no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in it; there had been a conſtant contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two doctors, ſpiritual and phyſical, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their abilities in a ſcience, in which, as neither of them profeſſed it, they had equal preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to diſpute each other's opinions. Theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023370_0076_0FBF3BD4AC4C2A08"/>
were carried on with great contempt on both ſides, and had almoſt divided the pariſh; Mr. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe and one half of the neighbours inclining to the ſurgeon, and Mrs. Tow-wouſe with the other half to the parſon. The ſurgeon drew his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from thoſe ineſtimable fountains called the Attorney's Pocket-Companion, and Mr. Jacob's Law-tables; Barnabas truſted entirely to Wood's Inſtitutes. It happened on this occaſion, as was pretty frequently the caſe, that theſe two learned men differed about the ſufficiency of evidence: the doctor being of opinion, that the maid's oath would convict the priſoner without producing the gold; the parſon <hi>è contra, totis viribus.</hi> To diſplay their parts therefore before the juſtice and the pariſh, was the ſole motive, which we can diſcover, to this zeal which both of them pretended to have for public juſtice.</p>
                        <p>O Vanity! how little is thy force acknowledged, or thy operations diſcerned! How wantonly doſt thou deceive mankind under different diſguiſes! Sometimes thou doſt wear the face of pity, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of generoſity: nay, thou haſt the aſſurance even to put on thoſe glorious ornaments which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to heroick virtue. Thou odious, deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed monſter! whom prieſts have railed at, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers deſpiſed, and poets ridiculed: is there a wretch ſo abandoned as to own thee for an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in publick? yet how few will refuſe to enjoy thee in private! nay, thou art the purſuit of moſt men through their lives. The greateſt villainies are daily practiſed to pleaſe thee: nor is the meaneſt thief below, or the greateſt hero above thy notice. Thy embraces are often the ſole aim and ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the private robbery, and the plundered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. It is to pamper up thee, thou harlot, that
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023370_0077_0FBF3BD74555D458"/>
we attempt to withdraw from others what we do not want, or to withhold from them what they do. All our paſſions are thy ſlaves. Avarice itſelf is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten no more than thy hand-maid, and even luſt thy pimp.

                           <p>The eſcape of the thief. Mr. Adams's diſappointment. The arrival of two very extraordinary perſonages, and the introduction of parſon Adams to parſon Barnabas.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BARNABAS and the ſurgeon being returned, as we have ſaid, to the inn, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the thief before the juſtice, were greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to find a ſmall accident had happened, which ſomewhat diſconcerted them; and this was no other than the thief's eſcape, who had modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrawn himſelf by night, declining all oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and not chuſing, in imitation of ſome great men, to diſtinguiſh himſelf at the expence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pointed at.</p>
                        <p>When the company had retired the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023370_0078_0FBF3BDBE12B7480"/>
the thief was detained in a room where the conſtable, and one of the young fellows who took him, were planted as his guard. About the ſecond watch, a general complaint of drowth was made both by the priſoner and his keepers; among whom it was at laſt agreed, that the conſtable ſhould remain on duty, and the young fellow call up the tapſter; in which diſpoſition the latter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended not the leaſt danger, as the conſtable was well armed, and could beſides eaſily ſummon him back to his aſſiſtance, if the priſoner made the leaſt attempt to gain his liberty.</p>
                        <p>The young fellow had not long left the room, before it came into the conſtable's head, that the priſoner might leap on him by ſurpriſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preventing him of the uſe of his weapons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the long ſtaff, in which he chiefly confided, might reduce the ſucceſs of the ſtruggle to an equal chance. He wiſely, therefore, to prevent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, ſlipt out of the room himſelf, and locked the door, waiting without with his ſtaff in his hand, ready lifted to fell the unhappy priſoner, if by ill fortune he ſhould attempt to break out.</p>
                        <p>But human life, as hath been diſcovered by ſome great man or other, (for I would by no means be underſtood to affect the honour of making any ſuch diſcovery) very much reſembles a game at Cheſs: for as in the latter, while a gameſter is too atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſecure himſelf very ſtrongly on one ſide the board, he is apt to leave an unguarded opening on the other; ſo doth it often happen in life; and ſo did it happen on this occaſion: for whilſt the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious conſtable with ſuch wonderful ſagacity had poſſeſſed himſelf of the door, he moſt unhappily forgot the window.</p>
                        <p>The thief, who played on the other ſide, no
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023370_0079_0FBF3BDCC8CDF7A0"/>
ſooner perceived this opening, than he began to move that way; and finding the paſſage eaſy he took with him the young fellow's hat; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceremony, ſtepped into the ſtreet, and made the beſt of his way.</p>
                        <p>The young fellow returning with a double mug of ſtrong beer, was a little ſurprized to find the conſtable at the door; but much more ſo, when, the door being opened, he perceived the priſoner had made his eſcape, and which way. He threw down the beer, and without uttering any thing to the conſtable, except a hearty curſe or two, he nimbly leapt out at the window, and went again in purſuit of his prey; being very unwilling to loſe the reward which he had aſſured himſelf of.</p>
                        <p>The conſtable hath not been diſcharged of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion on this account: it hath been ſaid, that not being concerned in the taking the thief, he could not have been entitled to any part of the reward, if he had been convicted; that the thief had ſeveral guineas in his pocket; that it was very unlikely he ſhould have been guilty of ſuch an overſight; that his pretence for leaving the room was abſurd; that it was his conſtant maxim, that a wiſe man never refuſed money on any conditions; that at every election he always had ſold his vote to both parties, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But notwithſtanding theſe and many other ſuch allegations, I am ſufficiently convinced of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; having been poſitively aſſured of it, by thoſe who received their informations from his own mouth; which, in the opinion of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, is the beſt and indeed only evidence.</p>
                        <p>All the family were now up, and with many others aſſembled in the kitchen, where Mr. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe was in ſome tribulation; the ſurgeon hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:023370_0080_0FBF3BDF60C5F808"/>
declared, that by law he was liable to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for the thief's eſcape, as it was out of his houſe: he was a little comforted however by Mr. Barnabas's opinion, that as the eſcape was by night, the indictment would not lie.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Tow-wouſe delivered herſelf in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words: <q>Sure never was ſuch a fool as my huſband! would any other perſon living have left a man in the cuſtody of ſuch a drunken drowſy blockhead as Tom Suckbribe;</q> (which was the conſtable's name) <q>and if he could be indicted without any harm to his wife and children, I ſhould be glad of it.</q> (Then the bell rung in Joſeph's room.) <q>Why, Betty, John, Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, where the devil are you all? Have you no ears, or no conſcience, not to tend the ſick bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?—See what the gentleman wants; why don't you go yourſelf, Mr. Tow-wouſe? but any one may die for you; you have no more feeling than a dead-board. If a man lived a fortnight in your houſe without ſpending a penny, you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put him in mind of it. See whether he drinks tea or coffee for breakfaſt.</q> 'Yes, my dear,' cried Tow-wouſe. She then aſked the doctor and Mr. Barnabas what morning's draught they choſe, who anſwered they had a pot of cyder-and at the fire; which we will leave them merry over, and return to Joſeph.</p>
                        <p>He had riſen pretty early this morning: but tho' his wounds were far from threatening any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he was ſo ſore with the bruiſes, that it was impoſſible for him to think of undertaking a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney yet; Mr. Adams therefore, whoſe ſtock was viſibly decreaſed with the expences of ſupper and breakfaſt, and which could not ſurvive that day's ſcoring, began to conſider how it was poſſible to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023370_0081_0FBF3BE0AE9D6920"/>
recruit it. At laſt he cry'd, <q>He had luckily hit on a ſure method; and though it would oblige him to return himſelf home together with Joſeph, it mattered not much.</q> He then ſent for Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe, and taking him into another room, told him, <q>He wanted to borrow three guineas, for which he would put ample ſecurity into his hand.</q> Tow-wouſe, who expected a watch, or ring, or ſomething of double the value, anſwered, <q>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he could furniſh him.</q> Upon which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, pointing to his ſaddle-bag, told him with a voice and face full of ſolemnity, <q>That there were in that bag no leſs than nine volumes of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript ſermons, as well worth a hundred pounds as a ſhilling was worth twelve pence, and that he would depoſit one of the volumes in his hands by way of pledge; not doubting but that he would have the honeſty to return it on his repayment of the money: for otherwiſe he muſt be a very great loſer, ſeeing that every volume would at leaſt bring him ten pounds, as he had been informed by a neighbouring clergyman in the country: for, ſaid he, as to my own part, having never yet dealt in printing, I do not pretend to aſcertain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act value of ſuch things.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Tow-wouſe, who was a little ſurprized at the pawn, ſaid (and not without ſome truth) <q>That he was no judge of the price of ſuch kind of goods: and as for money, he really was very ſhort.</q> Adams anſwered, <q>Certainly he would not ſcruple to lend him three guineas on what was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly worth at leaſt ten.</q> The landlord replied, <q>He did not believe he had ſo much money in the houſe, and beſides he was to make up a ſum. He was very confident the books were of much higher value, and heartily ſorry it did not ſuit
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023370_0082_0FBF3BE20D40CE98"/>
him.</q> He then cryed out, coming Sir! though no body called; and ran down ſtairs without any fear of breaking his neck.</p>
                        <p>Poor Adams was extremely dejected at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, nor knew he what farther ſtratagem to try. He immediately applied to his pipe, his conſtant friend and comfort in his afflictions; and leaning over the rails he devoted himſelf to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, aſſiſted by the inſpiring fumes of tobacco.</p>
                        <p>He had on a night-cap drawn over his wig, and a ſhort great coat, which half-covered his caſſock; a dreſs which, added to ſomething comical enough in his countenance, compoſed a figure likely to attract the eyes of thoſe who were not ever-given to obſervation.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt he was ſmoaking his pipe in this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a coach and fix, with a numerous attendance, drove into the inn. There alighted from the coach a young fellow and a brace of pointers, after which another young fellow leapt from the box, and ſhook the former by the hand; and both, together with the dogs, were inſtantly conducted by Mr. Tow-wouſe into an apartment; whither as they paſſed, they entertained themſelves with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhort facetious dialogue.</p>
                        <p>'You are a pretty fellow for a coachman, Jack!' ſays he from the coach, <q>you had almoſt overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us juſt now.</q> 'Pox take you,' ſays the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <q>if I had only broke your neck, it would have been ſaving ſomebody elſe the trouble: but I ſhould have been ſorry for the pointers.</q> 'Why you ſon of a b—,' anſwered the other, <q>if no body could ſhoot better than you, the pointers would be of no uſe.</q> 
                           <q>D—n me, ſays the coachman, I will ſhoot with you, five guineas a ſhot.</q> 'You be hanged,' ſays the other, <q>for

five guineas you ſhall ſhoot at my a—.</q> 'Done,' ſays the coachman, <q>I'll pepper you better than ever you was pepper'd by Jenny Bouncer.</q> 'Pepper your grandmother,' ſays the other, <q>here's Tow-wouſe will let you ſhoot at him for a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a time.</q> 'I know his honour better,' cries Tow-wouſe, <q>I never ſaw a ſurer ſhoot at a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge. Every man miſſes now and then; but if I could ſhoot half as well as his honour, I would deſire no better livelihood than I could get by my gun.</q> 'Pox on you,' ſaid the coachman, <q>you demoliſh more game now than your head's worth. There's a bitch, Tow-wouſe, by G—ſhe never blink'd a bird in her life.</q> 
                           <q>I have a puppy not a year old ſhall hunt with her for a hundred,</q> cries the other gentleman, 'Done,' ſays the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <q>but you will be pox'd before you make the bett. If you have a mind for a bett,</q> cries the coachman, <q>I will match my ſpotted dog with your white bitch for a hundred, play or pay.</q> 'Done,' ſays the other, <q>and I'll run Baldface againſt Slouch with you for another.</q> 'No,' cries he from the box, <q>but I'll venture Miſs Jenny againſt Baldface or Hannibal either.</q> 'Go to the devil,' cries he from the coach, <q>I will make every bett your own way, to be ſure! I will match Hannibal with Slouch for a thouſand, if you dare, and I ſay done firſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>They were now arrived, and the reader will be very contented to leave them, and repair to the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, where Barnabas, the ſurgeon, and an exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were ſmoaking their pipes over ſome Cyder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, and where the ſervants, who attended the two noble gentlemen we have juſt ſeen alight, were now arrived.</p>
                        <p>'Tom,' cries one of the footmen, <q>there's parſon

Adams ſmoaking his pipe in the gallery.</q> 'Yes ſays Tom, <q>I pulled off my hat to him, and the parſon ſpoke to me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Is the gentleman a clergyman then?' ſays Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, (for his caſſock had been tied up when he firſt arrived.) 'Yes, Sir,' anſwered the footman, <q>and one there is but few like.</q> 'Aye,' ſaid Barnabas, <q>If I had known it ſooner, I ſhould have deſired his company; I would always pay a proper reſpect for the cloth; but what ſay you, Doctor, ſhall we adjourn into a room, and invite him to take part of a bowl of punch?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This propoſal was immediately agreed to, and executed; and parſon Adams accepting the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much civility paſſed between the two clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who both declared the great honour they had for the cloth. They had not been long together, before they entered into a diſcourſe on ſmall tithes, which continued a full hour, without the doctor o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>It was then propoſed to begin a general conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the exciſeman opened on foreign affairs: but a word unluckily dropping from one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a diſſertation on the hardſhips ſuffered by the inferior clergy; which after a long duration, concluded with bringing the nine volumes of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on the carpet.</p>
                        <p>Barnabas greatly diſcouraged poor Adams; he ſaid, <q>The age was ſo wicked, that nobody read ſermons:</q> Would you think it, Mr. Adams, (ſaid he) <q>I once intended to print a volume of ſermons myſelf, and they had the approbation of two or three biſhops: but what do you think a bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler offered me?</q> 'Twelve guineas perhaps (cried Adams.') 'Not twelve pence, I aſſure you,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Barnabas; <q>nay, the dog refuſed me a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023370_0085_0FBF3BEE179DB720"/>
in exchange.—At laſt I offered to give him the printing them for the ſake of dedicating them to that very gentleman who juſt now drove his own coach into the inn; and I aſſure you he had the impudence to refuſe my offer: by which means I loſt a good living, that was afterwards given away in exchange for a pointer, to one who—but I will not ſay any thing againſt the cloth. So you may gueſs, Mr. Adams, what you are to expect; for if ſermons would have gone down, I believe—I will not be vain: but to be conciſe with you, three biſhops ſaid, they were the beſt that ever were writ: but indeed there are a pretty moderate number printed already, and not all ſold yet.</q>—'Pray, Sir,' ſaid Adams, <q>to what do you think the numbers may amount?</q> 'Sir,' anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Barnabas, <q>a bookſeller told me, he believed five thouſand volumes at leaſt.</q> 'Five thouſand!' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uoth the ſurgeon, <q>what can they be writ upon? I remember when I was a boy, I uſed to read one Tillotſon's ſermons; and I am ſure, if a man practiſed half ſo much as is in one of thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he will go to heaven.</q> 'Doctor,' cried Barnabas, <q>you have a prophane way of talking, for which I muſt reprove you. A man can never have his duty too frequently inculcated into him. And as for Tillotſon, to be ſure he was a good writer, and ſaid things very well: but compariſons are odious; another man may write as well as he—I believe there are ſome of my ſermons,</q>—and then he applied the candle to his pipe—<q>And I believe there are ſome of my diſcourſes,</q> cries Adams, <q>which the biſhops would not think totally unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being printed; and I have been informed, I might procure a very large ſum (indeed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe one) on them.</q> 'I doubt that,' anſwered
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023370_0086_0FBF3BF47212D518"/>
Barnabas, <q>however, if you deſire to make ſome money of them, perhaps you may ſell them by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing the manuſcript ſermons, of a clergyman lately deceaſed, all warranted originals, and never printed. And now I think of it, I ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to you, if there be ever a funeral one among them, to lend it me: for I am this very day to preach a funeral ſermon; for which I have not penned a line, though I am to have a double price.</q> Adams anſwered, <q>He had but one, which he feared would not ſerve his purpoſe, being ſacred to the memory of a magiſtrate, who had exerted himſelf very ſingularly in the preſervation of the morality of his neighbours, inſomuch that he had neither ale-houſe, nor lewd woman in the pariſh where he lived.</q>—'No,' replyed Barnabas, <q>that will not do quite ſo well; for the deceaſed upon whoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues I am to harangue, was a little too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to liquor, and publickly kept a miſtreſs I believe I muſt take a common ſermon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </p>
                        <p>With ſuch kind of ſpiritual diſcourſe, they emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the bowl of punch, paid their reckoning, and ſeparated: Adams and the doctor went up to Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, parſon Barnabas departed to celebrate the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid deceaſed, and the exciſeman deſcended into the cellar to gauge the veſſels.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph was now ready to ſit down to a loin of mutton, and waited for Mr. Adams, when he and the doctor came in. The doctor having felt his pulſe, and examined his wounds, declared him much better, which he imputed to that ſanative
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023370_0087_0FBF3BF95E19E308"/>
ſoporiferous draught, a medicine, 'whoſe virtues,' he ſaid, 'were never to be ſufficiently extolled.' And great indeed they muſt be, if Joſeph was ſo much indebted to them as the doctor imagined; ſince nothing more than thoſe effluvia, which eſcaped the cork, could have contributed to his recovery: for the medicine had ſtood untouched in the window ever ſince his arrival.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph paſſed that day and the three following with his friend Adams, in which nothing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable happened as the ſwift progreſs of his recovery. As he had an excellent habit of body, his wounds were now almoſt healed; and his bruiſes gave him ſo little uneaſineſs, that he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mr. Adams to let him depart, told him he ſhould never be able to return ſufficient thanks for all his favours; but begged that he might no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger delay his journey to London.</p>
                        <p>Adams, notwithſtanding the ignorance, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>They were now walking in the inn-yard, when a fat, fair, ſhort perſon rode in, and alighting from his horſe, went directly up to Barnabas, who was
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023370_0088_0FBF3BFACC6DABD0"/>
ſmoaking his pipe on a bench. The parſon and the ſtranger ſhook one another very lovingly by the hand, and went into a room together.</p>
                        <p>The evening now coming on, Joſeph retired to his chamber, whither the good Adams accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him; and took this opportunity to expatiate on the great mercies God had lately ſhewn him, of which he ought not only to have the deepeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe; but likewiſe to expreſs outward thankfulneſs for them. They therefore fell both on their knees, and ſpent a conſiderable time in prayer and thankſgiving.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023370_0089_0FBF3BFC48943290"/>
heartily deſirous of returning with the young man who was juſt recovered of his misfortune. He then ſnapt his fingers (as was uſual with him) and took two or three turns about the room in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy.—And to induce the bookſeller to be as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious as poſſible, as likewiſe to offer him a better price for his commodity, he aſſured him their meeting was extremely lucky to himſelf: for that he had the moſt preſſing occaſion for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at that time, his own being almoſt ſpent, and having a friend then in the ſame inn who was juſt recovered from ſome wounds he had received from robbers, and was in a moſt indigent condition; 'So that nothing,' ſays he, <q>could be ſo opportune, for the ſupplying both our neceſſities, as my mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an immediate bargain with you.</q>

                        <p>Adams did not at all reliſh the laſt expreſſion; he ſaid, he was ſorry to hear ſermons compared to plays.

He would reduce us to the example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ages, forſooth! and would inſinuate to the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:023370_0091_0FBF3C0307DF55C8"/>
people that a clergyman ought to be always preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying. He pretends to underſtand the ſcripture literally, and would make mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the poverty and low eſtate which was recommended to the church in it's infancy, and was only temporary doctrine adapted to her under perſecution, was to be preſerved in her flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eſtabliſhed ſtate. Sir, the principles of Toland, Woolſton, and all the free-thinkers, are not calculated to do half the miſchief, as thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by this fellow and his followers.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir, anſwered Adams, <q>if Mr. Whitefield had carried his doctrine no farther than you mention, I ſhould have remained, as I once was, his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſher. I am myſelf as great an enemy to the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and ſplendor of the clergy as he can be. I do not, more than he, by the flouriſhing eſtate of the church, underſtand the palaces, equipages, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rich dainties, and vaſt fortunes of her mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Surely thoſe things, which favour ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this world, become not the ſervants of one who profeſſes his kingdom was not of it: but when he began to call nonſenſe and enthuſiaſm to his aid, and ſet up the deteſtable doctrine of faith againſt good works, I was his friend no longer; for ſurely, that doctrine was coined in hell, and one would think none but the devil himſelf could have the impudence to preach it. For can any thing be more derogatory to the honour of God, than for men to imagine that the all-wiſe Being will hereafter ſay to the good and virtuous, "notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the purity of thy life, notwithſtanding that conſtant rule of virtue and goodneſs in which you walked upon earth, ſtill as thou didſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing in the true orthodox manner, thy want of faith ſhall condemn thee?" Or on

the other ſide, can any doctrine have a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious influence on ſociety, than a perſuaſion, that it will be a good plea for the villain at the laſt day; "Lord, it is true, I never obeyed one of thy commands, yet puniſh me not, for I believe them all?"</q> 'I ſuppoſe, Sir,' ſaid the bookſeller, <q>your ſermons are of a different kind.</q> 'Ay, Sir,' ſaid Adams, <q>the contrary, I thank heaven, is incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in almoſt every page, or I ſhould bely my own opinion, which hath always been, that a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good Turk, or heathen, are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of their Creator, than a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked Chriſtian, tho' his faith was as perfectly orthodox as St. Paul's himſelf.</q>—<q>I wiſh you ſucceſs,</q> ſays the bookſeller, <q>but muſt beg to be excuſed, as my hands are ſo very full at preſent; and indeed I am afraid, you will find a backwardneſs in the trade, to engage in a book which the clergy would be certain to cry down.</q> 'God forbid,' ſays Adams, <q>any books ſhould he propagated which the clergy would cry down: but if you mean by the clergy, ſome few deſigning fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men, who have it at heart to eſtabliſh ſome favourite ſchemes at the price of the liberty of mankind, and the very eſſence of religion, it is not in their power to decry any book they pleaſe; witneſs that excellent book called, "A plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature and end of the Sacrament;" a book written (if I may venture on the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) with the pen of an angel, and calculated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the true uſe of Chriſtianity, and of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred inſtitution; for what could tend more to the noble purpoſes of religion, than frequent chearful meetings among the members of a ſociety, in which they ſhould, in the preſence of one another, and in the ſervice of the Supreme Being, make promiſes

Mrs. Tow-wouſe, Mr. Tow-wouſe, and Betty, all lifting up their voices together: but Mrs. Tow-wouſe's voice, like a baſs viol in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, was clearly and diſtinctly diſtinguiſhed among the reſt, and was heard to articulate the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſounds,—<q>O you damn'd villain, is this the return to all the care I have taken of your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? This the reward of my virtue? Is this the manner in which you behave to one who brought you a fortune, and preferred you to ſo many matches, all your betters? To abuſe my bed, my own bed, with my own ſervant: but I'll maul the ſlut, I'll tear her naſty eyes out: was ever ſuch a pitiful dog, to take up with ſuch a mean trollop?

It was a monoſyllable beginning with a b—, and indeed was the ſame, as if ſhe had pronounced the words, She-Dog. Which term we ſhall, to avoid offence, uſe on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though, indeed, both the miſtreſs and maid uttered the abovementioned b—, a word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſguſtful to females of the lower ſort. Betty had borne all hitherto with patience, and had uttered only lamentations: but the laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation ſtung her to the quick. <q>I am a woman as well as yourſelf,</q> ſhe roared out, <q>and no ſhe-dog, and if I have been a little naughty, I am not the firſt; if I have been no better than I ſhould be,</q> cries ſhe ſobbing, <q>that's no reaſon you ſhould call me out of my name; my be-betters are wo-rſe than me.</q> 'Huzzy, huzzy,' ſays Mrs. Tow-wouſe, <q>have you the impudence to anſwer me? Did I not catch you, you fancy—</q> and then again repeated the terrible word ſo odious to female ears. 'I can't bear that name,' anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Betty, <q>if I have been wicked, I am to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it myſelf in the other world; but I have done nothing that's unnatural; and I will go out of your houſe this moment: for I will never be called She-Dog by any miſtreſs in England.</q> Mrs. Tow-wouſe then armed herſelf with the ſpit, but was prevented from executing any dreadful purpoſe by Mr. Adams, who confined her arms with the ſtrength of a wriſt which Hercules would not have been aſhamed of. Mr. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe being caught, as our lawyers expreſs it, with the manner, and having no defence to make, very prudently withdrew himſelf, and Betty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted herſelf to the protection of the hoſtler, who,

<pb n="97" facs="unknown:023370_0096_0FBF3C156DFCFEB8"/>
weapon which is to be found in the whole armoury of love, againſt them.</p>
                        <p>Betty, who was but one and twenty, had now lived three years in this dangerous ſituation, during which ſhe had eſcaped pretty well. An enſign of foot was the firſt perſon who made an impreſſion on her heart; he did indeed raiſe a flame in her, which required the care of a ſurgeon to cool.</p>
                        <p>While ſhe burnt for him, ſeveral others burnt for her. Officers of the army, young gentlemen travelling the weſtern circuit, inoffenſive ſquires, and ſome of graver character were ſet afire by her charms!</p>
                        <p>At length, having perfectly recovered the effects of her firſt unhappy paſſion, ſhe ſeemed to have vowed a ſtate of perpetual ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>ity. She was long deaf to all the ſufferings of her lovers, till one day, at a neighbouring fair, the rhetoric of John the hoſtler, with a new ſtraw hat, and a pint of wine, made a ſecond conqueſt over her.</p>
                        <p>She did not, however, feel any of thoſe flames on this occaſion, which had been the conſequence of her former amour; nor indeed thoſe other ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which prudent young women very juſtly apprehend from too abſolute an indulgence to the preſſing endearments of their lovers. This latter, perhaps, was a little owing to her not being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely conſtant to John, with whom ſhe permitted Tom Whipwell the ſtage-coachman, and now and then a handſome young traveller, to ſhare her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tow-wouſe had for ſome time caſt the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing eyes of affection on this young maiden. He had laid hold on every opportunity of ſaying tender things, to her, ſqueezing her by the hand, and ſometimes kiſſing her lips: for as the violence of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:023370_0097_0FBF3C18F9B10718"/>
his paſſion had conſiderably abated to Mrs. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouſe; ſo like water, which is ſtopt from its uſual current in one place, it naturally ſought a vent in another. Mrs. Tow-wouſe is thought to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this abatement, and probably it added very little to the natural ſweetneſs of her temper; for though ſhe was as true to her huſband as the dial to the ſun, ſhe was rather more deſirous of being ſhone on, as being more capable of feeling his warmth.</p>
                        <p>Ever ſince Joſeph's arrival, Betty had conceived an extraordinary liking to him, which diſcovered it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more and more, as he grew better and better; till that fatal evening when, as ſhe was warming his bed, her paſſion grew to ſuch a height, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly maſtered both her modeſty and her reaſon, that after many fruitleſs hints and fly inſinuations, ſhe at laſt threw down the warming-pan, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him with great eagerneſs, ſwore he was the handſomeſt creature ſhe had ever ſeen.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph in great confuſion leapt from her, and told her, he was ſorry to ſee a young woman caſt off all regard to modeſty: but ſhe had gone too far to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and grew ſo very indecent, that Joſeph was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, contrary to his inclinations, to uſe ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to her, and taking her in his arms, he ſhut her out of the room, and locked the door.</p>
                        <p>How ought man to rejoice, that his chaſtity is always in his own power, that if he hath ſufficient ſtrength of mind, he hath always a competent ſtrength of body to defend himſelf, and cannot like a poor weak woman, be raviſhed againſt his will.</p>
                        <p>Betty was in the moſt violent agitation at this diſappointment. Rage and luſt pulled her heart, as with two ſtrings, two different ways; one moment ſhe thought of ſtabbing Joſeph, the next, of taking
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:023370_0098_0FBF3C19AA7CDC90"/>
him in her arms, and devouring him with kiſſes; but the latter paſſion was far more prevalent. Then ſhe thought of revenging his refuſal on herſelf: but whilſt ſhe was engaged in this meditation, happily death preſented himſelf to her in ſo many ſhapes of drowning, hanging, poiſoning, &amp;c. that her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted mind could reſolve on none. In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of ſpirit, it accidentally occurred to her memory, that her maſter's bed was not made; ſhe therefore went directly to his room; where he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at that time to be engaged at his bureau. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, ſhe attempted to retire, but he called her back, and taking her by the hand, ſqueezed her ſo tenderly, at the ſame time whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many ſoft things into her ears, and then preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſo cloſely with his kiſſes, that the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fair one, whoſe paſſions were already raiſed, and which were not ſo whimſically capricious that one man only could lay them, though, perhaps, ſhe would have rather preferred that one: the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed fair-one quietly ſubmitted, I ſay, to her maſter's will, who had juſt attained the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his bliſs, when Mrs. Tow-wouſe unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly entered the room, and cauſed all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion which we have before ſeen, and which it is not neceſſary at preſent to take any farther notice of: ſince without the aſſiſtance of a ſingle hint from us, every reader of any ſpeculation, or experience, tho' not married himſelf, may eaſily conjecture, that it concluded with the diſcharge of Betty, the ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mr. Tow-wouſe, with ſome things to be performed on his ſide by way of gratitude for his wife's goodneſs of being reconciled to him, with many hearty promiſes never to offend any more in the like manner: and laſtly, his quietly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly bearing to be reminded of his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                        <p>Secondly, what are the contents prefixed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chapter, but ſo many inſcriptions over the gates of inns (to continue the ſame metaphor) informing the reader what entertainment he is to expect, which, if he likes not, he may travel on to the next: for, in biography, as we are not tied down to an exact concatenation equally with other hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; ſo a chapter or two (for inſtance this I am now writing) may be often paſſed over without any injury to the whole. And in theſe inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have been as faithful as poſſible, not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the celebrated Montaigne, who ſometimes promiſes a great deal and produces nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>There are, beſides theſe more obvious benefits, ſeveral others which our readers enjoy from this art of dividing; though perhaps moſt of them too myſterious to be preſently underſtood by any who are not initiated into the ſcience of authoring. To mention therefore but one which is moſt obvious, it prevents ſpelling the beauty of a book by turning
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:023370_0101_0FBF3729E9948030"/>
down its leaves, a method otherwiſe neceſſary to thoſe readers, who, (tho' they read with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and advantage) are apt, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their ſtudy, after half an hour's abſence, to forget where they left off.</p>
                        <p>Theſe diviſions have the ſanction of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Homer not only divided his great work into twenty-four books, (in compliment perhaps to the twenty-four letters, to which he had very particular obligations) but, according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome very ſagacious criticks, hawked them all ſeparately, delivering only one book at a time, (probably by ſubſcription.) He was the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of the art which hath ſo long lain dormant, of publiſhing by numbers, an art now brought to ſuch perfection, that even dictionaries are divided and exhibited piece-meal to the public; nay, one bookſeller hath (to encourage learning and eaſe the public) contrived to give them a dictionary in this divided manner, for only fifteen ſhillings more than it would have coſt entire.</p>
                        <p>Virgil hath given us his poem in twelve books, an argument of his modeſty; for by that doubtleſs he would inſinuate that he pretends to no more than half the merit of the Greek: for the ſame reaſon, our Milton went originally no farther than ten; 'till being puffed up by the praiſe of his friends, he put himſelf on the ſame footing with the Roman poet.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not however enter ſo deep into this matter as ſome very learned critics have done, who have with infinite labour and acute diſcernment diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what books are proper for embelliſhment, and what require ſimplicity only, particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſimilies, which I think are now generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to become any book but the firſt.</p>
                        <p>

I will diſmiſs this chapter with the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: that it becomes an author generally to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a book, as it does a butcher to joint his meat, for ſuch aſſiſtance is of great help to both the reader and the carver. And now having indulged my ſelf a little, I will endeavour to indulge the curioſity of my reader, who is no doubt impatient to know what he will find in the ſubſequent chapters of this book.</p>

                           <p>A ſurpriſing inſtance of Mr. Adams's ſhort memory, with the unfortunate conſequences which it brought on Joſeph.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>MR. Adams and Joſeph were now ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part different ways, when an accident deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the former to return with his friend, which Tow-wouſe, Barnabas, and the bookſeller, had not been able to do. This accident was, that thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which the parſon was travelling to London to publiſh, were, O my good reader! left behind; what he had miſtaken for them in the ſaddle-bags being no other than three ſhirts, a pair of ſhoes, and ſome other neceſſaries, which Mrs. Adams, who thought her huſband would want ſhirts more than ſermons on his journey, had carefully provided him.</p>
                        <p>This diſcovery was now luckily owing to the preſence of Joſeph at the opening the ſaddle-bags; who having hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d his friend ſay, he carried with him nine volumes of ſermons, and not being of that ſect of philoſophers, who can reduce all the matter of the world into a nut-ſhell, ſeeing there was no room for them in the bags, where the parſon had ſaid they were depoſited, had the curioſity to cry out, <q>Bleſs me, Sir, where are your ſermons?</q> The parſon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd.
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023370_0103_0FBF372E4B45A2A8"/>
                           <q>There, there, child, there they are, under my ſhirts.</q> Now it happened that he had taken forth his laſt ſhirt, and the vehicle remained viſibly empty. 'Sure, Sir,' ſays Joſeph, <q>there is nothing in the bags.</q> Upon which Adams ſtarting, and te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ifying ſome ſurprize, cried, <q>Hey! fie, fie upon it; they are not here ſure enough. Ay, they are certainly left behind.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Joſeph was greatly concerned at the uneaſineſs which he apprehended his friend muſt feel from this diſappointment: he begged him to purſue his journey, and promiſed he would himſelf return with the books to him, with the utmoſt expedition. 'No, thank you, child,' anſwered Adams, <q>it ſhall not be ſo. What would it avail me, to tarry in the great city, unleſs I had my diſcourſes with me, which are, <hi>ut ita dicum,</hi> the ſole cauſe, the <hi>aitia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

No, child, as this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident hath happened, I am reſolved to return back to my cure, together with you; which indeed my inclination ſufficiently leads me to. This diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment may perhaps be intended for my good. He concluded with a verſe out of Theocritus, which ſignifies no more than, that ſometimes it rains, and ſometimes the ſun ſhines.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Joſeph bowed with obedience and thankfulneſs for the inclination which the parſon expreſſed of returning with him; and now the bill was called for, which, on examination, amounted within a ſhilling to the ſum Mr. Adams had in his pocket. Perhaps the reader may wonder how he was able to produce a ſufficient ſum for ſo many days: that he may not be ſurprized therefore, it cannot be unneceſſary to acquaint him, that he had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a guinea of a ſervant belonging to the coach and ſix, who had been formerly one of his pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023370_0104_0FBF372F28742BB0"/>
and whoſe maſter, the owner of the coach, then lived within three miles of him: for ſo good was the credit of Mr. Adams, that even Mr. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lady Booby's ſteward would have lent him a guinea with very little ſecurity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adams diſcharged the bill, and they were both ſetting out, having agreed to ride and tie; a method of travelling much uſed by perſons who have but one horſe between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The two travellers ſet out together, one on horſeback, and the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>: Now, as it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally happens that he on horſeback outgoes him on foot, the cuſtom is, that when he arrives at the diſtance agreed on, he is to diſmount, tie the horſe to ſome gate, tree, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or other thing, and then proceed on foot; when the other comes up to the horſe, he unties him, mounts and gallops on, 'till having paſſed by his fellow-traveller, he li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ewiſe arrives at the place of tying. And this is that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of travelling ſo much in uſe among our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent anceſtors, who knew that horſes had mouths as well as legs, and that they could not uſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without being at the expence of ſuffering the beaſts themſelves to uſe the former. This was the method in uſe in thoſe days, when, inſtead of a coach and ſix, a member of parliament's lady uſed to mount a pillion behind her huſband; and a grave ſerjeant at law condeſcended to amble to Weſtminſter on an eaſy pad, with his clerk kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his heels behind him.</p>
                        <p>Adams was now gone ſome minutes, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on Joſeph's beginning the journey on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and Joſeph had his foot in the ſtirrup, when the hoſtler preſented him a bill for the horſe's board during his reſidence at the inn. Joſeph ſaid Mr. Adams had paid all; but this matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:023370_0105_0FBF3730A72266F0"/>
referred to Mr. Tow-wouſe, was by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in favour of the hoſtler, and indeed with truth and juſtice: for this was a freſh inſtance of that ſhortneſs of memory which did not ariſe from want of parts, but that continual hurry in which parſon Adams was always involved.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph was now reduced to a dilemma which extremely puzzled him. The ſum due for horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat was twelve ſhillings, (for Adams, who had borrowed the beaſt of his clerk, had ordered him to be fed as well as they could feed him) and the caſh in his pocket amounted to ſixpence, (for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams had divided the laſt ſhilling with him.) Now tho' there have been ſome ingenious perſons who have contrived to pay twelve ſhillings with ſixpence, Joſeph was not one of them. He had never contracted a debt in his life, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the leſs ready at an expedient to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf. Tow-wouſe was willing to give him credit 'till next time, to which Mrs. Tow-wouſe would probably have conſented (for ſuch was Joſeph's beauty, that it had made ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion even on that piece of flint which that good woman wore in her boſom by way of heart.) Joſeph would have found therefore, very likely, the paſſage free, had he not, when he honeſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the nakedneſs of his pockets, pull'd out that little piece of gold which we have mentioned before. This cauſed Mrs. Tow-wouſe's eyes to water; ſhe told Joſeph, ſhe did not conceive a man could want money whilſt he had gold in his pocket. Joſeph anſwered, he had ſuch a value for that little piece of gold, that he would not part with it for a hundred times the riches which the greateſt eſquire in the country was worth. <q>A pretty way indeed,</q> ſaid Mrs. Tow-wouſe, <q>to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:023370_0106_0FBF3732CDEBE760"/>
run in debt, and then refuſe to part with your money, becauſe you have a value for it. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew any piece of gold of more value than as many ſhillings as it would change for.</q> 
                           <q>Not to preſerve my life from ſtarving, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it from a robber, would I part with this dear piece,</q> anſwered Joſeph. 'What,' (ſays Mrs. Tow-wouſe) <q>I ſuppoſe it was given you by ſome vile trollop, ſome miſs or other; if it had been the preſent of a virtuous woman, you would not have had ſuch a value for it. My huſband is a fool if he parts with the horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being paid for him.</q> 
                           <q>No, no, I can't part with the horſe indeed till I have the money,</q> cried Tow-wouſe. A reſolution highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by a lawyer then in the yard, who declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Tow-wouſe might juſtify the detainer.</p>
                        <p>As we cannot therefore at preſent get Mr. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph out of the inn, we ſhall leave him in it, and carry our reader on after parſon Adams, who, his mind being perfectly at eaſe, fell into a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on a paſſage in AEſchylus, which entertained him for three miles together, without ſuffering him once to reflect on his fellow-traveller.</p>
                        <p>At length, having ſpun out his thread, and being now at the ſummit of a hill, he caſt his eyes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and wondered that he could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

As he left him ready to mount the horſe, he could not apprehend any miſchief had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, neither could he ſuſpect that he miſſed his way, it being ſo broad and plain: the only reaſon which preſented itſelf to him, was, that he had met with an acquaintance who had prevailed with him to delay ſome time in diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>He therefore reſolved to proceed ſlowly forwards, not doubting but that he ſhould be ſhortly overtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

and ſoon came to a large water, which filling the whole road, he ſaw no method of paſſing unleſs by wading through, which he accordingly did up to his middle; but was no ſooner got on the other ſide, than he perceived, if he had looked over the hedge, he would have found a foot-path capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him without wetting his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>His ſurprize at Joſeph's not coming up grew now very troubleſome: he began to fear he knew not what; and as he determined to move no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if he did not ſhortly overtake him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back, he wiſhed to find a houſe of publick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment where he might dry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>One of theſe immediately aſked the other, if he had ſeen a more comical adventure a great while? Upon which the other ſaid, <q>he doubted whether by law, the landlord could juſtify detaining the horſe for his corn and hay.</q> But the former anſwered, <q>undoubtedly he can; it is an adjudged caſe, and I have known it tried.</q>

He ſaid,—<q>he no more regarded a field of wheat when he was hunting, than he did the highway; that he had injured ſeveral poor farmers by trampling their corn under his horſe's heels; and if any of them begged him with the utmoſt ſubmiſſion to refrain, his horſe whip was always ready to do them juſtice.</q> He ſaid, <q>that he was the greateſt tyrant to the neighbours in every other inſtance, and would not ſuffer a farmer to keep a gun, tho' he might juſtify it by law; and in his own family ſo cruel a maſter, that he never kept a ſervant a twelvemonth. In his capacity as a juſtice,</q> continued he, <q>he behaves ſo partially, that he commits or acquits juſt as he is in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, without any regard to truth or evidence: the devil may carry any one before him for me; I would rather be tried before ſome judges than be a proſecutor before him: if I had an eſtate in the neighbourhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would ſell it for half the value, rather than live near him.</q>
                        </p>

It is true,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:023370_0110_0FBF373BD14543C0"/>
ſays he, perhaps, that he may have ſometimes purſued his game over a field of corn, but he hath always made the party ample ſatisfaction; that ſo far from tyrannizing over his neighbours, or taking away their guns, he himſelf knew ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral farmers not qualified, who not only kept guns, but killed game with them. That he was the beſt of maſters to his ſervants, and ſeveral of them had grown old in his ſervice. That he was the beſt juſtice of peace in the kingdom, and to his certain knowledge, had decided many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult points, which were referred to him, with the greateſt equity, and the higheſt wiſdom. And he verily believed, ſeveral perſons would give a year's purchaſe more for an eſtate near him, than under the wings of any other great man.</q> He had juſt finiſhed his encomium, when his companion returned, and acquainted him the ſtorm was over. Upon which, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently mounted their horſes and departed.</p>
                        <p>Adams, who was in the utmoſt anxiety at thoſe different characters of the ſame perſon, aſked his hoſt if he know the gentleman: for he began to imagine they had by miſtake been ſpeaking of two ſeveral gentlemen. 'No, no, maſter!' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the hoſt, a ſhrewd cunning fellow, <q>I know the gentlemen very well of whom they have been ſpeaking, as I do the gentleman who ſpoke of him. As for riding over other mens corn, to my knowledge he hath not been on horſeback theſe two years. I never heard he did any injury of that kind; and as to making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, he is not ſo free of his money as that comes to neither. Nor did I ever hear of his taking away any man's gun; nay, I know ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who have guns in their houſes: but as for
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023370_0111_0FBF374068B3EFE8"/>
killing game with them, no man is ſtricter; and I believe he would ruin any who did. You heard one of the gentlemen ſay, he was the worſt maſter in the world, and the other that he is the beſt: but for my own part, I know all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and never heard from any of them that he was either one or the other.—</q> 'Aye! aye!' ſays Adams. <q>and how doth he behave as a juſtice, pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </q> 'Faith, Friend,' anſwered the hoſt, <q>I queſtion whether he is in the commiſſion: the only cauſe I have heard he hath decided a great while, was one between thoſe very two perſons who juſt went out of this houſe; and I am ſure he determined that juſtly, for I heard the whole matter.</q> 'Which did he decide it in favour of,' quoth Adams? <q>I think I need not anſwer that queſtion,</q> cried the hoſt, <q>after the different characters you have heard of him. It is not my buſineſs to contradict gentlemen, while they are drinking in my houſe; but I knew neither of them ſpoke a ſyllable of truth.</q> 'God forbid!' (ſaid Adams) <q>that men ſhould arrive at ſuch a pitch of wickedneſs to belye the character of their neighbour from a little private affection, or, what is infinitely worſe, a private ſpite. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe we have miſtaken them, and they mean two other perſons: for there are many houſes on the road.</q> 'Why prithee, friend,' cries the hoſt, <q>doſt thou pretend never to have told a lye in thy life?</q> 
                           <q>Never a malicious one, I am certain,</q> anſwered Adams; <q>nor with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to injure the reputation of any man living.</q> 'Pugh! malicious; no, no,' replied the hoſt; <q>not malicious with a deſign to hang a man, or bring him into trouble; but ſurely out of love to one's ſelf, one muſt ſpeak better of a friend than
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:023370_0112_0FBF3744188D3B88"/>
an enemy.</q> 
                           <q>Out of love to yourſelf! you ſhould confine yourſelf to truth,</q> ſays Adams, <q>for by doing otherwiſe, you injure the nobleſt part of yourſelf, your immortal ſoul. I can hardly believe any man ſuch an ideot to riſque the loſs of that by any trifling gain, and the greateſt gain in this world is but dirt in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what ſhall be revealed hereafter.</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the hoſt, taking up the cup, with a ſmile, drank a health to Hereafter: adding, he was for ſomething preſent. 'Why,' ſays Adams very gravely, 'Do not you believe another world?' To which the hoſt anſwered, <q>yes, he was no atheiſt.</q> 
                           <q>And you believe you have an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul,</q> cries Adams. He anſwered, <q>God forbid he ſhould not.</q> 'And heaven and hell?' ſaid the parſon.' The hoſt then bid him <q>not to profane; for thoſe were things not to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned nor thought of but in church.</q> Adams aſked him, <q>why he went to church, if what he learned there had no influence on his conduct in life?</q> 'I go to church,' anſwered the hoſt, 'to ſay my prayers and behave godly.' <q>And doſt not thou,</q> cried Adams, <q>believe what thou heareſt at church?</q> 'Moſt part of it, maſter,' returned the hoſt. <q>And doth not thou then trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</q> cries Adams, <q>at the thought of eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment?</q> 'As for that, maſter,' ſaid he, <q>I never once thought about it: but what ſignifies talking about matters ſo far off? The mug is out, ſhall I draw another?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whilſt he was going for that purpoſe, a ſtage-coach drove up to the door. The coach-man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the houſe, was aſked by the miſtreſs, what paſſengers he had in his coach?

Aye, ſaid the coachman, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman in my coach that is his acquaintance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him and his horſe; he would have been here before this time, had not the ſtorm driven him to ſhelter. God bleſs her, ſaid Adams, in a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor could he delay walking out to ſatisfy himſelf who this charitable woman was; but what was his ſurprize, when he ſaw his old acquaintance Madam Slipſlop? Her's indeed was not ſo great, becauſe ſhe had been informed by Joſeph, that he was on the road. Very civil were the ſalutations on both ſides; and Mrs. Slipſlop rebuked the hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs for denying the gentleman to be there when ſhe aſked for him. But indeed the poor woman had not erred deſignedly: for Mrs. Slipſlop aſked for a clergyman; and ſhe had unhappily miſtaken Adams for a perſon travelling to a neighbouring fair with the thimble and button, or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Joſeph was now come up, and Mrs. Slipſlop would have had him quit his horſe to the parſon and come himſelf into the coach: but he abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, ſaving, he thanked heaven he was well enough recovered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>They had not proceeded far before Mrs. Slipſlop addreſſing herſelf to the parſon, ſpoke thus: <q>There hath been a ſtrange alteration in our family, Mr. Adams, ſince Sir Thomas's death.</q> 
                           <q>A ſtrange alteration indeed!</q> ſays Adams, <q>as I gather from ſome hints which have dropped from Joſeph.</q> 'Aye,' ſays ſhe, <q>I could never have believed it, but the longer one lives in the world, the more one ſees. So Joſeph hath given you hints.</q>—<q>But of what nature will always remain a perfect ſecret with me,</q> cries the parſon; <q>he forced me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe before he would communicate any thing. I am indeed concerned to find her ladyſhip behave in ſo unbecoming a manner. I always thought her in the main a good lady, and ſhould never have ſuſpected her of thoughts ſo unworthy a Chriſtian, and with a young lad her own ſervant.</q> 'Theſe things are no ſecrets to me, I aſſure you,' cries Slipſlop; <q>and I believe they will be none any where ſhortly: for ever ſince the boy's departure, ſhe hath behaved more like a mad-woman than any thing elſe.</q> 
                           <q>Truly, I am heartily concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q> ſays Adams, <q>for ſhe was a good ſort of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; indeed I have often wiſhed ſhe had attended a little more conſtantly at the ſervice, but ſhe hath done a great deal of good in the pariſh.</q> 'O Mr. Adams!' ſays Slipſlop, <q>people that don't ſee all, often know nothing. Many things have been giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away in our family, I do aſſure you, without her knowledge. I have heard you ſay in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit we ought not to brag: but indeed I can't avoid ſaying, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he is there, and enjoys a quiet life, which ſome folks would not allow him here.</q> Adams anſwered, 'he had never heard this before, and was miſtaken, if ſhe herſelf,' (for he remembered ſhe uſed to commend her miſtreſs and blame her maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) 'had not formerly been of another opinion.' 'I don't know,' replied ſhe, <q>what I might once think: but now I am confidious matters are as I tell you: the world will ſhortly ſee who hath been deceived: for my part I ſay nothing, but that it is wonderſome how people can carry all things with a grave face.</q>

                        </argument>
                        <p>LEONORA was the daughter of a gentleman of fortune; ſhe was tall and well-ſhaped, with a ſprightlineſs in her countenance, which often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts beyond more regular features joined with an inſipid air; nor is this kind of beauty leſs apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive than allure the good humour which it indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, being often miſtaken for good-nature, and the vivacity for true underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>Leonora, who was now at the age of eighteen, lived with an aunt of her's in a town in the north of England. She was an extreme lover of gaiety; and very rarely miſſed a ball, or any other publick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; where ſhe had frequently opportunities of ſatisfying a greedy appetite of vanity with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which was given her by the men to almoſt every other woman preſent.</p>
                        <p>Among many young fellows who were particular in their gallantries towards her, Horatio ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf in her eyes beyond all his compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors; ſhe danced with more than ordinary gaiety when he happened to be her partner; neither the fairneſs of the evening nor the muſick of the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale, could lengthen her walk like his company. She affected no longer to underſtand the civilities of others: whilſt ſhe inclined ſo attentive an air to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very compliment of Horatio, that ſhe often ſmiled even when it was too delicate for her comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>'Pray, Madam,' ſays Adams, 'who was this ſquire Horatio?'</p>
                        <p>Horatio, ſays the lady, was a young gentleman of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

a good family bred to the law, and had been ſome few years called to the degree of a barriſter. His face and perſon were ſuch as the generality allowed handſome: but he had a dignity in his air very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſeen. His temper was of the ſaturnine complexion, and without the leaſt taint of moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He had wit and humour, with an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſatire, which he indulged rather too much.</p>
                        <p>This gentleman, who had contracted the moſt violent paſſion for Leonora, was the laſt perſon who perceived the probability of its ſucceſs. The whole town had made the match for him, before he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had drawn a confidence from her actions ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to mention his paſſion to her; for it was his opinion, and perhaps he was there in the right) that it is highly impoli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>But whatever diffidence the fears of a lover may create, which are apt to magnify every favour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on a rival, and to ſee the little advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards themſelves through the other end of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective; it was impoſſible that Horatio's paſſion ſhould ſo blind his diſcernment, as to prevent his conceiving hopes from the behaviour of Leonora, whoſe fondneſs for him was now as viſible to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different perſon in their company, as his for her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I never knew any of theſe forward ſluts come to good,</q> (ſays the lady, who refuſed Joſeph's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the coach) <q>nor ſhall I wonder at any thing ſhe doth in the ſequel.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The lady proceeded in her ſtory thus: it was in the midſt of a gay converſation in the walks one evening, when Horatio whiſpered Leonora, that he was deſirous to take a turn or two with her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023370_0118_0FBF3757BA02FF78"/>
for that he had ſomething to communicate to her of great conſequence. <q>Are you ſure it is of conſequence? ſaid ſhe ſmiling—</q> I hope, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, <q>you will think ſo too, ſince the whole fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs of my life muſt depend on the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Leonora, who very much ſuſpected what was coming, would have deferred it till another time: but Horatio, who had more than half conquered the difficulty of ſpeaking, by the firſt motion, was ſo very importunate, that ſhe at laſt yielded, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of the company, they turned aſide into an unfrequented walk.</p>
                        <p>They had retired far out of the ſight of the company, both maintaining a ſtrict ſilence. At laſt Horatio made a full ſtop, and taking Leonora, who ſtood pale and trembling, gently by the hand, he fetched a deep ſigh, and then looking on her eyes with all the tenderneſs imaginable, he cried out in a faltering accent; <q>O Leonora! it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to declare to you on what the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs of my life muſt be founded! Muſt I ſay, there is ſomething belonging to you which is a bar to my happineſs, and which unleſs you will part with, I muſt be miſerable?</q> 
                           <q>What can that be,</q> replied Leonora?—'No wonder,' ſaid he, <q>you are ſurprized that I ſhould make an objection to any thing which is yours, yet ſure you may gueſs, ſince it is the only one which the riches of the world, if they were mine, ſhould purchaſe of me—Oh it is that which you muſt part with, to beſtow all the reſt! Can Leonora, or rather will ſhe, doubt longer?—Let me then whiſper it in her ears,—It is your name, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. It is by parting with that, by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to be for ever mine, which muſt at

once prevent me from being the moſt miſerable, and will render me the happieſt of mankind.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Leonora, covered with bluſhes, and with as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry a look as ſhe could poſſibly put on, told him, <q>that had ſhe ſuſpected what his declaration would have been, he ſhould not have decoyed her from her company; that he had ſo ſurprized and frighted her, that ſhe begged him to convey her back as quick as poſſible;</q> which he, trembling very near as much as herſelf, did.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>More fool he, cried Slipſlop, it is a ſign he knew very little of our ſect.</q> 'Truly, madam,' ſaid Adams, <q>I think you are in the right, I ſhould have inſiſted to know a piece of her mind, when I had carried matters ſo far.</q> But Mrs. Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>airs deſired the lady to omit all ſuch fulſome ſtuff in her ſtory; for that it made her ſick.</p>
                        <p>Well then, Madam, to be as conciſe as poſſible, ſaid the lady, many weeks had not paſs'd after this interview, before Horatio and Leonora were what they call on a good footing together.

I will, if you pleaſe, repeat you a letter from each of them which I have got by heart, and which will give you no ſmall idea of their paſſion on both ſides.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Grave-airs objected to hearing theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but being put to the vote, it was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her by all the reſt in the coach; parſon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams contending for it with the utmoſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.</p>

Since the beloved, whoſe happineſs it ultimately reſpects, may give us charming op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of being brave in her defence, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to her wants, compaſſionate to her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, grateful to her kindneſs; and, in the ſame manner, of exerciſing every other virtue, which he who would not do to any degree, and that with the utmoſt rapture, can never deſerve the name of a lover: It is therefore with the view to the delicate modeſty of your mind that I cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate

                              <p>Can I tell you with what eagerneſs I expect the arrival of that bleſt day, when I ſhall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the falſhood of a common aſſertion, that the greateſt human happineſs conſiſts in hope? A doctrine which no perſon had ever ſtronger reaſon to believe than myſelf at preſent, ſince none ever taſted ſuch bliſs as fires my boſom with the thoughts of ſpending my future days with ſuch a companion, and that every action of my life will have the glorious ſatisfaction of conducing to your happineſs.</p>

                              <p>THE refinement of your mind has been ſo evidently proved by every word and action ever ſince I had firſt the pleaſure of knowing you, that I thought it impoſſible my good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Horatio could have been heightened to any additional proof of merit. This very thought was my amuſement when I received your laſt letter, which, when I opened, I confeſs I was ſurprized to find the delicate ſentiments expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, ſo far exceeded what I thought could come even from you, altho' I know all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous principles human nature is capable of, are centered in your breaſt, that words cannot paint what I feel on the reflection, that my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:023370_0122_0FBF3765D2B16E50"/>
ſhall be the ultimate end of all your actions.</p>
                              <p>Oh Horatio! what a life muſt that be, where the meaneſt domeſtic cares are ſweetened by the pleaſing conſideration, that the man on earth who beſt deſerves, and to whom you are moſt inclined to give your affections, is to reap either profit or pleaſure from all you do! In ſuch a caſe toils muſt be turned into diverſions, and nothing but the unavoidable inconveniencies of life can make us remember that we are mortal.</p>
                              <p>If the ſolitary turn of your thoughts, and the deſire of keeping them undiſcovered, makes even the converſation of men of wit an learning te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to you, what anxious hours muſt I ſpend who am condemned by cuſtom to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of women, whoſe natural curioſity leads them to pry into all my thoughts, and whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy can never ſuffer Horatio's heart to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any one without forcing them into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious deſigns againſt the perſon who is ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to poſſeſs it: but indeed, if ever envy can poſſibly have any excuſe, or even alleviation, it is in this caſe, where the good is ſo great, and it muſt be equally natural to all to wiſh it for themſelves, nor am I aſhamed to own it: and to your merit, Horatio, I am obliged, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents my being in that moſt uneaſy of all the ſituations I can figure in my imagination, of being led by inclination to love the perſon whom my own judgment forces me to condemn.</p>

                        <p>Matters were in ſo great forwardneſs between this fond couple, that the day was fixed for their marriage, and was now within a fortnight, when the ſeſſions chanced to be held for that county in a town about twenty miles diſtance from that which
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:023370_0123_0FBF37674FD62F18"/>
is the ſcene of our ſtory. It ſeems it is uſual for the young gentlemen of the bar to repair to theſe ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, not ſo much for the ſake of profit, as to ſhew their parts, and learn the law of the juſtices of peace: for which purpoſe one of the wiſeſt and graveſt of all the juſtices is appointed ſpeaker or chairman, as they modeſtly call it, and he reads them a lecture, and inſtructs them in the true knowledge of the law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>You are here guilty of a little miſtake, ſays A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, which, if you pleaſe, I will correct; I have attended at one of theſe quarter-ſeſſions, where I obſerved the counſel taught the juſtices, inſtead of learning any thing of them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not very material, ſaid the lady. Hither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired Horatio, who as he hoped by his profeſſion to advance his fortune, which was not at preſent very large, for the ſake of his dear Leonora, he reſolved to ſpare no pains, nor loſe any opportunity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving or advancing himſelf in it.</p>
                        <p>The ſame afternoon in which he left the town, as Leonora ſtood at her window, a coach and ſix paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by: which ſhe declared to be the compleateſt, genteeleſt, prettieſt equipage ſhe ever ſaw; adding theſe remarkable words, <q>O I am in love with that equipage!</q> which, tho' her friend Florella at that time did not greatly regard, ſhe hath ſince remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.</p>
                        <p>In the evening an aſſembly was held, which Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora honoured with her company: but intended to pay her dear Horatio the compliment of refuſing to dance in his abſence.</p>
                        <p>O why have not women as good reſolution to maintain their vows, as they have often good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in making them!</p>
                        <p>The gentleman who owned the coach and ſix
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023370_0124_0FBF376D6D304C60"/>
came to the aſſembly. His clothes were as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fine as his equipage could be. He ſoon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the eyes of the company; all the ſmarts, all the ſilk waiſtcoats with ſilver and gold edgings, were eclipſed in an inſtant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Madam, ſaid Adams, if it be not impertinent, I ſhould be glad to know how this gentleman was dreſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir, anſwered the lady, I have been told he had on a cut-velvet coat of a cinnamon colour, lined with a pink ſatten, embroidered all over with gold: his waiſtcoat, which was cloth of ſilver, was em-broidered with gold likewiſe. I cannot be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as to the reſt of his dreſs: but it was all in the French faſhion; for Bellarmine (that was his name) was juſt arrived from Paris.</p>
                        <p>This fine figure did not more engage the eyes of every lady in the aſſembly, than Leonora did his. He had ſcarce beheld her, but he ſtood motionleſs and fixed as a ſtatue, or at leaſt would have done ſo, if good breeding had permitted him. However, he carried it ſo far, before he had power to correct himſelf, that every perſon in the room eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered where his admiration was ſettled. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ladies began to ſingle out their former partners, all perceiving who would be Bellarmine's choice; which they however endeavoured, by all poſſible means, to prevent: Many of them ſaying to Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora, <q>O, Madam, I ſuppoſe we ſhan't have the pleaſure of ſeeing you dance to-night;</q> and then crying out, in Bellarmine's hearing, <q>O Leonora will not dance, I aſſure you; her partner is not here.</q> One maliciouſly attempted to prevent her, by ſending a diſagreeable fellow to aſk her, that ſo ſhe might be obliged either to dance with him, or ſit down: but this ſcheme proved abortive.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="126" facs="unknown:023370_0125_0FBF376F7B323878"/>
Leonora ſaw herſelf admired by the fine ſtranger, and envied by every woman preſent. Her little heart began to flutter within her, and her head was agitated with a convulſive motion; ſhe ſeemed as if ſhe would ſpeak to ſeveral of her acquaintance, but had nothing to ſay: for as ſhe would not mention her preſent triumph; ſo ſhe could not diſengage her thoughts one moment from the contemplation of it: ſhe had never taſted any thing like this happineſs. She had before known what it was to torment a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle woman; but to be hated and ſecretly curſed by a whole aſſembly, was a joy reſerved for this bleſſed moment. As this vaſt profuſion of ecſtacy had confounded her unſterſtanding; ſo there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo fooliſh as her behaviour; ſhe played a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand childiſh tricks, diſtorted her perſon into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhapes, and her face into ſeveral laughs, without any reaſon. In a word, her carriage was as abſurd as her deſires, which were, to affect an inſenſibility of the ſtranger's admiration, and at that ſame time a triumph, from that admiration, over every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the room.</p>
                        <p>In this temper of mind, Bellarmine, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired who ſhe was, advanced to her, and with a low bow begged the honour of dancing with her, which ſhe with a low curt'ſy immediately granted. She danced with him all night, and enjoyed perhaps the higheſt pleaſure that ſhe was capable of feeling.</p>
                        <p>At theſe words Adams fetched a deep groan, which frighted the ladies, who told him, <q>they hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was not ill.</q> He anſwered <q>he groaned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the folly of Leonora.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Leonora retired (continued the lady) about ſix in the morning, but not to reſt. She tumbled and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in her bed, with very ſhort intervals of ſleep, and thoſe entirely filled with dreams of the equipage,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023370_0126_0FBF3771EDCF6AC0"/>
and fine clothes ſhe had ſeen, and the balls, operas, and ridottos, which had been the ſubject of their converſation.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, Bellarmine, in the dear coach and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ix, came to wait on her. He was indeed charmed with her perſon, and was, on enquiry, ſo well pleaſed with the circumſtances of her father (for he himſelf, notwithſtanding all his finery, was not quite ſo rich as Croeſus or an Attalus) 'Attalus,' ſays Mr. Adams: <q>but pray how came you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe names?</q> The lady ſmiled at the queſtion and proceeded—He was ſo pleaſed I ſay, that he reſolved to make his addreſſes to her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. He did ſo accordingly, and that with ſo much warmth and briſkneſs, that he quickly baffled her weak repulſes, and obliged the lady to refer him to her father, who, ſhe knew, would quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in favour of a coach and ſix.</p>
                        <p>Thus, what Horatio had by ſighs and tears, love and tenderneſs, been ſo long obtaining, the French-Engliſh Bellarmine with gaiety and gallantry poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of in an inſtant. In other words, what modeſty had employed a full year in raiſing, impudence demoliſhed in twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>Here Adams groaned a ſecond time; but the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who began to ſmoak him, took no notice.</p>
                        <p>From the opening of the aſſembly till the end of Bellarmine's viſit, Leonora had ſcarce once thought of Horatio; but he now began, though an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gueſt, to enter into her mind. She wiſhed ſhe had ſeen the charming Bellarmine and his charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equipage, before matters had gone ſo far. <q>Yet why (ſays ſhe) ſhould I wiſh to have ſeen him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; or what ſignifies it that I have ſeen him now? Is not Horatio my lover? almoſt my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? Is he not as handſome, nay handſomer,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:023370_0127_0FBF3775204978F0"/>
than Bellarmine? Aye, but Bellarmine is the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeler and the finer man; yes, that he muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Yes, yes, he is that certainly. But did not I no longer than yeſterday love Horatio more than all the world? Aye, but yeſterday I had not ſeen Bellarmine. But doth not Horatio doat on me, and may he not in deſpair break his heart if I abandon him? Well, and hath not Bellarmine a heart to break too? Yes, but I promiſed Horatio firſt; but that was poor Bellarmine's misfortune; if I had ſeen him firſt, I ſhould certainly have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him. Did not the dear creature prefer me to every woman in the aſſembly, when every She was laying out for him? When was it in Horatio's power to give me ſuch an inſtance of affection? Can he give me an equipage, or any of thoſe things which Bellarmine will make me miſtreſs of? How vaſt is the difference between being the wife of a poor counſellor, and the wife of one of Bellarmine's fortune! If I marry Horatio, I ſhall triumph over no more than one rival: but by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Bellarmine, I ſhall be the envy of all my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. What happineſs!—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> can I ſuffer Horatio to die? for he hath ſworn he cannot ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive my loſs: but perhaps he may not die; if he ſhould, can I prevent it? Muſt I ſacrifice myſelf to him? beſides, Bellarmine may be as miſerable for me too.</q> She was thus arguing with herſelf, when ſome young ladies called her to the walks, and a little relieved her anxiety for the preſent.</p>
                        <p>The next morning Bellarmine breakfaſted with her in preſence of her aunt, whom her ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his paſſion for Leonora: he was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er withdrawn, than the old lady began to adviſe her niece on this occaſion—<q>You ſee, child, (ſays ſhe) what fortune hath thrown in your way; and I

Will any woman heſitate a moment, whether ſhe ſhall ride in a coach, or walk on foot all the days of her life?—But Bellarmine drives ſix, and Horatio not even a pair.</q> 'Yes,' <q>but, Madam, what will the world ſay?</q> anſwered Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora; 'will not they condemn me?' <q>The world is always on the ſide of prudence,</q> cries the aunt, <q>and would ſurely condemn you, if you ſacrificed your intereſt to any motive whatever. O, I know the world very well: and you ſhew your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, my dear, by your objection. O' my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience! the world is wiſer. I have lived longer in it than you; and I aſſure you there is not any thing worth our regard beſides money: nor did I ever know any one perſon who married from other conſiderations, who did not afterwards heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it. Beſides, if we examine the two men, can you prefer a ſneaking fellow, who hath been bred at the univerſity, to a fine gentleman juſt come from his travels?—All the world muſt allow Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine to be a fine gentleman, poſitively a fine gentleman and a handſome man.</q>—<q>Perhaps, Madam, I ſhould not doubt it if I knew not how to be handſomely off with the other.</q> 
                           <q>O leave that to me,</q> ſays the aunt. You know your father <q>hath not been acquainted with the affair. Indeed, for my part, I thought it might do well enough, not dreaming of ſuch an offer: but I'll diſengage you; leave me to give the fellow an anſwer. I warrant you ſhall have no farther trouble.</q>

Leonora was at length ſatisfied with her aunt's reaſoning; and, Bellarmine ſupping with her that evening, it was agreed he ſhould the next morning go to her father and propoſe the match, which ſhe conſented ſhould be conſummated at his return.</p>
                        <p>The aunt retired ſoon after ſupper, and the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers being left together, Bellarmine began in the following manner: <q>Yes, Madam, this coat I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you was made at Paris, and I defy the beſt Engliſh taylor even to imitate it. There is not one of them can cut, Madam, they can't cut. If you obſerve how this ſkirt is turned, and this ſleeve, a clumſy Engliſh raſcal can do nothing like it.—Pray how do you like my liveries?</q> Leonora anſwered, 'ſhe thought them very pretty.' <q>All French,</q> ſays he, <q>I aſſure you, except the great coats; I never truſt any thing more than a great coat to an Engliſhman; you know one muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our own people what one can, eſpecially as, before I had a place, I was in the country intereſt, he, he, he! but for myſelf, I would ſee the dirty iſland at the bottom of the ſea, rather than wear a ſingle rag of Engliſh work about me; and I am ſure after you have made one tour to Paris, you will be of the ſame opinion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to your own clothes. You can't conceive what an addition a French dreſs would be to your beauty. I poſitively aſſure you, at the firſt opera I ſaw ſince I came over, I miſtook the Engliſh ladies for chambermaids, he, he, he!</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With ſuch ſort of polite diſcourſe did the gay Bellarmine entertain his beloved Leonora, when the door opened on a ſudden, and Horatio entered the room. Here 'tis impoſſible to expreſs the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of Leonora.</p>
                        <p>'Poor woman,' ſays Mrs. Slipſlop, <q>what a

                           <q>She muſt have then more than Corinthian aſſurance,</q> ſaid Adams; <q>aye more than Lais herſelf.</q>

                           <q>I can have no buſineſs,</q> ſaid ſhe, <q>with the gentleman, nor any other, which need be any ſecret to you.</q>

She convinced him that he was never more awake in his life, and that nothing more extraordinary had happened in his three days abſence, than a ſmall alteration in the affections of Leonora; who now burſt into tears, and wondered what reaſon ſhe had given him to uſe her in ſo barbarous a manner. Horatio deſired Bellarmine to withdraw with him: but the ladies prevented it, by laying violent hands on the latter; upon which, the former took his leave without any great ceremony, and departed, leaving the lady with his rival to conſult for his ſafety, which Leonora feared her indiſcretion might have endangered: but the aunt comforted her with aſſurances, that Horatio would not venture his perſon againſt ſo accompliſhed a cavalier as Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine; and that, being a lawyer, he would ſeek revenge in his own way, and the moſt they had to apprehend from him was an action.</p>
                        <p>They at length therefore agreed to permit Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine to retire to his lodgings, having firſt ſettled all matters relating to the journey which he was to undertake in the morning, and their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the nuptials at his return.</p>
                        <p>But alas! as wiſe men have obſerved, the ſeat of valour is not the countenance; and many a grave and plain man, will, on a juſt provocation, betake himſelf to that miſchievous metal, cold iron; while men of a fiercer brow, and ſometimes with that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of courage, a cockade, will more prudently decline it.</p>
                        <p>Leonora was waked in the morning, from a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary

coach and ſix, with the diſmal account, that Bellarmine was run through the body by Horatio; that he lay languiſhing at an inn, and the ſurgeons had declared the wound mortal. She immediately leap'd out of the bed, danced about the room in a frantic manner, tore her hair, and beat her breaſt in all the agonies of deſpair; in which ſad condition her aunt, who likewiſe aroſe at the news, found her. The good old lady applied her utmoſt art to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her niece. She told her, while there was life <q>there was hope; but that if he ſhould die, her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction would be of no ſervice to Bellarmine, and would only expoſe herſelf, which might probably keep her ſome time without any future offer; that as matters had happened, her wiſeſt way would be to think no more of Bellarmine, but to endeavour to regain the affections of Horatio.</q> 
                           <q>Speak not to me,</q> cry'd the diſconſolate Leonora; <q>is it not owing to me, that poor Bellarmine has loſt his life? have not theſe curſed charms</q> (at which words ſhe looked ſtedfaſtly in the glaſs) <q>been the ruin of the moſt charming man of this age? Can I ever bear to contemplate my own face again?</q> (with her eyes ſtill fixed on the glaſs.) <q>Am I not the murdreſs of the fineſt gentleman? no other woman in the town could have made any impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on him.</q> 'Never think of things paſt,' cries the aunt, <q>think of regaining the affections of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio.</q> 'What reaſon,' ſaid the niece, <q>have I to hope he would forgive me? No, I have loſt him as well as the other, and it was your wicked advice which was the occaſion of all; your ſeduced me contrary to my inclinations, to abandon poor Horatio,</q> at which words ſhe burſt into tears; <q>you prevailed upon me, whether I would or no, to give up my affections for him; had it not been for

you, Bellarmine never would have entered into my thoughts; had not his addreſſes been backed by your perſuaſions, they never would have made any impreſſion on me; I ſhould have defied all fortune and equipage in the world; but it was you, it was you, who got the better of my youth and ſimplicity, and forced me to loſe my dear Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio for ever.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The aunt was almoſt borne down with this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of words; ſhe however rallied all the ſtrength ſhe could, and drawing her month up into a purſe, began: <q>I am not ſurprized, Niece, at this ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Thoſe who adviſe young women for their intereſt, muſt always expect ſuch a return: I am convinced my brother will thank me for breaking off your match with Horatio at any rate.</q> 
                           <q>That may not be in your power yet,</q> anſwered Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; <q>though it is very ungrateful in you to deſire or attempt it, after the preſents you have received from him.</q> (For indeed true it is, that many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and ſome pretty valuable ones, had paſſed from Horatio to the old lady: but as true it is, that Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, when he breakfaſted with her and her niece, had complimented her with a brilliant from his finger, of much greater value than all ſhe had touched of the other.)</p>
                        <p>The aunt's gall was on float to reply, when a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant brought a letter into the room; which Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, hearing it came from Bellarmine, with great ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs opened, and read as follows:</p>

                        <p>AS ſoon as the paſſengers had alighted from the coach, Mr. Adams, as was his cuſtom, made directly to the kitchen, where he found Joſeph ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the fire, and the hoſteſs anointing his leg: for the horſe which Mr. Adams had borrowed of his clerk, had ſo violent a propenſity to kneeling, that one would have thought it had been his trade as well as his maſter's; nor would he always give any notice of ſuch his intention; he was often found on his knees when the rider leaſt expected it. This
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023370_0137_0FBF379202BC8020"/>
foible however was of no great inconvenience to the parſon, who was accuſtomed to it, and as his legs almoſt touched the ground when he beſtrode the beaſt, had but a little way to fall, and threw himſelf forward on ſuch occaſions with ſo much dexterity, that he never received any miſchief? the horſe and he frequently rolling many paces diſtance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards both getting up and meeting as good friends as ever.</p>
                        <p>Poor Joſeph, who had not been uſed to ſuch kind of cattle, though an excellent horſeman, did not ſo happily diſengage himſelf; but falling with his leg under the beaſt, received a violent contuſion, to which the good woman was, as we have ſaid, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a warm hand, with ſome camphorated ſpirits, juſt at the time when the parſon entered the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen.</p>
                        <p>He had ſcarce expreſſed his concern for Joſeph's misfortune, before the hoſt likewiſe entered. He was by no means of Mr. Tow-wouſe's gentle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and was indeed perfectly maſter of his houſe, and every thing in it but his gueſts.</p>
                        <p>This ſurly fellow, who always proportioned his reſpect to the appearance of a traveller, from God bleſs your honour, down to plain coming preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, obſerving his wife on her knees to a footman, cried out without conſidering his circumſtances, <q>What a pox is the woman about? why don't you mind the company in the coach? Go and aſk them what they will have for dinner?</q> 'My dear,' ſays ſhe, you know they can have nothing <q>but what is at the fire, which will be ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; and really the poor young man's leg is very much bruiſed.</q> At which words, ſhe fell to chafing more violently than before: the bell then happening to ring, he damn'd his wife, and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:023370_0138_0FBF3792CA113D70"/>
bid her go into the company, and not ſtand rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing there all day: for he did not believe the young fellow's leg was ſo bad as he pretended; and if it was, within twenty miles, he would find a ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cut it off. Upon theſe words, Adams fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ſtrides acroſs the room; and ſnapping his fingers over his head, muttered aloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He would excommunicate ſuch a wretch for a farthing; for he believed the devil had more humanity. Theſe words occaſioned a dialogue between Adams and the hoſt, in which there were two or three ſharp replies, till Joſeph bade the latter know how to behave himſelf to his betters. At which the hoſt (having firſt ſtrictly ſurveyed Adams) ſcornfully repeating the word betters, flew into a rage, and telling Joſeph he was as able to walk out of his houſe as he had been to walk into it, offered to lay violent hands on him; which Adams perceiving, dealt him ſo ſound a compliment over his face with his fiſt, that the blood immediately guſhed out of his noſe in a ſtream. The hoſt being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be out-done in courteſy, eſpecially by a perſon of Adam's figure, returned the favour with ſo much gratitude, that the parſon's noſtrils began to look redder than uſual. Upon which he again aſſailed his antagoniſt, and with another ſtroke laid him ſprawling on the floor.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="unknown:023370_0139_0FBF379814B7C5A0"/>
with ſo good an aim, that much the greater part firſt ſaluted his countenance, and trickled thence in ſo large a current down to his beard, and over his garments, that a more horrible ſpectacle was hardly to be ſeen, or even imagined. All which was perceived by Mrs. Slipſlop, who entered the kitchen at that inſtant. This good gentlewoman, not being of a temper ſo extremely cool and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as perhaps was required to aſk many queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this occaſion, flew with great impetuoſity at the hoſteſs's cap, which, together with ſome of her hair, ſhe plucked from her head in a moment, giving her at the ſame time ſeveral hearty cuffs in the face, which, by frequent practice on the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſervants, ſhe had learned an excellent knack of delivering with a good grace. Poor Joſeph could hardly riſe from his chair; the parſon was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in wiping the blood from his eyes, which had entirely blinded him, and the landlord was but juſt beginning to ſtir, whilſt Mrs. Slipſlop, holding down the landlady's face with her left hand, made ſo dexterous an uſe of her right, that the poor woman began to roar in a key which alarmed all the company in the inn.</p>
                        <p>There happened to be in the inn at this time, beſides the ladies who arrived in the ſtage-coach, the two gentlemen who were preſent at Mr. Tow-wouſe's when Joſeph was detained for his horſe's meat, and whom we have before mentioned to have ſtopped at the ale-houſe with Adams. There was likewiſe a gentleman juſt returned from his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels to Italy; all whom the horrid outcry of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſently brought into the kitchen, where the ſeveral combatants were found in the poſtures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It was now no difficulty to put an end to the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023370_0140_0FBF379B330A19E0"/>
fray, the conquerors being ſatisfied with the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance they had taken, and the conquered having no appetite to renew the fight. The principal figure, and which engaged the eyes of all, was Adams, who was all over covered with blood, which the whole company concluded to be his own; and conſequently imagined him no longer for this world. But the hoſt, who had now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his blow, and was riſen from the ground, ſoon delivered them from this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by damning his wife for waſting the hog's puddings, and telling her all would have been very well, if ſhe had not intermeddled like a b—as ſhe was; adding, he was very glad the gentlewoman had paid her, though not half what ſhe deſerved. The poor woman had indeed fared much the worſt, having, beſides the unmerciful cuffs received, loſt a quantity of hair, which Mrs. Slipſlop in triumph held in her left hand.</p>
                        <p>The traveller, addreſſing himſelf to Mrs. Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>airs, deſired her not to be frightened; for here had been only a little boxing, which he ſaid to their <hi>diſgracia</hi> the Engliſh were <hi>accuſtomata</hi> to: adding, it muſt be however a ſight ſomewhat ſtrange to him, who was juſt come from Italy, the Italians not being addicted to the <hi>cuffardo,</hi> but <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

'Recover! maſter,' ſaid the hoſt ſmiling: <q>Yes, yes, I am not afraid of dying with a blow or two neither; I am not ſuch a chicken as that.</q> Pugh! ſaid the gentleman, I mean you will recover damages in that action which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly you intend to bring as ſoon as a writ can be returned from London; for you look like a man of too much ſpirit and courage to ſuffer any one to beat you without bringing your action againſt him: he muſt be a ſcandalous fellow indeed, who would put up a drubbing whilſt the law is open to revenge it; beſides he hath drawn blood from you and ſpoiled your coat; and the jury will give da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages for that too.

Adams anſwered, if it was true that they were but one perſon, he had aſſaulted the wife; for he was ſorry to own he had ſtruck the huſband the firſt blow. 'I am ſorry you own it too,' cries the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; <q>for it could not poſſibly appear to the court: for here was no evidence preſent but the lame man in the chair, whom I ſuppoſe to be your friend, and would conſequently ſay nothing but what made for you.</q> 'How, Sir,' ſays Adams, <q>do you take me for a villain, who would proſecute revenge in cold blood, and uſe unjuſtifiable means to obtain it?

The coachman began now to grow importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with his paſſengers, whoſe entrance into the coach was retarded by Miſs Grave-airs, inſiſting againſt the remonſtrance of all the reſt, that ſhe would not admit a footman into the coach: for poor Joſeph was too lame to mount a horſe. A young lady, who was, as it ſeems, an earl's grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter, begged it with almoſt tears in her eyes. Mr. Adams prayed, and Mrs. Slipſlop ſcolded, but all to no purpoſe. She ſaid <q>ſhe would not demean herſelf to ride with a footman: that there were waggons on the road: that if the maſter of the coach deſired it, ſhe would pay for two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but would ſuffer no ſuch fellow to come in.</q> 'Madam,' ſays Slipſlop, <q>I am ſure no one can refuſe another coming into the ſtage-coach.</q> 'I don't know, Madam,' ſays the lady, <q>I am not much uſed to ſtage-coaches, I ſeldom travel in them.</q> 'That may be, Madam,' replied Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlop, <q>very good people do, and ſome people's betters, for aught I know.</q> Miſs Grave-airs ſaid, <q>ſome folks might ſometimes give their tongues a liberty, to ſome people that were their betters, which did not become them; for her part, ſhe was not uſed to converſe with ſervants.</q> Slipſlop returned, <q>Some people kept no ſervants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with; for her part, ſhe thanked heaven ſhe lived in a family where there were great many; and had more under her own command, than any paltry little gentlewoman in the kingdom.</q> Miſs Grave-airs cried, <q>ſhe believed her miſtreſs would not encourage ſuch ſaucineſs to her betters.</q> 'My betters,' ſays Slipſlop, <q>who is my betters, pray?</q> 'I am your betters,' anſwered Miſs Grave-airs, 'and I'll acquaint your miſtreſs.'—At which Mrs. Slipſlop laughed aloud, and told
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:023370_0144_0FBF37A1DAF24120"/>
her, <q>her lady was one of the great gentry, and ſuch little paltry gentlewomen, as ſome folks who travelled in ſtage-coaches, would not eaſily come at her.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This ſmart dialogue between ſome people and ſome folks, was going on at the coach door, when a ſolemn perſon riding into the inn, and ſeeing Miſs Grave-airs, immediately accoſted her with, <q>Dear child, how do you do? She preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, O! papa, I am glad you have overtaken me.</q> 'So am I,' anſwered he: <q>for one of our coaches is juſt at hand: and there being room for you in it, you ſhall go no farther in the ſtage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you deſire it.</q> 
                           <q>How can you imagine I ſhould deſire it?</q> ſays ſhe; ſo bidding Slipſlop ride with her fellow, if ſhe pleaſed, ſhe took her father by the hand, who was juſt alighted, and walked with him into a room.</p>
                        <p>Adams inſtantly aſked the coachman in a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; if he knew who the gentleman was? The coachman anſwered, he was now a gentleman, and kept his horſe and man: but times are altered maſter, ſaid he; I remember when he was no better born than myſelf. Ay! ay! ſays Adams. My father drove the ſquire's coach, anſwered he, when that very man rode poſtilion: but he is now his ſteward, and a great gentleman. Adams then ſnapped his fingers, and cried, he thought ſhe was ſome ſuch trollop.</p>
                        <p>Adams made haſte to acquaint Mrs Slipſlop with this good news, as he imagined it; but it found a reception different from what he expected. The prudent gentlewoman who deſpiſed the anger of Miſs Grave-airs, whilſt ſhe conceived her the daughter of a gentleman of ſmall fortune, now ſhe heard her alliance with the upper ſervants of a great
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:023370_0145_0FBF37A58CF71B68"/>
family in her neighbourhood, began to fear her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the miſtreſs. She wiſhed ſhe had not carried the diſpute ſo far, and began to think of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to reconcile herſelf to the young lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe left the inn; when luckily the ſcene at London, which the reader can ſcarce have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, preſented itſelf to her mind, and comforted her with ſuch aſſurance, that ſhe no longer apprehended any enemy with her miſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>Every thing being now adjuſted, the company entered the coach which was juſt on its departure, when one lady recollected ſhe had left her fan, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond her gloves, a third a ſnuff-box, and a fourth a ſmelling bottle behind her; to find all which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſome delay, and much ſwearing, to the coachman.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the coach had left the inn, the women all together fell to the character of Miſs Grave-airs, whom one of them declared ſhe had ſuſpected to be ſome low creature from the beginning of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and another affirmed, ſhe had not even the looks of a gentlewoman; a third warranted ſhe was no better than ſhe ſhould be; and turning to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who had related the ſtory in the coach, ſaid, <q>Did you ever hear, Madam, any thing ſo prudiſh as her remarks? Well, deliver me from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs of ſuch a prude.</q> The fourth added, <q>O Madam! all theſe creatures are cenſorious: but for my part, I wonder where the wretch was bred; indeed I muſt own I have ſeldom converſed with theſe mean kind of people: ſo that it may appear ſtranger to me; but to refuſe the general deſire of a whole company had ſomething in it ſo aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that for my part, I own I ſhould hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, if my own ears had not been witneſſes to it.</q> 'Yes, and ſo handſome a young fellow,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:023370_0146_0FBF37A7DC323748"/>
cries Slipſlop: <q>the woman muſt have no compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in her, I believe ſhe is more of a Turk than a Chriſtian; I am certain, if ſhe had any Chriſtian woman's blood in her veins, the ſight of ſuch a young fellow muſt have warm'd it. Indeed there are ſome wretched miſerable old objects, that turn one's ſtomach; I ſhould not wonder if ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſuch a one; I am as nice as herſelf, and ſhould have cared no more than herſelf for the company of ſtinking old fellows: but, hold up thy head, Joſeph, thou art none of thoſe; and ſhe who hath no compulſion for thee is a Myhummetman, and I will maintain it</q>. This converſation made Joſeph uneaſy, as well as the ladies; who, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirits Mrs. Slipſlop was in, (for indeed ſhe was not a cup too low) began to fear the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; one of them therefore deſired the lady to conclude the ſtory—'Aye, Madam,' ſaid Slipſlop, <q>I beg your ladyſhip to give us that ſtory you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſated in the morning;</q> which requeſt that well-bred woman immediately complied with.</p>

                        <p>LEONORA having once broke through the bounds which cuſtom and modeſty impoſe on her ſex, ſoon gave an unbridled indulgence to her paſſion. Her viſits to Bellarmine were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as well as longer, than his ſurgeon's; in a word, ſhe became abſolutely his nurſe, made his water-gruel, adminiſtered him his medicines, and, notwithſtanding the prudent advice of her aunt to the contrary, almoſt entirely reſided in her wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lover's apartment.</p>
                        <p>The ladies of the town began to take her conduct
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:023370_0147_0FBF37AB06032770"/>
under conſideration; it was the chief topic of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at their tea-tables, and was very ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the moſt part; eſpecially by Lindamira, a lady whoſe diſcreet and ſtarch carriage, together with a conſtant attendance at church three times a day, had utterly defeated many malicious attacks on her own reputation: for ſuch was the envy that Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damira's virtue had attracted, that, notwithſtanding her own ſtrict behaviour and ſtrict enquiry into the lives of others ſhe had not been able to eſcape being the mark of ſome arrows herſelf, which however did her no injury; a bleſſing perhaps owned by her to the clergy, who were her chief male companions, and with two or three of whom ſhe had been bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly and unjuſtly calumniated.</p>
                        <p>Not ſo unjuſtly neither perhaps, ſays Slipſlop, for the clergy are men, as well as other folks.</p>
                        <p>The extreme delicacy of Lindamira's virtue was cruelly hurt by thoſe freedoms which Leonor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>But to return to my ſtory: as ſoon as Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine was recovered, which was ſomewhat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a month from his receiving the wound, he ſet out, according to agreement, for Leonora's father's, in order to propoſe the match, and ſettle all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with him touching ſettlements, and the like.</p>
                        <p>A little before his arrival, the old gentleman had received an intimation of the affair by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter; which I can repeat <hi>verbatim,</hi> and which, they ſay, was written neither by Leonora

along with him: nor had his children any other ſecurity of being his heirs, than that the law would conſtitute them ſuch without a will, and that he had not affection enough for any one living to take the trouble of writing one.</p>
                        <p>To this gentleman came Bellarmine on the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand I have mentioned.

He commended the ſaying of Solomon, He that ſpareſt the rod, ſpoileth the child: but added he might likewiſe aſſerted, that he that ſpareſt the purſe ſaveth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That fine gentleman, who, at another ſeaſon would have been well enough pleaſed to dwell a little on that ſubject, was now very eager to reſume the circumſtance of fortune. He ſaid, he had a very <q>high value for the young lady, and would receive her with leſs than he would any other whatever; but that even his love to her made ſome regard to worldly matters neceſſary;
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:023370_0150_0FBF37B25319FFD8"/>
for it would be a moſt diſtracting ſight for him to ſee her, when he had the honour to be her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, in leſs than a coach and ſix.</q> The old gentleman anſwered. <q>Four will do, four will do;</q> and then took a turn from horſes to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, and from extravagance to horſes, till he came round to the equipage again, whither he was no ſooner arrived, than Bellarmine brought him back to the point; but all to no purpoſe; he made his eſcape from that ſubject in a minute; till at laſt the lover declared, that <q>in the preſent ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his affairs it was impoſſible for him, though he loved Leonora more than <hi>tout le monde,</hi> to marry her without any fortune.</q> To which the father anſwered, <q>he was ſorry then his daughter muſt loſe ſo valuable a match; that if he had an inclination at preſent, it was not in his power to advance a ſhilling; that he had had great loſſes, and been at great expences on projects; which, though he had great expectation from them, had yet produced him nothing: that he did not know what might happen hereafter, as on the birth of a ſon, or ſuch accident; but he would make no promiſe, or enter into any article: for he would not break his vow for all the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world.</q>

                        <p>THE lady having finiſhed her ſtory, received the thanks of the company; and now Joſeph, putting his head out of the coach, cried out, <q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe me, if yonder be not our parſon Adams walking along without his horſe.</q> 
                           <q>On my word, and ſo he is,</q> ſays Slipſlop; <q>and as ſure as two pence he hath left him behind at the inn.</q> Indeed, true it is, the parſon had exhibited a freſh inſtance of his abſence of mind: for he was ſo pleaſed with having got Joſeph into the coach, that he never once thought of the beaſt in the ſtable; and finding his legs as nimble as he deſired, he ſallied out brandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a crabſtick, and had kept on before the coach, mending and ſlackening his pace occaſionally, ſo that he had never been much more or leſs than a quarter of a mile diſtant from it.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Slipſlop deſired the coachman to overtake him, which he attempted, but in vain: for the faſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This track how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did he keep, as indeed he had a wonderful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity at theſe kind of bare poſſibilities; and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it about three miles over the plain, he arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>He had not ſat long here, before a gun going off very near a little ſtartled him; he looked up and ſaw a gentleman within a hundred paces taking up a partridge, which he had juſt ſhot.</p>
                        <p>Adams ſtood up, and preſented a figure to the gentleman which would have moved laughter i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Adams advancing to the gentleman, told him he hoped he had good ſport; to which the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:023370_0154_0FBF37BB6D2E5860"/>
very little. 'I ſee, Sir,' ſays Adams, <q>you have ſmote one partridge:</q> to which the ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man made no reply, but proceeded to charge his piece.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the gun was charging, Adams remained in ſilence, which he at laſt broke, by obſerving, that it was a delightful evening. The gentleman, who had at firſt ſight conceived a very diſtaſteful opinion of the parſon, began, on perceiving a book in his hand, and ſmoaking likewiſe the information of the caſſock, to change his thoughts, and make a ſmall advance to converſation on his ſide, by ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, I ſuppoſe you are not one of theſe parts?</p>
                        <p>Adams immediately told him, no: that he was a traveller, and invited by the beauty of the evening and the place to repoſe a little, and amuſe himſelf with reading. 'I may as well repoſe myſelf too,' ſaid the ſportſman; <q>for I have been out this whole afternoon, and the devil a bird have I ſeen till I came hither.</q>

                           <q>It is very probable,</q> cries Adams, <q>for ſhooting is their profeſſion.</q> 'Ay, ſhooting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I don't like that affair of Carthagena; if I had been there, I believe I ſhould have done othergueſs things, d—n me; what's a man's life when his country demands it? a man who won't ſacrifice his life for his country, deſerves to be hang'd, d—n me.</q> Which words he ſpoke with ſo violent a geſture, ſo loud a voice, ſo ſtrong an accent, and ſo fierce a countenance, that he might have frighten'd a

captain of trained bands at the head of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but Mr. Adams was not greatly ſubject to fears: he told him intrepidly, that he very much approved his virtue, but diſliked his ſwearing, and begged him not to addict himſelf to ſo bad a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, without which he ſaid he might fight as bravely as Achilles did. Indeed he was charmed with this diſcourſe; he told the gentleman he would willingly have gone many miles to have met a man of his generous way of thinking; that if he pleaſed to ſit down, he ſhould be greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to commune with him: for tho' he was a clergyman, he would himſelf be ready, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called, to lay down his life for his country.</p>
                        <p>The gentleman ſat down, and Adams by him; and then the latter began, as in the following chapter, a diſcourſe which we have placed by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it is not only the moſt curious in this, but perhaps in any other book.</p>

                           <q>I DO aſſure you, Sir, ſays he, taking the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by the hand, I am heartily glad to meet with a man of your kidney: for tho' I am a poor parſon, I will be bold to ſay, I am an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, and would not do an ill thing to be made a biſhop: nay, tho' it hath not fallen in my way to offer ſo noble a ſacrifice, I have not been without opportunities of ſuffering for the ſake of my conſcience, I thank heaven for them; for I have had relations, tho' I ſay it, who made ſome figure in the world; particularly a nephew,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023370_0156_0FBF37C062260CD8"/>
who was a ſhop-keeper, and an alderman of a corporation. He was a good lad, and was under my care when a boy, and I believe would do what I bade him to his dying day. Indeed, it looks like extreme vanity in me, to affect being a man of ſuch conſequence, as to have ſo great an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in an alderman; but others have thought ſo too, as manifeſtly appeared by the rector, whoſe curate I formerly was, ſending for me on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of an election, and telling me, If I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to continue in his cure, that I muſt bring my nephew to vote for one colonel Courtley, a gentleman whom I had never heard tidings of till that inſtant. I told the rector, I had no power over my nephew's vote, (God forgive me for ſuch prevarication!) that I ſuppoſed he would give it according to his conſcience; that I would by no means endeavour to influence him to give it otherwiſe. He told me, it was in vain to equivocate, that he knew I had already ſpoke to him in favour of eſquire Fickle my neighbour; and indeed it was true I had: for it was at a ſeaſon when the church was in danger, and when all good men expected they knew not what would happen to us all. I then anſwered bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If he thought I had given my promiſe, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted me, in propoſing any breach of it. Not to be too prolix: I perſevered, and ſo did my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, in the eſquire's intereſt, who was choſe chiefly through his means; and ſo I loſt my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. Well, Sir, but do you think the eſquire ever mentioned a word of the church? <hi>Ne verbum quidem, ut ita dicam:</hi> within two years he got a place, and hath ever ſince lived in London; where I have been informed, (but God forbid I ſhould believe that) that he never ſo much as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023370_0157_0FBF37C14B204440"/>
to church. I remained Sir, a conſiderable time without any cure, and lived a full month on one funeral ſermon, which I preached on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of a clergyman: but this by the bye. At laſt, when Mr. Fickle got his place, colonel Courtley ſtood again; and who ſhould make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for him, but Mr. Fickle himſelf? that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry identical Mr. Fickle, who had formerly told me, the colonel was an enemy both to the church and ſtate, had the confidence to ſollicit my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew for him; and the colonel himſelf offered me to make me chaplain to his regiment, which I refuſed in favour of Sir Oliver Hearty, who told us he would ſacrifice every thing to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and I believe he would, except his hunting, which he ſtuck ſo cloſe to, that in five years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he went but twice up to parliament; and one of thoſe times, I have been told, never was within ſight of the houſe. However, he was a worthy man, and the beſt friend I ever had: for by his intereſt with a biſhop, he got me replaced into my curacy, and gave me eight pounds out of his own pocket to buy me a gown and caſſock, and furniſh my houſe. He had our intereſt while he lived, which was not many years. On his death I had freſh applications made to me; for all the world knew the intereſt I had with my good nephew, who now was a leading man in the corporation; and Sir Thomas Booby buying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He was then a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman juſt come from his travels; and it did me good to hear him diſcourſe on affairs, which, for my part, I knew nothing of. If I had been maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a thouſand votes, he ſhould have had them all. I engaged my nephew in his intereſt; and
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:023370_0158_0FBF37CBEC560190"/>
he was elected, and a very fine parliament-man he was. They tell me he made ſpeeches of an hour long; and I have been told very fine ones: but he could never perſuade the parliament to be of his opinion.—<hi>Non omnia poſſumus omnes.</hi> He promiſed me a living, poor man; and I believe I ſhould have had it, but an accident happened; which was, that my lady had promiſed it before, unknown to him. This indeed I never heard till afterwards: for my nephew, who died about a month before the incumbent, always told me I might be aſſured of it. Since that time, Sir Thomas, poor man, had always ſo much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he never could find leiſure to ſee me. I believe it was partly my lady's fault too; who did not think my dreſs good enough for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at her table. However, I muſt do him the juſtice to ſay, he never was ungrateful; and I have always found his kitchen, and his cellar too, open to me; many a time after ſervice on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, for I preach at four churches, have I recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſpirits with a glaſs of his ale. Since my nephew's death, the corporation is in other hands; and I am not a man of that conſequence I was formerly. I have now no longer any talents to lay out in the ſervice of my country; and to whom nothing is given, of him can nothing be required. However, on all proper ſeaſons, ſuch as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of an election, I throw a ſuitable daſh or two into my ſermons; which I have the pleaſure to hear is not diſagreeable to Sir Thomas, and the other honeſt gentlemen my neighbours, who have all promiſed me theſe five years, to procure an ordination for a ſon of mine, who is now near thirty, hath an infinite ſtock of learning, and is, I thank heaven, of an unexceptionable life; tho',
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:023370_0159_0FBF37D09772B750"/>
as he was never at an univerſity, the biſhop refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ordain him. Too much care cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be taken in admitting any to the ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; tho' I hope he will never act ſo as to be a diſgrace to any order: but will ſerve his God and his country to the utmoſt of his power, as I have endeavoured to do before him; nay, will lay down his life whenever called to that purpoſe. I am ſure I have educated him in thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; ſo that I have acquitted my duty, and ſhall have nothing to anſwer for on that account: but I do not diſtruſt him; for he is a good boy; and, if Providence ſhould throw it in his way to be of as much conſequence in a public light, as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther once was; I can anſwer for him, he will uſe his talents as honeſtly as I have done.</q>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE gentleman highly commended Mr. Adams for his good reſolutions, and told him, <q>he hoped his ſon would tread in his ſteps;</q> adding, <q>that if he would not die for his country, he would not be worthy to live in it. I'd make no more of ſhooting a man that would not die for his country, than—</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Sir,' ſaid he, <q>I have diſinherited a nephew who is in the army; becauſe he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his commiſſion, and go to the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. I believe the raſcal is a coward, though he pretends to be in love forſooth. I would have all ſuch fellows hanged, Sir; I would have them
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:023370_0160_0FBF37D296118170"/>
hanged.</q> Adams anſwered, <q>that would be too ſevere: that men did not make themſelves; and if fear had too much aſcendance in the mind, the man was rather to be pitied than abhorred: that reaſon and time might teach him to ſubdue it.</q> He ſaid, <q>a man might be a coward at one time, and brave at another. Homer,</q> ſays he, <q>who ſo well underſtood and copied nature, hath taught us this leſſon, for Paris fights, and Hector runs away: nay, we have a mighty inſtance of this in the hiſtory of later ages, no longer ago than the 705th year of Rome, when the great Pompey, who had won ſo many battles, and been honoured with ſo many triumphs, and of whoſe valour ſeveral au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, eſpecially Cicero and Paterculus, have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch elogiums; this very Pompey left the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Pharſalia before he had loſt it, and retreated to his tent, where he ſat like the moſt puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous raſcal in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>it of deſpair, and yielded a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was to determine the empire of the world, to Caeſar. I am not much travelled in the hiſtory of modern times, that is to ſay, theſe laſt thouſand years: but thoſe who are can, I make no queſtion, furniſh you with parallel inſtances.</q> He concluded therefore, that had he taken any ſuch haſty reſolutions againſt his nephew, he hoped he would conſider better, and retract them. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman anſwered with great warmth, and talked much of courage and his country, till perceiving it grew late, he aſked Adams, <q>what place he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that night?</q> He told him, <q>he waited there for the ſtage-coach.</q> 'The ſtage-coach! Sir,' ſaid the gentleman, <q>they are all paſt by long ago. You may ſee the laſt yourſelf almoſt three miles before us.</q> 'I proteſt and ſo they are,' cries A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, 'then I muſt make haſte and follow them.'
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:023370_0161_0FBF37D4CA805AC0"/>
The gentleman told him, <q>he would hardly be able to overtake them; and that if he did not know his way, he would be in danger of loſing himſelf on the downs; for it would be preſently dark; and he might ramble about all night, and perhaps, find himſelf farther from his journey's end in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than he was now. He adviſed him therefore to accompany him to his houſe, which was very little out of his way, aſſuring him, that he would find ſome country fellow in his pariſh, who would conduct him for ſix pence to the city where he was going.</q> Adams accepted this propoſal, and on they travelled, the gentleman renewing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on courage, and the infamy of not being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at all times to ſacrifice our lives to our country. Night overtook them much about the ſame time as they arrived near ſome buſhes: whence, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, they heard the moſt violent ſhrieks imaginable in a female voice. Adams offered to ſnatch the gun out of his companion's hand. <q>What are you do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</q> ſaid he. 'Doing!' ſays Adams, <q>I am haſtening to the aſſiſtance of the poor creature whom ſome villains are murdering.</q> 
                           <q>You are not mad enough, I hope,</q> ſays the gentleman trembling: <q>Do you conſider this gun is only charged with ſhot, and that the robbers are moſt probably furniſhed with piſtols loaded with bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets? This is no buſineſs of ours; let us make as much haſte as poſſible out of the way, or we may fall into their hands ourſelves.</q> The ſhrieks now increaſing, Adams made no anſwer, but ſnapt his fingers, and brandiſhing his crabſtick, made direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the place whence the voice iſſued; and the man of courage made as much expedition towards his own home, whither he eſcaped in a very ſhort time without once looking behind him: where we will
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:023370_0162_0FBF37D592AA7910"/>
leave him to contemplate his own bravery, and to cenſure the want of it in others: and return to the good Adams, who on coming up to the place whence the noiſe proceeded, found a woman ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with a man, who had thrown her on the ground, and had almoſt overpowered her. The great abilities of Mr. Adams were not neceſſary to have formed a right judgment of this affair on the firſt ſight. He did not therefore want the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the poor wretch to aſſiſt her; but lifting up his crabſtick, he immediately levelled a blow at that part of the raviſher's head, where, according to the opinion of the ancients, the brains of ſome perſons are depoſited, and which he had undoubtedly let forth, had not nature, (who, as wiſe men have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, equips all creatures with what is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them) taken a provident care, (as ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doth with thoſe ſhe intends for encounters) to make this part of the head three times as thick as thoſe of ordinary men, who are deſigned to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe talents which are vulgarly called rational and for whom, as brains are neceſſary, ſhe is obliged to leave ſome room for them in the cavity of the ſkull: whereas, thoſe ingredients being entirely uſeleſs to perſons of the heroic calling, ſhe hath an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of thickening the bone, ſo as to make it leſs ſubject to any impreſſion, or liable to be cracked or broken; and indeed, in ſome who are predeſtined to the command of armies and empires, ſhe is ſuppoſed ſometimes to make that part perfectly ſolid.</p>
                        <p>As a game-cock, when engaged in amorous toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a hen, if perchance he eſpies another cock at hand, immediately quits his female, and oppoſes himſelf to his rival: ſo did the raviſher, on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the crabſtick, immediately leap from the woman, and haſtened to aſſail the man. He had

no weapons but what nature had furniſhed him with. However, he clenched his fiſt, and preſently darted it at that part of Adams's breaſt where the heart is lodged. Adams ſtaggered at the violence of the blow, when, throwing away his ſtaff, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe clenched that fiſt which we have before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated, and would have diſcharged it full in the breaſt of his antagoniſt, had he not dexterouſly caught it with his left hand, at the ſame time dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head, (which ſome modern heroes of the lower claſs uſe, like the battering-ram of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, for a weapon of offence; another reaſon to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the cunningneſs of nature, in compoſing it of thoſe impenetrable materials) daſhing his head, I ſay into the ſtomach of Adams, he tumbled him on his back, and not having any regard to the laws of heroiſm, which would have reſtrained him from any farther attack on his enemy 'till he was again on his legs, he threw himſelf upon him, and laying hold on the ground with his left hand, he with his right belaboured the body of Adams 'till he was weary, and indeed, 'till he concluded (to uſe the language of fighting) 'that he had done his buſineſs;' or in the language of poetry, <q>that he had ſent him to the ſhades below; in plain Engliſh, 'that he was dead.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Adams, who was no chicken, and could bear a drubbing as well as any boxing champion in the univerſe, lay ſtill only to watch his opportunity; and now perceiving his antagoniſt to pant with his labours, he exerted his utmoſt force at once, and with ſuch ſucceſs, that he overturned him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his ſuperior; when fixing one of his knees in his breaſt, he cried out in an exulting voice, <q>It is my turn now:</q> and after a few minutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant application, he gave him ſo dexterous a blow

juſt under his chin, that the fellow no longer retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any motion, and Adams began to fear he had ſtruck him once too often; for he often aſſerted, <q>he ſhould be concerned to have the blood of even the wicked upon him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Adams got up, and called aloud to the young woman—<q>Be of good cheer, damſel, ſaid he, you are no longer in danger of your raviſher, who, I am terribly afraid, lies dead at my feet; but God forgive me what I have done in defence of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</q> The poor wretch, who had been ſome time in recovering ſtrength enough to riſe, and had afterwards, during the engagement, ſtood trembling, being diſabled by fear, even from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, hearing her champion was victorious, came up to him, but not without apprehenſion, even of her deliverer; which, however, ſhe was ſoon relieved from, by his courteous behaviour and gentle words. They were both ſtanding by the body, which lay motionleſs on the ground, and which Adams wiſhed to ſee ſtir much more than the woman did, when he earneſtly begged her to tell him, <q>by what misfortune ſhe came, at ſuch a time of night, into ſo lonely a place?</q> She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him, <q>ſhe was travelling towards Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and had accidentally met with the perſon from whom he had delivered her, who told her he was likewiſe on his journey to the ſame place and would keep her company: an offer which, ſuſpecting no harm, ſhe had accepted; that he told her, they were at a ſmall diſtance from an inn where ſhe might take up her lodging that evening, and he would ſhew her a nearer way to it than by following the road. That if ſhe had ſuſpected him, (which ſhe did not, he ſpoke ſo kindly to her,) being alone on theſe downs in
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:023370_0165_0FBF37DC96544348"/>
the dark, ſhe had no human means to avoid him; that therefore ſhe put her whole truſt in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and walk'd on, expecting every moment to arrive at the inn; when, on a ſudden, being come to thoſe buſhes, he deſired her to ſtop, and after ſome rude kiſſes, which ſhe reſiſted, and ſome entreaties, which ſhe rejected, he laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on her, and was attempting to execute his wicked will, when, ſhe thanked G—, he timely came up and prevented him.</q> Adams encouraged her for ſaying ſhe had put her whole truſt in Providence, and told her, <q>he doubted not but Providence had ſent him to her deliverance, as a reward for that truſt. He wiſhed indeed, he had not deprived the wicked wretch of life, but G—'s will be done; he ſaid, he hoped the goodneſs of his intention would excuſe him in the next world, and he truſted in her evidence to acquit him in this.</q> He was then ſilent, and began to conſider with himſelf, whether it would be properer to make his eſcape or to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the hands of juſtice; which meditation ended, as the reader will ſee in the next chapter.</p>

He ſtood over his vanquiſhed enemy, wiſely weighing in his mind the objections which might be made to either of the two methods of proceeding mentioned in the laſt chapter, his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſometimes inclining to the one, and ſometimes to the other; for both ſeemed to him ſo equally adviſeable, and ſo equally dangerous, that probably he would have ended his days, at leaſt two or three of them, on that very ſpot, before he had taken any reſolution: At length he lifted up his eyes, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a light at a diſtance, to which he inſtantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf with <hi>Heus tu, Traveller, hues tu!</hi> He preſently heard ſeveral voices, and perceived the light approaching toward him. The perſons who attended the light began ſome to laugh, others to ſing, and others to halloo, at which the woman teſtified ſome fear, (for ſhe had concealed her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of the parſon himſelf,) but Adams ſaid, <q>Be of good cheer, damſel, and repoſe thy truſt in the ſame Providence which hath hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected thee, and never will forſake the innocent.</q> Theſe people who now approached were no other, reader, than a ſet of young fellows, who came to theſe buſhes in purſuit of a diverſion which they call Bird-batting. This, if thou art ignorant of it (as perhaps if thou haſt never travelled beyond Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington, Iſlington, Hackney, or the Borough, thou may'ſt be) I will inform thee, is performed by

holding a large clap-net before a lanthorn, and at the ſame time beating the buſhes; for the birds, when they are diſturbed from their places of reſt, or rooſt, immediately make to the light, and ſo are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed within the net. Adams immediately told them what happened, and deſired them <q>to hold the lanthorn to the face of the man on the ground, for he feared he had ſmote him fatally.</q> But, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his fears were frivolous; for the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This fellow, who had a readineſs at improving any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

but in vain. Three or four of them laid hands on him, and one holding the lanthorn to his face, they all agreed, <q>he had the moſt villainous countenance they ever beheld;</q> and an attorney's clerk who was one of the company declared, <q>he was ſure he had remembered him at the bar.</q> As to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, her hair was diſhevelled in the ſtruggle: and her noſe had bled, ſo that they could not perceive whether ſhe was handſome or ugly, but they ſaid her fright plainly diſcovered her guilt. And ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her pockets, as they did thoſe of Adams, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which the fellow ſaid he had loſt, they found in her pocket a purſe with ſome gold in it, which abundantly convinced them, eſpecially as the fellow offered to ſwear to it. Mr. Adams was found to have no more than one halfpenny about him. This the clerk ſaid, 'was a great piece of preſumption that he was an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>This accident promiſing them better ſport than what they had propoſed, they quitted their intention of catching birds, and unanimouſly reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the juſtice with the offenders. Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what a deſperate fellow Adams was, they tied his hands behind him; and having hid their nets among the buſhes, and the lanthorn being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before them, they placed the two priſoners in their front, and then began their march: Adams not only ſubmitting patiently to his own fate, but comforting and encouraging his companion under her ſufferings.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt they were on their way, the clerk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the reſt, that this adventure would prove, a very beneficial one: for that they would be all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to their proportions of 801. for apprehending
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:023370_0169_0FBF37E70E03EFB8"/>
the robbers. This occaſioned a contention con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the parts which they had ſeverally borne in taking them; one inſiſting, he ought to have the greateſt ſhare; for he had firſt laid his hands on Adams; another claiming a ſuperior part, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt held the lanthorn to the man's face on the ground, by which, he ſaid, <q>the whole was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</q> The clerk claimed four fifths of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for having propoſed to ſearch the priſoners; and likewiſe the carrying them before the juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid indeed, <q>in ſtrict juſtice, he ought to have the whole.</q> Theſe claims, however, they at laſt conſented to refer to a future deciſion, but ſeem'd all to agree that the clerk was entitled to a moiety. They then debated what money ſhould be allotted to the young fellow, who had been employed only in holding the nets. He very modeſtly ſaid. <q>That he did not apprehend any large proportion would fall to his charge; but hoped they would allow him ſomething: he deſired them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they had aſſigned their nets to his care, which prevented him from being as forward as any in laying hold of the robbers, (for ſo theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people were called;) that if he had not occupied the nets, ſome other muſt: concluding however, that he ſhould be contented with the ſmalleſt ſhare imaginable, and ſhould think that rather their bounty than his merit.</q> But they were all unanimous in excluding him from any part whatever, the clerk particularly ſwearing, <q>if they gave him a ſhilling, they might do what they pleaſed with the reſt; for he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf with the affair.</q> This contention was ſo hot, and ſo totally engaged the attention of all the parties, that a dextrous nimble thief, had he been in Mr. Adams's ſituation, would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:023370_0170_0FBF37E84B2443B0"/>
care to have given the juſtice no trouble that evening. Indeed, it required not the art of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd to eſcape, eſpecially as the darkneſs of the night would have ſo much befriended him: but Adams truſted rather to his innocence than his heels, and without thinking of flight, which was eaſy, or reſiſtance (which was impoſſible, as there were ſix luſty young fellows, beſides the villain himſelf, preſent) he walked with perfect reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way they thought proper to conduct him.</p>
                        <p>Adams frequently vented himſelf in ejaculations during their journey; at laſt poor Joſeph Andrews occurring to his mind, he could not refrain ſighing forth his name, which being heard by his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in affliction, ſhe cried, with ſome vehemence, <q>Sure I ſhould know that voice; you cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Sir, be Abraham Adams?</q> 
                           <q>Indeed, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</q> ſays he, <q>that is my name; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo in your voice, which perſuades me I have heard it before.</q> 
                           <q>La, Sir, ſays ſhe, don't you remember poor Fanny?</q> 'How, Fanny!' anſwered Adams, <q>indeed I very well remember you; what can have brought you hither?</q> 
                           <q>I have told you, Sir,</q> replied ſhe, <q>I was travelling towards London; but I thought you mentioned Joſeph Andrews, pray what is become of him?</q> 'I left him, Child, this afternoon,' ſaid Adams, <q>in the ſtage-coach, in his way towards our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, whither he is going to ſee you.</q> 
                           <q>To ſee me! La, Sir,</q> anſwered Fanny, <q>ſure you jeer me; what ſhould he be going to ſee me for?</q> 'Can you aſk that?' replied Adams. <q>I hope Fanny you are not inconſtant; I aſſure you he deſerves much better of you.</q> La! 'Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams,' ſaid ſhe, <q>what is Mr. Joſeph to me? I am ſure I never had any thing to ſay to him, but
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:023370_0171_0FBF37EB6E60C1C8"/>
as one fellow-ſervant might to another.</q> 
                           <q>I am ſorry to hear this,</q> ſaid Adams; <q>a virtuous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a young man, is what no woman need be aſhamed of. You either do not tell me truth, or you are falſe to a very worthy man.</q> Adams then told her what had happened at the inn, to which ſhe liſtened very attentively; and a ſigh often eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her, notwithſtanding her utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the contrary, nor could ſhe prevent her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from aſking a thouſand queſtions, which would have aſſured any one but Adams, who never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Indeed, the fact was, that this poor girl hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of Joſeph's misfortune by ſome of the ſervants belonging to the coach, which we have formerly mentioned to have ſtopt at the inn while the poor youth was confined to his bed, that inſtant abandoned the cow ſhe was milking, and taking with her a little bundle of clothes under her arm, and all the money ſhe was worth in her own purſe, without conſulting any one, immediately ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in purſuit of one, whom, notwithſtanding her ſhyneſs to the parſon, ſhe loved with inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible violence, though with the pureſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate paſſion.

                           <p>What happened to them while before the juſtice. A chapter very full of learning.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THEIR fellow-travellers were ſo engaged in the hot diſpute concerning the diviſion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for apprehending theſe innocent people, that they attended very little to their diſcourſe. They were now arrived at the juſtice's houſe, and had ſent one of his ſervants in to acquaint his worſhip, that they had taken two robbers, and brought them before him. The juſtice, who was juſt returned from a fox-chaſe, and had not yet finiſhed his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ordered them to carry the priſoners into the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whither they were attended by all the ſervants in the houſe, and all the people in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who flocked together to ſee them with as much curioſity as if there was ſomething uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be ſeen, or that a rogue did not look like other people.</p>
                        <p>The juſtice now being in the height of his mirth and his cups, bethought himſelf of the priſoners; and telling his company he believed they ſhould have good ſport in their examination, he ordered them into his preſence. They had no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room, than he began to revile them, ſaying, <q>that robberies on the highway were now grown ſo frequent, that people could not ſleep ſafely in their beds, and aſſured them they both ſhould be made examples of at the enſuing aſſizes.</q> After he had gone on ſome time in this manner, he was reminded by his clerk, <q>that it would be proper to take the depoſition of the witneſſes againſt them:</q> which he bid him do, <q>and he would light his pipe
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:023370_0173_0FBF37F09C4E0860"/>
in the mean time.</q> Whilſt the clerk was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in writing down the depoſition of the fellow who had pretended to be robbed, the juſtice employed himſelf in cracking jeſts on poor Fanny, in which he was ſeconded by all the company at table. One aſked, <q>whether ſhe was to be indicted for a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman?</q> Another whiſpered in her ear, <q>if ſhe had not provided herſelf a great belly, he was at her ſervice.</q> A third ſaid, <q>he warranted ſhe was a relation of Turpin.</q> To which one of the company, a great wit, ſhaking his head, and then his ſides, anſwered, <q>he believed ſhe was nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Turpis;</q> at which there was an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal laugh. They were proceeding thus with this poor girl, when ſomebody ſmoaking the caſſock peeping from under the coat of Adams, cried out, 'What have we here, a parſon?' 'How, ſirrah, ſays the juſtice, <q>do you go robbing in the dreſs of a clergyman? let me tell you, your habit will not entitle you to the benefit of the clergy.</q> 'Yes,' ſaid the witty fellow, <q>he will have one benefit of clergy, he will be exalted above the heads of the people;</q> at which there was a ſecond laugh. And now the witty ſpark, ſeeing his jokes take, began to riſe in ſpirits; and turning to Adams, challenged him to cap verſes, and provoking him by giving the firſt blow, he repeated,

                           </q>
Upon which Adams, with a look full of ineffable contempt, told him, he deſerved ſcourging for his pronunciation. The witty fellow anſwered, <q>What do you deſerve, doctor, for not been able to anſwer the firſt time?</q> Why I'll give you one, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

'I'll hold thee a guinea of that,' ſaid the wit, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the money on the table.—<q>And I'll go your halves,</q> cries the other. 'Done.' anſwered Adams; but upon applying to his pocket, he was forced to retract, and own he had no money about him; which ſet them all a laughing, and confirmed the triumph of his adverſary, which was not moderate, any more than the approbation he met with from the whole company, who told Adams he muſt go a little longer to ſchool, before he attempted to attack that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

The clerk having finiſhed the depoſitions, as well of the fellow himſelf, as of thoſe who apprehended the priſoners, delivered them to the juſtice; who having ſworn the ſeveral witneſſes, without reading a ſyllable, ordered his clerk to make the mittimus.</p>
                        <p>Adams then ſaid, <q>he hoped he ſhould not be condemned unheard.</q> 'No, no,' cries the juſtice, <q>you will be aſked what you have to ſay for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when you come on your trial: we are not trying you now; I ſhall only commit you to goal: if you can prove your innocence at Size, you will be found Ignoramus, and ſo no harm done.</q> 
                           <q>Is it no puniſhment, Sir, for an innocent man to lie ſeveral months in goal?</q> cries Adams: <q>I beg you would at leaſt hear me before you ſign the mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</q> 'What ſignifies all you can ſay?' ſays the juſtice, <q>is it not here in black and white againſt you? I muſt tell you, you are a very impertinent fellow, to take up ſo much of my time.—So make haſte with his mittimus.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The clerk now acquainted the juſtice, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ſuſpicious things, as a penknife, &amp;c. found in Adams's pocket, they had diſcovered a book written, as he apprehended, in cyphers: for no one could read a word in it. 'Aye,' ſays the juſtice, <q>the fellow may be more than a common robber, he may be in a plot againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—Produce the book.</q> Upon which the poor manuſcript of Aeſchylus, which Adams had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with his own hand, was brought forth; and the juſtice looking at it ſhook his head, and turning to the priſoner aſked the meaning of thoſe cyphers. 'Cyphers!' anſwered Adams, <q>it is a manuſcript of Aeſchylus.</q> 'Who? who?' ſaid the juſtice. Adams repeated, 'Aeſchylus.' <q>That is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh name,</q> cried the clerk. <q>A fictitious

name rather, I believe, </q>ſaid the juſtice. One of the company declared it looked very much like Greek. 'Greek,' ſaid the juſtice, <q>why 'tis all in writing.</q> 'No,' ſays the other, <q>I don't poſitively ſay it is ſo: for it is a very long time ſince I have ſeen any Greek.</q> 'There's one,' ſays he, turning to the parſon of the pariſh, who was preſent, <q>will tell us immediately.</q> The parſon taking up the book, and putting on his ſpectacles and gravity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, muttered ſome words to himſelf, and then pronounced aloud—<q>Ay, indeed, it is a Greek ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, a very fine piece of antiquity. I make no doubt but it was ſtolen from the ſame clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from whom the rogue took the caſſock.</q> 'What did the raſcal mean by his Aeſchylus?' ſays the juſtice. 'Pooh!' anſwered the doctor, with a contemptuous grin, <q>do you think that fellow knows any thing of this book? Aeſchylus! ho! ho! I ſee now what it is—A manuſcript of one of the fathers. I know a nobleman who would give a great deal of money for ſuch a piece of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.—Ay, ay, queſtion and anſwer. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is the catechiſm in Greek.—Ay,—Ay,—<hi>Pollaki toi</hi>—What's your name?</q>—<q>Ay, what's your name?</q> ſay the juſtice to Adams, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, 'It is Aeſchylus, and I will maintain it.'—'O it is,' ſays the juſtice, <q>make Mr. Aeſchylus his mittimus.

in this ſituation;</q> and then addreſſing himſelf to the juſtice, he ſaid, <q>Sir, I aſſure you, Mr. Adams is a clergyman as he appears, and a gentleman of a very good character. I wiſh you would enquire a little farther into this affair; for I am convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his innocence.</q> 'Nay,' ſays the juſtice, <q>if he is a gentleman, and you are ſure he is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, I don't deſire to commit him, not I; I will commit the woman by herſelf, and take your bail for the gentleman; look into the book, clerk, and ſee how it is to take bail; come—and make the mittimus for the woman as faſt as you can.</q> 'Sir,' cries Adams, <q>I aſſure you ſhe is as innocent as myſelf.</q> 'Perhaps,' ſaid the ſquire, <q>there may be ſome miſtake;—pray let us hear Mr. Adams's relation.</q> 
                           <q>With all my heart,</q> anſwered the juſtice, <q>and give the gentleman a glaſs to whet his whiſtle before he begins. I know how to behave myſelf to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as well as another. No body can ſay I have committed a gentleman, ſince I have been in the commiſſion.</q> Adams then began the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, in which, though he was very prolix, he was uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>terrupted, unleſs by ſeveral hums and ha's of the juſtice, and his deſire to repeat thoſe parts which ſeemed to him moſt material. When he had finiſhed, the juſtice, who, on what the ſquire had ſaid, believed every ſyllable of his ſtory on his bare affirmation, notwithſtanding the depoſitions on oath to the contrary, began to let looſe ſeveral rogues and raſcals againſt the witneſs, whom he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſtand forth, but in vain: the ſaid witneſs, long ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> privily withdrawn, without attending the iſſue. The juſtice now flew into a violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and was hardly prevailed with not to commit
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:023370_0178_0FBF3800B5D00810"/>
the innocent fellows, who had been impoſed on as well as himſelf. He ſwore, <q>they had beſt find out the fellow who was guilty of perjury, and bring him before him within two days, or he would bind them all over to their good behaviour.</q> They all promiſed to uſe their beſt endeavours to that purpoſe, and were diſmiſſed. Then the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice inſiſted, that Mr. Adams ſhould ſit down and take a glaſs with him; and the parſon of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh delivered him back the manuſcript without ſaying a word; nor would Adams, who plainly diſcerned his ignorance, expoſe it. As for Fanny, ſhe was, at her own requeſt, recommended to the care of a maid-ſervant of the houſe, who helped her to new dreſs, and clean herſelf.</p>
                        <p>The company in the parlour had not been long ſeated, before they were alarmed with a horrible uproar from without, where the perſons who had apprehended Adams and Fanny, had been rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, according to the cuſtom of the houſe, with the juſtice's ſtrong beer. Theſe were all fallen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ears, and were cuffing each other without any mercy. The juſtice himſelf ſallied out, and with the dignity of his preſence ſoon put an end to the fray. On his return into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, he reported <q>That the occaſion of the quarrel was no other than a diſpute, to whom, if Adams had been convicted, the greater ſhare of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for apprehending him had belonged.</q> All the company laughed at this, except Adams, who, taking his pipe from his mouth, fetched a deep groan, and ſaid, he was concerned to ſee ſo litigious a temper in men. That he remembered a ſtory ſomething like it in one of the pariſhes where his cure lay: <q>There was, continued he, a competition between three young fellows for the
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:023370_0179_0FBF380585636CD0"/>
place of the clerk, which I diſpoſed of to the beſt of my abilities, according to merit: that is, I gave it to him who had the happieſt knack at ſetting a pſalm. The clerk was no ſooner eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in his place than a contention began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two diſappointed candidates concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their excellence, each contending, on whom, had they two been the only competitors, my elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have fallen. This diſpute frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturbed the congregation, and introduced a diſcord into the pſalmody, till I was forced to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them both. But alas, the litigious ſpirit could not be ſtifled; and being no longer able to vent itſelf in ſinging, it now broke forth in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It produced many battles, (for they were very near a match;) and, I believe, would have ended fatally, had not the death of the clerk given me an opportunity to promote one of them to the place; which preſently put an end to the diſpute, and entirely reconciled the contending parties.</q> Adams then proceeded to make ſome philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obſervations on the folly of growing warm in diſputes, in which neither party is intereſted. He then applied himſelf vigorouſly to ſmoaking; and a long ſilence enſued, which was at length broke by the juſtice; who began to ſing forth his own praiſes, and to value himſelf exceedingly on his nice diſcernment in the cauſe which had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been before him. He was quickly interrupted by Mr. Adams, between whom and his worſhip a diſpute now aroſe, whether he ought not, in ſtrictneſs of law, to have committed him, the ſaid Adams; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

violent and poſitive in their opinions) had not Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accidentally heard, that a young fellow was going from the juſtice's houſe to the very inn where the ſtage-coach, in which Joſeph was, put up. Upon this news, ſhe immediately ſent for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the parlour. Adams, when he found her reſolute to go, (though ſhe would not own the reaſon, but pretended ſhe could not bear to ſee the faces of thoſe who had ſuſpected her of ſuch a crime) was as fully determined to go with her; he accordingly took leave of the juſtice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſo ended a diſpute in which the law ſeemed ſhamefully to intend to ſet a magiſtrate and a divine together by the ears.</p>

                        <p>Fanny ſat likewiſe down by the fire; but was much more impatient at the ſtorm.

                        <p>Fanny was now in the nineteenth year of her age: ſhe was tall and delicately ſhaped; but not one of thoſe ſlender young women, who ſeem rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hang up in the hall of an anatomiſt, than for any other purpoſe. On the contrary, ſhe was ſo plump, that ſhe ſeemed burſting through her tight ſtays, eſpecially in the part which confined her ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling breaſts. Nor did her hips want the aſſiſtance of a hoop to extend them. The exact ſhape of her arms denoted the form of thoſe limbs which ſhe concealed; and though they were a little reddened by her labour; yet, if her ſleeve ſlipt above her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, or her handkerchief diſcovered any part of her neck, a whiteneſs appeared which the fineſt Italian paint would be unable to reach. Her hair was of a cheſnut brown, and nature had been extremely laviſh to her of it, which ſhe had cut, and on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days uſed to curl down her neck in the modern fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. Her forehead was high, her eye-brows arched, and rather full than otherwiſe. Her eyes black and ſparkling; her noſe juſt inclining to the Roman; her lips red and moiſt, and her under lip, according to the opinion of the ladies, too pouting. Her teeth were white, but not exactly even. The ſmall-pox had left one only mark on her chin, which

Her complexion was fair, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle injured by the ſun, but overſpread with ſuch a bloom, that the fineſt ladies would have exchanged all their white for it: add to theſe a countenance, in which, though ſhe was extremely baſhful, a ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity appeared almoſt incredible; and a ſweetneſs whenever ſhe ſmiled, beyond either imitation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.

Adams had been ruminating all this time on a paſſage in AEſchylus, without attending in the leaſt to the voice, tho' one of the moſt melodious that ever was heard; when caſting his eyes on Fanny, he cried out, 'Bleſs us, you look extremely pale.' Pale! Mr. Adams, ſays ſhe, O Jeſus! and fell backwards in her chair. Adams jumped up, flung his AEſchylus into the fire, and fell a roaring to the people of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He ſoon ſummoned every one into the room, and the ſongſter among the reſt: but, O reader, when this nightingale, who was no other than Joſeph Andrews himſelf, ſaw his beloved Fanny in this ſituation we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed her, can'ſt thou conceive the agitations of his mind? If thou can'ſt not, wave that meditation to behold his happineſs, when claſping her in his arms, he found life and blood returning into her cheeks: when he ſaw her open her beloved eyes, and heard her with the ſofteſt accent whiſper, <q>Are you Joſeph Andrews?</q> 'Art thou my Fanny?' he anſwered eagerly, and pulling her to his heart, he imprinted numberleſs kiſſes on her lips, without conſidering who were preſent.</p>

to explain the reaſons of her conduct; nor do we doubt being able to ſatisfy the moſt curious reader, that Mrs. Slipſlop did not in the leaſt devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from the common road in this behaviour; and indeed, had ſhe done otherwiſe, ſhe muſt have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended below herſelf, and would have very juſtly been liable to cenſure.</p>
                        <p>Be it known then, that the human ſpecies are divided into two ſorts of people, to wit, High people and Low people. As by high people I would not be underſtood to mean perſons literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born higher in their dimenſions than the reſt of the ſpecies, nor metaphorically thoſe of exalted characters or abilities; ſo by low people I cannot be conſtrued to intend the reverſe. High people ſignify no other than people of faſhion, and low people thoſe of no faſhion. Now this word Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion hath by long uſe loſt its original meaning, from which at preſent it gives us a very different idea; for I am deceived, if by perſons of faſhion, we do not generally include a conception of birth and accompliſhments ſuperior to the herd of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; whereas in reality, nothing more was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally meant by a perſon of faſhion, than a perſon who dreſt himſelf in the faſhion of the times; and the word really and truly ſignifies no more at this day. Now the world being thus divided into peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of faſhion, and people of no faſhion, a fierce con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In this contention, it is difficult to ſay which party ſucceeded: for whilſt the people of faſhion ſeized ſeveral places to their own uſe, ſuch as courts, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, operas, balls, &amp;c. the people of no faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

beſides one royal place, called his majeſty's bear-garden, have been in conſtant poſſeſſion of all hops, fairs, revels, &amp;c. Two places have been agreed to be divided between them, namely the church and the playhouſe; where they ſegregate themſelves from each other in a remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for as the people of faſhion exalt themſelves at church over the heads of the people of no faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo in the playhouſe they abaſe themſelves in the ſame degree under their feet. This diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have never met with any one able to account for: it is ſufficient, that ſo far from looking on each other as brethren in the Chriſtian language<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſeem ſcarce to regard each other as of the ſame ſpecies. This the terms, <q>ſtrange perſons, people one does not know, the creature, wretches, beaſts, brutes,</q> and many other appellations evidently demonſtrate; which Mrs. Slipſlop hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often heard her miſtreſs uſe, thought ſhe had alſo a right to uſe in her turn: and, perhaps, ſhe was not miſtaken; for theſe two parties eſpecially thoſe bordering nearly on each other, to wit, the loweſt of the high, and the higheſt of the low, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten change their parties according to place and time; for thoſe who are people of faſhion in one place, are often people of no faſhion in another. And with regard to time, it may not be unpleaſant to ſurvey the picture of dependance like a kind of ladder: as for inſtance; early in the morning ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the poſtilion, or ſome other boy which great families, no more than great ſhips, are without, and falls to bruſhing the cloaths, and cleaning the ſhoes of John the footman, who being dreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, applies his hand to the ſame labours for Mr. Second-hand the ſquire's gentleman; the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the like manner, a little later in the day,

attends the ſquire; the ſquire is no ſooner equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, than he attends the levee of my lord; which is no ſooner over, than my lord himſelf is ſeen at the levee of the favourite, who, after the hour of homage is at an end, appears himſelf to pay ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the levee of his ſovereign. Nor is there, perhaps, in this whole ladder of dependance, any one ſtep at a greater diſtance from the other, than the firſt from the ſecond: ſo that to a philoſopher the queſtion might only ſeem, whether you would chuſe to be a great man at ſix in the morning, or at two in the afternoon. And yet there are ſcarce two of theſe, who do not think the leaſt familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the perſons below them a condeſcenſion, and, if they were to go one ſtep farther, a degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

                        <p>The horſe was no ſooner put into Adams's head, but he was immediately driven out by this reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the character of Fanny. He proteſted, <q>

                           <q>Very honeſt means,</q> returned ſhe with a ſneer, <q>to bring good people together.</q> At which words Adams took two or three ſtrides acroſs the room, when the coachman came to inform Mrs. Slipſlop, <q>that the ſtorm was over, and the moon ſhone ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bright.</q> She then ſent for Joſeph, who was ſitting without with his Fanny, and would have had him gone with her: but he peremptorily refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to leave Fanny behind; which threw the good woman into a violent rage. She ſaid, <q>ſhe would inform her lady what doings were carrying on, and did not doubt but ſhe would rid the pariſh of all ſuch people;</q> and concluded a long ſpeech full of bitterneſs and very hard words, with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the clergy, not decent to repeat: at laſt, finding Joſeph unmoveable, ſhe flung herſelf into the chaiſe, caſting a look at Fanny as ſhe went, not unlike that which Cleopatra gives Octavia in the play. To ſay the truth, ſhe was moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeably diſappointed by the preſence of Fanny; ſhe had, from her firſt ſeeing Joſeph at the inn, conceived hopes of ſomething which might have been accompliſhed at an ale-houſe as well as a palace. Indeed, it is probable Mr. Adams had
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:023370_0191_0FBF383AFB446CA0"/>
reſcued more than Fanny from the danger of a rape that evening.</p>
                        <p>When the chaiſe had carried off the enraged Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlop; Adams, Joſeph, and Fanny aſſembled over the fire; where they had a great deal of innocent chat, pretty enough; but as poſſibly it would not be very entertaining to the reader, we ſhall haſten to the morning; only obſerving that none of them went to bed that night. Adams when he had ſmoaked three pipes, took a comfortable nap in a great chair, and left the lovers, whoſe eyes were too well employed to permit any deſire of ſhutting them, to enjoy by themſelves, during ſome hours, an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which none of my readers who have never been in love, are capable of the leaſt conception of, tho' we had as many tongues as Homer deſired to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it with, and which all true lovers will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their own minds without the leaſt aſſiſtance from us.</p>
                        <p>Let it ſuffice then to ſay, that Fanny, after a thouſand entreaties, at laſt gave up her whole ſoul to Joſeph, and almoſt fainting in his arms, with a ſigh infinitely ſofter and ſweeter too, than any Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian breeze, ſhe whiſpered to his lips, which were then cloſe to hers, <q>O Joſeph, you have won me; I will be yours for ever.</q> Joſeph having thanked her on his knees, and embraced her with eagerneſs, which ſhe now almoſt returned, leapt up in a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and awakened the parſon, earneſtly begging him, <q>that he would that inſtant join their hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</q> Adams rebuked him for his requeſt, and told him, <q>he would by no means conſent to any thing contrary to the forms of the church: that he had no licence, nor indeed would he adviſe him to obtain one. That the church had preſcribed a form, namely the publication of banns, with
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:023370_0192_0FBF383E4099A7F0"/>
which all good chriſtians ought to comply, and to the omiſſion of which he attributed the many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which befel great folks in marriage:</q> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, <q>As many as are joined together other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than G—'s word doth allow, are not joined together by G—, neither is their matrimony lawful.</q> Fanny agreed with the parſon, ſaying to Joſeph with a bluſh, <q>ſhe aſſured him ſhe would not conſent to any ſuch thing, and that ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his offering it.</q> In which reſolution ſhe was comforted, and commended by Adams; and Joſeph was obliged to wait patiently till after the third publication of the banns, which however he obtained the conſent of Fanny, in the preſence of Adams, to put in at their arrival.</p>
                        <p>The ſun had been now riſen ſome hours, when Joſeph finding his leg ſurprizingly recovered, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to walk forward; but when they were all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſet out, an accident a little retarded them. This was no other than the reckoning, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to ſeven ſhillings; no great ſum, if we conſider the immenſe quantity of ale which Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams poured in. Indeed they had no objection to the reaſonableneſs of the bill, but many to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of paying it; for the fellow who had taken poor Fanny's purſe, had unluckily forgot to return it. So that the account ſtood thus:

                        <p>PARSON Adams came to the houſe of Parſon Trulliber, whom he found ſtript into his waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, with an apron on, and a pale in his hand, juſt come from ſerving his hogs; for Mr. Trulliber was a parſon on Sundays, but all the other ſix might more properly be called a farmer. He oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied a ſmall piece of land of his own, beſides which he rented a conſiderable deal more. His wife milked his cows, managed his dairy, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the markets with butter and eggs. The hogs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He was indeed one of the largeſt men you ſhould ſee, and could have acted the part of Sir John Falſtaff without

ſtuffing. Add to this, that the rotundity of his belly was conſiderably increaſed by the ſhortneſs of his ſtature, his ſhadow aſcending very near as far in height when he lay on his back, as when he ſtood on his legs. His voice was loud and hoarſe, and his accent extremely broad; to complete the whole, he had a ſtatelineſs in his gait, when he walked, not unlike that of a gooſe, only he ſtalked ſlower.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Trulliber being informed that ſomebody wanted to ſpeak with him, immediately ſlipt off his apron, and cloathed himſelf in an old night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown, being the dreſs in which he always ſaw his company at home. His wife, who informed of Mr. Adams's arrival, had made a ſmall miſtake; for ſhe had told her huſband, <q>ſhe believed here was a man come for ſome of his hogs.</q> This ſuppoſition made Mr. Trulliber haſten with the utmoſt expedition to attend his gueſt. He no ſooner ſaw Adams, than not in the leaſt doubting the cauſe of his errand to be what his wife had imagined, he told him, <q>he was come in very good time; that he expected a dealer that very after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;</q> and added, <q>they were all pure and fat, and upwards of 20 ſcore a piece.</q> Adams an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, 'he believed he did not know him.' Yes, yes,' cried Trulliber, I have ſeen you often at fair; <q>why, we have dealt before now, mun, I warrant you; yes, yes, cries he, I remember thy face very well, but won't mention a word more till you have ſeen them, tho' I have never ſold thee a flitch of ſuch bacon as is now in the ſtye.</q> Upon which he laid violent hands on Adams, and dragged him into the hogs-ſtye, which was indeed but two ſteps from his parlour-window. They were no ſooner arrived there than he cry'd out,

                           <q>Do but handle them; ſtep in, friend, art welcome to handle them, whether doſt buy or no.</q> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> which words opening the gate, he puſhed Adams into the pig-ſtye, inſiſting on it, that he ſhould handle them before he would talk one word with him. Adams, whoſe natural complaiſance was beyond any artificial, was obliged to comply before he was ſuffered to explain himſelf; and laying hold on one of their tails, the unruly beaſt gave ſuch a ſudden ſpring, that he threw poor Adams all along in the mire. Trulliber, inſtead of aſſiſting him to get up, burſt into a laughter, and entering the ſtye, ſaid to Adams, with ſome contempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why, doſt not know how to handle a hog? and was going to lay hold of one himſelf; but Adams, who thought he had carried his complaiſance far enough, was no ſooner on his legs, than he eſcaped out of the reach of the animals, and cried out, <hi>Nihil habeo cum porcis:</hi> 
                           <q>I am a clergyman, Sir, and am not come to buy hogs.</q> Trulliber an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>he was ſorry for the miſtake; but that he muſt blame his wife;</q> adding, ſhe was a fool, and always committed blunders. He then deſired him to walk in and clean himſelf; that he would only faſten up the ſtye and follow him. Adams deſired leave to dry his great coat, wig and hat, by the fire, which Trulliber granted. Mrs. Trul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liber would have brought him a baſon of water to waſh his face; but her huſband bid her be quiet, like a fool, as ſhe was, or ſhe would commit more blunders, and then directed Adams to the pump. While Adams was thus employed, Trulliber per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no great reſpect for the appearance of his gueſt, faſtened the parlour-door, and now conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into the kitchen; telling him, he believed a cup of drink would do him no harm, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:023370_0196_0FBF384794BD20B8"/>
his wife to draw a little of the worſt ale. After a ſhort ſilence, Adams ſaid, <q>I fancy, Sir, you already perceive me to be a clergyman.</q> 'Ay, ay,' cries Trulliber grinning; <q>I perceive you have ſome caſſock; I will not venture to caale it a whole one.</q> Adams anſwered, <q>it was indeed none of the beſt; but he had the misfortune to tear it about ten years ago in paſſing over a ſtile.</q> Mrs. Trulliber returning with the drink, told her huſband, <q>ſhe fancied the gentleman was a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and that he would be glad to eat a bit,</q> Trul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liber bid her hold her impertinent tongue; and aſked her, <q>if parſons uſed to travel without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</q> adding, <q>he ſuppoſed the gentleman had none by his having no boots on.</q> 
                           <q>Yes, Sir, yes,</q> ſays Adams, <q>I have a horſe, but I left him behind me.</q> 'I am glad to hear you have one,' ſays Trulliber; <q>for I aſſure you I don't love to ſee clergymen on foot; it is not ſeemly nor ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignity of the cloth.</q> Here Trulliber made a long oration on the dignity of the cloth, (or rather gown) not worth much relating, till his wife had ſpread the table and ſet a meſs of porridge on it for his breakfaſt. He then ſaid to Adams, <q>I don't know, friend, how you came to caale on me; however, as you are here, if you think proper to eat a morſel, you may.</q> Adams accepted the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, and the two parſons ſat down together, Mrs. Trulliber waiting behind her huſband's chair, as was, it ſeems, her cuſtom. Trulliber eat hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, but ſcarce put any thing in his mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding fault with his wife's cookery. All which the poor woman bore patiently. Indeed ſhe was ſo abſolute an admirer of her huſband's greatneſs and importance, of which ſhe had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hints from his own mouth, that ſhe almoſt
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:023370_0197_0FBF384D961F77A8"/>
carried her adoration to an opinion of infallibility. To ſay the truth, the parſon had exerciſed her more ways than one, and the pious woman had ſo well edified by her huſband's ſermons, that ſhe had reſolved to receive the bad things of the world together with the good. She had indeed been at firſt a little contentious; but he had long ſince got the better, partly by her love for this, partly by her fear for that, partly by her religion, partly by the reſpect he paid himſelf, and partly by that which ſhe received from the pariſh: She had, in ſhort, abſolutely ſubmitted, and now worſhipped her huſband as Sarah did Abraham, calling him (not lord but) maſter. Whilſt they were at the table, her huſband gave her a freſh example of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for as ſhe had juſt delivered a cup of ale to Adams, he ſnatched it out of his hand, and, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, I caal'd vurſt, ſwallowed down the ale. Adams deny'd it; as was referred to the wife, who, tho' her conſcience was on the ſide of Adams, durſt not give it againſt her huſband. Upon which he ſaid, <q>No, Sir, no. I ſhould not have been ſo rude to have taken it from you, if you had caal'd vurſt; but I'd have you know I'm a better man than to ſuffer the beſt he in the kingdom to drink before me in my own houſe, when I caale vurſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>As ſoon as their breakfaſt was ended, Adams be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the following manner: <q>I think, Sir, it is high time to inform you of the buſineſs of my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy. I am a traveller, and am paſſing this way in company with two young people, a lad and a damſel, my pariſhoners, towards my own cure: we ſtopt at a houſe of hoſpitality in the pariſh, where they directed me to you, as having the cure.—Tho' I am but a curate,</q> ſays Trulliber, <q>I believe I am as warm as the vicar himſelf, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:023370_0198_0FBF385316AFC8F8"/>
the rector of the next pariſh too; I believe I could buy them both.</q> 'Sir,' cries Adams, <q>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice thereat. Now, Sir, my buſineſs is, that we are by various accidents ſtript of our money, and are not able to pay our reckoning, being ſeven ſhillings. I therefore requeſt you to aſſiſt me with the loan of thoſe ſeven ſhillings, and alſo ſeven ſhillings more, which peradventure I ſhall return to you; but if not, I am convinced you will joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrace ſuch an opportunity of laying up a treaſure in a better place than any this world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords.</q>

Lay up my treaſures! what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters where a man's treaſure is, whoſe heart is in the ſcripture? there is the treaſure of a chriſtian.</q> At theſe words the water ran from Adams's eyes; and catching Trulliber by the hand in a rapture, 'Brother,' ſays he, <q>heavens bleſs the accident by which I came to ſee you; I would have walked many a mile to have communed with you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I ſhall ſhortly pay you a ſecond viſit: but my friends, I fancy, by this time, wonder at my ſtay; ſo let me have the money immediately.</q> Trulliber then put on a ſtern look, and cried out, 'Thou doſt not intend to rob me?' At which the wife burſting into tears, fell on her knees, and roared out, <q>O dear Sir, for heaven's ſake don't rob my maſter, we are but poor people.</q> 
                           <q>Get up, for a fool as thou art, and go about thy buſineſs,</q> ſaid Trulliber, <q>doſt thou think the man will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life? he is a beggar, and no robber.</q> 'Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true indeed,' anſwered Adams. <q>I wiſh with all my heart, the tithing-man was here,</q> cries Trulliber, <q>I would have thee puniſhed as a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond for thy impudence.

                           <q>Iſacks, a good ſtory,</q> cries Mrs. Trulliber, <q>to preach to my maſter.</q> 'Silence, woman,' cries Trulliber, <q>I would have thee know, friend,</q> (addreſſing himſelf to Adams) <q>I ſhall not learn my duty from ſuch as thee; I know what charity is, better than to give it to vagabonds.</q>
                           <q> Beſides, if we were inclined, the poors rate obliges us to give ſo much charity,</q> cries the wife.—'Pugh!' thou art a fool. <q>Poors rate! hold thy nonſenſe,</q> anſwered Trulliber: and then turning to Adams, he told him <q>he would give him nothing.</q> 'I am ſorry,' anſwered Adams, <q>that you do know what charity is, ſince you practiſe it no better; I muſt tell you, if you truſt to your knowledge for your juſtification, you will find yourſelf deceived, though you ſhould add faith to it without good works.</q> 'Fellow,' cries Trulliber, <q>doſt thou ſpeak againſt faith in my houſe?

'No, but you do,' anſwered A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, <q>if I may reaſon from your practice: for their commands are ſo explicit, and their rewards and puniſhments ſo immenſe, that it is impoſſible a man ſhould ſtedfaſtly believe without obeying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now there is no command more expreſs, no duty more frequently enjoined, than charity.

                           <p>An adventure, the conſequence of a new inſtance which parſon Adams gave of his forgetfulneſs.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WHEN he came back to the inn, he found Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph and Fanny ſitting together. They were ſo far from thinking his abſence long, as he had feared they would, that they never once miſs'd or thought of him. Indeed I have been often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by both, that they ſpent theſe hours in a moſt delightful converſation: But as I never could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on either to relate it; ſo I cannot communicate it to the reader.</p>
                        <p>Adams acquainted the lovers with the ill ſucceſs of his enterprize. They were all greatly confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, none being able to propoſe any method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, till Joſeph at laſt adviſed calling in the hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, and deſiring her to truſt them: which Fanny faid ſhe deſpaired of her doing, as ſhe was one of the ſoureſt-fac'd women ſhe had ever beheld.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="203" facs="unknown:023370_0202_0FBF34249CC67480"/>
But ſhe was agreeably diſappointed; for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs was no ſooner aſked the queſtion than ſhe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agreed; and with a curt'ſy and ſmile wiſhed them a good journey. However, leſt Fanny's ſkill in phyſiognomy ſhould be called in queſtion, we will venture to aſſign one reaſon, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably incline her to this confidence and good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. When Adams ſaid he was going to viſit his brother, he had unwittingly impoſed on Joſeph and Fanny; who both believed he had meant his natural brother, and not his brother in divinity; and had ſo informed the hoſteſs on her enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. Now Mr. Trulliber had by his profeſſions of piety, by his gravity, auſterity, reſerve, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his great wealth, ſo great an authority in his pariſh, that they all lived in the utmoſt fear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of him. It was therefore no wonder that the hoſteſs, who knew it was in his option whether ſhe ſhould ever ſell another mug of drink, did not dare to affront his ſuppoſed brother by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him credit.</p>
                        <p>They were now juſt on their departure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t at Mr. Trulliber's. As he was not deſirous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his viſit, the hoſteſs herſelf, having no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at home, offered to fetch it.</p>
                        <p>This was an unfortunate expedient: for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs was ſoon undeceived in the opinion ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of Adams, whom Trulliber abuſed in the groſſeſt terms, eſpecially when he heard he had the aſſurance to pretend to be his near relation.</p>
                        <p>At her return therefore, ſhe entirely changed her note. She ſaid, <q>Folks might be aſhamed of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling about, and pretending to be what they were not. That taxes were high, and for her part, ſhe was obliged to pay for what ſhe had: ſhe could
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:023370_0203_0FBF3426D3463440"/>
not therefore poſſibly, nor would ſhe truſt any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, no not her own father. That money was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſcarcer, and ſhe wanted to make up a ſum. That ſhe expected therefore they ſhould pay their reckoning before they left the houſe.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Adams was now greatly perplexed: but as he knew that he could eaſily have borrowed ſuch a ſum in his own pariſh, and as he knew he would have lent it himſelf to any mortal in diſtreſs; ſo he took freſh courage, and ſallied out all round the pariſh, but to no purpoſe; he returned as pennyleſs as he went, groaning and lamenting, that it was impoſſible, in a country profeſſing chriſtianity, for a wretch to ſtarve in the midſt of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who abounded.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt he was gone, the hoſteſs, who ſtayed as a ſort of guard with Joſeph and Fanny, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with the goodneſs of parſon Trulliber. And indeed he had not only a very good character, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Adams was no ſooner returned the ſecond time, than the ſtorm grew exceeding high, the hoſteſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring among other things, that if they offered to ſtir without paying her, ſhe would ſoon overtake them with a warrant.</p>
                        <p>Plato and Ariſtotle, or ſomebody elſe hath ſaid, THAT WHEN THE MOST EXQUISITE CUNNING FAILS, CHANCE OFTEN HITS THE MARK, AND THAT BY MEANS THE LEAST EXPECTED. Virgil expreſſes this very boldly:

I would quote more great men if I could: but my memory not permitting me, I will proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify theſe obſervations by the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

This man having attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liſtened to the diſcourſe of the hoſteſs, at laſt took Adams aſide, and aſked him what the ſum was for which they were detained. As ſoon as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he ſighed, and ſaid, <q>he was ſorry it was ſo much: for that he had no more than ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſixpence in his pocket, which he would lend them with all his heart.</q> Adams gave a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and cry'd out, <q>It would do: for that he had ſixpence himſelf.</q> And thus theſe poor people, who could not engage the compaſſion of riches and piety, were at length delivered out of their diſtreſs by the charity of a poor pedlar.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall refer it to my reader to make what obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations he pleaſes on this incident: it is ſufficient for me to inform him, that after Adams and his companions had returned him a thouſand thanks, and told him where he might call to be repaid, they all ſallied out of the houſe without any compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from their hoſteſs, or indeed without paying her any; Adams declaring, he would take particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care never to call there again, and ſhe on her ſide aſſuring them ſhe wanted no ſuch gueſts.</p>

                           <p>A very curious adventure, in which Mr. Adams gave a much greater inſtance of the honeſt ſimplicity of his heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </argument>
                        <p>OUR travellers had walked about two miles from that inn, which they had more reaſon to have miſtaken for a caſtle, that Don Quixote ever had any of thoſe in which he ſojourned; ſeeing they had met with much difficulty in eſcaping out of its walls; when they came to a pariſh, and beheld a ſign of invitation hanging out. A gentleman ſat ſmoaking a pipe at the door; of whom Adams en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the road, and received ſo courteous and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an anſwer, accompanied with ſo ſmiling a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenace, that the good parſon, whoſe heart was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpoſed to love and affection, began to aſk ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other queſtions; particularly the name of the pariſh, and who was the owner of a large houſe whoſe front they then had in proſpect. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman anſwered as obligingly as before: and as to the houſe, acquainted him it was his own. He then proceeded in the following manner: <q>Sir, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume by your habit you are a clergyman: and as you are travelling on foot, I ſuppoſe a glaſs of good beer will not be diſagreeable to you; and I can recommend my landlord's within, as ſome of the beſt in all this country. What ſay you, will you halt a little and let us take a pipe together? There is no better tobacco in the kingdom.</q> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was not diſpleaſing to Adams, who had allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his thirſt that day with no better liquor than what Mrs. Trulliber's cellar had produced; and which
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:023370_0206_0FBF342E446E8D50"/>
was indeed little ſuperior either in richneſs or fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to that which diſtilled from thoſe grains her generous huſband beſtowed on his hogs. Having therefore abundantly thanked the gentleman for his kind invitation, and bid Joſeph and Fanny fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, he entered the ale-houſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> truly anſwered the character given of it, being ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, the three travellers fell to eating with appetites infinitely more voracious than are to be found at the moſt exquiſite eating-houſes in the pariſh of St. James's.</p>
                        <p>The gentleman expreſſed great delight in the hearty and chearful behaviour of Adams; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the familiarity with which he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Joſeph and Fanny, whom he often called his children, a term he explained to mean no more than his pariſhioners; ſaying, he looked on all thoſe whom God had entruſted to his cure, to ſtand to him in that relation. The gentleman, ſhaking him by the hand, highly applauded thoſe ſentiments. 'They are indeed,' ſays he, <q>the true principles of a chriſtian divine; and I heartily wiſh they were univerſal: but on the contrary, I am ſorry to ſay the parſon of our pariſh, inſtead of eſteeming his poor pariſhioners as a part of his family, ſeems rather to conſider them as not of the ſame ſpecies with himſelf. He ſeldom ſpeaks to any, unleſs ſome few of the richeſt of us; nay, indeed he will not move his hat to the others. I often laugh, when I behold him on Sundays ſtrutting along the church-yard like a turky-cock, through rows of his pariſhioners; who bow to him with as much ſubmiſſion, and are as unregarded as a ſet of ſervile courtiers by the proudeſt prince in Chriſtendom. But if ſuch

Adams begged he might give him no ſuch trouble; that he could be very well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated in the houſe where they were; forgetting they had not a ſixpenny piece among them. The gentleman would not be denied; and informing himſelf how far they were travelling, he ſaid it was too long a journey to take on foot, and begged that they would favour him, by ſuffering him to lend them a ſervant and horſes; adding withal, that if they would do him the pleaſure of their company only two days, he would furniſh them with his coach and ſix. Adams turning to Joſeph ſaid, <q>How lucky is this gentleman's goodneſs to you, who I am afraid would be ſcarce able to hold out on your lame leg:</q> and then addreſſing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who made him theſe liberal promiſes, after much bowing, he cried out, <q>Bleſſed be the hour which firſt introduced me to a man of your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: you are indeed a chriſtian of the true primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive kind, and an honour to the country wherein you live. I would willingly have taken a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the holy land to have beheld you: For the advantages which we draw from your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:023370_0209_0FBF3433902D6738"/>
give me little pleaſure, in compariſon of what I enjoy for your own ſake; when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the treaſures you are by theſe means laying up for yourſelf in a country that paſſeth not away. We will therefore, moſt generous Sir, accept your goodneſs, as well the entertainment you have ſo kindly offered us at your houſe this evening, as the accommodation of your horſes to-morrow morning.</q> He then began to ſearch for his hat, as did Joſeph for his; and both they and Fanny were in order of departure, when the gentleman ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſhort, and ſeeming to meditate by himſelf for the ſpace of about a minute, exclaimed thus: <q>Sure never any thing was ſo unlucky; I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that my houſe-keeper was gone abroad, and hath locked up all my rooms; indeed I would break them open for you, but ſhall not be able to furniſh you with a bed; for ſhe has likewiſe put away all my linen. I am glad it entered into my head, before I had given you the trouble of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; beſides, I believe you will find better accommodations here than you expected. Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, you can provide good beds for theſe people, can't you?</q> 'Yes, and pleaſe your worſhip,' cries the hoſt, <q>and ſuch as no lord or juſtice of the peace in the kingdom need be aſhamed to lie in. I am heartily ſorry, ſays the gentleman, for this diſappointment. I am reſolved I will never ſuffer her to carry away the keys again. Pray Sir, let it not make you uneaſy,</q> cries A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, <q>we ſhall do very well here; and the loan of your horſes is a favour we ſhall be incapable of making any return to</q> 
                           <q>Ay! ſaid the ſquire, the horſes ſhall attend you here, at what hour in the morning you pleaſe.</q> And now after many civilities too tedious to enumerate, many ſqueezes
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:023370_0210_0FBF3435C0F193C0"/>
by the hand, with moſt affectionate looks and ſmiles at each other, and after appointing the horſes at ſeven the next morning, the gentleman took his leave of them, and departed to his own houſe. Adams and his companions returned to the table, where the parſon ſmoaked another pipe, and then they all retired to reſt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adams roſe very early, and called Joſeph out of his bed, between whom a very fierce diſpute enſued, whether Fanny ſhould ride behind Joſeph, or behind the gentleman's ſervant; Joſeph inſiſted on it that he was perfectly recovered, and was as capable of taking care of Fanny as any other perſon could be. But Adams would not agree to it, and declared he would not truſt her behind him; for that he was weaker than he imagined himſelf to be.</p>
                        <p>This diſpute continued a long time, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be very hot, when a ſervant arrived from their good friend to acquaint them, that he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately prevented from lending them any horſes; for that his groom had, unknown to him, put his whole ſtable under a courſe of phyſick.</p>
                        <p>This advice preſently ſtruck the two diſputants dumb; Adams cried out, <q>was ever any thing ſo unlucky as this poor gentleman? I proteſt I am more ſorry on his account than my own. You ſee, Joſeph, how this good-natur'd man is treated by his ſervants; one lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But certainly this gentleman has ſuch an affection for you, that he would lend you a larger ſum than we owe here; which is not above four or five ſhillings.</q> 'Very true, child,' anſwered Adams; <q>I will write a letter to him, and will even venture to ſollicit him for three hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>Fanny being now riſen, Joſeph paid her a viſit, and left Adams to write his letter, which having finiſhed, he diſpatched a boy with it to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and then ſeated himſelf by the door, lighted his pipe, and betook himſelf to meditation.</p>
                        <p>The boy ſtaying longer than ſeemed to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, Joſeph, who with Fanny was now returned to the parſon, expreſſed ſome apprehenſions, that the gentleman's ſteward had locked up his purſe too. To which Adams anſwered, <q>It might very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be; and he ſhould wonder at no liberties which the devil might put into the head of a wicked ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to take with ſo worthy a maſter: but added, that as the ſum was ſo ſmall, ſo noble a gentleman would be eaſily able to procure it in the pariſh; though he had it not in his own pocket.</q> Indeed, ſays he, <q>if it was four or five guineas, or any ſuch large quantity of money, it might be a different matter.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>They were now ſat down to breakfaſt over ſome toaſt and ale, when the boy returned, and informed them, 'that the gentleman was not at home.' <q>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well!</q> cries Adams; <q>but why, child, did you not ſtay 'till his return?

Therefore go back, child, and tarry 'till his return home.</q> The meſſenger departed, and was back again with great expedition; bringing an account, that the gentleman was gone a long journey, and would not be at home again this month. At theſe words Adams ſeemed greatly confounded, ſaying, <q>This muſt be a ſudden accident, as the ſickneſs or death of a relation, or ſome ſuch unforeſeen misfortune; and then turning to Joſeph, cried, I wiſh you had reminded me to have borrowed this money laſt night.</q> Joſeph ſmiling, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>he was very much deceived, if the gentleman would not have found ſome excuſe to avoid lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. I own,</q> ſays he, <q>I was never much pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his profeſſing ſo much kindneſs for you at firſt ſight: for I have heard the gentlemen of our cloth in London tell many ſuch ſtories of their maſters. But when the boy brought the meſſage back of his not being at home, I preſently knew what would follow; for whenever a man of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not care to fulfil his promiſes, the cuſtom is, to order his ſervants that he will never be at home to the perſon ſo promiſed. In London they call it denying him. I have denyed Sir Thomas Booby above an hundred times; and when the man hath danced attendance for about a month, or ſometimes longer, he is acquainted in the end, that the gentleman is gone out of town, and could do nothing in the buſineſs.</q> 'Good lord!' ſays A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, <q>what wickedneſs is there in the chriſtian world?

                           <q>It is not for me,</q> anſwered Joſeph, <q>to give reaſons for what men do, to a gentleman of your learning.</q> 
                           <q>You ſay right,</q> quoth Adams; <q>knowledge of men is only to be learnt from books; Plato and Seneca for that; and thoſe are authors, I am afraid, child, you never read.</q> 'Not I, Sir, truly,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Joſeph; <q>all I know is, it is a maxim among the gentlemen of our cloth, that thoſe maſters who promiſe the moſt perform the leaſt; and I have often heard them ſay, they have found the largeſt vails in thoſe families where they were not promiſed any. But, Sir, inſtead of conſidering any farther theſe matters, it wou'd be our wiſeſt way to contrive ſome method of getting out of this houſe: for the generous gentleman, inſtead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us any ſervice hath left us the whole reckoning to pay.</q> Adams was going to anſwer, when their hoſt came in, and, with a kind of jeering ſmile, ſaid, <q>Well, maſters! the ſquire hath not ſent his horſes for you yet. Laud help me! how eaſily ſome folks make promiſes! How! ſays Adams, have you ever known him to do any thing of the kind before? Ay marry have I, anſwered the hoſt; it is no buſineſs of mine, you know, Sir, to ſay any thing to a gentleman to his face: but now he is not here, I will aſſure you, he hath not his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low within the three next market towns. I own I could not help laughing, when I heard him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you the living; for thereby hangs a good jeſt. I thought he would have offered you my houſe next; for one is no more his to diſpoſe of than the other.</q> At theſe words, Adams bleſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declared, <q>he had never read of ſuch a monſter;
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:023370_0214_0FBF3442870378A0"/>
but what vexes me moſt,</q> ſays he, <q>is, that he hath decoyed us into running up a long debt with you, which we are not able to pay; for we have no money about us; and, what is worſe, live at ſuch a diſtance, that if you ſhould truſt us, I am afraid you would loſe your money, for want of our finding any conveniency of ſending it.</q> 
                           <q>Truſt you, maſter, ſays the hoſt, that I will with all my heart; I honour the clergy too much to deny truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of them for ſuch a trifle; beſides, I like your fear of never paying me. I have loſt many a debt in my life-time; but was promiſed to be payed them all in a very ſhort time. I will ſcore this reckoning for the novelty of it. It is the firſt I do aſſure you of its kind. But what ſay you, maſter, ſhall we have t'other pot before we part? it will waſte but a little chalk more; and if you never pay me a ſhilling, the loſs will not ruin me.</q> Adams liked the invitation very well; eſpecially as it was delivered with ſo hearty an accent.—He ſhook his hoſt by the hand, and, thanking him, ſaid, <q>he would tarry another pot, rather for the pleaſure of ſuch worthy company, than for the liquor;</q> adding, <q>he was glad to find ſome chriſtians left in the kingdom; for that he almoſt began to ſuſpect that he was ſojourning in a country inhabited only by Jews and Turks.</q>

                        <p>The kind hoſt produced the liquor, and Joſeph with Fanny retired into the garden; where while they ſolaced themſelves with amorous diſcourſe, Adams ſat down with his hoſt; and both filling their glaſſes, and lighting their pipes, they began that dialogue which the reader will find in the next chapter.</p>

                        <p>
                           <q>SIR, ſaid the hoſt, I aſſure you, you are not the firſt to whom our ſquire hath promiſed more than he hath performed. He is ſo famous for this practice, that his word will not be taken for much by thoſe who know him. I remember a young fellow whom he promiſed his parents to make an exciſeman. The poor people, who could ill afford it, bred their ſon to writing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and other learning, to qualify him for the place, and the boy held up his head above his condition with theſe hopes: nor would he go to plough, nor to any other kind of work; and went conſtantly dreſt as fine as could be, with two clean holland ſhirts a week, and this for ſeveral years; 'till at laſt he followed the ſquire up to London, thinking there to mind him of his promiſes: but he could never get ſight of him. So that being out of money and buſineſs, he fell into evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and wicked courſes: and in the end came to a ſentence of tranſportation, the news of which broke the mother's heart. I will tell you another true ſtory of him: There was a neighbour of mine, a farmer, who had two ſons whom he bred up to the buſineſs. Pretty lads they were; nothing would ſerve the ſquire, but that the youngeſt muſt be made a parſon. Upon which, he perſuaded the father to ſend him to ſchool, promiſing, that he would afterwards maintain
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:023370_0216_0FBF34488EE94E78"/>
him at the univerſity; and when he was of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age, give him a living. But after the lad had been ſeven years at ſchool, and his father brought him to the ſquire with a letter from his maſter, that he was fit for the univerſity; the ſquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of minding his promiſe, or ſending him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his expence, only told his father, that the young man was a fine ſcholar; and it was a pity he could not afford to keep him at Oxford for four or five years more, by which time, if he could get him a curacy, he might have him ordained. The farmer ſaid, he was not a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ufficient to do any ſuch thing.</q> 'Why then,' anſwered the ſquire, <q>I am very ſorry you have given him ſo much learning; for if he cannot get his living by that, it will rather ſpoil him for any thing elſe; and your other ſon who can hardly write his name, will do more at ploughing and ſowing, and is in a better condition than he: and indeed ſo it proved; for the poor lad, not finding friends to maintain him in his learning as he had expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and being unwilling to work, fell to drinking, though he was a very ſober lad before; and, in a ſhort time, partly with grief, and partly with good liquor, fell into a conſumption and died. Nay; I can tell you more ſtill: There was another, a young woman, and the handſomeſt in all this neighbourhood, whom he inticed up to London, promiſing to make her a gentlewoman to one of your women of quality: but inſtead of keeping his word, we have ſince heard, after having a child by her himſelf, ſhe became a common whore; then kept a coffee-houſe in Covent-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and a little after died of the French diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a goal. I could tell you many more ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but how do you imagine he ſerved me my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:023370_0217_0FBF344BE4342C58"/>
You muſt know, Sir, I was bred a ſea-far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, and have been many voyages; 'till at laſt I came to be a maſter of a ſhip myſelf, and was in a fair way of making a fortune, when I was attacked by one of thoſe curſed Guarda-Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, who took our ſhips before the beginning of the war; and after a fight, wherein I loſt the greater part of my crew, my rigging being all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, and two ſhots received between wind and water, I was forced to ſtrike. The villains carried off my ſhip, a brigantine of an hundred and fifty tons, a pretty creature ſhe was, and put me, a man and a boy, into a little bad pink, in which, with much ado, we at laſt made Falmouth; tho' I believe the Spaniards did not imagine ſhe could poſſibly live a day at ſea. Upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn hither, where my wife, who was of this country, then lived, the ſquire told me he was ſo pleaſed with the defence I had made againſt the enemy, that he did not fear getting me promoted to a lieutenancy of a man of war, if I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it; which I thankfully aſſured him I would. Well, Sir, two or three years paſs'd, during which I had many repeated promiſes, not only from the ſquire, but (as he told me) from the lords of the admiralty. He never returned from London, but I was aſſured I might be ſatisfied now, for I was certain of the firſt vacancy; and what ſurpriſes me ſtill, when I reflect on it, theſe aſſurances were given me with no leſs confidence, after ſo many diſappointments, than at firſt. At laſt, Sir grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary, and ſomewhat ſuſpicious, after ſo much delay, I wrote to a friend in London, who I knew had ſome acquaintance at the beſt houſe in the admiralty, and deſired him to back the ſquire's intereſt: for indeed, I feared he had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:023370_0218_0FBF344F53AA5CE0"/>
the affair with more coolneſs than he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.—And what anſwer do you think my friend ſent me?—Truly, Sir, he acquainted me, that the ſquire had never mentioned my name at the admiralty in his life; and unleſs I had much faithfuller intereſt, adviſed me to give over my pretenſions, which I immediately did; and, with the concurrence of my wife, reſolved to ſet up an ale-houſe, where you are heartily welcome: and ſo my ſervice to you; and may the ſquire, and all ſuch ſneaking raſcals, go to the devil toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q> 'O fie.' ſays Adams, <q>O fie! He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a wicked man; but G—will, I hope, turn his heart to repentance. Nay if he could but once ſee the meanneſs of this deteſtable vice; would he but once reflect that he is one of the moſt ſcandalous as well as pernicious liars; ſure he muſt deſpiſe himſelf to ſo intolerable a degree, that it would be impoſſible for him to continue a moment in ſuch a courſe. And, to confeſs the truth, notwithſtanding the baſeneſs of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which he hath too well deſerved, he hath in his countenance ſufficient ſymptoms of that <hi>bona indoles,</hi> that ſweetneſs of diſpoſition which furniſhes out a good chriſtian.</q>

                           <q> Pray where's the Levant?</q> quoth Adams, <q>that ſhould be in the Eaſt-Indies by right.</q>—<q>Oho! you are a pretty traveller,</q> cries the hoſt, <q>and not know the Levant. My ſervice to you, maſter; you muſt not talk of theſe things with me! you muſt not tip us the traveller; it won't go here.</q>
                           <q> Since thou art ſo dull to miſunderſtand me ſtill,</q> quoth Adams, <q>I will inform thee; the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I mean, is in books, the only way of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:023370_0220_0FBF3463F22A0A80"/>
by which any knowledge is to be acquired. From them I learn what I aſſerted juſt now, that nature generally imprints ſuch a portraiture of the mind in the countenance, that a ſkilful phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt will rarely be deceived. I preſume you have never read the ſtory of Socrates, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore I will tell it you. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain phyſiognomiſt aſſerted of Socrates that he plainly diſcovered by his features that he was a rogue in his nature. A character ſo contrary to the tenor of all this great man's actions and the generally received opinion concerning him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the boys of Athens, ſo that they threw ſtones at the phyſiognomiſt, and would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed him for his ignorance, had not Socrates himſelf prevented them by confeſſing the truth of his obſervations, and acknowledging, that though he corrected his diſpoſition by philoſophy, he was indeed naturally as inclined to vice as had been predicated of him. Now, pray reſolve me,—How ſhould a man know this ſtory, if he had not read it?</q> 'Well, maſter,' ſaid the hoſt, <q>and what ſignifies it whether a man knows it or no? He who goes abroad as I have done, will always have opportunities enough of knowing the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling his head with Socrates, or any ſuch fellows.</q>—'Friend,' cries Adams, <q>if a man ſhould ſail round the world, and anchor in every harbour of it, without learning, he would return home as ignorant as he went out.</q>
                           <q> Lord help you,</q> anſwered the hoſt, <q>there was my boatſwain, poor fellow he could ſcarce either write or read, and yet he would navigate a ſhip with any maſter of a man of war; and a very pretty knowledge of trade he had too.</q> 'Trade,' anſwered Adams. <q>As Ariſtotle proves in his firſt chapter of politics,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:023370_0221_0FBF346745996150"/>
is below a philoſopher, and unnatural as it is mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged now,</q> The hoſt look'd ſtedfaſtly at Adams, and after a minute's ſilence aſked him, <q>if he was one of the writers of the Gazetteers? for I have heard, ſays he, they are writ by parſons.</q> 'Gazetteers!' ſaid Adams 'What is that?' 'It is a dirty news-paper,' repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hoſt, <q>which hath been given away all over the nation for theſe many years, to abuſe trade and honeſt men, which I would not ſuffer to lye on my table, though it hath been offered me for nothing.</q> 'Not I truly,' ſaid Adams, <q>I never write any thing but ſermons; and I aſſure you I am no enemy to trade, whilſt it is conſiſtent with honeſty; nay, I have always looked on the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as a very valuable member of ſociety, and perhaps, inferior to none but the man of learning.</q> 'No, I believe he is not, nor to him neither,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the hoſt. <q>Of what elſe would learning be in a country without trade! What would all you parſons do to clothe your backs and feed your bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies? Who fetches you your ſilks, and your linens, and your wines, and all the other neceſſaries of life; I ſpeak chiefly with regard to the ſailors.</q>
                           <q> You ſhould ſay the extravagancies of life,</q> replied the parſon; <q>but admit they were the neceſſaries, there is ſomething more neceſſary than life itſelf, which is provided by learning; I mean the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the clergy. Who clothes you with piety, meekneſs, humility, charity, patience, and all the other chriſtian virtues? Who feeds your ſouls with the milk of brotherly love, and diets them with all the dainty food of holineſs, which at once cleanſes them of all impure carnal affections, and fattens them with the truly rich Spirit of grace?—Who doth this?</q> 'Ay, who indeed!' cries the hoſt; <q>for I do not remember ever to have ſeen
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:023370_0222_0FBF34681C664380"/>
any ſuch clothing, or ſuch feeding. And ſo in the mean time, maſter, my ſervice to you.</q> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams was going to anſwer with ſome ſeverity, when Joſeph and Fanny returned, and preſſed his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo eagerly, that he would not refuſe them; and ſo, graſping his crabſtick, he took leave of his hoſt, (neither of them being ſo well pleaſed with each other as they had been at their firſt ſitting down together) and with Joſeph and Fanny, who both expreſſed much impatience, departed, and now all together renewed their journey.</p>

Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will not write, Sir, they will not write without the expectation of fame or profit, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, both.

A farce writer hath indeed ſome chance for ſucceſs; but they have loſt all taſte for the ſublime. Though I believe one reaſon of their depravity is the badneſs of the actors.

am ſurprized you grow ſo warm; you cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine yourſelf intereſted in this diſpute; I hope you have a better opinion of my taſte, than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend I ſquinted at yourſelf. No, Sir, if we had ſix ſuch actors as you, we ſhould ſoon rival the Bettertons and Sandfords of former times; for, without a compliment to you, I think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any one to have excelled you in moſt of your parts. Nay, it is a ſolemn truth, and I have heard many, and all great judges, expreſs as much; and you will pardon me if I tell you, I think every time I have ſeen you lately, you have conſtantly acquired ſome new excellence, like a ſnowball. You have deceived me in my eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfection, and have outdone what I thought inimitable.</q> 'You are as little intereſted,' anſwered the player, <q>in what I have ſaid of other poets; for d—n me if there are not many ſtrokes, ay, whole ſcenes, in your laſt tragedy, which at leaſt equal Shakeſpear. There is a delicacy of ſentiment a dignity of expreſſion in it, which I will own many of our gentlemen did not do adequate juſtice to. To confeſs the truth, they are bad enough, and I pity an author who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the murder of his works.—</q>
                           <q>Nay it is but ſeldom that it can happen,</q> returned the poet, <q>the works of moſt modern authors, like dead-born children, cannot be murdered. It is ſuch wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed half-begotten, half-wit, lifeleſs, ſpiritleſs, low, groveling ſtuff, that I almoſt pity the actor who is obliged to get it by heart, which muſt be almoſt as difficult to remember as words in a language you do not underſtand.</q> 'I am ſure,' ſaid the player, <q>if the ſentences have little meaning when they are writ, when they are ſpoken they have leſs. I know ſcarce one who ever lays an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis

right, and much leſs adapts his action to his character. I have ſeen a tender lover in an attitude of fighting with his miſtreſs, and a brave hero ſuing to his enemy with his ſword in his hand—I don't care to abuſe my profeſſion, but rot me if in my heart I am not inclined to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's ſide.</q> 'It is rather generous in you than juſt,' ſaid the poet; <q>and though I hate to ſpeak ill of any perſon's production; nay, I never do it, nor will—but yet, to do juſtice to the actors, what could Booth or Betterton have made of ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtuff as Fenton's Mariaamne, Frowd's Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, or Mallet's Eurydice, or thoſe low, dirty, laſt dying ſpeeches, which a fellow in the city of Wapping, your Dillo, or Lillo, what was his name, called Tragedies?</q>—'Very well,' ſays the player, <q>and pray what do you think of ſuch fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as Quin and Delane, or that face-making puppy young Cibber, that ill-look'd dog Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, or that ſaucy ſlut Mrs. Clive?

much, ay infinitely, the majority, all the boxes in particular, were deſirous of it; nay, moſt of the ladies ſwore they never would come to the houſe till it was acted again.—Indeed I muſt own their policy was good, in not letting it be given out a ſecond time; for the raſcals knew, if it had gone a ſecond night, it would have run fifty: for if ever there was diſtreſs in a tragedy—I am not fond of my own performance; but if I ſhould tell you what the beſt judges ſaid of it—Nor was it entirely owing to my enemies neither, that it did not ſucceed on the ſtage, as well as it hath ſince among the polite readers; for you can't ſay it had juſtice done it by the performers,</q>—<q>I think,</q> anſwered the player, <q>the performers did the diſtreſs of it juſtice: for I am ſure we were in diſtreſs enough, who were pelted with oranges all the laſt act; we all imagined it would have been the laſt act of our lives.</q>

                        </argument>
                        <p>JOSEPH no ſooner came perfectly to himſelf, than perceiving his miſtreſs gone, he bewailed her loſs with groans, which would have pierced any heart but thoſe which are poſſeſſed by ſome people, and are made of a certain compoſition, not unlike flint in its hardneſs, and other properties; for you may ſtrike fire from them, which will dart through the eyes, but they can never diſtil one drop of water the ſame way. His own, poor youth was of a ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er compoſition: and, at thoſe words, O my dear Fanny! O my love! ſhall I never, never ſee thee more? his eyes overflowed with tears, which would have become any thing but a hero. In a word, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair was more eaſy to be conceived than related—</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adams, after many groans, ſitting with his back to Joſeph, began thus in a ſorrowful tone: <q>You cannot imagine, my good child, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely blame theſe firſt agonies of your grief; for when misfortunes attack us by ſurprize, it muſt require infinitely more learning than you are maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of to reſiſt them: but it is the buſineſs of a man and a chriſtian, to ſummon reaſon as quickly as he can to his aid; and ſhe will preſently teach him patience and ſubmiſſion. Be comforted, therefore, child, I ſay be comforted. It is true you have loſt the prettieſt, kindeſt, lovelieſt, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt young woman, one with whom you might have expected to have lived in happineſs, virtue and innocence. By whom you might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed

yourſelf many little darlings, who would have been the delight of your youth, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your age. You have not only loſt her, but have reaſon to fear the utmoſt violence which luſt and power can inflict upon her. Now indeed you may eaſily raiſe ideas of horror which might drive you to deſpair.</q>—'O I ſhall run mad,' cries Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph. <q>O that I could but command my hands to tear my eyes out, and my fleſh off.</q>—<q>If you would uſe them to ſuch purpoſes, I am glad you can't,</q> anſwered Adams. <q>I have ſtated your misfortune as ſtrong as I poſſibly can; but, on the other ſide, you are to conſider you are a chriſtian; that no accident happens to us without the divine permiſſion, and that it is the duty of a man and a chriſtian to ſubmit. We did not make ourſelves; but the ſame power which made us, rules over us, and we are abſolutely at his diſpoſal; he may do with us what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> pleaſes, nor have we any right to complain. A ſecond reaſon againſt our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is our ignorance: for as we know not fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events, ſo neither can we tell to what purpoſe any accident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

I ſhould have ſaid indeed our ignorance is twofold (but I have not at preſent time to divide properly) for as we know not to what purpoſe any event is ultimately directed; ſo neither can we affirm from what cauſe it originally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You are a man, and conſequently a ſinner; and this may be a puniſhment to you for your ſins; indeed in this ſenſe it may be eſteemed as a good, yea, as the greateſt good, which ſatisfies the anger of heaven, and averts that wrath which cannot continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our deſtruction. Thirdly, our impotency of relieving ourſelves, demonſtrates the folly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:023370_0324_0FBF65844356C068"/>
of our complaints: for whom do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? Or againſt whom do we complain, but a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from whoſe ſhafts no armour can guard us, no ſpeed can fly? A power which leaves us no hope but in ſubmiſſion.</q>—'O Sir,' cries Joſeph, <q>all this is very true, and very fine, and I could hear you all day, if I was not ſo grieved at heart as now I am.</q> 'Would you take phyſic,' ſays Adams, <q>when you are well, and refuſe it when you are ſick? Is not comfort to be adminiſtred to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and not to thoſe who rejoice, or thoſe who are at eaſe?</q>—<q>O you have not ſpoken one word of comfort to me yet,</q> returned Joſeph. 'No!' cries Adams, <q>What am I then doing? what can I ſay to comfort you?—'O tell me,' cries Joſeph, that Fanny will eſcape back to my arms, that they ſhall again incloſe that lovely creature, with all her ſweetneſs, all her untainted innocence about her.</q>—'Why, perhaps you may,' cries Adams; <q>but I can't promiſe you wha't to come. You muſt with perfect reſignation wait the event; if ſhe be reſtored to you again, it is your duty to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo it is if ſhe be not: Joſeph, if you are wiſe, and truly know your own intereſt, you will peaceably and quietly ſubmit to all the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Providence, being thoroughly aſſured, that all the misfortunes, how great ſoever, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the righteous, happen to them for their own good.—Nay it is not your intereſt only, but your duty to abſtain from immoderate grief; which, if you indulge, you are not worthy the name of a chriſtian.</q>—He ſpoke theſe laſt words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſignifies knowing your duty, if you do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it?</q> anſwered Adams. <q>Your knowledge increaſes your guilt—O Joſeph, I never thought you had this ſtubborneſs in your mind.</q> Joſeph replied, <q>he fancied he miſunderſtood him, which I aſſure you,</q> ſays he, <q>you do, if you imagine I endeavour to grieve; upon my ſoul I don't.</q> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams rebuked him for ſwearing, and then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enlarge on the folly of grief, telling him all the wiſe men and philoſophers, even among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, had written againſt it, quoting ſeveral paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from Seneca, and the Conſolation, which tho' it was not Cicero's was he ſaid, as good almoſt as any of his works, and concluded all by hinting, that immoderate grief in this caſe might incenſe that power which alone could reſtore him his Fanny. This reaſon, or indeed rather the idea which it raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the reſtoration of his miſtreſs, had more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than all which the perſon had ſaid before, and for a moment abated his agonies: but when his fears ſufficiently ſet before his eyes the danger that poor creature was in, his grief returned again with repeated violence, nor could Adams in the leaſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

was all bloody from his encounter at the inn, to be conveyed as a priſoner behind the chariot, and very gallantry took Fanny into it; for, to ſay he truth, this gentleman (who was no other than the celebrated Mr. Peter Pounce, and who preceded the lady Booby only a few miles, by ſetting out earlier in the morning) was a very gallant perſon, and loved a pretty girl better than any thing, beſides his own money, or the money of other people.</p>

                        <p>Peter being informed by Fanny of the preſence of Adams, ſtopt to ſee him, and receive his homage; for, as Peter was an hypocrite, a ſort of people whom Mr. Adams never ſaw through, the one paid that reſpect to his ſeeming goodneſs which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believed to be paid to his riches; hence Mr. Adams was ſo much his favourite, that he once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

would have made no uſe of, tho' the money had not been (as it was) paid exactly at the time.</p>
                        <p>It is not perhaps eaſy to deſcribe the figure of Adams; he had riſen in ſuch a hurry, that he had on neither breeches, garters, nor ſtockings; nor had he taken from his head a red ſpotted handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which by night bound his wig turned inſide out, around his head. He had on his torn caſſock, and his great coat; but as the remainder of his caſſock hung down below his great coat; ſo did a ſmall ſtripe of white, or rather whitiſh linen, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear below that; to which we may add the ſeveral colours which appeared on his face, where a long piſs-burnt beard ſerved to retain the liquor of the ſtone-pot, and that of a blacker hue which diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the mop.—This figure which Fanny had delivered from his captivity, was no ſooner ſpied by Peter, than it diſordered the compoſed gravity of his muſcles; however he adviſed him immediatel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> to make himſelf clean, nor would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his homage in that pickle.</p>
                        <p>The poet and player no ſooner ſaw the captain in captivity, than they began to conſider of their own ſafety, of which flight preſented itſelf as the only means; they therefore both of them mounted the poet's horſe, and made the moſt expeditious retreat in their power.</p>
                        <p>The hoſt, who well knew Mr. Pounce, and lady Booby's livery, was not a little ſurprized at this change of the ſcene, nor was his confuſion much helped by his wife, who was now juſt riſen, and having heard from him the account of what had paſt, comforted him with a decent number of fools and blockheads; aſked him why he did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023370_0331_0FBF659AA933C290"/>
the nonſenſical dictates of his own numſcull, till ſhe and her family were ruined.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph being informed of the captain's arrival, and ſeeing his Fanny now in ſafety, quitted her a moment, and running down ſtairs, went directly to him, and, ſtripping off his coat, challenged him to fight; but the captain refuſed, ſaying, he did not underſtand boxing. He then graſped a cudgel in one hand, and catching the captain by the collar in the other, gave him a moſt ſevere drubbing, and ended with telling him, he had now had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for what his dear Fanny had ſuffered.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. Pounce had a little regaled himſelf with ſome proviſion which he had in his chariot, and Mr. Adams had put on the beſt appearance his clothes would allow him, Pounce ordered the captain into his preſence; for he ſaid he was guilty of felony, and the next juſtice of peace ſhould commit him: but the ſervants (whoſe appetite for revenge is ſoon ſatisfied) being ſufficiently content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the drubbing which Joſeph had inflicted on him, and which was indeed of no very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate kind, had ſuffered him to go off, which he did, threatening a ſevere revenge againſt Joſeph, which I have never heard he thought proper to take.</p>
                        <p>The miſtreſs of the houſe made her voluntary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before Mr. Pounce, and with a thouſand curtſies told him. <q>ſhe hoped his honour would pardon her huſband, who was a very nonſenſe man, for the ſake of his poor family; that indeed if he could be ruined alone, ſhe ſhould be very willing of it; for becauſe as why, his worſhip ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knew he deſerved it: but ſhe had three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:023370_0332_0FBF659C2CFFED90"/>
was a poor weak woman, continually a breeding, and had no time to work for them. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hoped his honour would take it into his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's conſideration, and forgive her huſband this time; for ſhe was ſure he never intended, any harm to man, woman, or child; and if it was not for that block-head of his own, the man in ſome things was well enough; for ſhe had had three children by him in leſs than three years, and was almoſt ready to cry out the fourth time.</q> She would have proceeded in this manner much longer, had not Peter ſtopt her tongue, by telling her he had nothing to ſay to her huſband, nor her neither. So, as Adams and the reſt had aſſured her of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe cried and curtſied out of the room.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pounce was deſirous that Fanny ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue her journey with him in the chariot; but ſhe abſolutely refuſed, ſaying ſhe would ride behind Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, on a horſe which one of lady Booby's ſervants had equipped him with. But alas! when the horſe appeared, it was found to be no other than that iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical beaſt which Mr. Adams had left behind him at the inn, and which theſe honeſt fellows, who knew him, had redeemed. Indeed whatever horſe they had provided for Joſeph, they would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to mount none, no not even to ride before his beloved Fanny, till the perſon was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; much leſs would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Adams was very deſirous that Joſeph and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023370_0333_0FBF65A2E5D0B1D0"/>
eaſily walk home. 'If I walked alone,' ſays he, <q>I would wage a ſhilling, that the Pedeſtrian out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped the Equeſtrian travellers: but as I intend to take the company of a pipe, peradventure I may be an hour later.</q> One of the ſervants whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Joſeph to take him at his word, and ſuffer the old put to walk if he would: This propoſal was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with an angry look and a peremptory refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal by Joſeph, who catching Fanny up in his arms, aver'd he would rather carry her home in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than take away Mr. Adams's horſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to walk on foot.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, reader, thou haſt ſeen a conteſt between two gentlemen, or two ladies quickly decided, tho' they have both aſſerted they would not eat ſuch a nice morſel, and each inſiſted on the other's accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; but in reality both were deſirous to ſwallow it themſelves. Do not therefore conclude hence, that this diſpute would have come to a ſpeedy deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for here both parties were heartily in earneſt, and it is very probable, they would have remained in the inn-yard to this day, had not the good Peter Pounce put a ſtop to it; for finding he had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hopes of ſatisfying his old appetite with Fanny, and being deſirous of having ſome one to whom he might communicate his grandeur, he told the perſon he would convey him home in his chariot. This favour was by Adams, with many bows and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements accepted, tho' he afterwards ſaid, <q>he aſcended the chariot rather that he might not offend, than from any deſire of riding in it, for that in his heart he preferred the Pedeſtrian even to the Vehicular expedition.</q> All matters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

ſeated herſelf thereon, and had laid hóld of the gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle which her lover wore for that purpoſe, when the wiſe beaſt, who concluded that one at a time was ſufficient, that two to one were odds, &amp;c. diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much uneaſineſs at his double load, and began to conſider his hinder as his forelegs, moving the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary way to that which is called forwards. Nor could Joſeph, with all his horſemanſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to advance; but without having any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the lovely part of the lovely girl which was on his back, he uſed ſuch agitations, that had not one of the men come immediately to her aſſiſtance, ſhe had, in plain Engliſh, tumbled backwards on the ground.

Indeed had you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited an eſtate like Sir Thomas Booby, which had deſcended in your family for many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they might have had a colour for their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> 'Why, what do they ſay I am worth?' cries Peter, with a malicious ſneer. <q>Sir, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Adams, I have heard ſome aver you are not worth leſs than twenty thouſand pounds.</q> At which Peter frowned. 'Nay, Sir,' ſaid Adams, <q>you aſk me only the opinion of others; for my own part, I have always denied it, nor did I ever believe you could poſſibly be worth half that ſum.</q> 'However, Mr. Adams,' ſaid he, ſqueezing him by the hand. <q>I would not ſell them all I am worth for double that ſum; and as to what you believe, or they believe, I care not a fig, no not a fart. I am not poor, becauſe you think me ſo, nor becauſe you attempr to undervalue me in the country. I know the envy of mankind very well; but I thank heaven I am above them: It is true, my wealth is of my own acquiſition. I have not an eſtate like Sir Thomas Booby, that has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in my family through many generations; but I know heirs of ſuch eſtates who are forced to travel about the country like ſome people in torn caſſocks, and might be glad to accept of a pitiful curacy for what I know.

She had in her ſurprize al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtopt her coach; but recollected herſelf timely enough to prevent it.

whoſe inhabitants ſuch a family finds a conſtant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and ſupply; and with the offals of whoſe table the infirm, aged, and infant poor, are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly fed, with a generoſity which hath ſcarce a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effect on their benefactor's pockets?</p>
                        <p>But if their intereſt inſpired ſo public a joy into every countenance, how much more forcibly did the affection which they bore perſon Adams operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all who beheld his return? they flocked about him like dutiful children and an indulgent parent, and vied with each other in demonſtrations of duty and love. The perſon on his ſide ſhook every one by the hand, enquired heartily after the healths of all that were abſent, of their children and relations, and expreſs'd a ſatisfaction in his face, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but benevolence made happy by its objects could infuſe.</p>
                        <p>Nor did Joſeph and Fanny want a hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come from all who ſaw them. In ſhort, no three perſons could be more kindly received, as indeed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Adams carried his fellow-travellers home to his houſe where he inſiſted on their partaking whatever his wife, whom with his children, he found in health and joy, could provide; where we ſhall leave them enjoying perfect happineſs over a home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meal, to view ſcenes of greater ſplendor, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely leſs bliſs.</p>

The removal of the object ſoon cooled her rage, but it had a different effect on her love; that departed

with his perſon; but this remained lurking in her mind with his image. Reſtleſs, interrupted ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and confuſed horrible dreams were her porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt night. In the morning, fancy painted her a more delicious; but to delude, not delight her; for before ſhe could reach the promiſed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, it vaniſhed, and left her to curſe, not bleſs the viſion.</p>
                        <p>She ſtarted from her ſleep, her imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all on fire with the phantom, when her eyes accidentally glancing towards the ſpot where yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday the real Joſeph had ſtood, that little circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance raiſed his idea in the livelieſt colours in her memory. Each look, each word, each geſture ruſhed back on her mind with charms which all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Now ſhe imputed that to his youth, his folly, his awe, his religion, to every thing, but what would inſtantly have produced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, want of paſſion for the ſex: or, that which would have rouſed her hatred, want of liking to her.</p>
                        <p>Reflection then hurried her farther, and told her, ſhe muſt ſee this beautiful youth no more: nay, ſuggeſted to her, that ſhe herſelf had diſmiſſed him for no other fault, than probably that of too violent an awe and reſpect for herſelf: and which ſhe ought rather to have eſteemed a merit, the effects of which were beſides ſo eaſily and ſurely to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; ſhe then blamed, ſhe curſed the haſty raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her temper; her fury was vented all on her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Joſeph appeared innocent in her eyes. Her paſſion at length grew ſo violent, that it forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her on ſeeking relief, and now ſhe thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling him; but pride forbad that; pride which ſoon drove all ſofter paſſions from her ſoul, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to her the meanneſs of him ſhe was fond

of. That thought ſoon began to obſcure his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; contempt ſucceeded next, and then diſdain, which preſently introduced her hatred of the creature who had given her ſo much uneaſineſs. Theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of Joſeph had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of her mind, than they inſinuated to her a thouſand things in his disfavour; every thing but diſlike of her perſon; a thought, which, as it would have been intolerable to bear, ſhe checked the moment it endeavoured to ariſe. Revenge came now to her aſſiſtance; and ſhe conſidered her diſmiſſion of him ſtript, and without a character, with the utmoſt pleaſure. She rioted in the ſeveral kinds of miſery, which her imagination ſuggeſted to her might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Mrs. Slipſlop being ſummoned, attended her miſtreſs, who had now in her own opinion totally ſubdued this paſſion. Whilſt ſhe was dreſſing, ſhe aſked if that fellow had been turned away ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to her orders. Slipſlop anſwered, ſhe had told her ladyſhip ſo, (as indeed ſhe had) —'And how did he behave?' replied the lady. 'Truly, Madam,' cries Slipſlop, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as infected every body who ſaw him. The poor lad had but little wages to receive: for he conſtantly allowed his father and mother half his income; ſo that when your ladyſhip's livery was ſtript off, he had not wherewithal to buy a coat, and muſt have gone naked, if one of the footmen had not incommodated him with one, and whilſt he was ſtanding in his ſhirt, (and to ſay the truth he was an amorous figure) being told your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would not give him a character, he ſighed and ſaid, he had done nothing willingly to offend;

that for his part he ſhould always give your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a good character wherever he went; and he prayed God to bleſs you: for you was the beſt of ladies, though his enemies had ſet you againſt him; I wiſh you had not turned him away; for I believe you had not a faithfuller ſervant in the houſe.—'How came you then,' replied the lady, 'to adviſe me to turn him away?' 'I, Madam!' ſaid Slipſlop, <q>I am ſure you will do me the juſtice to ſay, I did all in my power to prevent it; but I ſaw your ladyſhip was angry; and it is not the buſineſs of us upper servants to hinterfear on thoſe occaſions.—And was it not you, audacious wretch, cried the lady, who made me angry?

found good reaſon to doubt whether ſhe had ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conquered her paſſion, as ſhe had flattered herſelf; and, in order to accompliſh it quite, took a reſolution more common than wiſe, to retire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into the country. The reader hath long ago ſeen the arrival of Mrs. Slipſlop, whom no pertneſs could make her miſtreſs reſolve to part with; lately, that of Mr. Pounce, her forerunners; and laſtly, that of the lady herſelf.</p>
                        <p>The morning after her arrival, being Sunday, ſhe went to church, to the great ſurprize of every body, who wondered to ſee her ladyſhip, being no very conſtant church woman, there ſo ſuddenly upon her journey. Joſeph was likewiſe there; and I have heard it was remarked, that ſhe fixed her eyes on him much more than on the parſon; but this I believe to be only a malicious rumour. When the prayers were ended, Mr. Adams ſtood up, and with a loud voice pronounced: I publiſh the banns of marriage between Joſeph Andrews and Frances Goodwill, both of this pariſh, &amp;c. Whether this had any effect on lady Booby or no, who was then in her pew, which the congregation could not ſee into, I could never diſcover: but certain it is, that in about a quarter of an hour ſhe ſtood up, and directed her eyes to that part of the church were the women ſat, and perſiſted in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way during the remainder of the ſermon, in ſo ſcrutinizing a manner, and with ſo angry a countenance, that moſt of the women were afraid ſhe was offended at them.</p>
                        <p>The moment ſhe returned home, ſhe ſent for Slipſlop into her chamber, and told her, ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what that impudent fellow Joſeph did in that pariſh. Upon which Slipſlop gave her an account of her meeting Adams with him on the

my cure. As for the young woman, I aſſure your ladyſhip I have as good an opinion of her as your ladyſhip yourſelf, or any other can have. She is the ſweeteſt-tempered, honeſteſt, worthieſt, young creature; indeed, as to her beauty, I do not commend her on that account, though all men allow ſhe is the handſomeſt woman, gentle, or ſimple, that ever appeared in the pariſh.</q> 'You are very impertinent,' ſays ſhe, <q>to talk ſuch fulſome ſtuff to me. It is mighty becoming tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a clergyman to trouble himſelf about hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome women, and you are a delicate judge of beauty, no doubt.

                        </argument>
                        <p>IN the afternoon the lady ſent for Mr. Scout, whom ſhe attacked moſt violently for intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with her ſervants: which he denied, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with truth; for he had only aſſerted accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perhaps rightly, that a year's ſervice gained a ſettlement; and ſo far he owned he might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023370_0348_0FBF65CF4F9A9930"/>
informed the parſon, and believed it was law. 'I am reſolved,' ſaid the lady, <q>to have no diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſervants of mine ſettled here: and ſo, if this be your law, I ſhall ſend to another lawyer.</q> Scout ſaid, <q>if ſhe ſent to a hundred lawyers, not one or all of them could alter the law. The utmoſt that was in the power of a lawyer, was to prevent the law's taking effect; and that he himſelf could do for her ladyſhip as well as any other: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſays he, Madam, your ladyſhip not being converſant in theſe matters, hath miſtaken a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: for I aſſerted only, that a man who ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a year was ſettled. Now there is a material difference between being ſettled in law and ſettled in fact; and as I affirmed generally, he was ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and law is preferable to fact, my ſettlement muſt be underſtood in law, and not in fact. And ſuppoſe, madam, we admit he was ſettled in law, what uſe will they make of it? how doth that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to fact? He is not ſettled in fact; and if he be not ſettled in fact, he is not an inhabitant; and if he is not an inhabitant, he is not of this pariſh; and then undoubtedly he ought not to be publiſhed here; for Mr. Adams hath told me your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's pleaſure, and the reaſon, which is a very good one, to prevent burdening us with the poor; we have too many already: and I think we ought to have an act to hang or tranſport half of them. If we can prove in evidence, that he is not ſettled in fact, it is another matter. What I ſaid to Mr. Adams, was on a ſuppoſition that he was ſettled in fact; and indeed if that was the caſe, I ſhould doubt</q>—'Don't tell me your facts and your ifs,' ſaid the lady, <q>I don't underſtand your gibberiſh: you take too much upon you, and are very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in pretending to direct in this pariſh, and
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:023370_0349_0FBF65D103D37A18"/>
you ſhall be taught better, I aſſure you, you ſhall. But as to the wench, I am reſolved ſhe ſhall not ſettle here; I will not ſuffer ſuch beauties as theſe to produce children for us to keep.</q>—<q>Beauties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! your ladyſhip is pleaſed to be merry,</q>—an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Scout.—<q>Mr. Adams deſcribed her ſo to me,</q> ſaid the lady.—<q>Pray what ſort of a dowdy is it, Mr. Scout?</q>—<q>The uglieſt creature almoſt I ever beheld, a poor dirty drab, your ladyſhip ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw ſuch a wretch.</q>—<q>Well, but dear Mr. Scout, let her be what ſhe will,—theſe ugly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will bring children you know; ſo that we muſt prevent the marriage,</q>—'True, Madam,' replied Scout, <q>for the ſubſequent marriage, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with the law, will carry law into fact.—When a man is married, he is ſettled in fact; and then he is not removeable. I will ſee Mr. Adams, and I make no doubt of prevailing with him. His only objection is, doubtleſs, that he ſhall loſe his fee; but that being once made eaſy, as it ſhall be, I am confident no farther objection will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. No, no, it is impoſſible; but your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can't diſcommend his unwillingneſs to depart from his fee. Every man ought to have a proper value for his fee. As to the matter in queſtion, if your ladyſhip pleaſes to employ me in it, I will venture to promiſe you ſucceſs. The laws of this land are not ſo vulgar, to permit a mean fellow to contend with one of your ladyſhip's fortune. We have one ſure card, which is to carry him before juſtice Frolic, who, upon hearing your ladyſhip's name, will commit him without any farther queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As for the dirty ſlut, we ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with her; for if we get rid of the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the ugly jade will</q>—<q>Take what meaſures you pleaſe, good Mr. Scout, </q>anſwered the lady,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:023370_0350_0FBF65D4E4F11B88"/>
                           <q>but I wiſh you could rid the pariſh of both; for Slipſlop tells me ſuch ſtories of this wench, that I abhor the thoughts of her; and though you ſay ſhe is ſuch an ugly ſlut, yet you know, dear Mr. Scout, theſe forward creatures who run after men, will always find ſome as forward as themſelves: ſo that to prevent the increaſe of beggars, we muſt get rid of her.</q>—<q>Your ladyſhip is very much in the right,</q> anſwered Scout, <q>but I am afraid the law is a little deficient in giving us any ſuch power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; however, the juſtice will ſtretch it as far as he is able, to oblige your ladyſhip. To ſay the truth, it is a great bleſſing to the country that he is in the commiſſion; for he hath taken ſeveral poor off our hands that the law would never lay hold on. I know ſome juſtices who make as much of committing a man to Bridewell, as his lordſhip at ſize would of hanging him; but it would do a man good to ſee his worſhip our juſtice, commit a fellow to Bridewell: he takes ſo much pleaſure in it: and when once we ha' um there; we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hear any more o'um. He's either ſtarved or eat up by vermin in a month's time.</q>—Here she arrival of a viſitor put an end to the converſation, and Mr. Scout having undertaken the cauſe, and promiſed it ſucceſs, departed.</p>
                        <p>This Scout was one of thoſe fellows who; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledge of the law, or being bred to it, take upon them, in defiance of an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to act as lawyers in the country, and are called ſo. They are the peſts of ſociety, and a ſcandal to a profeſſion to which indeed they do not belong; and which owes to ſuch kind of raſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions the ill-will which weak perſons bear towards it. With this fellow, to whom a little before ſhe would not have condeſcended to have ſpoken, did

She loved, hated, pitied, ſcorned; admired, deſpiſed the ſame perſon by fits, which changed in a very ſhort interval. On Tueſday morning, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be a holiday, ſhe went to church, where, to her ſurprize, Mr. Adams publiſhed the banns again, with as audible a voice as before. It was lucky for her, that as there was no ſermon, ſhe had immediate opportunity of returning home to vent her rage, which ſhe could not have concealed from the congregation five minutes; indeed it wad not then very numerous, the aſſembly conſiſting of no more than Adams, his clerk, his wife, the lady, and one of her ſervants. At her return ſhe met Slipſlop, who accoſted her in theſe words.—<q>O meam, what doth your ladyſhip think? To be ſure lawyer Scout hath carried Joſeph and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023370_0352_0FBF65DBE2D13158"/>
both before the juſtice. All the pariſh are in tears, and ſay they will certainly be hanged: for no body knows what it is for.</q>—<q>I ſuppoſe they deſerve it,</q> ſays the lady. <q>Why doſt thou men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch wretches to me?</q> 
                           <q>O dear Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Slipſlop, is it not a pity ſuch a graceleſs young man ſhould die a virulent death? I hope the judge will take commenſuration on his youth. As for Fanny, I don't think it ſignifies much what becomes of her; and if poor Joſeph hath done any thing, I could venture to ſwear ſhe traduced him to it: Few men ever come to fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant puniſhment, but by thoſe naſty creatures who are a ſcandal to our ſect.</q> The lady was no more pleaſed at this news, after a moment's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, than Slipſlop herſelf: for though ſhe wiſhed Fanny far enough, ſhe did not deſire the removal of Joſeph, eſpecially with her. She was puzzled how to act or what to ſay on this occaſion, when a coach and ſix drove into the court, and a ſervant acquainted her with the arrival of her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew Booby and his lady. She ordered them to be conducted into a drawing-room, whither ſhe preſently repaired, having compoſed her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as well as ſhe could; and being a little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that the wedding would by theſe means be at leaſt interrupted, and that ſhe ſhould have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to execute any reſolution ſhe might take, for which ſhe ſaw herſelf provided with an excellent inſtrument in Scout.</p>
                        <p>The lady Booby apprehended her ſervant had made a miſtake, when he mentioned Mr. Booby's lady; for ſhe had never heard of his marriage; but how great was her ſurpriſe, when at her entering the room, her nephew preſented his wife to her, ſaying, 'Madam, this is that charming Pamela, of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:023370_0353_0FBF65DE5BE0DB28"/>
'whom I am convinced you have heard ſo much.' The lady received her with more civility than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; indeed with the utmoſt; for ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly polite, nor had any vice inconſiſtent with good-breeding. They paſſed ſome little time in ordinary diſcourſe, when a ſervant came and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Mr. Booby, who preſently told the ladies he muſt deſert them a little on ſome buſineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; and as their diſcourſe during his abſence would afford little improvement or entertainment to the reader, we will leave them for a while to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Mr. Booby.</p>

                        <p>THE young ſquire and his lady were no ſooner alighted from their coach, than the ſervants began to enquire after Mr. Joſeph, from whom they ſaid their lady had not heard a word, to her great ſurpriſe, ſince he had left lady Booby's. Upon this they were inſtantly informed of what had lately happened, with which they haſtily acquainted their maſter, who took an immediate reſolution to go himſelf and endeavor to reſtore his Pamela her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before ſhe even knew ſhe had loſt him.</p>
                        <p>The juſtice before whom the criminals were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and who lived within a ſhort mile of the lady's houſe, was luckily Mr. Booby's acquaintance, by his having an eſtate in his neighbourhood. Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore his horſes to his coach, he ſet out for me judgment-ſeat, and arrived when the juſtice had almoſt finiſhed his buſineſs. He was conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023370_0354_0FBF65E09C19DCE8"/>
a hall, where he was acquainted that his worſhip would wait on him in a moment; for he had only a man and a woman to commit to Bridewell firſt. As he was now convinced he had not a minute to loſe, he inſiſted on the ſervant's introducing him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into the room where the juſtice was then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting his office, as he called it. Being brought thither, and the firſt compliments being paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſquire and his worſhip, the former aſked the latter, what crime thoſe two young people had been guilty of? 'No great crime,' anſwered the juſtice. <q>I have only ordered them to Bridewell for a month.</q> 'But what is their crime?' repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſquire. 'Larceny, an't pleaſe your houour,' ſays Scout. 'Ay,' ſays the juſtice, <q>a kind of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonious larcenous thing. I believe I muſt order them a little correction too, a little ſtripping and whipping.</q> (Poor Fanny, who had hitherto ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported all with the thoughts of Joſeph's company, trembled at that ſound; but indeed without reaſon, for none but the devil himſelf would have executed ſuch a ſentence on her.) 'Still,' ſaid, the ſquire, 'I am ignorant of the crime, the fact I mean' 'Why, there it is in paper,' anſwered the juſtice, ſhewing him a depoſition, which in the abſence of his clerk, he had writ himſelf, of which we have with great difficulty procured an authentic copy: and here it follows <hi>verbatim &amp; literatim.</hi>

then ordered to drive to lady Booby's.—It had moved a few yards only, when the ſquire aſked Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph if he knew who that man was croſſing the field; for, added he, I never ſaw one take ſuch ſtrides before. Joſeph anſwered eagerly, <q>O Sir, it is parſon Adams.</q>—<q>O la, indeed, and ſo it is, ſaid Fanny; poor man, he is coming to do what he could for us. Well, he is the worthieſt beſt-natured creature,</q>—'Ay,' ſaid Joſeph, <q>God bleſs him; for there is not ſuch another in the univerſe.</q>—'The beſt creature living ſure,' cries Fanny. 'Is he?' ſays the ſquire, <q>then I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have the beſt creature living in my coach:</q> and ſo ſaying he ordered it to ſtop, whilſt Joſeph, at his requeſt, hallooed to the parſon, who well knowing his voice, made all the haſte imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſoon came up with them. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the maſter, who could ſcarce refrain from laughter at his figure, to mount into the coach, which he with many thanks refuſed, ſaying he could walk by his ſide, and he'd warrant he kept up with it; but he was at length over-prevailed on. The ſquire now acquainted Joſeph with his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but he might have-ſpared himſelf that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for his ſervant, whilſt Joſeph was dreſſing, had performed that office before. He continued to expreſs the vaſt happineſs he enjoyed in his ſiſter, and the value he had for all who belonged to her. Joſeph made many bows, and expreſſed an many acknowledgments; and parſon Adams who now firſt perceived Joſeph's new apparel, burſt into tears with joy, and fell to rubbing his hands and ſnapping his fingers, as if he had been mad.</p>
                        <p>They were now arrived at the lady Booby's, and the ſquire deſiring them to wait a moment in the court, walked in to his aunt, and calling her out
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023370_0359_0FBF65F27068AF58"/>
from his wife, acquainted her with Joſeph's arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; ſaying, <q>Madam, as I have married a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and worthy woman, I am reſolved to own her relations, and ſhew them all a proper reſpect; I ſhall think myſelf, therefore, infinitely obliged to all mine, who will do the ſame. It is true, her brother hath been your ſervant, but he is now become my brother; and I have one happineſs, that neither his character, his behaviour, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, give me any reaſon to be aſhamed of calling him ſo. In ſhort, he is now below, dreſs'd like a gentleman, in which light I intend he ſhall hereafter to ſeen: and you will oblige me beyond expreſſion, if you will admit him to be of our party; for I know it will give great pleaſure to my wife, though ſhe will not mention it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was a ſtroke of fortune beyond the lady Booby's hopes or expectation; ſhe anſwered him eagerly, <q>Nephew, you know how eaſily I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to do any thing which Joſeph Andrews deſires—Phoo, I mean which you deſire me, and as he is now your relation, I cannot refuſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him as ſuch.</q> The ſquire told her, he knew his obligation to her for her compliance; and going three ſteps, returned and told her—he had one more favour, which he believed ſhe would eaſily grant, as ſhe had accorded him the former. 'There is a young woman'— 'Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,' ſays ſhe, <q>don't let my good-nature make you deſire, as is too commonly the caſe, to impoſe on me; nor think, becauſe I have with ſo much condeſcenſion agreed to ſuffer your brother-in-law to come to my table, that I will ſubmit to the company of all my own ſervants, and all the dirty trollops in the country.</q> 'Madam,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:023370_0360_0FBF65F3F7703AF0"/>
the ſquire, <q>I believe you never ſaw this young creature; I never beheld ſuch ſweetneſs and innocence, joined with ſuch beauty, and withal ſo genteel.</q>
                           <q> Upon my ſoul, I won't ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her,</q> reply'd the lady in a paſſion; <q>the whole world ſhan't prevail on me. I reſent even the deſire as an affront, and</q>—The ſquire,' who knew her inflexibility, interrupted her, by aſking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and promiſing not to mention it more. He then returned to Joſeph, and ſhe to Pamela. He took Joſeph aſide, and told him he would carry him to his ſiſter; but could not prevail as yet for Fanny. Joſeph begged that he might ſee his ſiſter alone, and then be with his Fanny; but the ſquire know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleaſure his wife would have in her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's company, would not admit it, telling Joſeph there would be nothing in ſo ſhort an abſence from Fanny, whilſt he was aſſured of her ſafety; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he hoped he could not eaſily quit a ſiſter whom he had not ſeen ſo long, and who ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved him—Joſeph immediately complied; for, indeed, no brother could love a ſiſter more; and recommending Fanny, who rejoiced that ſhe was not to go before lady Booby, to the care of Mr. Adams, he attended the ſquire up ſtairs, whilſt Fanny repaired with the parſon to his houſe, where ſhe thought herſelf ſecure of a kind reception.</p>

                        <p>THE meeting between Joſeph and Pamela was not without tears of joy on both ſides; and their embraces were full of tenderneſs and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They were however regarded with much

In the afternoon Joſeph, at their requeſt, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with an account of his adventures; nor could lady Booby conceal her diſſatisfaction at thoſe parts in which Fanny was concerned, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when Mr. Booby launched forth into ſuch rapturous praiſes of her beauty. She ſaid, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her niece, that ſhe wondered her nephew, who had pretended to marry for love, ſhould think ſuch a ſubject proper to amuſe his wife with; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that for her part, ſhe ſhould be jealous of a huſband, who ſpoke ſo warmly in praiſe of another woman, Pamela anſwered, indeed ſhe thought ſhe had cauſe; but it was an inſtance of Mr. Booby's aptneſs to ſee more beauty in women than they were miſtreſſes of. At which words both the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fixed their eyes on two looking-glaſſes; and lady Booby replied, that men were in general, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill judges of beauty; and then, whilſt both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated only their own faces, they paid a croſs compliment to each other's charms. When the hour of reſt approached, which the lady of the houſe deferred as long as decently ſhe could, ſhe informed Joſeph (whom for the future we ſhall call Mr. Joſeph, he having as good a title to that appellation as many others, I mean that inconteſted one of good clothes) that ſhe ordered a bed to be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him. He declined this favour to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; for his heart had long been with his Fanny; but ſhe inſiſted on his accepting it, alledging, that the pariſh had no proper accommodation for ſuch a perſon as he was now to eſteem himſelf. The
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023370_0362_0FBF65FDC91AC7B0"/>
ſquire and his lady both joining with her, Mr. Joſeph was at laſt forced to give over his deſign of viſiting Fanny that evening, who, on her ſide, as impatiently expected him till midnight, when, in complaiſance to Mr. Adams's family, who had ſat up two hours out of reſpect to her, ſhe retired to bed, but not to ſleep; the thought of her love kept her waking, and his not returning according to his promiſe, filled her with uneaſineſs; of which, however, ſhe could not aſſign any other cauſe than merely that of being abſent from him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Joſeph roſe early in the morning, and viſited her in whom his ſoul delighted. She no ſooner heard his voice in the parſon's parlour, than ſhe leaped from her bed, and dreſſing herſelf in a few minutes, went down to him.

                        <p>She was no ſooner retired to her chamber than ſhe aſked Slipſlop what ſhe thought of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creature her nephew had married.

'I aſk you,' anſwered the lady, <q>what you think of the dowdy, my niece I think I am to call her?</q> Slipſlop, wanting no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hint, began to pull her to pieces, and ſo miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably defaced her, that it would have been impoſſible for any one to have known the perſon. The lady gave her all the aſſiſtance ſhe could, and ended with ſaying,—<q>I think, Slipſlop, you have done her juſtice; but yet, bad as ſhe is, ſhe is an angel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this Fanny.</q> Slipſlop then fell on Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023370_0363_0FBF65FFE3D7E740"/>
whom ſhe hacked and hewed in the like barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner, concluding with an obſervation, that there was always ſomething in thoſe low life crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which muſt eternally diſtinguiſh them from their betters. 'Really,' ſaid the lady, <q>I think there is one exception to your rule; I am certain you may gueſs who I mean.</q>—<q>Not I, upon my word, madam,</q> ſaid Slipſlop.—<q>I mean a young fellow;</q> 
                           <q>ſure you are the dulleſt wretch,</q> ſaid the lady.—<q>O la, I am indeed.—Yes, truly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, he is an acceſion,</q> anſwered Slipſlop.—'Ay, is he not, Slipſlop?' returned the lady. <q>Is he not ſo genteel that a prince might without a bluſh acknowledge him for his ſon. His behaviour is ſuch that would not ſhame the beſt education. He borrows from his ſtation a condeſcenſion in every thing to his ſuperiors, yet unattended by that mean ſervility which is called good behaviour in ſuch perſons. Every thing he doth, hath no mark of the baſe motive of fear, but viſibly ſhews ſome reſpect and gratitude, and carries with it the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of love.—And then for his virtues; ſuch piety to his parents, ſuch tender affection to his ſiſter, ſuch integrity to his friendſhip, ſuch brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſuch goodneſs, that if he had been born a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, his wife would have poſſeſſed the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable bleſſing.</q>—'To be ſure, Ma'am,' ſaid Slipſlop.—'But as he is,' anſwered the lady, <q>if he had a thouſand more good qualities, it muſt render a woman of faſhion contemptible even to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of thinking on him: yes, I ſhould deſpiſe myſelf for ſuch a thought.</q> 'To be ſure, Ma'am,' ſaid Slipſlop. 'And why to be ſure?' replied the lady; <q>thou art always one's echo. Is he not more worthy of affection than a dirty country clown, though born of a family as old as the flood, or an

idle worthleſs rake, or little puiſne beau of quality? And yet theſe we muſt condemn ourſelves to, in order to avoid the cenſure of the world; to ſhun the contempt of others, we muſt ally ourſelves to thoſe we deſpiſe; we muſt prefer birth, title, and fortune, to real merit. It is a tyranny of cuſtom, a tyranny we muſt comply with: for we people of faſhion are the ſlaves of cuſtom.</q>—<q>Marry come up!</q> ſaid Slipſlop, who now well knew which party to take, <q>if I was a woman of your ladyſhip's fortune and quality, I would be a ſlave to no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</q>—'Me,' ſaid the lady, <q>I am ſpeaking if a young woman of faſhion, who had ſeen nothing of the world, ſhould happen to like ſuch a fellow.—Me, indeed!

What doſt thou think of Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews?</q> 'Why I think,' ſays Slipſlop, <q>he is the handſomeſt and propereſt man I ever ſaw: and if I was a lady of the greateſt degree it would be well for ſome folks. Your ladyſhip may talk of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom if you pleaſe; but I am confidous there is no more compariſon between young Mr. Andrews, and moſt of the young gentlemen who come to your ladyſhip's houſe in London; a parcel of whipper-ſnapper ſparks: I would ſooner marry our old parſon Adams: never tell me what peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay, whilſt I am happy in the arms of him I

love. Some folks rail againſt other folks, becauſe other folks have what ſome folks would be glad of.</q>—'And ſo,' anſwered the lady, <q>if you was a woman of condition, you would really marry Mr. Andrews?</q>—'Yes, I aſſure your ladyſhip,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Slipſlop, 'if he would have me.'—<q>Fool, idiot,</q> cries the lady, <q>if he would have a woman of faſhion! is that a queſtion?</q>
                           <q> No truly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</q> ſaid Slipſlop, <q>I believe it would be none if Fanny was out of the way; and I am confidous if I was in your ladyſhip's place, and liked Mr. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Andrews, ſhe ſhould not ſtay in the pariſh a moment. I am ſure lawyer Scout would ſend her packing, if your ladyſhip would but ſay the word.</q> This laſt ſpeech of Slipſlop raiſed a tempeſt in the mind of her miſtreſs. She feared Scout had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, or rather that ſhe had betrayed herſelf. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſilence, and a double change of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; firſt to pale, and then to red, ſhe thus ſpoke: <q>I am aſtoniſhed at the liberty you give your tongue. Would you inſinuate, that I employed Scout againſt this wench, on the account of the fellow?</q> 'La, Ma'am,' ſaid Slipſlop, frighted out of her wits, 'I aſſaſſinate ſuch a thing!' <q>I think you dare not,</q> anſwered the lady. <q>I believe my conduct may defy malice itſelf to aſſert ſo curſed a ſlander. If I had ever diſcovered any wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, any lightneſs in my behaviour: if I had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the example of ſome whom thou haſt, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſeen, in allowing myſelf indecent liberties, even with a huſband: but the dear man who is gone, (here ſhe began to ſob) was he alive again, (then ſhe produced tears) could not upbraid me with any one act of tenderneſs or paſſion. No, Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlop all the time I cohabited with him, he never obtained even a kiſs from me, without my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing

reluctance in the granting it. I am ſure he himſelf never ſuſpected how much I loved him.—Since his death, thou knowſt, tho' it is almoſt ſix weeks (it wants but a day) ago, I have not admitted one viſitor, till this fool my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew arrived. I have confined myſelf quite to one party of friends.—And can ſuch a conduct as this fear to be arraigned? To be accuſed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a paſſion which I have always deſpiſed, but of fixing it on ſuch an object, a creature ſo much beneath my notice.</q>—'Upon my word, Ma'am,' ſays Slipſlop, <q>I do not underſtand your ladyſhip, nor know I any thing of the matter.</q>—<q>I believe indeed thou doſt not underſtand me.—Thoſe are delicacies which exiſt only in ſuperior minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy coarſe ideas cannot comprehend them. Thou art a low creature, of the Andrews breed, a reptile of lower order, a weed that grows in the common garden of the creation.</q>—<q>I aſſure your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</q> ſays Slipſlop, whoſe paſſions were almoſt of as high an order as her lady's, <q>I have no more to do with Common Garden than other folks. Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your ladyſhip talks of ſervants as if they were not born of the chriſtian ſpecious. Servants have fleſh and blood as well as quality; and Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews himſelf is a proof that they have as good, if not better.

for I will ſay this, I never heard him ſay an ill word of any body in his life. I am ſure his coarſeneſs doth not lie in his heart; for he is the beſt-natured man in the world; and as for his ſkin, it is no coarſer than other people's, I am ſure. His boſom, when a boy, was as white as driven ſnow: and where it is not covered with hairs, is ſo ſtill. Ifakins! if I was Mrs. Andrews, with a hundred a year, I ſhould not envy the beſt ſhe who wears a head. A woman that could not be happy with ſuch a man, ought never to be ſo: for if he can't make a woman happy, I never yet beheld the man who could. I ſay again, I wiſh I was a great lady for his ſake; I believe when I had made a gentleman of him, he'd behave ſo, that nobody ſhould deprecate what I had done; and I fancy few would venture to tell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Now, reader, to apply this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to my preſent purpoſe, thou muſt know, that as the paſſion generally called love, exerciſes moſt of the talents of the female or fair world; ſo in this they now and then diſcover a ſmall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deceit; for which thou wilt not be angry with the beautiful creatures, when thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that at the age of ſeven, or ſomething earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Miſs is inſtructed by her mother that maſter is a very monſtrous kind of animal, who will, if ſhe ſuffers him to come too near her, infallibly eat her up, and grind her to pieces.

of paſſing their lives out of his reach, of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of which they have ſo viſible an example in their good maiden aunt. But when they arrive at this period, and have now paſs'd their ſecond cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macteric, when their wiſdom, grown riper, begins to ſee a little farther, and from almoſt daily falling in maſter's way, to apprehend the great difficulty of keeping out of it; and when they obſerve him look often at them, and ſometimes very eagerly, and earneſtly too, (for the monſter ſeldom takes any notice of them till at this age) they then begin to think of their danger; and as they perceive they cannot eaſily avoid him, the wiſer part bethink themſelves of providing by other means for their ſecurity. They endeavour by all the methods they can invent to render themſelves ſo amiable in his eyes, that he may have no inclination to hurt them; in which they generally ſucceed ſo well, that his eyes by frequent languiſhing, ſoon leſſen their idea of his fierceneſs, and ſo far abate their fears, that they venture to parly with him; and when they perceive him ſo different from what he hath been deſcribed, all gentleneſs, ſoftneſs, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tenderneſs, fondneſs, their dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions vaniſh in a moment; and now, (it being uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with the human mind to ſkip from one extreme to its oppoſite, as eaſily, and almoſt as ſuddenly, as a bird from one bough to another;) love inſtantly ſucceeds to fear: But as it happens to perſons who have in their infancy been thoroughly frightened with certain no-perſons called ghoſts, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their dread of thoſe beings; after they are convinced that there are no ſuch things; ſo theſe young ladies, tho' they no longer apprehend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, cannot ſo entirely ſhake off all that hath been inſtilled into them; they ſtill entertain the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:023370_0370_0FBF66112963C788"/>
idea of that cenſure which was ſo ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on their tender minds, to which the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of abhorrence they every day hear from their companions greatly contribute. To avoid this cenſure therefore, is now their only care; for which purpoſe they ſtill pretend the ſame averſion to the monſter: And the more they love him, the more ardently they counterfeit the antipathy. By the continual and conſtant practice of which deceit no others, they at length impoſe on themſelves, and really believe they hate what they love. Thus indeed it happened to lady Booby, who loved Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph long before ſhe knew it; and now loved him much more than ſhe ſuſpected. She had indeed, from the time of his ſiſter's arrival in the quality of her niece, and from the inſtant ſhe viewed him in the dreſs and character of a gentleman, began to conceive ſecretly a deſign which love had concealed from herſelf, till a dream betrayed it to her.</p>
                        <p>She had no ſooner riſen than ſhe ſent for her nephew; when he came to her, after many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments on his choice, ſhe told him, <q>He might perceive in her condeſcenſion to admit her own ſervant to her table, that ſhe looked on the family of Andrews as his relations, and indeed hers; that as he had married into ſuch a family, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him to endeavour by all methods to raiſe it as much as poſſible! At length ſhe adviſed him to uſe all his art to diſſuade Joſeph from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended match which would ſtill enlarge their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to meanneſs and poverty; concluding, that by a commiſſion in the army, or ſome other genteel employment, he might ſoon put young Mr. Andrews on the foot of a gentleman; and that being once done, his accompliſhments might
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:023370_0371_0FBF661382A477C8"/>
quickly gain him an alliance, which would not be to their diſcredit.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Her nephew heartily embraced this propoſal; and finding Mr. Joſeph with his wife, at his return to her chamber, he immediately began thus: <q>My love to my dear Pamela, brother, will extend to all her relations; nor ſhall I ſhew them leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect than if I had married into the family of a duke. I hope I have given you ſome early teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of this, and ſhall continue to give you dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more. You will excuſe me therefore, brother, if my concern for your intereſt makes me menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what may be, perhaps, diſagreeable to you to hear; But I muſt inſiſt upon it, that if you have any value for my alliance or my friendſhip, you will decline any thoughts of engaging farther with a girl who is, as you are a relation of mine, ſo much beneath you. I know there may be at firſt ſome difficulty in your compliance, but that will daily diminiſh; and you will in the end ſincerely thank me for my advice. I own, indeed, the girl is handſome; but beauty alone is a poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, and will make but an uncomfortable marriage.</q> 'Sir,' ſaid Joſeph, <q>I aſſure you her beauty is not the leaſt perfection; nor do I know a virtue which that young creature is not poſſeſs'd of.</q> 'As to her virtues,' anſwered Mr. Booby, <q>you can be yet but a ſlender judge of them: But if ſhe had ever ſo many, you will find her equal in theſe among her ſuperiors in both and fortune, which now you are to eſteem on a footing with yourſelf; at leaſt I will take care they ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſo, unleſs you prevent me by degrading yourſelf with ſuch a match, a match I have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patience to think of; and which would break the hearts of your parents, who now rejoice in
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:023370_0372_0FBF661BB2996A38"/>
the expectation of ſeeing you make a figure in the world.</q> 'I know not,' replied Joſeph, <q>that my parents have any power over my inclinations; nor am obliged to ſacrifice my happineſs to their whim or ambition: Beſides, I ſhall be very ſorry to ſee, that the unexpected advancement of my ſiſter ſhould ſo ſuddenly inſpire them with this wicked pride, and make them deſpiſe their equals. I am-reſolved on no account to quit my dear Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, no, tho' I could raiſe her as high above her preſent ſtation as you have raiſed my ſiſter.</q>
                           <q> Your ſiſter, as well as myſelf,</q> ſaid Booby, <q>are greatly obliged to you for the compariſon: But, Sir, ſhe is not worthy to be compared in beauty to my Pamela; nor hath ſhe half her merit. And beſides, Sir, as you civilly throw my marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with your ſiſter in my teeth, I muſt teach you the wide difference between us; my fortune ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to pleaſe myſelf; and it would have been as overgrown a folly in me to have omitted it, as in you to do it.</q>
                           <q> My fortune enables me to pleaſe myſelf likewiſe,</q> ſaid Joſeph; <q>for all my pleaſure is centred in Fanny; and whilſt I have health, I ſhall be able to ſupport her with my labour in that ſtation to which ſhe was born, and with which ſhe is content,</q> 'Brother,' ſaid Pamela, <q>Mr. Booby adviſes you as a friend; and, no doubt, my papa and mamma will be of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and will have great reaſon to be angry with you for deſtroying what his goodneſs hath done, and throwing down our family again, after he hath raiſed it. It would become you better, brother, to pray for the aſſiſtance of grace againſt ſuch a paſſion than to indulge it.—Sure, ſiſter, you are not in earneſt; I am ſure ſhe is your equal at leaſt.</q>—'She was my equal,' anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:023370_0373_0FBF661EC4B9D6C0"/>
Pamela, <q>but I am no longer Pamela An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, I am now this gentleman's lady, and as ſuch am above her—I hope I ſhall never behave with an unbecoming pride, but at the ſame time, I ſhall always endeavour to know myſelf, and queſtion not the aſſiſtance of grace to that purpoſe.</q> They were now ſummoned to breakfaſt, and thus ended their diſcourſe for the preſent, very little to the ſatisfaction of any of the parties.</p>
                        <p>Fanny was now walking in an avenue at ſome diſtance from the houſe, where Joſeph had promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take the firſt opportunity of coming to her. She had not a ſhilling in the world, and had ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever ſince her return, entirely on the charity of parſon Adams. A young gentleman, attended by many ſervants, came up to her, and aſked her if that was not the lady Booby's houſe before him? This indeed he well knew, but had framed the queſtion for no other reaſon than to make her look up, and diſcover if her face was equal to the delicacy of her ſhape. He no ſooner ſaw it than he was ſtruck with amazement. He ſtopt his horſe, and ſwore ſhe was the moſt beautiful creature he ever beheld. Then inſtantly alighting, and delivering his horſe to his ſervant, he rapt out half a dozen oathes that he would kiſs her; to which ſhe at firſt ſubmitted, begging he would not be rude; but he was not ſatisfied with the civility of a ſalute; nor even with the rudeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack he could make on her lips, but caught her in his arms, and endeavoured to kiſs her breaſts, which with all her ſtrength ſhe reſiſted, and, as our ſpark was not of the Herculean race, with ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prevented. The young gentleman, being ſoon out of breath in the ſtruggle, quitted her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting his horſe called one of his ſervants to him, whom he ordered to ſtay behind with her,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023370_0374_0FBF66202F19EC20"/>
and make her any offers whatever, to prevail on her to return home with him in the evening; and to aſſure her he would take her into keeping. He then rode on with his other ſervants, and arrived at the lady's houſe, to whom he was a diſtant, relation, and was come to pay a viſit.</p>
                        <p>The truſty fellow, who was employed in an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he had been long accuſtomed to, diſcharged his part with all the fidelity and dexterity imaginable; but to no purpoſe. She was entirely deaf to his offers, and rejected them with the utmoſt diſdain. At laſt the pimp, who had perhaps more warm blood about him than his maſter, began to ſollicit for himſelf; he told her, tho' he was a ſervant, he was a man of ſome fortune, which he would make her miſtreſs of—and this without any inſult to her virtue, for that he would marry her. She anſwered, if his maſter himſelf, or the greateſt lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> in the land, would marry her, ſhe would refuſe him. At laſt being weary with perſuaſions, and on fire with charms which would have almoſt kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled a flame in the boſom of an ancient philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, or modern divine, he faſtened his horſe to the ground, and attacked her with much more force than the gentleman had exerted. Poor Fanny, would not have been able to reſiſt his rudeneſs a long time; but the deity, who preſides over chaſte love, ſent her Joſeph to her aſſiſtance. He no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came within ſight, and perceiving her ſtruggling with a man, than like a cannon-ball, or like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or any thing that is ſwifter, if any thing be, he ran towards her, and coming up juſt as the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher had torn her handkerchief from her breaſt, before his lips had touched that ſeat of innocence and bliſs, he dealt him ſo luſty a blow in that part of his neck which a rope would have become with
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023370_0375_0FBF66230E63F1D8"/>
the utmoſt propriety, that the fellow ſtaggered back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and perceiving he had to do with ſomething rougher than the little, tender, trembling hand of Fanny, he quitted her, and turning about ſaw his rival, with fire flaſhing from his eyes, again ready to aſſail him; and indeed before he could well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, or return the firſt blow, received a ſecond, which, had it fallen on that part of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to which it was directed, would have been probably the laſt he would have had any occaſion for; but the raviſher lifting up his hand, drove the blows upwards to his mouth, whence it diſlodged three of his teeth; and now not conceiving any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary affection for the beauty of Joſeph's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor being extremely pleaſed with this method of ſalutation, he collected all his force, and aimed a blow at Joſeph's breaſt, which he artfully parry'd with one fiſt, ſo that it loſt its force entirely in air; and ſtopping one foot backward, he darted his fiſt ſo fiercely at his enemy, that had he not caught it in his hand (for he was a boxer of no inferior fame) it muſt have tumbled him on the ground. And now the raviſher meditated another blow, which he aimed at that part of the breaſt where the heart is lodged; Joſeph did not catch it as before, yet ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented its aim, that it fell directly on his noſe, but with abated force. Joſeph then moving both fiſt and foot forwards at the ſame time, threw his head ſo dexterouſly into the ſtomach of the raviſher, that he fell a lifeleſs lump on the field, where he lay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minutes breathleſs and motionleſs.</p>
                        <p>When Fanny ſaw her Joſeph receive a blow in his face, and blood running in a ſtream from him, ſhe began to tear her hair, and invoke all human and divine power to his aſſiſtance. She was not, however, long under this affliction, before Joſeph
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:023370_0376_0FBF6623E4CEA350"/>
having conquered his enemy, ran to her, and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her he was not hurt; ſhe then inſtantly fell on her knees, and thanked God that he had made Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph the means of her reſcue and at the ſame time preſerved him from being injured in attempting it. She offered with her handkerchief to wipe his blood from his face; but he ſeeing his rival attempting to recover his legs, turned to him, and aſked him if he had enough; to which the other anſwered he had; for he believed he had fought with the devil, inſtead of a man; and looſening his horſe, ſaid he ſhould not have attempted the wench if he had known ſhe had been ſo well provided for.</p>
                        <p>Fanny now begged Joſeph to return with her to parſon Adams, and to promiſe that he would leave her no more; theſe were propoſitions ſo agreeable to Joſeph, that, had he heard them, he would have given an immediate aſſent: but indeed his eyes were now his only ſenſe; for you may remember, reader, that the raviſher had tore her handkerchief from Fanny's neck, by which he had diſcovered ſuch a ſight, that Joſeph hath declared all the ſtatues he ever beheld, were ſo much inferior to it in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it was more capable of converting a man into a ſtatue, than of being immitated by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt maſter of that art. This modeſt creature, whom no warmth in ſummer could ever induce to expoſe her charms to the wanton ſun, a modeſty to which perhaps they owed their inconceivable whiteneſs, had ſtood many minutes bare-necked in the preſence of Joſeph, before her apprehenſion of his danger, and the horror of ſeeing his blood, would ſuffer her once to reflect on what concerned her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; till at laſt, when the cauſe of her concern had vaniſhed, and admiration at his ſilence, together with obſerving the fixed poſition of his eyes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:023370_0377_0FBF662DCF519D98"/>
an idea in the lovely maid, which brought more blood into her face than had flowed from Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's noſtrils. The ſnowy hue of her boſom was likewiſe exchanged to vermillion at the inſtant when ſhe clapped her handkerchief round her neck. Joſeph ſaw the uneaſineſs that ſhe ſuffered, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately removed his eyes from an object, in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying which he had felt the greateſt delight which the organs of ſight were capable of conveying to his ſoul. So great was his fear of offending her, and ſo truly did his paſſion for her deſerve the noble name of love.</p>
                        <p>Fanny, being recovered from her confuſion, which was almoſt equalled by what Joſeph had felt from obſerving it, again mentioned her requeſt; this was inſtantly and gladly complied with, and together they croſſed two or three fields, which brought them to the habitation of Mr. Adams.</p>

                           <p>A diſcourſe which happened between Mr. Adams Mrs. Adams, Joſeph, and Fanny, with ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Mr. Adams, which would be called by ſome few readers very low, abſurd, and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE parſon and his wife had juſt ended a long diſpute when the lovers came to the door. Indeed this young couple had been the ſubject of diſpute; for Mrs. Adams was one of thoſe prudent people, who never do any thing to injure their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or perhaps one of thoſe good mothers who would even ſtretch their conſcience to ſerve their children. She had long entertained hopes of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eldeſt daughter ſucceed Mrs. Slipſlop, and
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023370_0378_0FBF662FEDF87E60"/>
of making her ſecond ſon an exciſeman by lady Booby's intereſt. Theſe were expectations ſhe could not endure the thoughts of quitting, and was therefore very uneaſy to ſee her huſband ſo reſolute to oppoſe the lady's intention in Fanny's affair. She told him, <q>it behoved every man to take the firſt care of his family; that he had a wife and ſix children, the maintaining and providing for whom would be buſineſs enough for him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermeddling in other folks affairs; that he had always preached up ſubmiſſion to ſuperiors, and would do ill to give an example of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary behaviour in his own conduct; that if lady Booby did wrong, ſhe muſt anſwer for it herſelf, and the ſin would not lie at their door; than Fanny had been a ſervant, and bred up in the lady's own family, and conſequently ſhe muſt have known more of her than they did; and it was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, if ſhe had behaved herſelf well, that the lady would have been ſo bitterly her enemy; that perhaps he was too much inclined to think well of her, becauſe ſhe was handſome, but handſome women were often no better than they ſhould be; that G—made ugly women as well as handſome ones; and that if a women had virtue, it ſignified nothing whether ſhe had beauty or no!</q> For all which reaſons, ſhe concluded he ſhould oblige the lady, and ſtop the future publication of the banns. But all theſe excellent arguments had no effect on the parſon, who perſiſted in doing his duty; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the conſequence it might have on his worldly intereſt; he endeavoured to anſwer her as well as he could, to which ſhe had juſt finiſhed her reply, (for ſhe had always the laſt word every where but at church) when Joſeph and Fanny en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their kitchen, where the parſon and his wife
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023370_0379_0FBF6631725EE1D8"/>
then ſat at breakfaſt over ſome bacon and cabbage. There was a coldneſs in the civility of Mrs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, which perſons of accurate ſpeculation might have obſerved, but eſcaped her preſent gueſts; indeed it was a good deal covered by the heartineſs of Adams, who no ſooner heard that Fanny had neither eat nor drank that morning, than he preſented her a bone of bacon he had juſt been gnawing, being the only remains of his proviſion, and then ran nimbly to the tap, and produced a mug of ſmall beer, which he called ale; however, it was the beſt in his houſe. Joſeph addreſſing himſelf to the parſon, told him the diſcourſe which had paſs'd between ſquire Booby, his ſiſter, and himſelf, concerning Fanny: he then acquainted him with the dangers whence he had reſcued her, and communicated ſome apprehenſions on her account. He conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he ſhould never have an eaſy moment till Fanny was abſolutely his, and begged that he might be ſuffered to fetch a licence, ſaying, he could eaſily borrow the money. The parſon anſwered, that he had already given his ſentiments concerning a licence, and that a very few days would make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. 'Joſeph,' ſays he, <q>I wiſh this haſte doth not ariſe rather from your impatience than your fear; but as it certainly ſprings from one of theſe cauſes, I will examine both. Of each of theſe therefore in their turn; and firſt, for the firſt of theſe, namely, impatience. Now, child, I muſt inform you, that if in your purpoſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with this young woman, you have no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but the indulgence of carnal appetites, you are guilty of a very heinous ſin. Marriage was ordained for nobler purpoſes, as you will learn when you hear the ſervice provided on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion read to you. Nay, perhaps, if you are a

Indeed all ſuch brutal luſts and affections are to be greatly ſubdued, if not totally eradicated, before the veſſel can be ſaid to be conſecrated to honour.

If, therefore this haſte ariſes from impatience, you are to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and not give away to it. Now, as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head which I propoſed to ſpeak to, namely, fear: it argues a diffidence highly criminal of that Power in which alone we ſhould put our truſt, ſeeing we may be well aſſured that he is able not only to defeat the deſigns of our enemies, but even to turn their hearts. Inſtead of taking therefore any unjuſtifiable or deſperate means to rid ourſelves of fear, we ſhould reſort to prayer only on theſe occaſions; and we may be then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of obtaining what is beſt for us. When any accident threatens us, we are not to deſpair, nor, when it overtakes us, to grieve; we muſt ſubmit in all things to the will of Providence, and ſet our affections ſo much on nothing here, that we cannot quit it without reluctance.

                           </gap> Joſeph; ſhe therefore propoſed to her company a walk in the fields before dinner, when ſhe led them towards Mr. Adams's houſe; and, as ſhe approached it, told them, if they pleaſed ſhe would divert them with one of the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſights they had ever ſoon, which was an old fooliſh parſon, who, ſhe ſaid laughing, kept a wife and ſix brats on a ſalary of about twenty pounds a year; adding, that there was not ſuch another rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged family in the pariſh. They all readily agreed to this viſit, and arrived whilſt Mrs. Adams was declaiming as in the laſt chapter. Beau Didapper, which was the name of the young gentleman we have ſeen riding towards lady Booby's, with his cane mimic had the rap of a London footman at the door. The people within, namely, Adams, his wife, and three children, Joſeph, Fanny, and the pedlar, were all thrown into confuſion by this knock; but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams went directly to the door, which being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the lady Booby and her company walked in, and were received by the parſon with about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred bows, and by his wife with as many curtſies;
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:023370_0386_0FBF6645B290FDF8"/>
the latter telling the lady. <q>She was aſhamed to be ſeen in ſuch a pickle, and that her houſe was in ſuch a litter: but that if ſhe expected ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from her ladyſhip, ſhe ſhould have found her in a better manner.</q> The parſon made no apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, though he was in his half caſſock, and a flannel night-cap. He ſaid, <q>they were heartily welcome to his poor cottage,</q> and, turning to Mr. Didapper, cried out, <hi>Non mea renidet in domo lacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar.</hi> The beau anſwered, <q>He did not underſtand Welch;</q> at which the parſon ſtared, and made no reply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Didapper, or beau Didapper, was a young gentleman of about four foot five inches in height. He wore his own hair: though the ſcarcity of it might have given him ſufficient excuſe for a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig. His face was thin and pale: the ſhape of his body and legs none of the beſt; for he had very narrow ſhoulders, and no calf; and his gait might more probably be called hopping than walking. The qualifications of his mind were well adapted to his perſon. We ſhall handle them firſt negatively. He was not entirely ignorant; for he could talk a little French, and ſing two or three Italian ſongs: he had lived too much in the world to be baſhful, and too much at court to be proud: he ſeemed not much inclined to avarice; for he was profuſe in his expences: nor had he all the features of prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for he never gave a ſhilling:—no hater of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for he always dangled after them: yet ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſubject to luſt, that he had, among thoſe who knew him beſt, the character of great moderation in his pleaſures. No drinker of wine; nor ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to paſſion, but that a hot word or two from an adverſary made him immediately cool.</p>
                        <p>Now, to give him only a daſh or two on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formative
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:023370_0387_0FBF664728090DD0"/>
ſide, <q>tho' he was born to an immenſe fortune, he choſe, for the pitiful and dirty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a place of little conſequence, to depend entirely on the will of a fellow, whom they call a great man; who treated him with the utmoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, and exacted of him a plenary obedience to his commands; which he implicitly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, at the expence of his conſcience, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of his country, in which he had himſelf ſo very large a ſhare. And to finiſh his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as he was entirely well ſatisfied with his own perſon and parts, ſo he was very apt to ridicule and laugh at any imperfection in another.</q> Such was the little perſon or rather thing that hopped after lady Booby into Mr. Adams's kitchen.</p>
                        <p>The parſon and his company retreated from the chimney-ſide, where they had been ſeated, to give room to the lady and hers. Inſtead of returning any of the curtſies or extraordinary civilities of Mrs. Adams, the lady turning to Mr. Booby, cried out, <hi>'Quelle Bête! Quel animal!'</hi> And preſently after diſcovering Fanny (for ſhe did not need the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her ſtanding by Joſeph to aſſure the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of her perſon) ſhe aſked the beau, <q>Whether he did not think her a pretty girl?</q>—<q>Begad, Madam,</q> anſwered he, ''tis the very ſame I met.' 'I did not imagine,' replied the lady, <q>you had ſo good a taſte.</q> 
                           <q>Becauſe I never liked you, I warrant,</q> cries the beau. 'Ridiculous!' ſaid ſhe, <q>you know you were always my averſion.</q>
                           <q> I would never mention averſion,</q> anſwered the beau, <q>with that face;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                                 <hi>Leſt this ſhould appear unnatural to ſome readers, we think proper to acquaint them, that it is taken ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim from very polite converſation.</hi>

                        <p>Mrs. Adams had been all this time begging and praying the ladies to ſit down, a favour which ſhe at laſt obtained. The little boy to whom the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had happened, ſtill keeping his place by the fire, was chid by his mother for not being more mannerly: but lady Booby took his part, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his beauty, told the parſon he was his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry picture. She then ſeeing a book in his hand, aſked, 'if he could read?' 'Yes,' cries Adams, 'a little Latin, Madam, he is juſt got into Quae Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.' 'A fig for quere genius,' anſwered ſhe, 'let me hear him read a little Engliſh,'—<q>Lege, Dick, Lege,</q> ſaid Adams: but the boy made no anſwer, 'till he ſaw the parſon knit his brows; and then cried, 'I don't underſtand you, father.'—'How, boy!' ſays Adams, <q>What doth Lego make in the imperative mode? Legito, doth it not?</q> 'Yes,' anſwered Dick.—'And what beſides?' ſays the father. 'Lege,' quoth the ſon, after ſome heſitation. 'A good boy,' ſays the father: <q>And now, child, what is the Engliſh of Lego?</q>—To which the boy, after long puzzling, anſwered, he could not tell. 'How,' cries Adams, in a paſſion,—<q>What hath the water waſhed away your learning?</q> 
                           <q>Why, what is Latin for the Engliſh verb read? Conſider before you ſpeak.</q>—The child conſidered for ſome time, and then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cried twice or thrice, 'Le—e, Le—,' Dick anſwered, 'Lego.'—<q>Very well;—and then what is the Engliſh,</q> ſays the parſon, <q>of the verb Lego.</q>—'To read,' cried Dick.—<q>Very well,</q> ſaid the parſon, <q>a good boy, you can do well, if you will take pains.—I aſſure your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

                        <argument>
                           <p>The hiſtory of two friends, which may afford an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſſon to all thoſe perſons who happen to take up their reſidence in married families.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>'LEONARD and Paul were two friends,'—'Pronounce it Lennard, child,' cries the—parſon. 'Pray, Mr. Adams,' ſays Lady Booby, 'let your ſon read without interruption.' Dick then proceeded. Lennard and Paul were two friends, who having been educated together at the ſame ſchool, commenced a friendſhip which they preſerved a long time for each other. It was ſo deeply fixed in both their minds, that a long abſence, during which they had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no correſpondence, did not eradicate nor leſſen it: but it revived in all its force at their firſt meeting, which was not till after fifteen years abſence, moſt of which time Lennard had ſpent in the Eaſt-Indi-es.—'Pronounce it ſhort Indies,' ſays Adams.—'Pray, Sir, be quiet,' ſays the lady.—The boy repeated—in the Eaſt-Indies, whilſt Paul had ſerved his king and country in the army. In which different ſervices, they had found ſuch different ſucceſs, that Lennard was now married, and retired with a fortune of thirty thouſand pounds; and Paul
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:023370_0390_0FBF6650254A91E0"/>
was arrived to the degree of a lieutenant of foot; and was not worth a ſingle ſhilling.</p>
                        <p>The regiment in which Paul was ſtationed, happened to be ordered into quarters, within a ſmall diſtance from the eſtate which Lennard had purchaſed; and where he was ſettled. This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was now become a country gentleman, and a juſtice of peace, came to attend the quarter-ſeſſions, in the town where his old friend was quartered. Soon after his arrival, ſome affair in which a ſoldier was concerned, occaſioned Paul to attend the juſtices. Manhood, and time, and the change of climate had ſo much altered Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, that Paul did not immediately recollect the features of his old acquaintance: but it was otherwiſe with Lennard, he knew Paul the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſaw him: nor could he contain himſelf from quitting the bench, and running haſtily to embrace him. Paul ſtood at firſt a little ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but had ſoon ſufficient information from his friend, whom he no ſooner remembered, than he returned his embrace with a paſſion which made many of the ſpectators laugh, and gave to ſome few a much higher and more agreeable ſenſation.</p>
                        <p>Not to detain the reader with minute circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Lennard inſiſted on his friend's return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him to his houſe that evening; which requeſt was complied with, and leave for a month's abſence for Paul obtained of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer.</p>
                        <p>If it was poſſible for any circumſtances to give any addition to the happineſs which Paul propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this viſit, he received that additional plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by finding on his arrival at his friend's houſe, that his lady was an old acquaintance which he had formerly contracted at his quarters; and
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:023370_0391_0FBF6657869F0D98"/>
who had always appeared to be of moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper. A character ſhe had ever maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among her intimates, being of that number, every individual of which is called quite the beſt ſort of woman in the world.</p>
                        <p>But good as this lady was, ſhe was ſtill a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; that is to ſay, an angel, and not an angel.—'You muſt miſtake, child, 'cries the parſon, 'for you read nonſenſe.' 'It is ſo in the book,' anſwered the ſon. Mr. Adams was then ſilenced by authority and Dick proceeded,—For though her perſon was of that kind to which men attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the name of angel, yet in her mind ſhe was perfectly woman. Of which a great degree of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>A day or two paſs'd after Paul's arrival, before any inſtances of this appear'd; but it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conceal it long. Both ſhe and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſoon loſt all apprehenſion from their friend's preſence, and fell to their diſputes with as much vigour as ever. Theſe were ſtill purſued with the utmoſt ardour and eagerneſs, however trifling the cauſes were whence they firſt aroſe. Nay, however incredible it may ſeem, the little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the matter in debate was frequently given as a reaſon for the fierceneſs of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thus: "If you loved me, ſure you would never diſpute with me ſuch a trifle as this." The anſwer to which is very obvious; for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would hold equally on both ſides, and was conſtantly retorted with ſome addition, as—I am ſure I have much more reaſon to ſay ſo, who am in the right. During all theſe diſputes, Paul always kept ſtrict ſilence, and preſerved an even countenance, without ſhewing the leaſt
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:023370_0392_0FBF6658E35A52D0"/>
viſible inclination to either party. One day, however, when Madam had left the room in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fury, Lennard could not refrain from refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his cauſe to his friend.

What ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it whether you were married in a red or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low waiſtcoat? for that was your diſpute. Now ſuppoſe ſhe was miſtaken, as you love her you ſay ſo tenderly, and I believe ſhe deſerves it, would it not have been wiſer to have yielded, tho' you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew yourſelf in the right, than to give either her or yourſelf any uneaſineſs? For my own part, if ever I marry, I am reſolved to enter into an agreement with wife, that in all diſputes (eſpecially about trifles) that party who is moſt convinced they are right, ſhall always ſurrender the victory: by which means we ſhall both be forward to give up the cauſe. I own, ſaid Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, my dear friend, ſhaking him by the hand, there is great truth and reaſon in what you ſay and I will for the future endeavour to follow your advice. They ſoon after broke up the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Lennard going to his wife aſked her pardon, and told her his friend had convinced him he had been in the wrong. She immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began a vaſt encomium on Paul, which he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded her, and both agreed he was the worthieſt

When next they met, which was at ſupper, tho' ſhe had promiſed not to mention what her huſband told her, ſhe could not forbear caſting the kindeſt and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate looks on Paul, and aſked him with the ſweeteſt voice, whether ſhe ſhould help him to ſome potted woodcock?—Potted partridge, my dear, you mean, ſays the huſband. My dear-ſays ſhe, I aſk your friend if he will eat any pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted woodcock; and I am ſure I muſt know, who potted it. I think I ſhould know too who ſhot them, reply'd the huſband, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that I have not ſeen a woodcock this year; however, tho' I know I am in the right I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and the potted partridge is potted woodcock, if you deſire to have it ſo. It is equal to me, ſays ſhe, whether it is one or the other; but you would perſuade one out of one's ſenſes; to be ſure you are always in the right in your own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but your friend, I believe, knows which he is eating. Paul anſwered nothing, and the diſpute continued, as uſual, the greateſt part of the evening. The next morning the lady accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meeting Paul, and being convinced he was her friend, and of her ſide, accoſted him thus:—I am certain, Sir, you have long ſince wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the unreaſonableneſs of my huſband. He is indeed, in other reſpects, a good ſort of man; but ſo poſitive, that no woman but one of my complying temper could poſſibly live with him. Why, laſt night now, was ever any creature ſo unreaſonable?—I am certain you muſt condemn him.—Pray, anſwer me, was he not in the wrong?

They then proceeded to produce numberleſs other inſtances, in all which Paul had, on vows of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, given his opinion on both ſides. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, both believing each other, they fell ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the treachery of Paul, and agreed that he had been the occaſion of almoſt every diſpute which had fallen out between them.

                        <p>However ungenerous this behaviour in Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard may be eſteemed, his wife obtained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from him (tho' with difficulty) to follow her advice; but they both expreſſed ſuch unuſual cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that day to Paul, that he, who was quick of apprehenſion, taking Lennard aſide, preſs'd him ſo home, that he at laſt diſcovered the ſecret.

Paul replied with ſome indignation, he had given him a ſufficient proof how capable he was of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecret from his wife. Lennard returned with ſome warmth, he had more reaſon to upbraid him, for that he had cauſed moſt of the quarrels between them by his ſtrange conduct, and might (if they had not diſcovered the affair to each other) have been the occaſion of their ſeparation.

The ladies imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſcreamed out, roſe from their chairs, and the beau as ſoon as he recovered himſelf, drew his hanger, which Adams obſerving, ſnatched up the lid of a pot in his left hand, and covering himſelf with it as with a ſhield, without any weapon of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in his other hand, ſtept in before Joſeph, and expoſed himſelf to the enraged beau, who threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch perdition and deſtruction, that it frighted the women, who were all got in a huddle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of their wits, even to hear his denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of vengeance. Joſeph was of a different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and begged Adams to let his rival come on; for he had a good cudgel in his hand, and did not fear him.

The beau now ſheathed his hanger, and taking out a pocket glaſs, and vowing vengeance all the time, readjuſted his hair; the parſon depoſited his ſhield, and Joſeph running to Fanny ſoon brought her back to life. Lady Booby chid Joſeph for his inſult on Didapper; but he anſwered he would have attacked an army in the ſame cauſe. 'What cauſe?' ſaid the lady, 'Madam,' anſwered Joſeph, <q>he was rude to that young woman.</q>—'What,' ſays the lady, <q>I ſuppoſe he would have kiſſed the wench; and is a gentleman to be ſtruck for ſuch an offer? I muſt tell you, Joſeph, theſe airs do not become you.</q>—'Madam,' ſaid Mr. Booby, <q>I ſaw the whole affair, and I do not commend my brother; for I cannot perceive why he ſhould take upon him to be this girl's champion.</q>—<q>I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him,</q> ſays Adams, <q>he is a brave lad; and it becomes any man to be the champion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and he muſt be the baſeſt coward, who would not vindicate a woman with whom he is on the brink of marriage.</q>—'Sir,' ſays Mr. Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <q>my brother is not a proper match for ſuch a young woman as this.</q>—'No,' ſays lady Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <q>nor do you, Mr. Adams, act in your proper character, by encouraging any ſuch doings; and I am very much ſurprized you ſhould concern your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it,—I think your wife and family your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer care.—Indeed, Madam, your ladyſhip ſays very true,—anſwered Mrs. Adams, he talks a pack of nonſenſe, that the whole pariſh are his children.

He went out with Fanny under his left arm, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing a cudgel in his right, and neither Mr. Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by nor the beau thought proper to oppoſe him.

But I don't ſee ſhe is ſo much handſomer than other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. If people were to be kept for their beauty, ſhe would ſcarce fare better than her neighbours. I believe.—As for Mr. Joſeph, I have nothing to ſay, he is a young man of honeſt principles, and will pay ſome time or other for what he hath: But for the girl,—Why doth ſhe not return to her place ſhe run away from? I would not give ſuch a vagabond ſlut a halfpenny, tho' I had a million of money; no, tho' ſhe was ſtarving.</q>—'Indeed but I would,' cries little Dick? <q>and, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather than poor Fanny ſhall be ſtarved, I will give her all this bread and cheeſe.</q>—(of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering what he held in his hand.) Adams ſmiled on the boy, and told him, he rejoiced to ſee he was a chriſtian: and that if he had a halfpenny in his pocket, he would have given it him: telling him, it was his duty to look upon all his neighbours as his brothers and ſiſters, and love them accordingly. 'Yes, papa,' ſays he, <q>I love her better than my ſiſters; for ſhe is handſomer than any of them.</q> 'Is ſhe ſo, ſaucebox?' ſays the ſiſter, giving him a box on the ear, which the father would probably have reſented, had not Joſeph, Fanny, and the ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, at that inſtant returned together—Adams bid his wife prepare ſome food for their dinner; ſhe ſaid. <q>truly ſhe could not, ſhe had ſomething elſe to do.</q> Adams rebuked her for diſputing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,

Mrs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, who was a very good ſort of woman, only rather too ſtrict in oeconomics, readily accepted this invitation, as did the parſon himſelf by her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and away they all walked together, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting little Dick, to whom Joſeph gave a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when he heard of his intended liberality to Fanny.</p>

She ſaid ſhe had formerly travelled in a company of gypſies, who had made a practiſe of ſtealing away children; that for her own part, ſhe had been only once guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the crime; which ſhe ſaid ſhe lamented more than all the reſt of her ſins, ſince probably it might have occaſioned the death of the parents: for, added ſhe, it is almoſt impoſſible to deſcribe the beauty of the young creature, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a year and a half old when I kidnapped it. We kept her (for ſhe was a girl) above two years in our company, when I ſold her myſelf for 3 gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas to Sir Thomas Booby, in Somerſetſhire. Now, you know whether there are any more of that name in this country.</q>—'Yes,' ſays A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, <q>there are ſeveral Boobys who are ſquires, but I believe no baronet now alive; beſides, it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſo exactly in every point, there is no room for doubt; but you have forgot to tell us the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from whom the child was ſtolen.</q>—<q>Their name,</q> anſwered the pedlar, <q>was Andrews.—They lived about thirty miles from the ſquire; and ſhe told me, that I might be ſure to find them out by one circumſtance; for that they had a daughter of a very ſtrange name, Pamela, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; ſome pronounced it one way, and ſome the other.</q> Fanny, who had changed colour at the firſt mention of the name, now fainted away; Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph turned pale, and poor Dicky began to roar; the parſon fell on his knees, and ejaculated many thankſgivings, that this diſcovery had been made before the dreadful ſin of inceſt was committed;
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:023370_0404_0FBF667E27ED4488"/>
and the pedlar was ſtruck with amazement, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to account for all this confuſion, the cauſe of which was preſently opened by the parſon's daughter, who was the only unconcerned perſon; (for the mother was chafing Fanny's temples, and taking the utmoſt care of her) and indeed Fanny was the only creature whom the daughter would not have pitied in her ſituation; wherein, tho' we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate her ourſelves, we ſhall leave her for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and pay a ſhort viſit to lady Booby.</p>

                           <p>The hiſtory returning to the lady Booby, gives ſome account of the terrible conflict in her breaſt between love and pride; with what happened on the preſent diſcovery.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE lady ſat down with her company to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but eat nothing. As ſoon as the cloth was removed, ſhe whiſpered Pamela, that ſhe was taken a little ill, and deſired her to entertain her huſband and beau Didapper. She then went up into her chamber, ſent for Slipſlop, threw herſelf on the bed, in the agonies of love, rage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; nor could ſhe conceal theſe boiling paſſions longer, without burſting. Slipſlop now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her bed, and aſked how her ladyſhip did; but inſtead of revealing her diſorder, as ſhe intended, ſhe entered into a long encomium on the beauty and virtues of Joſeph Andrews: ending at laſt with expreſſing her concern, that ſo much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be thrown away on ſo deſpicable an object as Fanny. Slipſlop, wall knowing how to humour her miſtreſs's frenzy, proceeded to repeat, with exaggeration, if poſſible, all her miſtreſs had
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:023370_0405_0FBF6684074311E0"/>
ſaid, and concluded with a wiſh, that Joſeph had been a gentleman, and that ſhe could ſee her lady in the arms of ſuch a huſband. The lady then ſtarted from the bed, and taking a turn or two acroſs the room cry'd out with a deep ſigh,—<q>Sure he would make any woman happy.</q>—<q>Your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</q> ſays ſhe,<q> would be the happieſt woman in the world with him.—A fig for cuſtom and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. What vails what people ſay? Shall I be afraid of eating ſweetmeats, becauſe people may ſay I have a ſweet tooth? If I had a mind to marry a man, all the world ſhould not hinder me. Your ladyſhip hath no parents to tutelar your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; beſides, he is of your ladyſhip's family now, and as good a gentleman as any in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and why ſhould not a woman follow her mind as well as a man? Why ſhould not your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip marry the brother, as well as your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew the ſiſter? I am ſure, if it was a fragrant crime, I would not perſuade your ladyſhip to it.</q>—'But, dear Slipſlop,' anſwered the lady, <q>if I could prevail on myſelf to commit ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is that curſed Fanny in the way, whom the ideot.—O how I hate and deſpiſe him!</q>—<q>She, a little ugly minx,</q> cries Slipſlop, <q>leave her to me.—I ſuppoſe your ladyſhip hath heard of Joſeph's fitting with one of Mr. Didapper's ſervants about her; and his maſter hath ordered them to carry her away by force this evening. I'll take care they ſhall not want aſſiſtance. I was talking with this gentleman, who was below, juſt when your ladyſhip ſent for me.</q>—'Go back,' ſays the lady Booby, <q>this inſtant; for I expect Mr. Didapper will ſoon be going. Do all you can; for I am reſolved this wench ſhall not be in our family; I will endeavour to return to the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:023370_0406_0FBF668648CCDA78"/>
company; but let me know as ſoon as ſhe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off.</q> Slipſlop went away; and her miſtreſs began to arraign her own conduct in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>What am I doing? How do I ſuffer this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to creep imperceptibly upon me! How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days are paſs'd ſince I could have ſubmitted to aſk myſelf the queſtion?—Marry a footman! diſtraction! Can I afterwards bear the eyes of my acquaintance? But I can retire from them; retire with one in whom I propoſe more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the world without him can give me! Retire—to feed continually on beauties, which my inflamed imagination ſickens with eagerly gazing on; to ſatisfy every appetite, every deſire, with their utmoſt wiſh.—Ha! and do I doat thus on a footman! I deſpiſe, I deteſt my paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—Yet why? Is he not generous, gentle, kind?—Kind to whom? to the meaneſt wretch, a creature below my conſideration. Doth he not?—Yes, he doth prefer her; curſe his beauties, and the little low heart that poſſeſſes them; which can baſely deſcend to this deſpicable wench, and be ungratefully deaf to all the honours I do him.—And can I then love this monſter? No, I will tear his image from my boſom, tread on him, ſpurn him. I will have thoſe pitiful charms, which now I deſpiſe, mangled in my ſight; for I will not ſuffer the little jade I hate to riot in the beauties I contemn. No, tho' I deſpiſe him my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; tho' I would ſpurn him from my feet, was he to languiſh at them, no other ſhould taſte the happineſs I ſcorn. Why do I ſay happineſs? To me it would be miſery.—To ſacrifice my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, my character, my rank in life, to the indulgence of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="186" facs="unknown:023370_0407_0FBF668B4DC43350"/>
How I deteſt the thought! How much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite is the pleaſure reſulting from the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of virtue and prudence, than the faint reliſh of what flows from vice and folly! Whither did I ſuffer this improper, this mad paſſion to hurry me, only by neglecting to ſummon the aid of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to my aſſiſtance? Reaſon, which hath now ſet before me my deſires in their proper colours, and immediately helped me to expel them. Yes, I thank heaven and my pride, I have now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conquered this unworthy paſſion; and if there was no obſtacle in its way, my pride would diſdain any pleaſures which could be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſo baſe, ſo mean, ſo vulgar</q>—Slipſlop returned at this inſtant in a violent hurry, and with the utmoſt eagerneſs cry'd out,—<q>O, Madam, I have ſtrange news. Tom the footman is juſt come from the George; where it ſeems Joſeph and the reſt of them are a jinkitting; and he ſays, there is a ſtrange man who hath diſcovered that Fanny and Joſeph are brother and ſiſter.</q>—'How, Slipſlop!' cries the lady in a ſurprize.—<q>I had not time, Madam,</q> cries Slipſlop, <q>to enquire about particles, but Tom ſays, it is moſt certainly true.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This unexpected account entirely obliterated all thoſe admirable reflections which the ſupreme power of reaſon had ſo wiſely made juſt before. In ſhort, when deſpair, which had more ſhare in producing the reſolutions of hatred we have ſeen taken, began to retreat, the lady heſitated a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then forgetting all the purport of her ſoliloquy, diſmiſſed her woman again, with orders to bid Tom attend her in the parlour, whither ſhe now haſtened to acquaint Pamela with the news. Pamela ſaid, ſhe could not believe it: For ſhe had
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:023370_0408_0FBF6691C1971EA8"/>
never heard that her mother had loſt any child, or that ſhe had ever had any more than Joſeph and herſelf. The lady flew into a violent rage with her, and talked of upſtarts and diſowning relations, who had ſo lately been on a level with her. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela made no anſwer: But her huſband, taking up her cauſe, ſeverely reprimanded his aunt for her behaviour to his wife; he told her, if it had been earlier in the evening ſhe ſhould not have ſtaid a moment longer in her houſe; that he was convinced, if this young woman could be proved her ſiſter, ſhe would readily embrace her as ſuch; and he himſelf would do the ſame: He then deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the fellow might be ſent for, and the young woman with him; which lady Booby immediately ordered, and thinking proper to make ſome apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to Pamela for what ſhe had ſaid, it was readily accepted, and all things reconciled.</p>
                        <p>The pedlar now attended, as did Fanny and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, who would not quit her; the parſon likewiſe was induced, not only by curioſity, of which he had no ſmall portion, but his duty, as he apprehended it, to follow them; for he continued all the way to exhort them, who were now breaking their hearts, to offer up thankſgivings, and be joyful for ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous an eſcape.</p>
                        <p>When they arrived at Booby-hall, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently called into the parlour, when the pedlar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the ſame ſtory he had told before, and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the truth of every circumſtance; ſo that all who heard him were extremely well ſatisfied of the truth except Pamela, who imagined, as ſhe had never heard either of her parents mention ſuch an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it muſt be certainly falſe; and except the lady Booby, who ſuſpected the falſhood of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from her ardent deſire that it ſhould be true;
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:023370_0409_0FBF6692F7EEAA20"/>
and Joſeph, who feared its truth, from his earneſt wiſhes that it might prove falſe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Booby now deſired them all to ſuſpend their curioſity and abſolute believe or diſbelieve, till the next morning, when he expected old Mr. Andrews and his wife, to fetch himſelf and Pamela home in his coach, and then they might be certain of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowing the truth or falſhood of this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in which he ſaid, as there were many ſtrong circumſtances to induce their credit, ſo he could not perceive any intereſt the pedlar could have in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it, or in endeavouring to impoſe ſuch a falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood on them.</p>
                        <p>The lady Booby, who was very little uſed to ſuch company, entertained them all, <abbr>viz.</abbr> her nephew, his wife, her brother and ſiſter, the beau, and the parſon, with great good-humour at her own table. As to the pedlar, ſhe ordered him to be made as welcome as poſſible by her ſervants. All the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the parlour, except the diſappointed lovers, who ſat ſullen and ſilent, were full of mirth: For Mr. Booby had prevailed on Joſeph to aſk Mr. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapper's pardon, with which he was perfectly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Many jokes paſs'd between the beau and the parſon, chiefly on each other's dreſs; theſe afforded much diverſion to the company. Pamela chid her brother Joſeph or the concern which he expreſs'd at diſcovering a new ſiſter. She ſaid, if he loved Fanny as he ought, with a pure affection, he had no reaſon to lament being related to her.—Upon which Adams began to diſcourſe on Platonic love; whence he made a quick tranſition to the joys in the next world; and concluded with ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that there was no ſuch thing as pleaſure in this. At which Pamela and her huſband ſmiled on one another.</p>

                           <pb n="189" facs="unknown:023370_0410_0FBF6694ABCD8BF8"/>
This happy pair propoſing to retire (for no other perſon gave the leaſt ſymptom of deſiring reſt) they all repaired to ſeveral beds provided for them in the ſame houſe; nor was Adams himſelf ſuffered to go home, it being a ſtormy night. Fanny indeed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten begged ſhe might go home with the parſon; but her ſtay was ſo ſtrongly inſiſted on, that ſhe at laſt, by Joſeph's advice, conſented.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>ABOUT an hour after they had all ſeparated (it being now paſt three in the morning) beau Didapper, whoſe paſſion for Fanny permitted him not to cloſe his eyes, but had employed his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in contrivances how to ſatisfy his deſires, at laſt hit on a method by which he hoped to effect it. He had ordered his ſervant to bring him word where Fanny lay, and had received his informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he therefore aroſe, put on his breeches and night-gown, and ſtole ſoftly along the gallery which led to her apartment; and being come to the door, as he imagined it, he opened it with the leaſt noiſe poſſible, and entered the chamber. A ſavour now invaded his noſtrils which he did not expect in the room of ſo ſweet a young creature, and which might have probably had no good effect on a cooler lover. However, he groped out the bed with difficulty; for there was not a glimpſe of light, and opening the curtains, he whiſpered in Joſeph's voice, (for he was an excellent mimic) <q>Fanny, my angel.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:023370_0411_0FBF6696D25B8A08"/>
I am come to inform thee that I have diſcovered the falſhood of the ſtory we laſt night heard. I am no longer thy brother, but thy lover; nor will I be delayed the enjoyment of thee one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longer. You have ſufficient aſſurances of my conſtancy not to doubt my marrying you, and it would be want of love to deny me the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of thy charms.</q>—So ſaying, he diſencum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered himſelf from the little clothes he had on, and, leaping into bed, embraced his angel, as he conceived her, with great rapture. If he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at receiving no anſwer, he was no leſs pleaſed to find his hug returned with equal ardour. He remained not long in this ſweet confuſion; for both he and his paramour preſently diſcovered their error. Indeed it was no other than the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Slipſlop whom he had engaged; but tho' ſhe immediately knew the perſon whom ſhe had miſtaken for Joſeph, he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

therefore, when he offered to leap from the bed ſhe caught faſt hold of his ſhirt, at the ſame time roaring out, <q>O thou villain! thou haſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked my chaſtity, and I believe ruined me in my ſleep; I will ſwear a rape againſt thee, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thee with the utmoſt vengeance.</q> The beau attempted to get looſe, but ſhe held him faſt, and when he ſtruggled, ſhe cried out <q>Murder! murder! rape! robbery! ruin!</q> At which words parſon Adams, who lay in the next chamber, wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and meditating on the pedlar's diſcovery, jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of bed, and, without ſtaying to put a rag of clothes on, haſtened into the apartment whence the cries proceeded.

<pb n="192" facs="unknown:023370_0413_0FBF66A1AEDF2540"/>
another ſtroke on his chops, he gave her ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in the guts, that ſhe began to roar loud enough to be heard all over the houſe. Adams then ſeizing her by the hair (for her double-clout had fallen off in the ſcuffle) pinned her head down to the bolſter, and then both called for lights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>The lady Booby, who was as wakeful as any of her gueſts, had been alarmed from the beginning; and, being a woman of a bold ſpirit, ſhe ſlip on a night-gown, petticoat, and ſlippers, and taking a candle, which always burnt in her chamber, in her hand, ſhe walked undauntedly to Slipſlop's room; where ſhe entered juſt at the inſtant as Adams had diſcovered, by the two mountains which Slipſlop carried before her, that he was concerned with a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. He then concluded her to be a witch, and ſaid, he fancied thoſe breaſts gave ſuck to a legion of devils. Slipſlop ſeeing lady Booby enter the room, cried, 'Help! or I am raviſhed,' with a moſt audible voice; and Adams perceiving the light, turned haſtily, and ſaw the lady (as ſhe did him) juſt as ſhe came to the feet of the bed; nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Poor Adams had before diſcovered the countenance of his bedfellow, and now firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting, he was naked, he was no leſs confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than lady Booby herſelf, and immediately whipt under the bed-clothes; whence the chaſte Slipſlop endeavoured in vain to ſhut him out. Then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his head, on which by way of ornament,

he wore a flannel nigh-cap, he proteſted his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and aſked ten thouſand pardons of Mrs. Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlop for the blows he had ſtruck her, vowing he had miſtaken her for a witch. Lady Booby then caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eyes on the ground, obſerved ſomething ſparkle with great luſtre, which when ſhe had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it up, appeared to be a very fine pair of diamond buttons for the ſleeves. A little farther ſhe ſaw the ſleeve itſelf of a ſhirt with laced ruffles. <q>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dey!</q> ſays ſhe, 'what is the meaning of this?'—'O, Madam,' ſays Slipſlop, <q>I don't know what hath happened, I have been ſo terrified. Here may have been a dozen men in the room.</q>
                           <q> To whom belongs this laced ſhirt and jewels,</q> ſays the lady.—'Undoubtedly,' cries the parſon, <q>to the young gentleman whom I miſtook for a woman on coming into the room, whence proceeded all the ſubſequent miſtakes, for if I had ſuſpected him for a man, I would have ſeized him had he been another Hercules, though indeed he ſeems rather to reſemble Hylas.</q> He then gave an account of the reaſon of his riſing from bed, and the reſt, till the lady came into the room; at which, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Slipſlop and her gallant, whoſe heads only were viſible at the oppoſite corners of the bed, ſhe could not refrain from laughter; nor did Slipſlop perſiſt in accuſing the parſon of any motions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a rape. The lady therefore deſired him to return to his bed as ſoon as ſhe was departed, and then ordering Slipſlop to riſe and attend her in her own room, ſhe returned herſelf thither. When ſhe was gone, Adams renewed his petitions for pardon to Mrs. Slipſlop, who, with a moſt chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an temper, not only forgave, but began to move with ſuch courteſy towards him, which he taking as a hint to be gone, immediately quitted the bed, and
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:023370_0415_0FBF66A424161D08"/>
made the beſt of his way towards his own; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, inſtead of turning to the right, he turned to the left, and went to the apartment where Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lay, who (as the reader may remember) had not slept a wink the preceding night, and who was ſo hagged out with what had happened to her in the day, that notwithſtanding all thoughts of her Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, ſhe was fallen into ſo profound a ſleep, that all the noiſe in the adjoining room had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſturb her. Adams groped out the bed, and turning the clothes down ſoftly, a cuſtom Mrs. Adams had long accuſtomed him to crept in, and depoſited his carcaſe on the bed-poſt, a place which that good woman had always aſſigned him.</p>
                        <p>As the cat or lap-dog of ſome lovely nymph for whom ten thouſand lovers languiſh, lies quietly by the ſide of the charming maid, and, ignorant of the ſcene of delight on which they repoſe, meditates the future capture of a mouſe, or ſurpriſal of a plate of bread and butter: ſo Adams lay by the ſide of Fanny, ignorant of the paradiſe to which he was ſo near; nor could the emanation of ſweets which flowed from her breath, overpower the fumes of tobacco which played in the parſon's noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils. And now ſleep had not overtaken the good man, when Joſeph who had ſecretly appointed Fanny to come to her at the break of day, rapped ſoftly at the chamber-door, which, when he had repeated twice, Adams cried, <q>Come in, whoever you are.</q> Joſeph thought he had miſtaken the door, though ſhe had given him the moſt exact directions; however, knowing his friend's voice, he opened it, and ſaw ſome female veſtments lying on a chair. Fanny waking at the ſame inſtant, and ſtretching out her hand on Adams's beard, ſhe cry'd out.—'O heavens! where am I?' <q>Bleſs
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:023370_0416_0FBF66A5B2DE9928"/>
me! where am I?</q> ſaid the parſon. Then Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcreamed, Adams leapt out of bed, and Joſeph ſtood, as the tragedians call it, like the ſtatue of Surprize. 'How came ſhe into my room?' cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Adams. 'How came you into her's?' cried Joſeph, in an aſtoniſhment. <q>I know nothing of the matter,</q> anſwered Adams, <q>but that ſhe is a veſtal for me. As I am a chriſtian, I know not whether ſhe is a man or woman. He is an infidel who doth not believe in witchcraft. They as ſurely exiſt now as in the days of Saul. My clothes are bewitched away too, and Fanny's brought into their place.</q> For he ſtill inſiſted he was in his own apartment; but Fanny denied it vehemently, and ſaid his attempting to perſuade Joſeph of ſuch a falſhood convinced her of his wicked deſign. 'How!' ſaid Joſeph in a rage, 'hath he offered any rudeneſs to you?'—She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe could not accuſe him of any more than villainouſly ſtealing to bed to her, which ſhe thought rudeneſs ſufficient, and what no man would do without a wicked intention. Joſeph's great opinion of Adams was not eaſily to be ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and when he heard from Fanny that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Adams therefore of this truth, he begged him to give ſome account how he came there. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams then, ſtanding in his ſhirt, which did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Fanny, as the curtains of the bed were drawn, related all that had happened, and when he had ended. Joſeph told him it was plain he had miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by turning to the right inſtead of the left.

                        <p>In the morning, Mr. Wilſon propoſed to his
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:023370_0426_0FBF63D9DF7C0B18"/>
ſon to make a viſit with him to his mother; which notwithſtanding his dutiful inclinations, and a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire he had to ſee her, a little concerned him, as he muſt be obliged to leave his Fanny: but the goodneſs of Mr. Booby relieved him, for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſend his own coach and ſix for Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom Pamela ſo very earneſtly invited, that Mr. Wilſon at length agreed with the entreaties of Mr. Booby and Joſeph, and ſuffered the coach to go empty for his wife.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday the coach returned with Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who added one more to this happy aſſembly. The reader may imagine much better and quicker too than I can deſcribe, the many embraces and tears of joy which ſucceeded her arrival. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſay, ſhe was eaſily prevailed with to follow her huſband's example, in conſenting to the match.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday, Mr. Adams performed the ſervice at the ſquire's pariſh church, the curate of which very kindly exchanged duty, and rode twenty miles to the lady Booby's pariſh ſo to do; being particularly charged not to omit publiſhing the banns, being the third and laſt time.</p>
                        <p>At length the happy day arrived, which was to put Joſeph in the poſſeſſion of all his wiſhes. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and dreſs'd himſelf in a neat but plain ſuit of Mr. Booby's which exactly fitted him; for he refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all finery; as did Fanny likewiſe, who could be prevailed on by Pamela to attire herſelf in nothing richer than a white dimity night-gown. Her ſhift, indeed, which Pamela preſented her, was of the fineſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kind, and had an edging of lace round the boſom; ſhe likewiſe equipped her with a pair of fine white thread ſtockings, which were all ſhe would accept; for ſhe wore one of her own round-eared caps and, over it a ſtraw hat, lined with cherry coloured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

and tied with a cherry coloured ribbon. In this dreſs ſhe came forth from her chamber, bluſhing and breathing ſweets; and was by Joſeph, whoſe eyes ſparkled fire, led to church, the whole family attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where Mr. Adams performed the ceremony; at which nothing was ſo remarkable, as the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and unaffected modeſty of Fanny, unleſs the true chriſtian piety of Adams, who pulickly rebuked Mr. Booby and Pamela for laughing in ſo ſacred a place, and on ſo ſolemn an occaſion. Our parſon would have done no leſs to the higheſt prince on earth: for though he paid all ſubmiſſion and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his ſuperiors in other matters, where the leaſt ſpice of religion intervened, he immediately loſt all reſpect of perſons. It was his maxim, that he was a ſervant of the Higheſt, and could not, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from his duty, give np the leaſt article of his honour, or of his cauſe, to the greateſt earthly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate. Indeed he always aſſerted, that Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams at church with his ſurplice on, and Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams without that ornament, in any other place, were two very different perſons.</p>
                        <p>When the church rites were over, Joſeph led his blooming bride back to Mr. Booby's (for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was ſo very little, they did not think proper to uſe a coach; the whole company attended them likewiſe on foot; and now a moſt magnificent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was provided, at which parſon Adams demonſtrated an appetite ſurprizing, as well as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing every one preſent: Indeed the only perſons who betrayed any deficency on this occaſion, were thoſe on whoſe account the feaſt was provided: they pampered their imaginations with the much more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="207" facs="unknown:023370_0428_0FBF63DDED9F0BF0"/>
the other had her wiſhes tempered with fears.</p>
                        <p>At length, after a day paſſed with the utmoſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, corrected by the ſtricteſt decency; in which however, parſon, Adams, being well filled with ale and pudding, had given a looſe to more facetiouſneſs than was uſual to him; the happy, the bleſs'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment arrived, when Fanny retired with her mother, her mother in-law, and her ſiſter. She was ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd; for ſhe had no jewels to depoſit in their caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, nor fine laces to fold with the niceſt exactneſs. Undreſſing to her was properly diſcovering, not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off ornaments: for as all her charms were the gifts of nature, ſhe could diveſt herſelf of none. How, reader, ſhall I give thee an adequate idea of this lovely young creature? the bloom of roſes and lilies might a little illuſtrate her complexion, or their ſmell her ſweetneſs: but to comprehend her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, conceive youth, health, bloom, neatneſs, and innocence, in her bridal bed; conceive all theſe in their utmoſt perfection; and you may place the charming Fanny's picture before your eyes.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph no ſooner heard ſhe was in bed, than he fled with the utmoſt eagerneſs to her. A minute carried him into her arms, where we ſhall leave this happy couple to enjoy the private rewards of their conſtancy; rewards ſo great and ſweet, that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Joſeph neither envied the nobleſt duke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The third day, Mr. Wilſon and his wife, with their ſon and daughter, returned home; where they now live together in a ſtate of bliſs ſcarce equalled. Mr. Booby hath with unprecedented generoſity giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Fanny a fortune of two thouſand pounds, which Joſeph hath laid out in a little eſtate in the ſame pariſh with his father, which he now occupies (his father having ſtocked it for him;) and Fanny pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:023370_0429_0FBF63DF6554CB10"/>
with moſt excellent management in his dairy, where, however, ſhe is not at preſent very able to buſtle much, being, as Mr. Wilſon informs me in his laſt letter, extremely big with her firſt child.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Booby hath preſented Mr. Adams with a living of one hundred and thirty pounds a year: he at firſt refuſed it, reſolving not to quit his pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with whom he had lived ſo long: but on recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting he might keep a curate at this living, he hath been lately induced into it.</p>
                        <p>The pedlar, beſides ſeveral handſome preſents both from Mr. Wilſon and Mr. Booby, is by the latter's intereſt, made an exciſeman; a truſt which he diſcharges with, ſuch juſtice, that he is greatly beloved in his neighbourhood.</p>
                        <p>As for the lady Booby, ſhe returned to London in a few days, where a young captain of dragoons, together with eternal parties at cards, ſoon oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the memory of Joſeph.</p>
                        <p>Joſeph remains bleſs'd with his Fanny, whom he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
