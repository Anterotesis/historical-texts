            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

underſtand, the manner, in which theſe ſacred and delightful acts of devotion are performed, is not for us in this ſtate of imperfection. For the deſired ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, we muſt wait, till we are admitted to join them, in thoſe heavenly and delightful ſervices—<hi>till we come to ſee as we are ſeen, and know as we are known.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.12.</note>— In the mean time, we may aſſure ourſelves, from divine authority, that <hi>they ceaſe not day and night,</hi> to pay their religious homage to God, to worſhip and adore that glorious being, from whom they derived their exiſtence, by whom they are preſerved in life, and upon whom they depend for felicity and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</p>
            <p>THE duty, as well as priviledge of mankind, in this matter, is not leſs evident, being clearly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, by the light of reaſon, from the nature of things, and fully pointed out both as to matter and manner, by expreſs revelation from heaven. The divine commands and inſtructions, written on the tables of our hearts, and explained and inforced by the writings of divine inſpiration, relative to our duty and obligations, to worſhip and adore the God, that made, preſerves, ſupports and governs us, are too plain and explicit to be drawn in queſtion, by any that have, believe and receive the ſcriptures of truth.

            <p>VARIOUS are the ways, in which theſe religious acknowledgments may be, and are, acceptably made unto God; both <hi>internally</hi> and <hi>externally.</hi> As, in private, in publick—ſeperately, by individuals,— ſocially, by ſocieties, or aſſemblies of men, adoring and worſhipping GOD, and giving him that glory which is due to his name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Internally,</hi> this is done, and this important duty is acceptably diſcharged, by the devotion of the heart, or the unreſerved dedication of the ſoul to God; and by cultivating a deep, conſtant and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of our indebtedneſs, dependence and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. —Herein does the eſſence of piety towards God conſiſt —Hence the intrinſic excellency,—hence the vital influence of religion takes its riſe.

bleſſed LORD ſaw the punctitious regard the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> paid, to ſome external rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their religion, while their groſs neglect of many things of higheſt importance to virtue and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and vital religion, was too notorious to be concealed, he ſeverely reproved them, ſaying, "<hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> hypocrites; For ye pay tithe of mint, anniſe and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: <hi>Theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi>" <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 23.23.</note> This paſſage is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to the point in view, and exhibits the leſſon, we have endeavoured to ſuggeſt, in too legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters to need any comment.</p>
            <p>THERE are a variety of ways, in which the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, to a glorious GOD, may be fitly exerciſed, profitably cultivated and ſtrongly expreſsed, in the external acts of religion; either diſcretionally, according to the beſt light of our own minds, or in obedience to ordinances and inſtitutions of divine appointment. But, in general, all religious acts and external ſervices of this nature, may be conſidered as reducible to, or virtually included in, or couched under, theſe two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt expreſſive branches of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prayer and praiſe. Both <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe and include in them, a full and unreſerved acknowledgment of the Deity and adoration of his perfections. Both are alike expreſſive of our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon GOD and of our obligations to him. And by whatever devotional acts, our deſires and greatful acknowledgments are expreſſed, in both prayer and praiſe, our truſt, fear, love, gratitude, hope, and even all
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011601_0009_0F87799061036E68"/>
the pious and religious affections, towards the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Being whom we worſhip and adore, are truly engaged and devoutly expreſſed. In a word, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and praiſe alike include and expreſs, (when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended aright) a filial acknowledgment of our intire ſubjection to divine government, and the righteous diſpoſals of a wiſe providence in the preſent ſtate, and of our accountableneſs to GOD, at laſt, as our rightful ſovereign and final judge. Theſe ſentiments ought always to be kept in mind and deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on the heart, as entering into the nature of devotion, and as eſſentially neceſſary to render devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal acts and ſervices well pleaſing to GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe,</hi> as they are emphatically the two grand conſtituent parts of religious worſhip, or devotion, and as they are jointly expreſſive of all the pious affections towards GOD, are very frequently, if not always joined together, in acts of homage and religious addreſſes to him. Agreably, an eminent apoſtle, who well underſtood the nature and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of religion, and eſpecially of devotion, in our addreſſes to GOD, expreſly enjoins, that we "be careful for nothing: But in <hi>every thing</hi> by prayer and ſupplication, with thanksgiving, let our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts be made known unto GOD." <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. 4.6.</note> So that it may fitly be ſaid, that prayer and praiſe do, for the moſt part, if not always, involve one another in the ſame acts of devotion. Are we requeſting the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any needed bleſſings, a greatful ſenſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs already experienced, is not only beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our character as dependent creatures, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, but alſo a good argument of our hope and truſt in GOD, as able and ready to do us good; and,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011601_0010_0F877991188242F0"/>
at the ſame time eſſentially neceſſary, as a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to render us accepted of GOD, in our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and meet for the reception of mercies requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In this way, paſt mercies, of which the people of GOD have a greatful ſenſe, are often pled with good ſucceſs, as an argument for granting the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they ſeek. Numberleſs have been the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this, recorded for our inſtruction and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, in the ſacred pages.—On the other hand, are we expreſſing our greatful acknowledgements, for bleſſings received, and giving of thanks at the remembrance of his goodneſs and grace, to renew the acknowledgment of our dependence upon GOD, and devoutly to implore the continuance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and bleſſing, and earneſtly to ſeek his grace and aſſiſtance, to a wiſe improvement of his favours, is, at once, to expreſs the ſincerity of our deſires in praiſing his name, and the ardour of our ſouls to make ſuch returns, of love and obedience, as, in conſequence of his goodneſs, he has a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Thus to offer praiſe, is to glorify GOD.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, though <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven, and practically ſpeaking, can ſcarcely be ſeperated, in acts of devotion; yet they may be, and are juſtly diſtinguiſhed, in theory and ſpeculation, and may fitly be conſidered, as expreſſive of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and main deſign of devotional acts, to which they are applied: The former as denominating an act of worſhip, as being of the nature of ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and requeſt, for favours needed; and the latter, as denoting an act of homage, as being of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of gratitude and thankfulneſs, for bleſſings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. In either, and in both, when done in true devotion, and from the heart, as the divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011601_0011_0F877991DCB51B18"/>
are acknowledged and adored, GOD is pleaſed to accept his ſincere worſhippers, and account him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf grorified.—It is the <hi>latter</hi> of theſe (tho' not to the excluſion of the <hi>former</hi>) to which our attention is called, upon this occaſion, and which is, more eſpecially, the ſubject of our text and the Pſalm before us.</p>
            <p>WHAT particular occaſion this Pſalm was wrote upon—whether to celebrate ſome ſignal victory, over the enemies of GOD's people—or to expreſs the joy of GOD's people, upon the bringing the ark of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>enant of GOD, into the city of David, which was done with great pomp, ſolemnity and rejoicings; or whether it is to be conſidered as prophetic of the kingdom of Chriſt, the glory of the church, in the goſgel day; to uſher in which, our bleſſed LORD, in glorious triumph, <hi>aſcended on high, led captivity captive, and received gifts for men;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm 68.18.</note> (I ſay) whether it is to be conſidered, as referring to either of theſe, or any other remarkable events, which the pſalmiſt might have immediately in view, is not eaſy for us to determine, at this diſtance of time. Neither is a certainty, in this caſe, of any ſpecial importance to our preſent purpoſe. For be the immediate occaſion of it, what it will, the ſubject, and practical uſe of it, to GOD's church and people, in every age, are the ſame, and will be ſo to the end of time. It is an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to praiſe the LORD, in ſeveral acts expreſſive of this part of devotion. Particularly, by <hi>clapping of hands, ſhouting,</hi> and <hi>ſinging.</hi>—"O clap your hands, all ye people, ſhout unto GOD with the voice of triumph: For the LORD moſt high is terrible; he is a great

King over all the earth.—<hi>Sing praiſes to God, ſing praiſes; Sing praiſes unto our King, ſing praiſes: For God is the King of all the earth, ſing ye praiſes with underſtanding.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praiſe,</hi> is expreſſive of that part of devotion, in which we celebrate the divine perfections, in the various diſplays of them, in the works of nature, providence and grace; in which GOD's people great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, and particularly celebrate, any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favours and bleſſings, they have received, and and in which they expreſs their faith, hope and truſt in GOD, and make it their concern to render to the LORD the glory due to his name. Agreable to that moſt pathetic wiſh of the holy Pſalmiſt, ſo often mentioned in the hundred and ſeventh Pſalm—"Oh that men would praiſe the LORD, for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the children of men"<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>VARIOUS have been the ways in which GOD's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the ſeveral ages of the church and the world, have expreſſed their grateful acknowledgments to him and endeavoured to praiſe his name: And various have been the religious rites, inſtitutions, means and acts attended upon and uſed, by the ſaints, to excite and aſſiſt in this part of devotion.</p>
            <p>AS to the firſt ages of the church, we have reaſon to ſuppoſe, as ſacred hiſtory is in a great meaſure ſilent upon this ſubject, that the ſaints and people of GOD, under the common guidance of the bleſſed ſpirit, were left very much, to their own diſcretion, both as to means of exciting and manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this part of their duty and this branch of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip. And as we have no reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that men of various tempers, characters and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011601_0013_0F877995B3778D68"/>
circumſtances, would hit upon the ſame methods of expreſſing their reverence for the Deity, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for his favours, it is natural to conclude, that ſocieties, families, and even individuals, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, pi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched upon thoſe means and methods, which, according to their beſt judgment and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appeared moſt ſuitable, and moſt expreſſive of their gratitude and thankfulneſs, for the bleſſings of heaven, with which they were indulged. While there were no ſtanding ordinances, or inſtitutions, of divine appointment, relative to the forms of worſhip; and ſo long as it was diſcretionary, in what way, to expreſs their devotion to GOD, it was of little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, what meaſures were adopted, in religious ſervices, ſo that the heart was found ſincere, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout aſcriptions of glory and praiſe to his name. Accordingly their greatful acknowledgments were expreſſed, ſometimes by ſerious and ſolemn addreſſes to GOD, as the author and giver of bleſſings enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —ſometimes by coſtly ſacrifices, offered upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, dedicated to the ſervice of GOD—ſometimes by religious feſtivals, attended in honour to his name, and ſometimes otherways, as his ſincere worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers thought proper, or as occaſion required.</p>
            <p>WHEN GOD was pleaſed to chuſe a people to himſelf, and bring his church into a covenant ſtate, as under the jewiſh oeconomy, he took the direction of theſe matters more immediately into his own hands; and appointed, both as to rites and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and time and manner of attending them, by his expreſs inſtructions and directions; as in the ſervices of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> enjoin'd by the moſaic inſtitution. By this diſpenſation, which was expreſly given by divine authority, days were
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011601_0014_0F87799664C548C8"/>
appointed for theſe important purpoſes, annually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be obſerved, as feſtivals in honour to GOD, and to ſhew forth his praiſe. By the ſame diſpenſation, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were directed to, and rites, of various kinds were inſtituted, to be attended upon by the people of GOD, as expreſſive of the gratitude of their hearts, and of that internal devotion, which he required and expected, in return for his bleſſings indulged them. And, as expreſſive of their joy in the LORD, and as ſuited to excite and aſſiſt their devotion, in praiſing their GOD, upon theſe and all other joyful occaſions, ſeveral things were admitted, under that diſpenſation, into the worſhip and ſervices of the ſanctuary;—ſuch as <hi>feaſting, ſhouting, blowing of trumpets, clapping of hands, leaping</hi> for joy, and even <hi>dancing</hi>—as <hi>David before the ark of the LORD, when it was brought up from the houſe of Oben<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>AMONG the numerous inſtruments of muſic, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to a divine uſe, in the ſervices of the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and in the worſhip of GOD, the <hi>Harp</hi> and the <hi>Pſaltery,</hi> are frequently mentioned: But by what may be collected from the ſcripture account, <hi>the Organ</hi> was of moſt antient date, and the leading inſtrument, in the divine uſe of inſtrumental muſic. And there is ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe, the <hi>Organ</hi> to have been in uſe, even in the earlieſt ages of the church.<note n="†" place="bottom">vide Gen. 4.21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, then, it is not to be underſtood, that <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental muſic,</hi> even the muſic of the <hi>pſaltery, harp,</hi> or <hi>organ,</hi> however pleaſant and harmonious, were ever introduced into a divine uſe, in the worſhip of GOD, to prevent, or exclude <hi>vocal muſic,</hi> or the voices of men, from being employed in praiſing the LORD. His deſign was, evidently, rather to aſſiſt, than to prevent, the people of GOD, in uſing their tongues to praiſe his great and glorious name. Whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity may have been diſcovered, in muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of human ſtructure; and however ſweet and harmonious their ſounds, when touched by a ſkilful hand; yet, certain it is, No Organs are equal to thoſe of divine conſtruction;—no muſic ſo pleaſant in itſelf—none ſo pleaſant in the ears of the LORD our GOD, as the voices of the ſaints and people, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſacred harmony and regularly employed in celebrating his praiſe. Above all, therefore, <hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the High Praiſes of the LORD,</hi> ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011601_0016_0F877997E0AB7AC8"/>
a moſt eſſential part of this religious ſervice, in the ſanctuary, and was more earneſtly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcated, and more generally attended to, in publick aſſemblies, for divine worſhip, as what greater numbers might be perſonally engaged in, and as better ſuited, than any other part of divine worſhip, at once to expreſs, excite, aſſiſt and inflame their pious affections, religious zeal and heavenly devotion.</p>
            <p>A gracious GOD, with ſmiles of approbation, in his providence, countenanced and encouraged his people, to make proficiency in a ſervice, ſo pleaſing to him and ſo profitable and delightful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. His countenance and encouragement, to his church and people, in this matter, were clearly diſcovered, in a variety of inſtances. The divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and acceptance of ſo excellent a ſervice, were peculiarly manifeſt, as under the ſpecial directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heaven, various ſteps were taken, from time to time, by the leaders of the people and the moſt eminent of his ſervants, to bring this part of divine worſhip to its greateſt perfection; and to render it moſt engaging to men, and moſt uſeful to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant purpoſes of piety and devotion.</p>
            <p>To aſſiſt his people in praiſing his name, and to prepare their minds with ſubjects and themes worthy his praiſe, an all-condeſcending GOD inſpires a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ſervants and prophets, with a concern for his honour and zeal for his ſervice and glory, in this part of his worſhip, and ſets their tongues and pens a going.—Under the immediate and powerful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his bleſſed ſpirit, the poetic numbers flow, in moſt exalted ſtrains of gratitude, adoration
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011601_0017_0F877998E4E12598"/>
and praiſe.—The glories of the Deity, the unchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geableneſs of his nature, the excellency of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the majeſty of his kingdom, the wiſdom of his government, the greatneſs of his goodneſs and the riches of his grace, as clearly diſplayed in the works of nature, providence and redemption, are ſome of the themes to which their attention is called, as ſuited to excite the gratitude of men and aſſiſt them to celebrate the praiſes of their GOD.—Pſalms, hymns, and heavenly ſongs, are thus compoſed for the uſe of the church; and in matter and meaſure, happily prepared for the ſervice of the ſanctuary: And, at the ſame time, in number and variety of ſubjects, wiſely calculated for the uſe of GOD's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon every occaſion and in every circumſtance, that did, or might occur to them in life. So that a gracious GOD, has not only invited his people to ſo delightful a duty, but put words into their mouth, to celebrate his praiſe.</p>
            <p>BUT not enough, that GOD's people were thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſuitable ſubjects and matter of praiſe, that his praiſes might be ſung in a manner worthy ſo exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a theme, the utmoſt care is taken to promote ſo important a ſervice. Inſpired with a pious zeal for the glory of GOD, and knowing it to be of no ſmall importance to the honour of his name, in promoting true devotion, in this part of his worſhip, that the <hi>muſic</hi> itſelf ſhould be decent, regular and engaging, the chief Rulers and Fathers of the people are not wanting, to uſe their utmoſt endeavours, as well as influence and authority, to encourage, cultivate and promote ſo pleaſing, ſo uſeful an art, for ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a purpoſe.—In a word, their aim is, that the harmony of Zion might at once, expreſs the devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of her children, and excite them to aſpire to ſing, in higher accents and ſtill more exalted ſtrains of praiſe.</p>
            <p>ALL, indeed, cannot be ſuppoſed, to have had the gift of, the <hi>ear</hi> and <hi>voice</hi> for <hi>muſic;</hi> tho' all might ſincerely join in the devotion, intended and expreſſed in this part of the worſhip of GOD's houſe: But yet, that ſo uſeful an inſtitution ſhould want no aſſiſtance, to make it as general, and extenſively beneficial, as poſſible, peculiar pains were taken in the church, both to find and to inſtruct ſuch as had talents, adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this purpoſe, and a genius for muſic, and to prepare them to lead and aſſiſt, in the ſervices of the ſanctuary; to the end, that in a manner, moſt regular, correct and harmonious, and beſt becoming the houſe and worſhip of GOD, this part might be performed.—That GOD's people in general, even the <hi>whole congregation,</hi> might be led and aſſiſted in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſe to their King and their GOD —That all might be enabled, in a good meaſure at leaſt, agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the direction in the text to <hi>ſing with underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in the manner, as well as matter of the ſong— and, at the ſame time, catch the attention, charm the ear, awaken the affections, engage the hearts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the devotion of all around.</p>
            <p>TO this purpoſe <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>ſweet ſinger</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had his <hi>muſicians</hi>—his <hi>Chief Muſicians,</hi>

            <p>TO the ſame end, <hi>Solomon,</hi> his ſon, in the Aera of whoſe reign, the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of GOD's choſen people arrived at the ſummit of their glory, and the beſt part of whoſe time, after he came to the throne, by divine appointment, was employed in building the <hi>Temple,</hi> and appointing the worſhip and ſervices of the ſanctuary, took care of this part of worſhip, and appointed his <hi>Men Singers</hi> and <hi>Women Singers;</hi> as alſo, <hi>and more eſpecially,</hi> for the temple ſervice and the worſhip of GOD, <hi>the Levites, which were Singers, were</hi> appointed, <hi>as one, to make one ſound to be heard when they lifted up their voice—and praiſed the LORD, ſaying, For he is good, for his mercy endureth forever.</hi>

            <p>BUT this is not all: Further to ſhow the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and propriety of this method of praiſing GOD, and our obligations hereto, it may be obſerved, that many of the pſalms and hymns, in ſacred writ, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the inſpired penmen, for the uſe of GOD's church and people, in this part of divine worſhip,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011601_0021_0F87799D258E1708"/>
are conceived in terms ſuited to remind all of their duty, in this reſpect: And ſome of them contain expreſs injunctions and exhortations hereto. —"It is a <hi>good thing</hi>", ſays the Pſalmiſt "to give thanks unto the LORD, and to ſing praiſes unto thy name, O moſt high." <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm 92.1, 2.111.1.</note> "Praiſe ye the LORD. I will praiſe the LORD with my whole heart, in the aſſembly of the upright, and in the congregation." "Praiſe ye the LORD: For it is good to ſing praiſes unto our GOD; for it is pleaſant, and praiſe is comely." <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 147.1.</note> For theſe and other important reaſons, the holy Pſalmiſt reſolves, ſaying, "I will ſing to the LORD as long as I live; I will ſing praiſe unto my GOD, while I have any being" <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſ. 104.33.</note> And, in full proof of what has been advanced, with regard to this important branch of divine worſhip, the pſalm before us, which is an exhortation to praiſe the LORD, but moſt directly the words of our text, may be added, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the nature and authority of a command.—<hi>Sing praiſes to God, ſing praiſes; Sing praiſes unto our King, ſing praiſes: For GOD is the King of all the earth, ſing ye praiſes with underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE the duty, of which we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is exhorted to and enjoined, in words too plain to be miſunderſtood—too clear to admit of diſpute, or need any comment.—The reaſon with which the injunction is enforced upon us, that the glorious Being, to whom we are exhorted to ſing praiſes, is our GOD and King—and the King of all the earth, or ſovereign of the world, is both clear and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, eaſy to be conceived of, and univerſally bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For ſurely no one will draw in queſtion his

obligations to God, in either of the characters here mentioned; or the reaſonableneſs of aſcribing to him the glory and praiſe that are juſtly his due. And as to the manner in which this duty is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is here repreſented conciſely and expreſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We are to ſing praiſes <hi>with underſtanding.</hi> That is, <hi>intelligently,</hi> with regard to ourſelves, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or entering into the ſpirit of the matter and ſubject of what we ſing, and whereby the devotion of our hearts is expreſſed; and alſo, as being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the manner of the heavenly ſong, and thoſe modulations of the voice, and modes of ſinging, which are decent and becoming devotion and praiſe:—<hi>Intelligibly,</hi> with reſpect to others, both as to matter and manner of the divine ſongs, in and by which our devotion to God is expreſſed.— Herein improving, both hymns and tunes, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for general uſe, and conforming ourſelves to ſome ſtanding rules and meaſures, in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, which are or may be, eaſily known to others, with whom we worſhip, and who join us in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic expreſſions of gratitude to God. Thus we ſhall, like <hi>the Levites, the ſingers</hi> in God's church of old, (as abovementioned) <hi>as one, make one,</hi> or the ſame delightful <hi>ſound,</hi> of muſic and harmony, to be heard, when <hi>we lift up our voices to praiſe the LORD:</hi>— And in this way, like the ſaints above, the door is open for thouſands and thouſands, to join in the ſame acts of devotion, to ſpeak the ſame things both <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligently</hi> to themſelves, and <hi>intelligibly</hi> to each other, and with one heart and with one voice, to praiſe the LORD.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:011601_0023_0F87799EA3F31830"/>SHOULD it be ſaid, that ſinging to the LORD, or ſinging his praiſe, is a rite or ceremony peculiar to the <hi>legal</hi> or <hi>moſaic</hi> diſpenſation; and that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſhared the ſame fate with other ceremonial rites, upon the introduction of the goſpel: It may be anſwered—That, to prove, that this is a way of expreſſing our devotion to GOD and gratitude for his favours, which is well pleaſing to him, under the <hi>goſpel,</hi> as well as under the <hi>law;</hi>—we need only ſay, that our bleſſed LORD, when upon earth, with his diſciples, worſhipped GOD, in this way—and by his example, manifeſted his approbation of it and taught us our duty.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 26.30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER to ſatisfy ourſelves, if we think this an inſufficient warrant for us, in this matter; it may be ſerved, that the apoſtles, with whom, our LORD, when he aſcended up to heaven, left the immediate care of the church, undoubtedly received it in this light.—One apoſtle expreſly exhorts, to the <hi>ſinging of pſalms,</hi> as expreſſive of our ſacred joy in, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to GOD. <note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. 5.13.</note> And another, for our example and inſtruction, tells us how this duty ſhould be attended—even as other acts of devotion, — <hi>with the ſpirit and with the underſtanding alſo.</hi>

            <p>IT hence appears, that as <hi>ſinging praiſe</hi> to God, as a part of divine worſhip, is not ſo novel an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to be deemed an unjuſtifiable innovation in the church: So it is not of ſo antient ſtanding, as to be out of date, or aboliſhed.—Saints under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are equally obliged and encouraged hereto, as under the law: And it is a peculiar glory of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel age, that—

good effect, to the purpoſe of our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. —When ſuch compoſitions; ſuch <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi> as, in themſelves, breathe the true ſpirit of religion, and are well adapted, at once, to lead, aſſiſt, excite and expreſs the devotion of the heart and ſoul to our GOD and King, are ſet to muſic; and the parts of muſic are well adapted to the ſentiments therein expreſſed, and well perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is not eaſy to conceive, the powerful influence it will have upon us, or the happy effects, it will have a natural tendency to produce.—The attention is rouſed, the paſſions are compoſed, the affections are engaged, the devotion is enlivened, and the <hi>whole ſoul</hi> is ſweetly drawn forth into the exerciſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and in moſt devout acknowledgments of praiſe to GOD. Our hearts are diſpoſed to receive the great truths of religion, our minds are prepared to digeſt and improve the inſtructions we receive, and thus our faith is confirmed, our love increaſed, our truſt encouraged, our hope ſtrengthned, a more endeared intimacy and communion with GOD eſtabliſhed, more laſting impreſſions are made upon us, and a more ſolid foundation laid for the flouriſhing growth of all the virtues and graces of the divine life, which are to the praiſe and glory of GOD.</p>
            <p>Do we conſider it, then, as a way pointed out by GOD, in his word, as well as rational and natural in itſelf, to expreſs our devotion to him:—Do we view it as a ſuitable method, of expreſſing all the pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ſoul, to that GOD, to whom we are indebted for life and favour, and upon whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for every bleſſing, it muſt appear a moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and delightful part of religious worſhip—And more eſpecially, will it appear a duty moſt engaging

Several things, ſuggeſted in and deducible from the preceeding diſcourſe, are particularly worthy our ſpecial notice and ſerious attention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:011601_0028_0F8779A55F943E68"/>FIRST, we are taught the great condeſcenſion and goodneſs of GOD, in permitting us, ſinful, unworthy creatures, to approach his preſence, to worſhip, adore and praiſe his great and glorious name: and eſpecially, that he is pleaſed, not only to accept, but alſo to be well pleaſed with, and to account himſelf glorified by, the ſincere ſervices of his people, in <hi>ſinging praiſe</hi> to his name.—It is condeſcention in the majeſty of heaven, to behold the things that are done therein, to receive the worſhip, adoration and praiſes of the heavenly hoſt—well may we then with grateful won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cry out—<hi>LORD, what is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the children of men, that thou haſt any regard unto them!</hi>—Often let us reflect upon this amazing inſtance of the goodneſs and condeſcention of our GOD and king; and as often let our ſouls be humbled within us, that we have been no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a ſenſe of the greatneſs of the priviledge we have ſo long enjoyed and ſo greatly abuſed.—And let our paſt neglect and abuſe of ſo high a priviledge, be an argument, effectually to awaken us, to a ſenſe of our high obligations, and excite us to the greateſt concern to improve our time, and employ our tongues, in celebrating the praiſes of that GOD, to whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grace we are indebted, for the opportunity we ſtill have allowed us, to ſing praiſe to his name — Yea, with the pious Pſalmiſt, let us reſolve, that we <hi>will ſing to the LORD as long as we live.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Is ſinging praiſes to the LORD, a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo rational and delightful, and ſo eſſential a part of the worſhip of GOD; hence we ſee the peculiar obligations we are under, for the wiſe proviſion he
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011601_0029_0F8779A6EEBB9F80"/>
has made, for our direction and aſſiſtance herein.—As "GOD hath not left himſelf without a witneſs", reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his providential care of the world of mankind, <hi>in that he hath</hi> all along, <hi>done them good, and given them rain from heaven:</hi> ſo neither <hi>hath he left himſelf without a witneſs,</hi> in the care of his church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the religion and worſhip, he hath called them to obſerve. The gracious care of a merciful GOD, was early manifeſt in a divine revelation of his will, relative to faith and worſhip, and, in all ſucceeding ages, down to the preſent time, in preſerving his word, in its purity, for the uſe and direction of his people, in both theſe reſpects, as a ſtanding and unerring rule of both faith and worſhip.—That we have this word, in our own language, for our directory, is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof of the divine care of the church, and of our obligations to gratitude and thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT, in regard to that branch of our duty and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, of which we have been ſpeaking, we are under peculiar obligations to GOD, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in providing for our direction and aſſiſtance in our attendance upon it. This conſtant care of a faithful GOD, for his church and this part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, appears, more eſpecially, in the following inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In raiſing up and qualifying, in ſpiriting and enabling, ſome of his ſaints and ſervants, ſo faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intelligibly to tranſlate, and reduce to ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poetical meaſures, the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and various other paſſages of the ſacred word, for the uſe of his church and people, in public and private, to aſſiſt in devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſpecially in ſinging the praiſes of GOD —
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011601_0030_0F8779A799FB2368"/>
Without ſuch a work, it would ſcarcely have been poſſible, for GOD's church and people, in a public ſocial way, to have attended this part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip —In this we ſee the providence of GOD, in his care for the ſupport and continuance of ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a part of his worſhip; which demands a grateful remembrance and ſhould be the ſubject of our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent praiſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly ANOTHER inſtance of the divine care and providence, in this important affair, appears in his raiſing up and encouraging men, poſſeſſed of a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for muſic, with great care and pains, to ſearch out and form ſuch an excellent ſyſtem of rules, for the direction of muſic, in its various parts—and to compoſe ſuch a variety of <hi>Tunes,</hi> ſo happily adapted, as to time, meaſure and harmony, to a divine uſe, in public worſhip, upon all occaſions, that whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, however numerous, may join, and with one voice, as well as heart, ſing praiſes unto GOD.</p>
            <p>THIS was a work of no ſmall importance to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the church, in this part of worſhip:—Yea, it was neceſſary; as hereby the harmony of Zion, as to deceney and engaging ſweetneſs, as well as uſe, becomes more general, and is raiſed to higher degrees of perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD is not the author of confuſion,</hi> ſays the apoſtle— and therefore he exhorts—<hi>Let all things be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order.</hi>— <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 14, 33, &amp; 40.</note> Though it is granted, that there is no ſuch thing, as <hi>Holineſs</hi> in one ſound more than another; yet no one can deny, that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Decency</hi> and harmony, in ſinging that is
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011601_0031_0F8779AA17BF29A0"/>
correct and regular—or that there is ſuch a thing as confuſion and diſcord in ſinging, that is without rule and order—where every one follows the dictates of his own humor and inclination. It is, therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſuch ſteps ſhould be taken and ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made, as thoſe but now mentioned, to aſſiſt and direct, as to matter and manner of praiſing GOD— to enable the people of GOD, in a manner becoming their character and his worſhip, to ſing praiſes to his name.—Happy for us, and the church of GOD, theſe things are done to our hand.—And ſuch are the helps, with which we are furniſhed, that by a careful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, the harmony of Zion, might riſe to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection, ſcarcely to be parrallel'd by any ages paſt.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Poetry</hi>—and a <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Muſic,</hi> are gifts of GOD.—It is of GOD to poſſeſs theſe gifts.—It is of GOD and under the influence of his providence and grace, that any of his ſervants have improved them to a divine uſe, and for the ſervice of the church, and ſanctuary, in theſe important inſtances.—To GOD our moſt grateful acknowledgments are due.—To GOD for theſe inſtances of his conſtant care, for his church and his worſhip, let our voices be raiſed, in grateful hymns and ſongs of praiſe.—</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, THE preceeding diſcourſe affords proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, to ſuch as have improved, or are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of improving the means for their direction and aſſiſtance, in the divine uſe of muſic, in the worſhip of GOD. It is, moſt certainly, a laudable ambition, in all, but eſpecially in youth, of both ſexes, to ſtrive to excell, in a ſtudy ſo pleaſant, in an art ſo profitable,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011601_0032_0F8779AB529FB728"/>
and in that, which, by divine grace, may qualify them to glorify GOD, in his houſe, to lead and aſſiſt in his ſervice, and to ſhine as examples of improvement, in ſo delightful a part of his worſhip.</p>
            <p>WE rejoice that there are any, who are engaged in ſo laudable a work, and who are taking thoſe ſteps which may be of uſe to teach them, to ſing praiſes to their GOD and King with underſtanding.—To ſuch we would ſay—We <hi>bid you GOD ſpeed</hi> —and with all our hearts, we wiſh you a bleſſing out of the houſe of the LORD, this day.—May you go on in improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to higher degrees of perfection, in the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, as well as the muſic of the voices, until, by praiſing GOD in his temple here below, you ſhall be fully prepared, with angels round the throne and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in loftier ſtrains, to ſing the praiſes of GOD and the Lamb, in his temple above, for ever and ever!—</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, this ſubject and what has been offered upon it, ſeverely reprove the negligence of all, who have gifts and talents to enable them to ſing praiſes to their GOD and King, and improve them not.</p>
            <p>IT is readily granted, that ſome have not talents for this external act of devotion: ſome, that have neither ear, voice, nor genius for muſic.—But is it not well known, that too many that might, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, at leaſt, attend and bear a part in ſinging praiſe to the LORD, who, either through pride, or baſhfulneſs, or from ſome other cauſe, neglect it — How ſuch can excuſe themſelves, or anſwer it to their conſciences and unto that GOD, whoſe praiſe
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011601_0033_0F8779AB5F128760"/>
they refuſe to celebrate, and whoſe name they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to glorify:—I know not—to their own maſter they ſtand or fall!—Would to GOD, they might be led to think ſeriouſly of their neglect, before it is too late!—But permit me, further, to aſk—Are there not ſome, yea, many, that are culpable, in a ſtill higher degree, in this matter?—Some, that not only neglect to improve, but even abuſe and profane theſe gifts of GOD, to purpoſes of wickedneſs? Is it not amazing, to obſerve, how pleaſant and melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the voices of many are, and how readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in ſinging vain and fooliſh, if not vicious ſongs, to the prophaning of GOD's holy name; and to the depraving their minds, and debauching their morals, who, perhaps, have never once employed their tongues, to ſing their great Creator's praiſe!— Alas, how guilty,—how inexcuſable, muſt ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in the ſight of that GOD, who ſearcheth all hearts,—who cannot be deceived,—who will not be mocked!—</p>
            <p>IN the church of GOD, under the former diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, there were <hi>ſinging men</hi> and <hi>ſinging women,</hi> who praiſed the LORD, for his goodneſs and for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which endureth for ever.—Why ſhould ſo many, who are equally capable of this divine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſervice, be ſilent in the goſpel day?— HAVE we not equal reaſon of praiſe—yea, are we not under greater obligations to ſing the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of GOD and the Redeemer!—In particular, let me aſk—why ſhould there be ſo general a neglect of this, moſt agreable and engaging part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip amongſt the <hi>Female Sex?</hi> Is it modeſty, baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,

pride, want of attention to the nature of the duty, or want of love and reverence to the Deity?— or what is it, that prevents them from honouring GOD, from being ornaments to religion and ſhining exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of devotion?—Certainly no voices are ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, none ſo ſweetly melodious and engaging, as thoſe of <hi>ſinging women,</hi> when rightly tun'd to hymns of praiſe. And ſhall they be the laſt to be perſuaded to engage in a duty, for which they are the firſt in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and for which they have the richeſt gifts and higheſt qualifications?—Have they no mercies to celebrate, no chearful notes to raiſe, no joyful ſongs to ſing, in praiſe of their GOD, their redeemer and King.—But I forbear—</p>
            <p>MAY we all ſeriouſly recollect what has now been (imperfectly) ſuggeſted, and carefully apply it to our own ſouls, for awakening; quickning, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and confirmation, as we find our ſtate requires. Let all be perſuaded to comply with our duty, in this part of divine worſhip, both in the internal devotion and external attendance, upon this divine inſtitution.</p>
            <p>LET thoſe that have genius and voices for muſic, ſtir up the gift that is in them, and be awakened to improve, to the glory of GOD, and to the praiſe of his diſtinguiſhing goodneſs and grace.</p>
            <p>MAY thoſe that have neither genius nor voices, for muſical performances, be yet concerned to praiſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

the devotion of the heart, and of conſequence to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſubject matter of the heavenly ſong, as if their voices were muſic, and the moving of their tongues was harmony itſelf.—It is theirs, therefore, to contemplate the hymns that are ſung by others, and embibing their ſpirit and adopting their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to lift their ſouls to GOD, and make melody in their hearts, to their Redeemer and King.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here it is natural to obſerve, that it might greatly aſſiſt the devotion of ſuch, as cannot join the congregation, in ſinging, to have the books of devotion with them, and the pſalm or hymns, appointed to be ſung, under their eye. This would be an happy means of preſerving the attention, exciting the affections, employing the meditation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling devotion. Whereas, without this help, the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is broken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the thoughts are wandering, and the whole ſpace employed in ſinging is ſpent to but little purpoſe, or waſted away in ſome vain amuſement. And even thoſe that do bare a part in ſinging, it is humbly conceived, would find no ſmall advantage, to the ſame purpoſes, by having the pſalms or hymns they ſing before them—they muſt be more likely to enter into the true ſpirit of the ſong, and of conſequence, more likely to exerciſe true devotion of heart.—For theſe, and ſeveral other reaſons, It cannot but be lamented, that carrying the pſalms and hymns, out of which the portion to be ſung are choſen, to public worſhip with us, is ſo generally neglected. And it is earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all, to reform this neglect, where it has prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by procuring and keeping by them, the books of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, for this part of worſhip, that are in common uſe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>TO ſhut up all: May we all be cautioned againſt reſting in the form of godlineſs, in the outward ſhew of religion. If the heart is not engaged, our worſhip and external acts, will avail us nothing; unleſs it be to enhance our guilt.—"The LORD ſeeth not as man ſeeth: Man looketh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but the LORD on the heart.—The
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011601_0036_0F8779ADB6E82ED0"/>
LORD ſearches the hearts,—He trieth the reins."— Our ſongs of praiſe unleſs attended with true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>with the ſpirit,</hi> as well as underſtanding, will be deemed no better than vain oblations, which are an offence to GOD. Yea, though we are ever ſo well ſkilled in muſic, and though the ſound of our voices, in the external acts of worſhip, have been pleaſant and engaging, as harmony itſelf—and though we have ſhone in the church, as bright ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of higheſt attainments in this part of divine worſhip, all will be in vain, if our hearts are not right in the ſight of GOD:—Our expectations will fail, when GOD ſhall take away the ſoul; and our hope ſhall be like the <hi>ſpiders web,</hi> which, in death, will yield us no ſupport.—To alarm, awaken, and put us upon our guard, againſt a miſtake ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fatal, let us be perſuaded to look forward and conſider how awful, how diſtreſſing it muſt be, at death, to change the ſcenes; and from being engaged in the delightful ſervice of <hi>muſic</hi> and ſinging praiſes with GOD's people, in his temple on earth, to paſs to join the haters of the LORD, in curſing and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his name in regions of deſpair for ever and ever! —An awful thought!— may it be deeply impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on every heart!—</p>
            <p>BUT are we ſincere, in our devotion to GOD, and in praiſing his name; then may we hope from praiſing him imperfectly on earth, to paſs to ſing in perfection above: and with angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and with the whole multitude of the redeemed of the LORD, to aſcribe praiſe, and bleſſing, and honor, and glory, and power, to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb, forever and ever. Which GOD, of his infinite mercy grant, for his mercy's ſake, in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
