            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ERFECT obedience to the moſt holy law, is the fixed medium of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with its author. And the impoſſibility of ſuch obedience, in thoſe who are any way chargeable with ſin, made the neceſſity of CHRIST'S appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in human nature, for the purpoſes of ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as well as ſacrifice; that GOD might be juſt, and yet the juſtifier of them who believe in JESUS. But as man was originally formed for ſuch obedience in himſelf, his pride ſtill ſtimulates him that way; and though, in reſpect of his original abilities, he is become like the beaſts that periſh, he ſtill truſts in himſelf that he is righteous. This was the ſpirit of thoſe to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, "by the deeds of the law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight." And again, "a man is not juſtified by the works of the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the faith of JESUS CHRIST." On
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009895_0003_0F7AD329F51AA678"/>
which he ſoon ſucceeded to convince the <hi>Galatian</hi> churches, and in their turn the <hi>Roman</hi> too. But this method of acceptance with GOD not being natural, they made no long ſtand in the ſimplicity of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; ſo that when St. <hi>James</hi> came to proſecute the ſame deſign, he found the word among them was, "Do ye believe?—Do ye own the faith of CHRIST?" And whoſoever made an affirmative anſwer, was a good chriſtian, without regard to the diſtinguiſhing qualities of his faith, or its influence on heart or life. So they were generally believers, and as generally careleſs, ungodly livers. To them, in this light, St. <hi>James</hi> cries out, <hi>"Can faith ſave you?—Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works is dead."</hi>—"This is not the ſort of faith which <hi>Paul</hi> taught, but another, a counterfeit, a dead ſort." So that theſe two apoſtles ſpeak of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, and not contradictorily of the ſame thing. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of true faith, St. <hi>James</hi> of a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and moſt dangerous ſort of faith to be depended on. The former denies works to be the ground of a ſinner's juſtification in the ſight of GOD. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requires them as the ſaint's vindication of his profeſſion in the ſight of men. One ſays, the ſinner's works can't ſave him; the other ſays, the ſaint's works muſt prove him to be what he pretends. St. <hi>James</hi> found the chriſtians of his time made high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to faith, and actually had a great deal of what they called by that name; yet, ſays he to them, ye may know 'tis a counterfeit ſort by your unevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical tempers and lives; whereas if your faith was right, its fruits would juſtify it; ſuch a ſight of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine righteouſneſs and grace would be imported in it, as could not fail to ſhew your own vileneſs, and ſo take away the occaſion of pride, and make you deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It would alſo give ſuch ſight of the purity of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009895_0004_0F7AD5061BDE8D50"/>
divine nature and law, as would transform your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the likeneſs of GOD, and make you holy, like his moſt holy law; whereas the faith you have, leaves you earthly, carnal, vain. The effect which a man's faith has upon his temper and life, proves what ſort it is. Ye ſee, therefore, ſays he, "how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only." That is, not by being able to ſay that he believes, for that is not the evidence of true faith, nor will juſtify any one's pretenſions to it; the devils can with great truth ſay they believe. When there is nothing but belief, in a man's religion, no <hi>divine truth,</hi> or genuine virtue of its ſpirit; and ſo no transforming effect, no holy fruits, 'tis thereby determined to be deluſive. If faith be without works 'tis dead. All this is as true now, as it was in St. <hi>James</hi>'s time. That faith which of its own nature makes a humble, ſelf-loathing, ſelf-denying, and of courſe a grace-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting bent of mind, and ſo a life evidently bearing the heavenly impreſs, is as ſurely ſaving, as the word of GOD is true; and the want of theſe in any one's belief, as evidently proves the contrary. This, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, might give ſurprize to many, and make them each begin to ſay,
<q>the LORD have mercy upon me! What ſhall I do? I ſee I have faith plenty, I believe all things, in general, which the bible teaches; but alas! I don't find it affects my heart or life much. I am proud, vain, worldly, paſſionate, negligent of duties, yet believe all the time; I fear my faith is dead, and that I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in my religion to this very day. My life certainly ſtares againſt me; I don't find my faith is humble and ſanctifying. I can have it as well in a careleſs way, as any; and don't this look like dead faith indeed? I don't find peace toward GOD;
<pb facs="unknown:009895_0005_0F7AD50764216B90"/>
ſomething within tells me I am not right; am I not yet in the gall of bitterneſs, and under the bonds of iniquity, without GOD, without CHRIST, and without hope in the world! And ſo have been every moment of my paſt life in immediate danger of eternal burnings, having never had one thing about me, with which GOD is pleaſed; always deceiving myſelf with this notional faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT perhaps all this is only ſurprize, and you are not yet convinced that your faith is falſe, and ſo damning inſtead of ſaving. Perhaps you don't ſee that your belief is eſſentially defective; but rather that it might do, if you had more of it, or if you had lived more agreeably. Perhaps you don't ſee, that, as readily as you have entertained the faith you have, you are thoroughly averſe to that which is divine; and that true faith never begins with any thing leſs than omnipotence; and that GOD never beſtows it, but on ſuch as have wholly loſt ſight of all ability and goodneſs in themſelves. On this ſuppoſition, how great the dangerous and growing diſtance between your ſoul and ſaving faith to this day? And what reaſon have thoſe who can pray to cry out and ſay, <q>O thou GOD of the ſpirits of all fleſh! who ſeeſt and judgeſt the ſecrets of all hearts; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, perfectly knoweſt, the inward ſtate of every ſoul here, and what ſort of faith we are riſking our eternity upon; be pleaſed, for the ſake of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect atonement, to ſhine in theſe dark ſouls this day, to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, as it appears to faith, in the face of JESUS CHRIST. And ſuffer no proud, ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous deluſion to prevent genuine conviction and light, by the plain account of true and falſe faith which may now be exhibited. And as every heart
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009895_0006_0F7AD507BB6133D0"/>
is naturally bent againſt it, with all its might, 'till conquered by mere power of truth, ſo let thy power now be glorious in its going forth from conquering to conquer, 'till every heart of thy choſen ſhall bow to this only faith of the great Redeemer, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </q>
Let us now attend to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſtinctions between true and falſe faith, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. True faith commences at the very time when the ſinner firſt finds all his ſoul needs, in the bible's account of JESUS CHRIST, neither ſooner nor later; but a dead faith never commences at that time.</p>
            <p n="2">II. True faith always affects the mind in a manner anſwerable to the nature of its objects; a dead faith never.</p>
            <p n="3">III. True faith produces juſt ſuch effects, as the ſcriptures aſcribe to true faith; but a dead faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces none of them. It has no ſort of divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all.</p>
            <p n="1">I. TRUE faith then begins when CHRIST with his own truth, and glorious ſufficiency is firſt made known to the ſinner. By which it will appear that dead faith has no ſuch commencement. Here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE ſhall ſhew that there is an abſolute and univerſal neceſſity for CHRIST to be ſpecially made known to a perſon in order to his ſalvation. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT this muſt be by faith, or in believing the goſpel, and that there is no other way for a ſinner to be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SHALL give ſome account of the manner in which ſuch faith is wrought.—Which will ſhew the nature and work of faith in the ſinner's juſtification, and that it is peculiar to divine faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE is an abſolute neceſſity of a revelation of CHRIST to the ſinner for his ſalvation. Now if
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009895_0007_0F7AD5086EF11700"/>
we are not well aſſured of this neceſſity, the doctrine of faith, as the alone mean of juſtification, will be to us as the doctrine of the croſs was of old, to ſome a ſtumbling block, to others fooliſh. Not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of our moral ruin is the grand reaſon why the doctrine of faith as taught in the ſcriptures, is ſo little regarded; they who are whole need not the phyſician. Let us take then a hint or two of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that this ruin is ours.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) IF death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, for two thouſand five hundred years, over ſuch as never committed one actual tranſgreſſion; then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature muſt be in a fallen guilty ſtate; but death did ſo reign.—<hi>Rom.</hi> v. 14. Now death is the greateſt puniſhment that ever was inflicted; ſuch puniſhment thoſe ſubjects deſerved, if GOD is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his executions; but as they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no actual tranſgreſſion, how could they deſerve it, unleſs by an univerſally corrupted and ruined nature! And yet that ſame puniſhment hath paſſed upon all men, becauſe all men, in that ſame ſenſe, have ſinned. There is therefore no way or name under heaven, given among men, by which they may be ſaved, but that of JESUS of <hi>Nazareth, Acts.</hi> iv. 10, 12. Nor any ſalvation by him, but through faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8. 'Tis no evaſion of this argument to ſay it was only bodily death that ſo reigned as the apoſtle ſays; becauſe death of the body is great puniſhment, and ſo the argument is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> 'tis inconſiſtent with the nature of GOD and his government to puniſh thoſe who are not guilty.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If we have all a natural freedom to ſin, but no ſuch natural freedom to be holy and heavenly; then our natures are ſinful and not holy. This is evident to common ſenſe. But nothing that worketh abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009895_0008_0F7AD5090AC7AC90"/>
or maketh a lie, can, as ſuch, enter heaven, nor can we be renewed from ſuch ſtate, but through faith.—Therefore, he that believeth, ſhall be ſaved, and he who believeth not ſhall be damned, <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) IF one died for all, then were all dead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14. Now though the <hi>all</hi> for whom CHRIST died, is to be underſtood in the moſt reſtrained ſenſe, for the elect only; it will doubtleſs be allowed that they are not naturally in a worſe ſtate than the non-elect; but then the conſequence is, all are as ſurely dead in ſin by nature, as that CHRIST died for any.—Only therefore in him who raiſeth the dead is there any poſſible hope of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE only way to be ſaved by him, is through faith. Faith is believing GOD. Hence <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith is thus deſcribed, (<hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 3)—'tis a believing the record which GOD has given of his ſon,—1 <hi>John</hi> v. 10, 11. True faith is ſuch a belief as makes its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, preſent and certain realities in the mind; juſt as it is in believing a common fact,—<hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 1. Of conſequence, a believer is one who is affected with divine things, juſt as if they were preſent realities, even as a common fact affects us as a common truth, when we believe it; and by this he ſtands diſtinguiſhed from all ſubjects of counterfeit faith in the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 10. Now we muſt be ſaved through ſuch faith only, or by our own goodneſs altogether, or partly by both. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not by our own goodneſs altogether; for if we were without ſin at all, and our obedience was quite perfect, we could merit nothing, 'tis all already due; what can we then do, now that we are altogether ſinful? Nay, our utmoſt can't begin to anſwer the native demands of the moſt holy law, becauſe they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009895_0009_0F7AD50A68C43010"/>
are all perfect, and we are ſo in nothing. And if we can't begin, what can we do? Beſide, no perſon in the world is naturally willing to be holy, "the carnal mind is <hi>enmity</hi> againſt GOD, not ſubject to his law, nor indeed can be;" (<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7)—and if not willing, if emnity in the abſtract, what can we do? Truly nothing at all.—Therefore, curſed is the man that truſteth in man, himſelf, or any other, 2. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved partly by both; firſt, becauſe we have no ſuch goodneſs, as has been ſhewn; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no part of the glory of his grace, will CHRIST divide to another; (<hi>Iſa.</hi> xlii. 7, 8)—therefore,—3. We are ſhut up to faith, to mere believing in the ſenſe above deſcribed, for juſtification and acceptance with GOD. But now the queſtion is, have we got this only ſaving precious faith? He who has, is now in a ſtate of acceptance with GOD, and ſhall be found in CHRIST without ſpot and blameleſs.—But he who has not this only ſaving faith, is yet in his ſins; all his life's tranſgreſſions are now lying againſt him in the book of GOD. What a dreadful catalogue fills out the long pages of that moſt voluminous record! Such as dare to trifle with cleanſing blood, and free mercy, 'till righteouſneſs terminates divine patience, will there find a long detail of crimes beyond their expectation! Sins of childhood, youth and riper years; of heart and lip and life; ſecret iniquities, which they thought no eye beheld; thoſe which have galled their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and they well remember; alſo thouſands which (ſurpriſed to ſee) they thought long ſince forgot; millions more, which they hoped would be excuſed.—Nay, whole ſheets are filled with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties; not becauſe they did them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe profanely or proudly done. And the blackeſt charge of all is,
<q>ye would not come to me, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009895_0010_0F7AD50B1E86B668"/>
ye might have life.</q>
There is truſting to falſe hopes, ſelf-righteouſneſs and duties; crucifying CHRIST, deſpiſing the blood of the covenant; ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths and ſermons trifled away; means and mercies always abuſed. Providence, word and ſpirit all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned; ſun and moon, houſe and friends, bed and board, life and health all abuſed to divers luſts and pleaſures. And when they ſee hell ſubjoined to every page, and burning flames to every line, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer there, what will they do? The word of GOD condemns them; the perfect knowledge of the judge condemns them; and conſcience from within, echoes truth to every charge. Theſe are the three books by which the world is judged, and which for that purpoſe <hi>John</hi> ſaw opened in the judgment. And when ſinners, long called to faith by a kind redeemer, come to ſee theſe three records of divine authority, opened before them, they will turn their own accuſers, and each amazed, begin to ſay,
<q>Oh ſtupid wretch that I was! Oh hardened rebel to this dreadful GOD! How long he called me, but I ſtill refuſed! He warned, he waited, but I would not hear. Long time his bowels yearned, for he ſaw my ſtate, he ſaw my danger, and this final day a coming. Indeed he told me all about it, but I choſe my own deluſions, was pleaſed with ſin, and would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it. I know he offered pardon if I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; he bid me truſt his mercy, and I ſhould be ſaved. But here, this heart held faſt its idols, and would not let them go; yet hoped for heaven, dreaming of faith, of duties, and of ſins forgiven. And now my time is gone, the door is ſhut, and he whoſe mercies I have abuſed, is now my judge, my dreadful avenger; no hope remains, there's no eſcape; his eye ſees through me, and his guards are
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009895_0011_0F7AD50C0B485228"/>
round me! The thunder riſes! Torment increaſes! My ſoul is ſinking in the gulph of vengeance forever and ever!</q>
There are they who deſpiſed the goſpel, and deſpiſed the ſaviour; were bid believe his truth, and truſt his grace, but never did; were often warned of certain ruin in every other way, but ſtill would give ear to lying vanities; they <hi>muſt</hi> lie in chains, muſt burn in hell forever and ever. More ages than this world has ſtood, won't bring relief. Their old heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, they have the ſame luſts and paſſions, the ſame taſte and averſions, which always governed them; yea, they are incenſed and increaſed, old reſtraints are taken off, and reſtleſs fury burns within; felt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and black diſpair inflames and rages all their powers; and theſe by diſtortion always grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt from nature and juſtice make that hell eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>NOTHING leſs than all this, is the certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of deluſion in point of faith:—For GOD will bring every thing into judgment; and "he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned." This ſhould excite the grand inquiry,—how ſhall I become acquainted with true faith? Or, how ſhall we know whether our faith is living or dead faith? Which brings me to,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE third thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To give ſome account of a ſaving change as wrought in the ſinner's heart; which will ſhew that it is peculiar to divine faith. Here we ſhould ſpeak,—1. Of the ſinner's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought down from his towering hopes of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with GOD, by his own righteouſneſs, to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he is, in order that mere mercy might have all the honor of his ſalvation. We have already ſhewn that all are naturally dead in ſin; in which ſtate, they are either ſo ſtupid as not to apprehend danger, or ſo far blinded with their notions of goodneſs in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009895_0012_0F7AD50CCA1A49D8"/>
themſelves, as to hope for deliverance thereby.—They are either hardened to eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> or are rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in goods, and ſo have need of nothing; though in fact they are wretched and miſerable, and poor, and blind and naked; not a moment's peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; always under wrath.—Know nothing of the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, or of communion with GOD, nor taſte any ſweets in holy religion.—Their hearts are pleaſed with ſin, but cordially delight in nothing that is divine.—And though they are always unhappy, their hearts being like the troubled ſea, never at reſt, knowing nothing of the nature of peace; yet they have a ſtrange ſort of eaſineſs, and froſt-bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pleaſure.—They make themſelves ſecure, by a guard againſt thoughts of GOD, religion, and death; they make themſelves hope things will end well, by falſe notions of GOD, and of their own goodneſs. In ſuch like manner men lead their lives, not one perſon exempt, of any ſort, 'till, it may be, GOD is pleaſed to alarm one, and that none of the beſt; for publicans and harlots ſhall go into the kingdom of heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who think well of themſelves. The means of this alarm are the words of GOD, with their inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attendants the Holy Ghoſt. The occaſion may be taken from death, ſickneſs, word read or preached, ſignal providence, or dictate of conſcience; but the power of GOD is not reſtrained to all theſe, he may ſeize a perſon in the midſt of his career, as <hi>Saul</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſperouſly to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> Often the effect of this alarm, is only reformation of known ſins, or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the practice of ſome known duty. And this naturally becomes a new ground of pride and ſelf-righteouſneſs; for the ſinner knowing no better ground of truſt, always puts importance upon what he thinks good in himſelf; here therefore many, doubtleſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009895_0013_0F7AD50E2423FBD0"/>
very many, ſit down, and here they die. But the ſcriptures, which are our grand rule in theſe matters, aſſures us, not only that GOD can, but that he often does, with little or no diſtinction of time, give the ſinner his killing wound, and his healing grace; for 'tis all the ſame with him, to ſay, "I kill, and I make alive," or to do the work. This was illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in the forementioned caſe of <hi>Saul;</hi> the woman of <hi>Samaria;</hi> the thief on the croſs, and others; and was repreſented in the reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and other like inſtances. But a ſtate of ſin, guilt, death and wrath, muſt be ſeen and felt, for the whole need not a phyſician; and CHRIST came only to ſave ſuch as are loſt, and to none can he be precious but thoſe who feel that character. This was the caſe of the convinced jailor, and the thouſands at <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 37.—Some are by light of truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to come forth ſooner, others later.—Some go along kicking againſt the pricks, reſiſting light and conviction. 'Tis a metaphor taken from a dull ox, who will rather kick againſt the pointed goad, than yield to work, and quicken his pace; though by trying to repel the goad, he only hurts himſelf the more. Convictions make no alteration in the ſinners moral ſtate, no more than a perſon's continuing to feel pain in the riſing of a diſtemper, cures it. They are the ſinner's ſight of himſelf, and when he is brought to ſee himſelf compleatly fit for immediate damnation, free grace will be glorious, if he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; for the excellency of the power will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to be of GOD. And 'till this is the caſe, be it ſooner or later, delivering grace will not appear. But when the ſinner is brought to ſee himſelf loſt, two things remarkably take place. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His old excuſes, in which he uſed to perſuade
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009895_0014_0F7AD50E8068DBC0"/>
himſelf there was ſome reaſon, now appear to be willing, diſcontented evaſions of known truth and duty, and ſo greatly enhance his guilt. Theſe fig leaves, not only will not cover him, but he ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by ſo much the more expoſed to wrath for them; they are now numbered among his great iniquities, and ſerve eminently to condemn him, as evidence in fact of the pride and enmity of his whole heart againſt the truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His duties and good qualifications, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hope, totally diſappear. Before his convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yea always 'till now, he thought there were ſome good things about him, which kept his ſelf-righteous ſpirit alive, and which ſhewed itſelf. 1. By an habitual conceit that GOD intended to be merciful to him. 2. By a turn of mind againſt thoſe who did not think well of his moral ſtate; and conſequently by a diſpoſition to careſs thoſe who flattered his hopes. 3. By his habit of thinking there were ſome worſe in the ſight of GOD than himſelf. 4. By his inward diſaffection to diſcourſes or books which ſtrenuouſly excluded <hi>all works</hi> in juſtification; and his real plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when ſome conſideration for them was aſſerted. 5. By his thinking it hard that ſuch as he ſhould be doomed to eternal hell.—But now he views himſelf as a ſinner, a hearty helpleſs ſinner, his conſcience and the law teſtify of a righteous judge, but he ſees no beauty in him that he ſhould be deſired; for in this, thoſe views of GOD which legal fear gives, are eſſentially different from thoſe of faith and love. By the former he is viewed as an avenger, by the other as a father and a friend. One keeps the ſoul under ſlaviſh principles, and ſhuts out love; the other brings the ſoul in ſight of rich favour, and caſts out ſlaviſh fear. Of conſequence, the former forbids
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009895_0015_0F7AD50F2FF86540"/>
delight and pleaſure in any duty or ſervice of religion; the latter feels the ways of wiſdom all-pleaſant.</p>
            <p>THE ſinner thus come to himſelf, but not to GOD, to whom he never ſaw himſelf farther off than now, finds, in oppoſition to all his former imaginations, that what he needs is a new heart to be created in him, and another, a right ſpirit to be put within him; and he finds 'tis equally unattainable by him as to create a world out of nothing; for he knows he has no ability or fitneſs for the work.—He is totally blind, to all the things of the ſpirit of GOD, he don't ſee or feel things as the bible repreſents them; don't hate ſin for its nature, but for its puniſhment; don't love religion for its excellency, but only for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it gives hope of.—He ſees he don't venture his <hi>all</hi> on the merit of CHRIST alone, or truſt his truth; <hi>he has no faith.</hi>—He can't truſt the word of a GOD, he has tried every mean for it all in vain; he is as full of pride and unbelief as ever, and his ſin, guilt, and condemnation increaſing by all he thinks and all he does.—Which introduces the following things, and in the following order, <hi>viz.</hi>—1. That the wound of his caſe is, he is wholly deſtitute of the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of holineſs. This ſhews why his heart will not yield to GOD, 'tis becauſe there is no principle or ſpring of right action there. He ſees now why his duties could not help him, becauſe they muſt be like himſelf, as wide from morally right, as unlike GOD, and the commanding law, as he himſelf is. Juſt ſo, he ſees, of courſe, is the utmoſt he can do; and ſo he finds 'tis not in man to direct his ſteps; now he learns the mournful truth, "thou haſt deſtroyed thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf." A clear conviction of this, will naturally, 2. Introduce a ſuſpenſion of arms in his oppoſing, quarrelling heart. The ſinner naturally practiſed his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009895_0016_0F7AD50FC8919698"/>
oppoſition by a living diſobedience to the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of GOD; and now ſince his convictions, his oppoſition has been eſpecially pointed againſt faith, as the only means of juſtification; he has ſhewed his enmity by refuſing to truſt his polluted ſoul, his guilty conſcience in the hand of CHRIST for pardon and cleanſing. CHRIST has bidden the ſinner to come to him, with all his ſin and guilt, and he ſhould be delivered; but the ſinner has ſaid, it will not do, he won't accept me 'till I mend a little; I muſt get rid of ſome ſins firſt, and get ſome more goodneſs in my heart; ſo he has indulged his enmity againſt the way of ſalvation by faith alone. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not get deliverance in his own way, he thought hard of GOD, of the goſpel, of all who would not encourage him in his way of acceptance; and would not be pleaſed with the way of life, as concerted by the wiſdom of GOD. But now, ſince he ſees his heart, and all its propenſities are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly perverſe, and all its ſchemes for acceptance juſt like itſelf, all directly contrary to GOD and his way, and as ſuch, the very height of iniquity; he ſays,
<q>No wonder GOD has not accepted me! I thought there was ſome reaſon and goodneſs in my duties, and ſchemes for acceptance, but I ſee, I am convinced, 'tis quite otherwiſe; I am all ſinner, and all that's mine, is like myſelf; no wonder GOD could not regard any thing I did! Now I ſee "they that are in the fleſh <hi>cannot</hi> pleaſe GOD." This is my caſe, he and I are <hi>contrary</hi> the one to the other. Oh! miſerable ſtate that I am in, to to be pitied of all beings! Loſt and can't help myſelf, blind and can't ſee the only help; proud and will not yield to JESUS CHRIST. And becauſe GOD would not change to me, my heart has
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009895_0017_0F7AD51126831D98"/>
wrangled againſt him, and all his ways, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his way of ſaving ſinners as written in the bible. But now I ſee the reaſon of all my miſery is from my willing ſelf.—3. Therefore nothing can be more juſt than eternal deſtruction to my ſoul; not one thing done in heaven righter than this; the ſentence in its dreadful weight is juſt as right as GOD is right; for theſe things were all revealed to me in the word of GOD, and made exceeding plain; but I have gone all my life directly againſt their teſtimony. I have ſinned willingly, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, allowedly againſt light, knowledge, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, love, and mercies. Such meaſures I have conſented to, and been pleaſed with; of courſe, the conſequent puniſhment is my own, and GOD is juſt. If, according to his word, he dooms me now to eternal burnings, that bleſſed world, my guilty ſoul, and all creation muſt applaud it juſt.</q>
The ſinner don't hereby conſent to his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis impoſſible, but is convinced of perfect reaſon in the curſe of the law, and of perfect juſtice if it ſhould be executed.</p>
            <p>NOW if mercy is diſplayed, in a revelation of CHRIST, in his own grace and perfect ſufficiency, to the ſinner's actual apprehenſion; and ſo he ſhould be changed into the ſame image, the excellency of this work would be <hi>manifeſt to this perſon</hi> to be of GOD; conſequently all the praiſe muſt evidently belong to him; which cannot be ſecured to the proper object in any other way. Now this is the grand deſign of divine goodneſs by the goſpel, to ſecure happineſs to believing ſinners, and <hi>all</hi> the glory to ſovereign grace.—Wherefore, when the ſinner is brought to theſe views of himſelf, as <hi>all-ſinner,</hi> and GOD a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judge, then mercy in full conſiſtence with
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009895_0018_0F7AD511DB3DBD58"/>
juſtice, referring to the atonement, ſays, <hi>"deliver him for I have found a ranſom."</hi> Then the ſpirit of all-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth, in the ſame inſtant, preſents to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's mind, in the light of the word of truth, that glorious CHRIST, which the goſpel always offered him, and with this manifeſtation to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he effectually touches the will, looſing it from its natural engagements and bondage, and turning the <hi>ſett</hi> of it to holy objects; the firſt and chief of which, is, as was ſaid, at the ſame time revealed in the underſtanding, and ſo is ſeen in his divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; the will thus looſed, under the agency of the Holy Ghoſt, determines all for him, makes an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent choice of him, as a ſeen complete redeemer, on him the ſoul reſts, and the affections immediately centre; <hi>i. e.</hi> he believes the word of GOD; of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the ſoul muſt have light and love, and joy and peace. Such is that regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt which the ſcriptures ſpeak of. Such is that receiving CHRIST by faith, or by ſeeing and believing what he has done for ſinners, wherein the work of GOD in the ſinner's heart primarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. At the inſtant of the ſinner's thus ſeeing truth and reality in what the bible ſays of CHRIST and his righteouſneſs, and ſo finding relief in it equal to his caſe, which is faith, he is juſtified. And ſo you have an account of the commencement of living faith, which from the nature of the caſe muſt exclude all other faith from any place in this affair. Such faith appears in every view to be right, by its univerſal correſpondence to the bible, and anſwering all the intentions of divine faith.—Whereas every other faith leaves the ſubject deſtitute of all theſe operations and powerful effects.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE ſecond rule of trial is, true faith always
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009895_0019_0F7AD512C2FC6780"/>
affects the mind, in a manner anſwerable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its objects; but ſo dead faith never does. In a general manner, both theſe ſorts of faith have the ſame objects. The true believer, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived believer, can ſubſcribe the ſame confeſſion of faith; they both believe there is a GOD, a Redeemer, a Holy Ghoſt, a bible of divine authority, a chriſtian ſabbath, a neceſſity of faith to juſtification, a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judgment, and approaching eternity, but the point in queſtion is, which of theſe ſorts of believers is ſuitably affected by what he believes in theſe caſes, by this the belief itſelf is determined to be genuine. For ſubſtance and ſhadow are not more different, than theſe two notions of faith, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 1.</p>
            <p>HERE we ſhould deſcend to particulars; but will it be to any purpoſe? 'Tis to be concluded, that a number here are now reſting on dead faith; and that this is far the greateſt number, perhaps ten to one; probably much more. And this ſort are ſo generally ſecure, and in their own opinion ſafe, that there is little reaſon to expect a fair hearing, eſpecially in an affair ſo diſagreeable as trials of the truth of faith. However the power of GOD makes uſe of hearing for the purpoſe of begetting faith, (as nature does in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſes;) and poſſibly conſcience may have begun already to diſturb ſome of you. Are there not ſome here, perhaps of the looſer ſort whoſe wicked lives have ſhocked and weakened the ſtrength of their hopes; or whoſe conſciences have had more influence againſt the ſtupifying tendency of dead faith; who have had ſome ſecret miſgivings at what was ſpoken of the ſinners loſt eſtate, his convictions, or his ſaving change? Did not your conſcience, my hearer, tell you,
<q>thou haſt never known that, nor that;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009895_0020_0F7AD512D10CC6D0"/>
thou haſt never ſeen things ſo; never felt ſuch a change? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>—May that divine mercy; that open fountain, which takes motive only from itſelf, accompany the following illuſtrations with conquering light to your ſouls, as well as ſweet confirmation to every humble ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. BOTH theſe ſorts of faith profeſs to agree, there is a GOD: A being of all perfection, who can do all things, and is worthy of all reverence and obedience, and whoſe eyes are in every place beholding the evil and the good. Now the queſtion is, how does our faith of this divine exiſtence affect us? Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will ſay, ſurely the belief of ſuch a being ſhould ſolemnize the heart, make it not only afraid of ſin, but endear all his will, and humble the ſoul to habitual reverence and univerſal obedience. And the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſcripture is,
<q>Let all the earth fear the LORD, and all the inhabitants of the world ſtand in awe of him," <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 8—And <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. 5, 6, Truſt in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not to thine own underſtanding.—In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</q>
Here let the conſcience of every perſon ſpeak, does your faith of GOD <hi>ſo</hi> influence and govern your heart, and life? What ſays conſcience? Or do you find that in ſpite of all your belief about GOD, his power and preſence, your heart will have its way? Will be ſtupid, vain and trifling, roving after ſenſual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, cold and wandering in the moſt ſacred employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? How then does your faith affect your heart in a manner anſwerable to the nature of its object? The object of your faith now, is the perfections and preſence of Jehovah, but your heart is juſt as it was, or would be without ſuch belief; no commanding ſolemnity upon it; you can have all your common
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009895_0021_0F7AD5138B9316C8"/>
thoughts of GOD, without any effect at all upon your heart. Are not theſe the ſpeaking lineaments of dead faith? Now living faith of this object, purifies the heart, cleanſes from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and enables to perfect holineſs in the fear of GOD, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 1. There is joy and peace in believing. He who has not theſe effects, has a dead faith, 'tis not the very ſubſtantiating evidence of its object as true faith is, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BOTH ſorts of believers ſay, that JESUS CHRIST is the only ſaviour. Dead faith yields a ſort of aſſent to all the ſcriptures ſay about CHRIST, and may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him for the loaves, <hi>i. e.</hi> for ſome worldly or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh advantage; it would be thought to believe his ſufficiency, ſuitableneſs and excellency, yea, it may call him the chief of ten thouſands, and altogether lovely; but they are empty words; for it neither truſts his ſufficiency, nor is pleaſed with his ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor loves his excellency. When a falſe believer goes to his GOD, the medium of his acceſs is always the goodneſs of his heart or life, paſt duties, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, honeſty, the pityableneſs of his caſe, or ſome other perſonal qualification, but never CHRIST'S merit and righteouſneſs alone. But a chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and ſo is governed according to the ſcripture account of that only ſaviour. Does he ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins,—he who believes it repairs to him with all his guilty burdens for relief. Is CHRIST'S righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs the only medium of acceſs to GOD, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, living faith enables to rely on <hi>that,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of all other placating conſiderations. If CHRIST executes the great offices of king, prieſt and prophet, divine faith looks to the firſt for all acts of power and ſovereign dominion, both to ſubdue and deſtroy all its enemies, looks to, and depends on the ſecond,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009895_0022_0F7AD514C0C301E0"/>
for all pardon and cleanſing; and on the laſt, for all light and teaching. Faith derives all its ſin-ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heart-purifying, ſoul-enlightening virtues from the ſame CHRIST whom it believes to be exalted for that very purpoſe. As a chriſtian believes him to be the chief of ten thouſands, he treats him accordingly, by ſupreme affection, and all-governing regard. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, choice and delight attend divine faith, in all its exerciſes towards its numberleſs divine objects: "Faith works by love." Are they, like the firſt and chief of them, all pure; then faith purifies the heart. Is CHRIST the LORD ſtrong and mighty, faith takes ſanctuary in all dangers, from all its adverſaries, in him. As faith ſees the will of GOD is our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo it ſets the LORD, and his illuſtrious examples, before our eyes, and makes the ſoul ardent, by every means, after holineſs. CHRIST is "the way" from all evil, to all good, accordingly he who believes it can rid himſelf of no ſin, of no penal evil, but by him; can obtain no inward bleſſing or outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief but by him. CHRIST is "the truth" of all he pretended, of all ancient types and prophecies, and of all the ſoul needs; accordingly faith truſts him without reſerve, ſees him in the long train of <hi>Moſaic</hi> types, and in all the prophets, and goes to him boldly with all its wants. In ſhort, to them who believe he is precious, and ſo true faith ſtands diſtinguiſhed from every counterfeit. "The life" that is in CHRIST gives being to faith, and all it does, wherein conſiſts moſt emphatically its eſſential difference from every other notion of faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THEY both profeſs to hold the divine preſence, neceſſary and univerſal efficacy of the Holy Ghoſt, in all ſpiritual and evangelical productions. A falſe profeſſor holds the indwelling of the ſpirit of GOD, as

the common privilege of chriſtians, and can ſay for it, "if any man have not the ſpirit of CHRIST, he is none of his," <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 9:—and yet he can be eaſy, year after year, in a total eſtrangement to him, and ignorance of his efficacies. He fancies himſelf to be taught by the word of GOD, which never gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge, but as the Holy Ghoſt invigorates it for that purpoſe, and without which that ſpirit does never ſo teach. He hopes, however, he has ſome ſmall meaſure of the ſpirit, (and ſmall meaſures will ſerve them who deſire none) becauſe he is ſober, performs duties, and has ſome concern about his ſoul; and eſpecially if providence ſmiles upon him, and he has ſome unexpected deliverance, and proſperity, then he hopes this unſeen bleſſing is ſomewhere about him; and he is much eaſier with theſe deluded ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions than he would be if he really thought the Holy Ghoſt was there.—Whereas true faith gives ſenſe of impotence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> hopeleſſneſs to every divine efficacy with him: Knows 'tis by the ſpirit of GOD that all its works are wrought. And accordingly, a chriſtian opens to him, relies on him for all manner of divine efficacy with the word, its only immediate mean; and he has anſwerable experience, according to the variety of the word, and the needs of his heart and life, for he has "received not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of GOD, that he might know the things which are freely given him of GOD," 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 12. And theſe are not rare things, but matters of daily and hourly experience with a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and ſo his faith affecting him anſwerably to its object, determines it the only goſpel faith. But this is ſuch a ſort of an affair, unnatural to mankind, that it may be aſked, how ſhall I know whether I have the Holy Ghoſt dwelling in me, according to the promiſe of CHRIST, or not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009895_0024_0F7AD515D037BFA8"/>ANSWER.—1. The indwelling of the ſpirit, is only manifeſt by the indwelling of bible truth, if therefore ſcripture truth dwells with you, and is wrought into the temper and habit of your mind, 'tis the alone work of the Holy Ghoſt, and the ſtated evidence of his indwelling, <hi>John</hi> vii. 38, 39.—1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. OF conſequence, if all ungodlineſs, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your own, is the object of your habitual aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the contrary points of holineſs, the objects of your ſoul's bias, 'tis evidence of this indwelling ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE ſpirit of CHRIST, is a ſpirit of prayer, of praiſe, and of free and intimate communion with GOD; if you have theſe, juſt as the bible requires and deſcribes them, 'tis not only evidence he is there, but 'tis the very work of the Holy Ghoſt that you feel, and are actuated by, <hi>Eph.</hi> vi. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 26. <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 18, 19, 20. <hi>John</hi> xvi. 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. BOTH theſe ſorts of faith confeſs the divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and authority of the bible; and yet one never affects the reader ſuitably to the notion of pure divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This is the reaſon why multitudes, who if an earthly king, or even a natural father, ſhould ſpeak, threaten, command or promiſe to them, they would receive impreſſion anſwerable to the thing ſpoken, and the authority of the ſpeaker; yet when they read or hear the bible, they have no anſwerable effect, though they ſay 'tis the word of GOD to them; and ſo the word, not being mixed with faith, never profits them. Their ſouls are not united to the truth they read, and ſo never get the ſincere milk of it for nouriſhment, but wither and die in the midſt of goſpel plenty; juſt as when the digeſtive powers of the ſtomach are not employed on the food received, ſo no nouriſhment, is ſecreted, the body muſt pine and die. At the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009895_0025_0F7AD51688B7E730"/>
ſame time living faith, viewing the holy book as a fountain of truth and light, the ſoul derives actual nouriſhment, feels its quick and powerful virtues, and it proves to be <hi>the word of</hi> GOD, by working effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in them that believe. But to ſee the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhould be a little more particular; and ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE are in the word of GOD, commands, both moral ones, founded in the nature of their caſes, and enforced by divine authority; and poſitive ones, founded only in the will of GOD. Dead faith owns all this, but never affects the reader with any commanding ſenſe of authority in the precept, or yielding ſubjection in his heart. Whereas by true faith the mind ſees authority and majeſty, as well as reaſon and goodneſs in the command, and is bowed to unfeigned obedience, and ſo the word of the LORD is powerful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE are alſo in the word of GOD, promiſes, both abſolute ones, without any condition, becauſe they contain the firſt qualifications, and are therefore the only fountain for thoſe who have none; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ones, which convey their goods to thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually furniſhed with their condition. An ungodly believer reads theſe as he does other ſcriptures, but has no ſenſe of the rich treaſures lodged in them, nor does his faith ever ſeize upon them, and draw them out. He reads about the covenant of grace, which is compoſed of theſe great and precious promiſes, but he regards it not as a ſummary of the loving-kindneſs of the LORD propoſed to his ſoul; nor does ever bow to its bands, or taſte its ſweeteſt mercies. Whereas in all theſe is the life of true faith; and unleſs theſe gracious words of the covenant and its promiſes, with their divine certainty, had been the ſoul's relief, it muſt have periſhed in many an adverſity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:009895_0026_0F7AD517B916AF60"/>3. THERE are doctrines alſo, by which the man of GOD may be thoroughly furniſhed to every good work. To theſe true faith gives heed as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of its GOD, its father, and its friend. By theſe a true believer is made light in the LORD, and wiſe unto ſalvation. They are a light to his feet, and a lamp to all his paths.—But they are daily a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death unto death to a dead believer. 'Tis with this ſort of people, as of old with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the words of their peace are before their eyes, but the <hi>things</hi> of their peace, contained in thoſe words, are totally hidden from their eyes, <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 42.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THERE are ſtories, examples, and penalties in the word of GOD, by which the different ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are very differently affected. Divine faith ſees the whole moral ſyſtem acted out in the two former, as it were, in inſtances before its eyes; and ſo ſeeing the will of GOD illuſtrated in them, is furniſhed with patterns for heart and life. It ſees in theſe ſtories and examples ſcripture promiſes made out in facts, to faith of its doctrines, and obedience of its commands; and the penalties as ſurely executed on the want of both. But dead faith though it may be amuſed and diverted by them, never takes theſe admonitions or gets ſuch divine wiſdom from them. And the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtiles them fools, who though they have ſo great a price in their hand, have no heart to improve it: ſo the effect produced by faith determines its kind.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THESE two ſorts of faith agree in ſome ſort of aſſent to the morality of the ſabbath; that fixed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of creation and redemption; that picture of ſoul-reſt in CHRIST now, and of endleſs reſt with him in glory. Profeſſing chriſtians, in general, allow the whole day is the LORD'S; but dead faith is ſo little affected with its divine deſignation, that if intereſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009895_0027_0F7AD5186FE27028"/>
or humour calls, if pleaſing example, cuſtom, or company requires, in front of his belief, the profeſſor can infringe upon its borders, trifle with its obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſerve himſelf with it, in thought, if not alſo in word and deed. If he eſcapes the civil laſh, and popular cenſure, 'tis well enough; and yet affirms the ſacred precepts about it, and the dreadful effects of its prophanation. Whereas belief of the holineſs of the ſabbath, will diſpoſe and bind the heart to be in temper, and practice juſt what it is in profeſſion. Both theſe ſorts of profeſſors read, and allow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of that remarkable rule for ſabbatizing in the fifty-eighth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and two laſt verſes; and one of them feels divinely bound to act it out ſincerely; they of this ſort make a buſineſs of it, not in ſhew only, but in ſpirit, to keep holy the ſabbath day. While the other never goes much further than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and often in them viſibly defective. Hence the wide difference ſo evident among profeſſors about ſanctifying the ſabbath.—And to their different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures very different conſequences correſpond; the one ſort has acceptance with GOD, the other has none; the one has peace on this head, the other has none; one is a ſweet ſavour unto GOD, the other a ſtench; becauſe to one ſort the ſabbath is a wearineſs, and their hearts tired with its reſtraints, ſay, "when will it be gone?" While the other does more than <hi>call</hi> it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; 'tis to them "the holy of the LORD and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable." And theſe employ the day, in every part, with a holy mind, and heavenly buſineſs; but the other are always deſtitute of both. So the former are approved of GOD, their conſcience, and the law, while the latter are condemned of all. True faith is always operative, and influences ſoul and life accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its objects; but other faith is not ſo; and this makes the viſible difference among profeſſors.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:009895_0028_0F7AD51956EDA4E8"/>6. BOTH ſorts affirm a neceſſity of faith for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the ſight of GOD, and a chriſtian both ſees what to believe for that purpoſe, and that there is neceſſity of it; but the formaliſt never ſees either. A believer knows that the merit of what CHRIST did, is his <hi>only</hi> and <hi>ſufficient</hi> ſource of hope; others can ſay it, but they never believe it. True faith in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication always correſponds exactly to the divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning CHRIST; ſuch an atonement, ſuch a righteouſneſs, the ſenſible ſinner feels need of, and this GOD requires him to believe; and he who finds himſelf <hi>all-ſinner,</hi> and all he can naturally do, <hi>all-ſinful,</hi> will rejoice at ſight of a righteouſneſs, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſufficient of itſelf, and wrought out on purpoſe for the believing ſinner; on this he truſts alone, by this he is made juſt, and on this ſcore excluſively he has abundant acceptance. True faith always has the thing it believes, and produces the genuine effect, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but dead faith gives no divine poſſeſſion, produces not one divine effect; ſo the believer is bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> the other remains the ſame that he was. But it may be ſaid, "juſtification is to me a dark affair; how ſhall I know whether I am juſtified or not?"</p>
            <p>ANSWER.—1. Juſtification is not a matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; 'tis a great change, but 'tis merely relative. It lies not in the frame of the mind, but in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the perſon as a ſinner bore to a righteous GOD, and his law. All the claim a ſinner has on GOD, is wrath; all the title he has in law, is curſe. Now, in juſtification, that claim, and this title are totally ſolved; his relation to GOD and the law, as a ſinner, is made wholly void; ſo he is dead to the law, that he might, in conſiſtence with the law, be made alive unto GOD. Juſtification therefore is the abſolving ſentence of the judge.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:009895_0029_0F7AD5198EDDEC68"/>2. BY the goſpel method of ſaving men, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is juſtified, but upon knowledge of his hopeleſs ruin, as has been ſhewn, in every way, but by CHRIST, and what he has done; for only by ſuch knowledge is the natural preventive of ſaving faith removed; "the whole don't need a phyſician." Doubtleſs, therefore, if thou haſt never yet ſo come in ſight of thy own ſelf, thou art ſtill unjuſtified: For with GOD, only the poor and needy find mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. JUSTIFICATION is naturally followed with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of conſcience. In a ſtate of ſin, the conſcience is always in bondage by guilt, which is its own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it muſt ſuffer for doing wrong. This felt neceſſity of ſuffering, takes its life and ſtrength from GOD and the law; but the ſinner's relation to GOD and his law, as a ſinner, is made void in juſtification; of conſequence the conſcience muſt be freed from its guilty bond:—"Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with GOD;" <hi>i. e.</hi> the account is ſettled with the avenger, by what CHRIST did, now imputed; whereas to his own view, he always knows he is the ſinner ſtill.</p>
            <p n="4">4. JUSTIFICATION is always followed by ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Sanctification don't conſiſt in outwardly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right; but it conſiſts in ſuch purifying of the conſcience, as knowledge of divine objects neceſſarily makes; "beholding his glory we are changed:" which objects are no ſooner known than loved, and ſo give ſpring to all practical holineſs. Juſtification is in order of nature, but not of time, before ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; "whom he juſtified, them he glorified," by beginning their heavenly holineſs at the ſame time. As ſoon as GOD cauſed <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s iniquity to paſs from him, his filthy garments were taken off, and he was cloathed with change of raiment, <hi>Zech.</hi> iii. 4.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009895_0030_0F7AD51A4D72B7F0"/>
Juſtification is inſtantly perfect, but ſanctification only then begins, and increaſes to perfection in glory. True faith, juſt as it is, the ſubſtance of theſe things, effectuates the deſign of them, in the believer; in every point of which efficacy, it is entirely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all other faith.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE ſubjects of living and dead faith both <hi>ſay</hi> there is an inſeparable connection between holineſs and happineſs: But they differ widely in their notions of both parts of the connection. They alike read and profeſs, that "the pure in heart ſhall ſee GOD;" and the believer knows what that purity of heart is, as it ſtands diſtinguiſhed from the moſt religious outward life in the world; he knows alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected certainty of ſeeing GOD, and what it means, and that the connection takes place now, or never. Accordingly he hungers and thirſts after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; cries out of the oppreſſion of ſin; longs for more purity, as the only way in which to enjoy GOD, the ſum of all his happineſs.—He wars againſt the firſt riſings of ſin in his heart, and his only relief from it, is in ſight of atoning blood, from which alone ſprings up repentance and a ſight of pardon.—His prayer is, <hi>let the Lord ſpeak, and make my heart ſound in all thy ſtatutes, then ſhall I not be aſhamed.</hi> Whereas other profeſſors, if their lives are outwardly regular, in their own ſenſe, they are well enough; holy enough; and if they can but make up an indolent <hi>hope-ſo,</hi> they are happy enough. As to ſuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as conſiſts in the light of GOD, they put all that to the account of another life. So differently are they affected by their faith.</p>
            <p>THESE two ſorts of chriſtians differ widely in their notions of good works; both hold a neceſſity of them, but one ſort know they muſt be the produce of living
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009895_0031_0F7AD51B13177380"/>
faith; in this ſenſe is true, "the living, the living, they praiſe thee, the dead praiſe thee not." They who believe, maintain good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 8;—while the other ſort ſet down for ſuch, all their ſober, well-meant, religious actions, if not ſome others. To make a good work, the firſt ſort conſider the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, motive, and view of an action; the other, only the ſeeming beauty of the thing done, regardleſs of its internal qualities, or relation to the law. Hence ariſe ſeveral obſervable events.</p>
            <p n="1">1. SOME profeſſors, though they know their lives and manners are unexceptionable enough, yet can't be eaſy with themſelves, becauſe they don't ſee GOD, and feel the divine life; their views are low and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, the love of GOD is not ſhed abroad in their hearts, nor they governed by faith, 'tis diſtreſſing, and they cannot be eaſy. Others, in the mean time, though they ſee and feel none of theſe things, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they never do; are eaſy and happy, as long as they can keep up their uſual regularity and hope-ſo's. This is their holineſs, and their ſenſe of it is their happineſs: "Verily they have their reward."</p>
            <p n="2">2. SOME profeſſors are ever apt to be jealous of their hearts, leſt, after all, they ſhould be ſome way ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and deceived by them; they have a watchful eye over them, they dare not truſt them. Indeed for want of a ſight of divine grace, are often fearful to admit the moſt precious things of the everlaſting covenant, for their comfort and relief. While others are forward enough, very forward to catch a piece at wiſdom's table, without regard to order; if they can get hold of a promiſe, no matter by what right. This is a reaſon why the pureſt goſpel-preaching is no more uſeful; GOD'S people are often ſhy to take the full latitude of its bleſſings for their help; and falſe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009895_0032_0F7AD51BD398AD88"/>
profeſſors <hi>will</hi> apply them for their hardening. The diſciples all ſaid, "LORD is it I," except <hi>Judas,—Mark</hi> xiv. 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SOME profeſſors, in time of trouble, run ſpeedily to the throne of grace, to the feet of mercy; they ſay each, "it is the LORD, what wouldſt thou have me to do?" and hear him ſay, "by this ſhall the iniquity of <hi>Jacob</hi> be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin." Then comes prayer, "LORD humble me! cleanſe my ſoul, and heal me!" And then, "remove thy ſtroke away from me." But others fly only to means, to ſchemes, in which to terminate their hopes. Or they ſit down and ſay, "ah! 'tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lot of all men, and we muſt take our chance with the reſt."</p>
            <p n="4">4. SOME profeſſors heartily prefer the cloſeſt goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preaching, they ſeek and prize it, and the more diſtinguiſhing it is, the better. But with others he is the beſt and moſt agreeable preacher, who dwells in generals; troubles not their ears with thoſe nice and heart-diſturbing diſtinctions. Their hopes are fair, and their hearts are eaſy, and they chooſe to have them kept ſo. If ſinners are alarmed, they are diſturbed; if ſaints rejoice, their envy riſes. Indeed if all is quiet, they are well, but if <hi>Zion</hi> proſpers, they repine: And if they themſelves are urged with downright bible truth, they will not bear it. Yet all the while holding they are ſinners, and muſt be holy, or no hope of heaven. So totally deſtitute of any thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their belief, are all falſe believers.</p>
            <p n="8">8. ALL profeſs to believe a future judgment and approaching eternity. And with ſome their faith makes them real, preſent things, and they are ſuitably affected with them. They have a view to the coming of the LORD, in all their ways; and to live like dying
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009895_0033_0F7AD51D898EC318"/>
and accountable perſons for all they do and ſay. For "he that hath this hope purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure," 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 3. But others know they muſt die, and after that come to judgment; yet they live on, in purſuit of ſenſual objects, corn, wine, oil; crying peace, peace, 'till ſudden deſtruction comes upon them. They are concerned about many things, but leaſt of all how to know CHRIST, and be found in him.—Of all this, the lives of the multitude are a flagrant proof; they hold theſe truths in their unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and on them is the wrath of GOD revealed. Vain men! ſays St, <hi>James,</hi> "can faith ſave you?"</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE third and laſt trial propoſed was, true faith produces juſt ſuch effects as the ſcriptures aſcribe to true faith.—But not one of them does any other faith produce.</p>
            <p n="1">1. ONE notable effect which the ſcriptures aſcribe to divine faith is, that by mean of it a ſinner is made a juſt perſon in the ſight of GOD. And yet 'tis not poſſible any action of a ſinner's heart ſhould do this; for then 'tis ſomething in that act, which gives it its divine worth and efficacy. And if any act done by a ſoul can from its own goodneſs and value juſtify a ſinner before GOD, there was no need of CHRIST, according to <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 21. This would make faith a work of the law, by ſuppoſing that act of the ſinner, had in itſelf, ſome quality anſwerable to the nature and deſign of the law, which is an abſurdity in terms, a natural impoſſibility; upon which therefore, and upon all ſuch ſuppoſed works, the inſpired apoſtle fixes deſpair of juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 20. Faith then juſtifies a ſinner only as the perfection of CHRIST'S lawful righteouſneſs is its matter or thing believed. The caſe is this.—When a perſon is brought to ſee himſelf <hi>all-ſinner,</hi> GOD makes him believe what the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009895_0034_0F7AD51EEE8443A0"/>
bible ſays about CHRIST as the divine ſaviour, by ſhewing him the truth of it, which he never would, or could ſee before; for faith is the gift of GOD, only to ſuch as ſee themſelves." In this believing, GOD juſtifies him, while yet ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 5. By accounting that perfect righteouſneſs which CHRIST wrought for ſinners, to this perſon, as he always ſaid he would to ſuch as believe it. And then, on the ſame account, he purifies his conſcience, and takes him for one of his own people, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 4 to 7. So he is ſaid to be juſtified by faith, becauſe it could not be done 'till he believed the juſtifying truth. But no ſooner does he believe the truth, than that truth ſets his ſoul at liberty: "The truth ſhall make you free." Now this faith actually operates juſt ſo to the ſinner, as the ſcripture ſaid it would. But there is no other faith which is capable of producing any ſuch effect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE ſcriptures aſcribe our title to all new-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant goods, to faith. Believers are all the children of GOD by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 26. They are heirs to all divine bleſſings by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8. Their whole ſalvation with all its mercies, is through faith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 15. Whereas dead faith has no title, but to that wrath which is revealed againſt its own unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But to be particular;</p>
            <p n="1">1. A BELIEVER has right to the favour and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of GOD.—That believing ſinners have divine rights the unerring word affirms.—<hi>John</hi> i. 12, "As many as received him, to them gave he <hi>exouſian</hi> right, <hi>tekna Theou geneſthai,</hi> to be children of GOD." <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 14, "They that do his commandments," which is the caſe of believers only, "have right to the tree of life," <hi>i. e.</hi> to CHRIST and all his benefits. The word is <hi>exouſia.</hi> And by the ſame <hi>right</hi> they enter in through the gates, to enjoy all the privileges of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009895_0035_0F7AD51F91B48820"/>
the holy city. Their right by heirſhip is alſo very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar in the goſpel; "if children, then heirs." The word is <hi>kleeronomoi,</hi> for they hold by law all that is given them: Therefore "heirs of GOD, and joint heirs with CHRIST, whoſe is the poſſeſſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of all things. In the ſame ſenſe believers "inherit the promiſes," have and hold them by right of heirſhip; ſo they have "an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified."—And ſo every believer "inherits all things." Two things naturally prevent men of theſe rights; one is, the ſubject is a willing ſinner, always ſins with all his heart. But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive is removed entirely, when, upon ſight of CHRIST, he is enabled to believe the lawful righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the goſpel: and when thereupon, by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it becomes his own. For thereby he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſtified, and inſtantly begins to be made holy. And though he will never have any lawful holineſs, naturally his own; yet CHRIST having engaged by covenant to maintain and promote his ſanctification to final glory, this believer is admitted into chriſtian rights, as if he was a true natural ſon. His rights alſo are more ſure, and more happifying, than if he was naturally a true ſon. The other thing which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally excludes from theſe rights, is, the unſatisfied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of injured juſtice and the law. But theſe CHRIST has fully anſwered, by atonement equal to their nature. There remains, therefore, nothing, on the part of juſtice, or the law, or on the part of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, to keep him out of favour; and he may now, hourly claim acceptance in the name and right of his redeemer, transferred to him, inviolably confirmed on him through believing. So now, "he who was afar off, is made nigh by the blood of CHRIST."—"He is our peace, who has made both one, having broken
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009895_0036_0F7AD52057A30680"/>
down the partition, and aboliſhed the enmity." Of conſequence, "GOD is not aſhamed to be called the believer's own GOD and father." Accordingly his conſtant language is, "come unto me," "walk with me;" "aſk what ye will and it ſhall be done," "truſt in me nothing doubting," "I will give thee the deſires of thine heart." "I have loved thee with an everlaſting love," "I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee;" "but will deliver thee in ſix troubles and in ſeven;" nay, "all things ſhall work together for thy good." Believers are not at liberty to uſe theſe rights or not, but are bound to claim accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; <hi>"do as thou haſt ſaid,"</hi> "fulfill the word on which thou haſt cauſed me to hope." But dead faith is as ſtrange and ignorant to all theſe <hi>things,</hi> as an infant to philoſophy, or a pagan to the love of GOD; and never comes nearer than, "what haſt thou to do to take my covenant into thy mouth?"</p>
            <p n="2">2. FAITH has title to all neceſſary temporal goods. For this, GOD has engaged his infallible truth, "ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thou ſhalt be fed," <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxvii. 3.—"All theſe things ſhall be added unto thee."—"Truſt in him and he ſhall bring it to paſs."—"He ſhall give thee the deſires of thine heart."—"He healeth all thy diſeaſes, redeemeth thy life from deſtruction, crowneth thee with loving-kindneſs and render mercies, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth thy mouth with good things," <hi>Pſal.</hi> ciii. Yea, no <hi>good thing</hi> will he withhold from faith. But it may be ſaid, where then is faith to be found? For who, or where is he, who is thus bleſſed with good things?</p>
            <p>ANSWER.—1. You muſt not judge of the rights of faith by every defect, or outward want of its ſubjects; but by the expreſs letter of its grants, made and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to it in the covenant of truth.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:009895_0037_0F7AD52113FACEA0"/>2. YOU are not to judge every profeſſor to be a true believer; nor any an unbeliever, merely for ſome outward trouble or want, for the poor in this world are often rich in faith, and their portion is ſafe and ſure, though not all yet dealt out.</p>
            <p n="3">3. BUT if any man is lacking in the ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the covenant, 'tis evidence he is lacking in faith, to which theſe divine rights are all ſecured. But if he be needy of outward goods, 'tis no evidence he has not ſuch, and all ſuch as are neceſſary, good, and beſt <hi>for him,</hi> at preſent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. HE who would experience more of theſe rights of faith, muſt underſtand, believe, and put to trial what our LORD teaches—<hi>Matt.</hi> xvi. 24 to 26, "If any man will come after me," and ſo find what his joint heirſhip with me imports, "let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his croſs." This is chriſtianity; faith firſt took place in total ſelf-denial, and ever after pines, or prevails, on the uſe or diſuſe of this cardinal doctrine; the old rule ſtill ſtands as good as ever, "according to thy faith be it unto thee." And ſo it comes to paſs, that as often, and in the ſame degree, as a chriſtian ſeeks, or indulges his ſenſual or ſelfiſh life, he loſes in the life of faith; on the contrary, juſt ſo much as is ceded to this, is loſt to that.</p>
            <p n="5">5. ON the whole, the rights of faith are all <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> "ye ſhall aſk what ye will and it ſhall be done." The deſires and prayers of faith, (and truly no other ever reach the ears of a covenant GOD) are filial, "not my will, but thine be done." Accordingly he who <hi>knows</hi> what, when and how, is beſt, has reſerved the execution of all the rights of faith to himſelf, that they may <hi>certainly</hi> all take place, infallibly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, according to his covenant engagements, that no believer may ever be aſhamed, world without end.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009895_0038_0F7AD521D3CBE2E8"/>
Here is the patience of faith, waiting the will of GOD, in every thing, as the huſbandman for his harveſt. And here is one inſtance of the aſſurance of faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways knowing that in due time we ſhall reap, if we faint not. Indeed, as a GOD of nature, he gives food to the ravers, and ſends his ſun and rain on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; but as a covenant GOD, in which character eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially faith has to do with him, the rule is, <hi>"thou wilt prepare their heart, and cauſe thine ear to hear."</hi> But men generally finding many things flow from the GOD of nature, as ſuch, care not on what right they come; ſo a covenant GOD is not in all their thoughts; theſe at beſt are dead believers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. FAITH has right to deliverance from troubles. "Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me."—"Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivereth him out of them <hi>all.</hi>" On ſuch truth, faith fixes, and is ſure of deliverance; but as to when and how, is never ſure beyond the letter of a promiſe. If the chriſtian is prepared with patient faith, and ſo with mortification, or ſelf-denial, enough to improve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to the purpoſes of the promiſe, he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it ſpeedily, becauſe "he will exalt them <hi>in due time,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 6.—So true faith has harbour, and anchor-hold by which to ride out every ſtorm; while dead faith, eaſy 'till trouble comes, is forced to ſink, or fly like chaff before the wind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. FAITH has right to ſpiritual mercies here and hereafter.—Grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from thoſe who walk uprightly." The extent of faith's claims is the letter of the promiſes, and ſo for things not named there, it ſays, "if the LORD will, we ſhall live and do this, or that." Yet on ſpiritual goods eſpecially, faith may inſiſt, knowing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009895_0039_0F7AD5228C6A48A0"/>
already that the will of GOD is our ſanctification," and that 'tis his good pleaſure to give us the kingdom. Whereas dead faith inſiſts on temporal goods, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitates only about ſpirituals.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE ſcriptures aſcribe aſſurance to faith—"Let us draw near in full aſſurance of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 22. Now as faith is a believing the ſcipture account of things, ſo the aſſurance of faith, is the ſenſible clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrength of the evidence, on which faith in that caſe ſtands. Therefore the apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 2, calls it <hi>the full aſſurance of underſtanding.</hi> Conſequently,</p>
            <p n="1">1. ASSURANCE of faith is not aſſurance of our own good or ſafe eſtate. Such aſſurance cannot in itſelf be diſtinguiſhed from a falſe confidence, and if it could, would generally be of little continuance, and leſs uſe; nor does the ſcripture uſe the word in this ſenſe at all. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxxii. 17, ſpeaks of CHRIST'S righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the conſequent peace with GOD, and the ſenſible certainty of the things believed. As to 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 19, it ſpeaks of the aſſurance of hope, which ſuppoſes the aſſurance of faith as above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. 'Tis as evident,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT in caſe of true faith, there is always as much aſſurance as faith, never more, never leſs. For faith is knowledge of divine objects, or things believed, and the evidence of truth in that caſe, makes faith's aſſurance.—So they muſt agree, and be inſeparable. So the goſpel came to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in much aſſurance or ſenſible certainty, as to its matter, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> i. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'TIS as evident that hope, and its aſſurance, of which in <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 11, differ much from the caſe of faith. Chriſtian hope riſes from a ſenſe of intereſt in, or title to, thoſe matters of promiſe which are objects of faith; and the aſſurance of hope, is the ſenſible
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009895_0040_0F7AD523548EF080"/>
certainty of ſuch intereſt. Hence this is the grand object of ſelf-examination; therefore the apoſtle, in the laſt-mentioned text, directs us to give diligence to have our hope clear. Experience makes hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 4, but not faith; and this hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of GOD is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt which is given to us: Of theſe dead faith knows nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE ſcriptures aſcribe to faith, a remarkably humbling virtue. It beholds the glory of the LORD, and in the light of it ſhews the perſon to himſelf, "in thy light, we ſee light." Hence nothing more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to a chriſtian, than, "behold I am vile." In this, true and falſe faith differ, one has as much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of mind, as it has of believing; the other has juſt ſo much religious pride. To one, a ſmile of GOD is the only mean of humbling; only the ſuppoſition of it, with the other, is the food of its pride. Suppoſed appearances of grace and love of GOD, have always juſt ſo contrary effects on them. The one always claims ſome goodneſs of heart of its own, the other never; ſo one has boaſting, the other none. The ſubject of the one is always bad enough in himſelf to be condemned now, the other always too good. Therefore with the one, the judgments of GOD are right, but with the other, too hard.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE ſcriptures aſcribe to faith a peculiar effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to pleaſe GOD.—"Without faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe him, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 6. True faith hearkens to his voice, receives his teſtimony, regards his honour, truſts his truth, does his will, and theſe are its life and only delight; not one of which is true of any other faith. Nothing is more natural to the former than "thy will be done." The other always reſiſts the manifeſt deſign of the will of GOD. The one ſubmits
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009895_0041_0F7AD52468007698"/>
to his correcting hand, the other ſubmits and pleaſes in nothing, "he is angry with the wicked every day."</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE ſcriptures aſcribe to faith a purifying vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, "beholding his glory, we are changed into the ſame image." It aſſimulates the ſoul to its objects; and of courſe, begets ſelf-loathing, and abhorrence of every ſenſual taſte. Thence the believer's prayer is, "cleanſe me, O LORD, from ſecret faults;" "purge me with hyſſop, that I may be clean." Dead faith may occaſion a reformation of life, though, in that, its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is from ſelfiſh views; but it never makes evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical purity, becauſe it never ſees evangelical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the only patterns of, and incentives to holineſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE ſcriptures aſcribe to faith, a divine life and ſpiritual growth.—"I live by the faith of the ſon of GOD," <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 20, and <hi>"your faith groweth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,"</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> i. 3.—So now, a chriſtian becomes fruitful in every good work, and increaſes in the knowledge of GOD, only through believing. 'Tis by faith that he grows in grace, and in the love of GOD; and ſo goes from faith to faith, gets clearer views of GOD, and conſequently more ſelf-emptying experience of himſelf; and ſo grows up toward the ſtature of ſuch as be perfect. Whereas dead faith, never having divine life, can never divinely grow; hence the evident difference in point of life, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and growth among viſible chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THE ſcriptures aſcribe to faith, a ſtrange power to bear up under trials. Faith is ſo the ſubſtance, and preſent evidence of the glorious power, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of CHRIST, that it "ſtrengthens with <hi>all might,</hi> in the inner man, unto all patience and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs," <hi>Col.</hi> i. 11. This ſtrength and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the believer is by the ſpirit of truth, <hi>Eph.</hi> iii. 16.—So that he can endure as ſeeing him who is
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009895_0042_0F7AD524D54A0320"/>
inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 27. He has ſenſe of a preſent GOD, "lo I am with you;" and ſo of his righteouſneſs and mercy, his encompaſſing arms, his wiſdom to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and his ſovereign power to ſave, with the never-failing truth of his covenant engagements, to iſſue this trouble for ſome divine purpoſe, "all things ſhall work together for good." Faith can ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this trial, in this manner, and at this time, "if need be ye are in heavineſs." It knows there is a kind deſign, "whom I love I rebuke and chaſten." Hence a chriſtian can approve his troubles, "'tis good for me that I have been afflicted." In every furnace of affliction, true faith has one like the ſon of man, ever preſent. So it can be joyful in tribulation, and thankful for its kind deſign, and precious effects. While dead faith either murmurs or deſpairs, is ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or ſullen under correction. Hence GOD often removes their ſtroke, ſaying "why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? Ye will revolt more and more."</p>
            <p n="9">9. THE ſcriptures teach us that acceſs to GOD is by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> iii. 12, "in whom we have boldneſs, and acceſs with confidence, by the faith of him." Faith has acceſs to GOD in the following caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN the habitual views of the mind. A chriſtian knows that GOD, with all his perfections on, is where <hi>he</hi> is; "thou GOD ſeeſt me." He knows the eye of GOD to ſee, his ear to hear, his arm of power to help, his mercy to pity, and his fulneſs to ſupply, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent. A believer, conſidered in that character, knows that he lives and moves, and thinks and ſpeaks in GOD. He can truly ſay, "I am not alone, becauſe the father is with me." And yet he is no more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified than the buſh was burned; but has cloſe acceſs to him, ſight and ſenſe of him. He lives, and walks, and works, in fellowſhip with GOD, 1 <hi>John</hi> i. 7. This
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009895_0043_0F7AD5258C690468"/>
is the life of the believer's life; but the thought of it is deadly, to dead faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN ejaculatory communion.—The living chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is ever, now and then, whiſpering in the ear of his GOD, <q>Oh for more holineſs! Oh to have this heart, nature, humour, paſſion, more mortified through knowledge of thy glory! Oh for direction in my way, for ordering my affairs, for help in this duty, for ſupport in this trial, for ſtrength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this hardſhip!</q> True faith has ever ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to its GOD, pleading, praiſing, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or ſomething; and ſomething to hear from him in his word, by the ſpirit thereof, teaching, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reproving, and ſuch like. They who walk in the light, as GOD is in the light, have conſtantly ſuch fellowſhip one with another, 1 <hi>John.</hi> i. 7;—that is, HE and they.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN devolving heavy burdens upon him.—"Caſt thy burden upon the LORD, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee." Many a time the chriſtian's heart muſt ſink under its preſſing weights, of ſin, cares, buſineſs, or afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it were not for this relief. But faith ſeeing room and reaſon for it, and finding abſolute need, delivers over its concerns according to the precept, and finds relief according to the promiſe. Dead faith can only eaſe the heart by ſight of natural means, or ſuppoſed prevalence of ſome perſonal conſideration with GOD, or by a mere indolent preſumption of a favourable iſſue.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IN ſpecial duties, whether publick, ſecret or private.—Faith has directly to do with GOD in duties, by it the ſoul comes to its ſeat, and orders its cauſe there. It comes to GOD himſelf, leaning on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and receives inſtructive anſwers from his word and works. While dead faith plays off, with its
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009895_0044_0F7AD5264AB9C9E0"/>
long dry forms and tools, and receives no anſwers, but from imagination, or pre-conceived deſign.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IN ſudden and unforeſeen occurrences.—Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are proſperous or adverſe, faith inſtantly ſays, "'Tis the LORD, let him do what ſeemeth him good." It can bid welcome to, and be thankful for, the moſt ſudden corrective incident, as well as be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſurprized with mercies. They alike ſhew that GOD "is good, and doeth good, and his tender mercies are over all his works." Yea, if the believer ſees ſecond cauſes, or wicked inſtruments in his affliction, he knows they may deſign evil by it, but that GOD means it for good. True faith will kiſs the rod, and love the humbling ſtroke; in all which dead faith is juſt the reverſe of it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. AND laſtly.—Chriſtian faith is victorious faith. "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith," 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 4. Faith preſents ſuch reality and excellency in divine objects, as attracts the mind away from things of ſenſe, and fairly ſolves their ſtrong dominion. 'Tis faith raiſes the chriſtian above the world, and daily carries him, with a gentle gale, over the frowns, the ſmiles, and ſhifting changes of the creatures. By this his corruptions are ſubdued; by this he conquers Satan and the world; by this he is ſupported in adverſity, prevails at the throne of grace, and lives at eaſe, amidſt all the enemies of his peace: "For where the ſpirit of the LORD is, there is liberty;" "and his ſoul ſhall dwell at eaſe." But dead faith has either ſtupid ſecurity, or elſe has bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage through fear of death eternal. Faith has two ſcenes to conquer through, <hi>viz.</hi> this life, and the hour of death; in both of which unfailing conqueſt is already ſure from the mouth of GOD, not with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to anticipate the utmoſt exertion of all its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but to invigorate them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:009895_0045_0F7AD527AA831650"/>1. FAITH has to conquer through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the ſly intrigues of its numerous enemies in the preſent life. For all this, its ſtrength and ſkill is hid with CHRIST in GOD, "our ſprings are all in thee;" and "our ſufficiency is of GOD." The believer then may boldly ſay, as numerous and mighty as his enemies are, "through GOD I can ruſh through an hoſt," and through him "can leap over a wall." In this manner have GOD'S people always found their way through this vale of tears; the road is the ſame, faith's enemies ſtill the ſame, our ſinful natures, and almighty helper both the ſame. Hence the hiſtory of the nature and ſituation, the trials and conqueſts of faith, in the ſacred book, are moſt adapt to every one of us. 'Tis an ignorant miſtake in this point, to dream that we ſtand on a higher ſtage of natural abilities and advantages, than goſpel ſubjects a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago; it renders the bible of little uſe, and damps the heart, and perplexes the path of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving warrior now. If the bible was a collection of lives and trials, ſtrange eſcapes, and final joys, of ſome godly perſons in this preſent age, commended to our certain belief, and conſtant imitation, with ſufficient aſſurance to us of an equally happy iſſue; would it not ſeem a more engaging directory than it is now? The only reaſon muſt be becauſe the path was ſtreaked, and all the patterns ſet by human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its preſent ſtate, and in our own times. Now faith ſees exactly that advantage in the bible as it is; ſees the facts in the ſame point of eaſy and engaging light, ſees the examples for our inſtruction and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, equally inſtructive, equally imitable by the weakeſt chriſtian. They are ſet before us on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe "that he may run that reads;" and ſo calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that "wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall not
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009895_0046_0F7AD52854418C00"/>
err therein." From this treaſury the believer, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his other circumſtances are, may be thoroughly furniſhed to every good work." From this armoury, equipped for the whole war,—"Lo I am with you," and "my grace is ſufficient for you," will make any believer of them couragious, whatever is his exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Indeed a chriſtian needs no more than to believe GOD, in order to be quite ſure of all he can need, "there is no want to them that fear him;" "he is ever mindful of his covenant," "and will withhold no good thing from them who walk uprightly." And he has not only ſaid all we need, but 'tis ſure, "his word is ſettled in heaven," and "he cannot deny himſelf." Theſe things only <hi>believed,</hi> will make the ſubject "wax valiant in fight, turning to flight whole armies of aliens." It will immediately appear, that the world and all the creatures, preſent things, and things to come, are within the rights of living faith, When 'tis ſeen to be the <hi>word of</hi> GOD, "that <hi>all things ſhall work together for good,</hi>" and "ye ſhall aſk what ye will, and it ſhall be done," and "no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be impoſſible unto you," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then faith will be victorious in all trials, and not 'till then. Dead faith can't be victorious in any thing, becauſe it can't take the bible for truth, ſo can't affect the ſubject by its ſpirit or grace, nor ever does.</p>
            <p n="2">2. DIVINE faith is victorious in death; there it conquers the conqueror. The believer, like <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and like his ſaviour, always conquers in death, and dies in his laſt conqueſt. Indeed death to a chriſtian is a different thing from what it is to any other; while 'tis a curſe to others, 'tis a bleſſed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to him. But all the privilege he has in death, he has by what he believes; the ſaviour's conqueſt becomes his own by believing it. He knows death
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009895_0047_0F7AD5290803C200"/>
in no ſenſe can have dominion over him, becauſe his own ſaviour, has conquered it in every ſenſe, and in right of that conqueſts he triumphs. Indeed he don't expect to be hyed away, through endleſs tracts of pathleſs ſpace, to a heaven beyond the ſtars; but as what ſeparated him from GOD here, was yielding to fleſh and ſenſe; ſo what kept him out of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſtate, was his confinement to this body; of courſe, releaſe from that muſt be commencement of the heavenly ſtate, abſent from the body, is to be preſent with the LORD, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 6, 8. As GOD is preſent every where, and his immediate enjoyment is heaven, ſo all, but in the body, is glorious heaven. Faith ſees this, and is ſure enough of the bleſſed viſion, and glorious enjoyments, the inſtant which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds his diſſolution. In the midſt of which GOD has promiſed, and faith enjoys "perfect peace," "the mind is ſtayed on him." When nature's bonds are looſed, he is at the church of the firſt-born in glory; the ſame inſtant faith is ſwallowed up in viſion, and the long ſtruggling ſpirit leaping from its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement into boundleſs day and liberty, leaves the gaſping cottage to the long-proved truth of GOD, for a glorious reſurrection; then to be reſumed with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious advantage, and everlaſting pleaſure; itſelf claiming for JESUS' ſake, the immediate and freely offered embracements of preſent divinity, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling itſelf, moſt welcome, with angels and the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, ſees the glory, feels the joys, and ſhouts the ſongs of that <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now it ſees, in their boundleſs original, the wiſdom, power, grace and love, that made and maintained it, enlightened, turned and guided it, ſtrengthened and preſerved it, from moment to moment, without wearineſs, to this never-to-be-finiſhed rapture. The chriſtian, now
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009895_0048_0F7AD5298BE19C58"/>
glorious, remembers his ſins, and wonders! Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers his deliverances and comforts, and adores their native fountain! He ſees the glories and the GOD he loved, and crowds his harp upon the higheſt key! He is now in heaven; and wherever the ſervice of his dear-loved Maker and Redeemer requires his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, whether immediately tracing and adoring the ſearchleſs deeps of holy truth; or ſet to guard ſome pilgrim yet in fleſh, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 9; or darting on beheſts to further ſtars; whatever his ſpecial em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is, which doubtleſs is aſſigned to pleaſe and improve his natural turn of mind, he is in perfect ſatisfaction. And that which crowns every moment of that exiſtence is, 'tis fixed beyond the reach of change, to the preſent undeceivable aſſurance of the inhabitant for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>NOW let us reflect a little on a point ſo much out of common view, and yet of ſuch vaſt and critical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. And what does the ſubject ſuggeſt more naturally than,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEN he whoſe faith is a dead faith is yet in his ſins, and every moment in danger of endleſs fire, let his religion, and his hopes be what they will. He is a child of wrath by nature, even as others, has as much need of being renewed and changed as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world; but his dead faith has done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly nothing towards it, to this very hour. It may have deceived him, but it has not ſaved him; it may have given him ſtrong-grounded hopes, but it has given him no well-grounded hopes; "there is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is death." This is doubtleſs the caſe with the moſt of people, both old and young, and of every charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which will abundantly appear, by comparing their evident want of genuine chriſtian experience,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009895_0049_0F7AD52A0AF4DAF8"/>
with the ſcripture character of <hi>a believer.</hi> Dead faith may ſeem right to him who has it, in almoſt every thing, but it never anſwers, as face anſwers to face in a glaſs, to the ſcripture account of ſaving faith. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he who has it, never brings his faith fairly to trial in the bible court; "ye think (ſays our LORD) ye have eternal life there, but they are they which teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify of me," <hi>John</hi> v. 39. He always firſt admits a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable bias to his caſe, and then goes to the bible; as <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 15,—"Ye are they which juſtify your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but GOD knoweth your hearts, for that which is highly eſteemed among men, is <hi>abomination</hi> in the ſight of God." So he goes on "deceiving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived," 'till he is "given up to ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to <hi>believe</hi> a lie." And doubtleſs multitudes go into eternity with this lie "in their right hand," there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have they "no bands in their death." Now this was not ſaid of abandoned wretches, as is often ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but of ſuch falſe hopers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxiii. In this character there is a decree of eternity againſt him, "curſed be the deceiver," for "he deceiveth his own heart, his religion is vain." The perſon we ſpeak of is going towards deſtruction every moment; and though his dead faith makes him hope, "what is the hope of the hypocrite when GOD takes away his ſoul?" Reader if this be thy caſe, thou art of thoſe "who think themſelves to be ſomething, when they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and deceive themſelves." Thy dead faith makes thee eaſy, but it can't make thee ſafe; it can harden, but it can't quicken thee. With a deceived believer his hopes make him believe; but with a true believer his faith makes him hope. If theſe very hints don't at all alarm thee, let it mind thee, thee to have confidence without evidence, or hope without ſenſible title, is proof of hypocriſy." 'Tis common
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009895_0050_0F7AD52ACFAA0A50"/>
with unconverted believers, to hope their faith is true, but only low and weak; not conſidering that the loweſt and weakeſt life of an infant always ſtirs, and breathes; but their dead faith never ſtirs, never breathes after GOD, holineſs, divine communion, or any divine object as ſuch; there is no beauty in them that they ſhould be deſired. They want eaſe, ſafety, happineſs, but never want the right ſort, never in the right way. Their relation to GOD is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of chriſtians, his wrath was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the former, his love never ſhall be from the latter. To one ſort he is a judge and avenger, to the other a father, friend, and ſaviour; accordingly dead faith makes a ſort of fear of GOD, but makes no love to JEHOVAH, while living faith works all by love, and caſts out ſlaviſh fear. To the ſubject of dead faith, let me ſay in pity, your faith is not comfortable, "there is no peace to the wicked;" it don't pleaſe GOD, "he is angry with you every day." It don't agree to the bible, becauſe 'tis not the work of GOD; it looks elſewhere for food, for CHRIST'S words judge and condemn it, <hi>John</hi> xii. 48. It don't agree with the way of ſalvation by faith alone, it always inclines you to ſay, "I have done thus and thus, or been ſuch and ſo," when you think of acceptance; ſo never reſts on what CHRIST has done; ſo certain it is that when you appear before him, he will ſay, "I never knew you, depart from me ye curſed." And don't this alarm you? Don't your own reaſon tell you that dead faith can't ſave you? Why don't you ſtop and ſay, "what good will this profeſſion, or theſe falſe hopes do me, ſince I am going to appear before GOD?" "Had I not better now, while I have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, ſuſpect the worſt, call all my hopes in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, realize my danger, and try to ſee myſelf worſe,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009895_0051_0F7AD52BE344AFC0"/>
as much worſe at heart, than the profane, as my proud religion has ſeemed to ſet me before them." For truly by this, have you always oppoſed and ſlighted the believer's CHRIST, and the true ſpirit, and happineſs of the bible. Who knows, but of an heir of hell, as you certainly be now, you may yet become a chriſtian and have everlaſting life? Which will naturally excite the anxious enquiry,</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHAT ſhould an unconverted perſon do, that he may get a living faith? Which gives occaſion to obſerve, if you ever hear this queſtion anſwered, by any directions, <hi>to do,</hi> at all, you may at once be ſure, the anſwer did not come from the bible. Two things will always make this evident; one is, the directed doer, is already dead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14—<hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 5. The other is, living faith is GOD'S <hi>gift, Eph.</hi> ii. 8.—<hi>Phil.</hi> i. 29. Men have natural power as creatures, and by it may perform actions, but 'tis not now in the power of nature to do any thing in the manner in which the goſpel requires obedience; "without me ye can do <hi>nothing.</hi>" To come to GOD is the work of faith, therefore ſays our LORD, "no man cometh to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>by me.</hi>" With this an unbeliever imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quarrels, although it is as plainly ſcriptural as any thing at all; CHRIST "came not to ſend peace, &amp;c." <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 34, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>QUESTION. Muſt an unconverted perſon then, ſit ſtill, and profeſſedly do nothing; or go on in his ſins allowedly, vexed with plain ſcripture?</p>
            <p>ANSWER.—1. He who don't ſee himſelf as the ſcriptures deſcribe him, will do nothing of this ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> coming to GOD, or believing on any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. HE who does ſo ſee himſelf, but is not pleaſed with it, will work in proportion to his conviction, and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:009895_0052_0F7AD52C542C2770"/>
nothing ſhall hinder him, and he will think himſelf better than he was before, in front of plain ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HE who has this ſight, and is pleaſed with it, which is the caſe only of a believer, knows that he did nothing evangelically 'till he believed the goſpel, and that what he did do, was the food of his pride, and not the relief of his ſoul.</p>
            <p>BUT you will ſay, what ſhall be ſaid to a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?—Anſwer 1.—Say as the bible does, "The ſoul that ſins ſhall die," and "he that believeth not ſhall be damned."—Say alſo, "CHRIST came to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even the chief," and "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved." 2.—If he aſk for doing, tell him as the bible does, "the whole law;" that nothing leſs than <hi>perfect righteouſneſs</hi> can begin to relieve him. Tell him, if he ſit ſtill here, he muſt die, but in the LORD there is righteouſneſs and ſtrength too. On the whole,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) HE muſt ſee himſelf, heart and life, juſt ſuch as the bible deſcribes to be the objects of GOD'S wrath, for want of perfect righteouſneſs, which righteouſneſs he cannot get but by believing.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) HE muſt ſee CHRIST, juſt as the bible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him, in all his own glorious fulneſs of grace and love, and lawful fulfilling righteouſneſs, and be brought to reſt, peace and pleaſure in both theſe views.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) AND for this purpoſe he muſt have a faith juſt ſuch as the bible ſpeaks of, or never can be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) HE may be aſſured that on his believing what the bible ſays of CHRIST and his righteouſneſs, he ſhall be ſaved; and that GOD does enable thereto ſuch as ſee themſelves too vile for any other relief.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THERE are a few things which greatly increaſe our danger of deluſion in this great affair. One is, there is an univerſal natural propenſity in mankind
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:009895_0053_0F7AD52E07DA5488"/>
to <hi>work for life;</hi> it was an excellency in his original conſtitution, but is now his ſnare. Another, is as common a fondneſs for what in matters of religion, we call <hi>our own.</hi> A third is, that, as a conſequence of the former, every part of the ſaving religion, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature is all unnatural. The conſequence is, every thing which in matters of religion, reſults from our own minds, as its original, is wrong; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what derives from GOD, through CHRIST, and ſo according to ſcripture, in matters of religion, is to be depended on; nor may we without guilt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate a moment about any thing that evidently does ſo. But then you will ſay, "ſtraight is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leads to life," and, "no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der few there be that find it." The deluſions which are made out of this ſtate of the caſe are numberleſs; we will be confined to two or three generals.</p>
            <p n="1">1. UNBELIEVERS generally perſuade themſelves they do believe.—And they may, in general, look on the bible as divine, but their belief lacks the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned diſcriminations of true faith; it has no ſuch divine original, is of no ſuch divine efficacy, don't agree with the bible-aſcriptions to faith. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of true faith always knows it comes from above; others don't, nor ever can know this of their belief. Living faith, as its character, imports, lives and grows, which a dead belief does not. It makes delight in <hi>all</hi> divine objects, which theirs does not. There are two texts of ſcripture which this ſort of believers <hi>cannot</hi> take pleaſure in; one is, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy." The other is, "depart from me ye curſed." And yet they will go on believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to St. <hi>James,</hi> "that their faith can ſave them."</p>
            <p n="2">2. MULTITUDES agree that it will not do to truſt
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:009895_0054_0F7AD52F60768430"/>
to believing only, for acceptance with GOD; there muſt be concern, or reformation, or duties, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſide barely believing the ſcripture righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And this fulfills the text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lv. 8, 9, "Your ways are not my ways, as the heaven is higher than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways." Juſt ſo is the way of acceptance with GOD by believing CHRIST'S perfect righteouſneſs alone, than the patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work way, which can make deluſion, and damnation, but cannot make juſtification and ſalvation;—as both St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> bear witneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 3, <hi>James</hi> ii. 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ANOTHER religious deluſion which ariſes from our natural enmity againſt the goſpel is, that if faith alone is the mean of juſtification, it muſt alſo be the whole of religion, and ſo we will do nothing in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commands, only believe what CHRIST has done; and ſo we are exactly at the religion which St. <hi>James</hi> had commiſſion to deſtroy. CHRIST by his obedience perfectly anſwered the law as a covenant of works, and ſo paved the way for a ſinner's accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when he relies ſolely on that medium; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, no matter who, or what the ſinner is, who ſo relies by faith, "though he were dead, yet ſhall he live."—No matter how vile a perſon, or how great a ſinner. But CHRIST did nothing to the law as a rule of common living for his people.—Conſequently, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are holy, <hi>i. e.</hi> of ardent choice, obſerve and obey the law in common life, it will prove they are not juſtified; but that their faith is the dead ſort; for only by ſuch works can their pretenſions to faith be juſtified. If faith does not produce ſuch works, 'tis dead, being <hi>alone, James,</hi> ii. 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE may in the laſt place make ſome inferences from what has been ſaid, of thoſe who have living <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:009895_0055_0F7AD53059E31B10"/>1. YE did not acquire it.—"Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt," <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 5. "Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the LORD GOD, be it known unto you: be aſhamed and confounded for your own ways," <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 32. A ſight of this makes and maintains humility; the want of it is the occaſion and life of religious pride. And he who don't habitually ſee it, will ſuffer by the latter; as he who does will be happy in the former.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD did not do all this for you, becauſe ye were better than others. The glory of GOD is the beſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of deſign for the creator, and all the creatures; this may be ſecured by his ſaving the worſt, rather than any other. With this view all ſcripture exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples concur, as well as doctrines. There were many needy widows in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of the famine, but only to a heathen one, was <hi>Elijah</hi> ſent. Many le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers alſo, but only to a <hi>Syrian</hi> was healing given, <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 25, 27. At this, they of the ſynagogue will always have wrath; but 'tis evident from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that real ſinfulneſs is <hi>no bar</hi> to the ſalvation of him who believes the divine teſtimony about CHRIST; though deſigned wickedneſs is always a qualification for hell. Conſequently, men's notions of their own goodneſs may prevent their ſalvation, but their real badneſs, duly ſeen, cannot. Therefore they who are loaded down with ſin and guilt, by coming to CHRIST, <hi>i. e.</hi> by believing the perfection of his merit with GOD, are welcome, <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 28. And poor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, who can ſee nothing but badneſs about them, are accepted, rather than they who truſt in themſelves that they are righteous, <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 9 to 14. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conſider ſaving grace as taking any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:009895_0056_0F7AD530C9445C38"/>
from the ſubject, (which indeed it does not) it would be his ſenſible badneſs beyond any other. And to this agrees the pointed knowledge of fact in every child of GOD in the world. This was the caſe with <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays he was the pattern for them who ſhould afterwards believe unto life, and it muſt be ſo in all, that GOD may have the glory of ſaving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 15 to 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HE don't maintain his kingdom in you becauſe you make good uſe of his grace. His favour could not turn on ſuch a hinge if it was true, grace in ſuch a caſe, would loſe both its name and nature. The fact is, he "worketh <hi>all</hi> our works in us," "both to will, and to do of his good pleaſure," <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 13; which is the apoſtle's grand argument on chriſtians to duty. Similar to which is that to <hi>Titus,</hi> ii. chap. 11 to 14. So that the believer is a debtor for every degree of faith, and for every duty thereby performed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>James</hi> ſays, iv. chap. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He giveth more grace, <hi>viz.</hi> to the humble, and thence takes his argument to urge all manner of duties in the following verſes. For ſays <hi>John,</hi> i. chap. 16, "of his fulneſs have we all received," "and grace" to improve "grace."</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE believer's province, is to endure, as ſeeing him who is inviſible. GOD is a ſpirit, and ſo his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all his perfections are hidden to every eye among men, but that of faith. But of believers it is ſaid, "we all, with open face, beholding as in a glaſs" (a looking-glaſs which ſhews the face truly, and cloſe at hand, ſuch is the word of GOD to faith,) "the glory of the LORD, are changed into the ſame image." This beholding is of infinite uſe; it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and aſſimulates the beholder to the object; it ſolves his ſenſual attachments; it attempers the ſoul to holy employments, confirms it in obedience,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009895_0057_0F7AD53194805E08"/>
makes all the ways of wiſdom pleaſant; emboldens the ſoul to hazardous enterprizes, ſaying, "the LORD is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved," <hi>Pſal.</hi> xvi. 8. It makes him ſafe, "that he will fear no evil." Steadies him againſt all inferior frowns, or flatteries; furniſhes ſuch equal relief, that the chriſtian language is "whom have I in heaven but GOD, and there is none on earth that I deſire beſide him." And though faith always ſees that he is a conſuming fire, the ſight is ſolemnly ſweetened by this view, and is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hold faſt, and ſerve him acceptably, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and godly fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 28, 29. This view of divine glory, and its improvement, are peculiar to faith. This and every ſight of the glory of GOD, is in the light of that covenant, of which faith knows "he is ever mindful." Therefore his ſeverer atri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, are as ſweetly precious as his milder ones, which is never the caſe of any other faith. In this light, to true faith, GOD is all father, own father, natural father. Hence all the freedoms, all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, confidence, and ſanctuary of believers. In theſe views alone the chriſtian can endure in both ſerving and ſuffering.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'TIS peculiar to a believer, in that character, to live in ſight of himſelf: "In thy light we ſee light." This ſhews why faith can never make pride, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways "hides pride from man;" and ſo actual faith, and goſpel-humility muſt be inſeparable. Hence a proud chriſtian is a natural falſehood. This clears the text, "he that truſteth to his own heart is a fool; and curſed is he who maketh an arm of fleſh his truſt." Nothing but faith can entirely ſhut out boaſting. "Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, there is more hope of a fool than of him." Hence alſo ſelf-loathing, ſelf-renouncing, and ſelf-denying
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009895_0058_0F7AD5324A1F7228"/>
are peculiar, and perfectly natural to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. So the chriſtian's life muſt be entirely a life of faith; and he muſt know in full latitude that all his ſprings are in GOD.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THEREFORE 'tis faith only, that can ever ſee, and habitually view JESUS CHRIST, as the bible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him. No perſon but the believer can ſee all in GOD, and nothing in himſelf, therefore to none is he precious, but thoſe who believe; but to theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more ſo. A chriſtian, from what he ſees in GOD and knows of himſelf, ſees the moſt abſolute need of the righteouſneſs and offices of JESUS CHRIST, in order that any of thoſe treaſures, ſhould flow to him. There is fulneſs of grace and glory, but how ſhall a ſinner get them? (for ſuch the believer always ſees himſelf,) it can't be, but in a way that agrees to the nature of an unchanging GOD; and how can there be ſuch a way, ſince his unchangeableneſs naturally ſeals up deſpair to thoſe who have ſinned? No way but through that atonement by means of which GOD is juſt, while he juſtifies the ungodly. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the believing ſinner's only refuge, only medium of hope, for preſent, or future, temporal or eternal goods. Of all theſe things his only account is in the bible, this makes the word of the LORD precious: And the only medium of actual communication is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that word; hence faith is called precious. By this the chriſtian conſtantly looks to GOD, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf a ſinner, and as ſuch having no right, but relying entirely on the truth of the word about the certain and perfect ſatisfaction, fulneſs and grace of CHRIST, there ſet forth to him; and in this way only, receives all ſorts of mercies which he has from a covenant GOD; and to which he became entitled by the atonement which he believes as reported in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:009895_0059_0F7AD533B900D988"/>
the word. And if he is ſtill needy and deſtitute of any ſpiritual bleſſing, 'tis wholly becauſe he don't ſo come for it, "for he that aſketh receiveth;" this is an abſolute rule. And if he is deſtitute of any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercy, 'tis certainly either becauſe 'tis not good for him, at preſent, or becauſe he don't aſk for it. The latter is owing to ſome falſe riches; in the other caſe he can ſay without reſerve, "thy will de done."</p>
            <p n="7">7. OF conſequence, a chriſtian muſt be one who has the higheſt veneration for the plain language of the bible. If the bible tells him, that men, and even all orders among them, are "children of wrath by nature," and "dead in treſpaſſes and ſins," with him, it ſhall ſtand for their moral character drawn by the direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Let religious pride, enmity, and profaneneſs join the oppoſition; he has two ſupports to his faith, one is divine report, the other is his own knowledge. The ſame upholds his heart againſt the empire of pride, in believing that we are, in the moſt abſolute ſenſe, "without ſtrength," as to ſelf-relief. If the bible teaches that we may be juſtified by only believing what GOD has ſaid, it ſhall ſtand with every one who is going to heaven, for the ſaving article. If, in this affair, the word of GOD plainly excludes all manner of conſideration for any thing done by men, he wrangles not one thought at it, for he has learned to believe whatever GOD ſays. If GOD has ſaid, the whole of ſalvation is of mere grace, he takes it without diſpute for a certainty. In ſhort, whatever he finds the bible ſays, is inſtantly put beyond all debate, for he not only ſees it the mind of his Maker, and Redeemer, but the grand and moſt ſacred charter of all his hopes for time and eternity. Thus every chriſtian approves, delights in, eſteems, and to his power will maintain, what the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:009895_0060_0F7AD533C96DB628"/>
plain bible tell him is the will of GOD. If CHRIST puts importance on every jot and tittle of his word, ſo does his child, they have the ſame ſpirit. And indeed this diſtinguiſhes the ſheep from the goats. No perſon, but a believer, can in the divine ſenſe, ſay "thy word is truth," or "thy word is the joy of my heart," any more than he can call JESUS, LORD, without the ſpirit of GOD.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THEN a believer is one who lives by faith. Though we are fallen ſo far into the dreggs of RUIN, as that the TERM, <hi>believer,</hi> and the phraſe, <hi>live by faith,</hi> are become matters of common banter and ſcoff, epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of reproach, and even the drunkard's ſong; yet ſuch is the light of reality in which divine objects are ſeen and known by faith that inſtead of weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſuch means, it waxes ſtronger and ſtronger; "this path of the juſt is like a ſhining light which ſhineth more and more, 'till it" blazes "into perfect day."—And "the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt it." In front of all ſorts of oppoſition, a chriſtian believes the various and mighty evidences of a divine exiſtence, and is accordingly governed thereby, he lives as if there was a GOD, and ſo his faith appears to be a rarity in the world. He believes what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay about the perfection of CHRIST'S righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and its deſign to be the ſole ground of ſinners truſt; and his belief in this caſe alſo governs him into ſingle dependance on it excluſively; he knows every good gift comes out of that font, to it therefore, all his views repair, and of its "fulneſs he receives, and grace for grace." He lives in ſight of the divinity of the bible, 'tis "the light of his feet, and a lamp to all his paths;" he believes it the ſtated vehicle of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo he hears it, reads it, feels it, and acts it out in common and divine life. He lives in ſight
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:009895_0061_0F7AD534894DCA48"/>
of uncertainty, and vanity, in all the things of this life; certainty and ſufficient reality in thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſight of himſelf <hi>a ſinner,</hi> and of CHRIST, as his "wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting redemption." He ſerves GOD, endures as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and has a conſtant view to the recompence of reward. So his heart and life are governed by faith; he lives by the faith of the ſon of GOD. Of conſequence,</p>
            <p n="9">9. A TRUE believer is diſtinguiſhed from all others in that his works juſtify his faith. 'Tis as peculiar to a true chriſtian to be governed by his belief, as it is to true faith to produce correſpondent works. There is no way to ſupport a claim to the chriſtian character, but by ſcriptural fruits of faith. If a perſon appears to be divinely governed by his faith, 'tis evidence enough to men, that he is born of GOD. And the want of this not only leaves no ſuch evidence, but is evidence enough of the contrary. So that a perſon may always judge of himſelf, and on all the neceſſary occaſions be judged of by others, by the evident di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence his religious faith has upon him. If chriſtian profeſſors appear not to be governed by the chriſtian faith, 'tis evidence, let them have as much faith as they will, that 'tis of the dead ſort, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not operative:—"Faith, if it have not works, is dead, being alone." If a miniſter or a magiſtrate, a parent or a child, a huſband or a wife, a maſter or a ſervant, the youth or aged, who profeſs, or ſecretly think, they have the chriſtian belief, have not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits which the bible aſcribes to its faith, in forms plain enough to be underſtood by all who read or hear them, their faith is condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it don't make goſpel works. A grand deſign of the bible is to ſhew plainly to all theſe diſtinctions
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:009895_0062_0F7AD536CBCDDDA8"/>
of perſons juſt "what manner of perſons, they ought to be;" that by its plain divine directions, "they may be thoroughly furniſhed to every good work," in their reſpective places; and there is in it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete plain ſet of inſtructions to all theſe ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for this purpoſe, and nothing wanting. Now theſe inſtructions are <hi>believed</hi> or not; if <hi>believed,</hi> that belief will infallibly bring out thoſe very things in life; if then thoſe ſame things are not in life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, 'tis certain they are not believed in the book; therefore, "by their fruits ye <hi>ſhall know</hi> them," <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 17 to 21. For whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the righteouſneſs of the bible, will "be <hi>filled</hi> with the fruits of that righteouſneſs, which are by JESUS CHRIST to the glory and praiſe of GOD," <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 11. And they who don't ſo believe, <hi>Jude</hi> ſays, "their fruit withers, they are without fruit, twice dead." To this purpoſe our Saviour ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> xiii. 23, he who receives the ſeed of the word into good ground, underſtands it, and bears fruit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. From this, CHRIST takes his rule of judicial conduct to all under the goſpel; if they bear fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their means, <hi>'tis well,</hi> but if not, they ſhall be cut down as barren trees, <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 9. For he knows "every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and cannot bring forth evil fruit," and juſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is true of all the reſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 17, 18. Hence that remarkable ſummary of the whole affair, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> "We give thanks to GOD, ſince we heard of your faith in CHRIST, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the goſpel, which is come unto you,—and bringeth forth fruit—in you, ſince the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of GOD, in truth." Which makes the following things plain enough. <hi>ſcil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:009895_0063_0F7AD53817F44360"/>(1.) THAT every perſon has his common character, as a candidate for eternity, with all the truths and duties which concern it, drawn before his eyes in the bible; and beſide this, has his ſpecial character, as miniſter, magiſtrate, huſband, wife, parent, child, or any other in the world, drawn equally plain, with <hi>all</hi> the truths and duties which concern that alſo, in which he has the whole mind of GOD about him, in general and particular reſpects, and all he needs to be, and know and do.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THAT it is the whole duty, the happy privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and ſo the ſaving article, for each to believe the things, that, in his general or particular character, as much concern him, as peace of conſcience, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, daily acceptance with GOD, and eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoul concerns him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) THAT ſuch as do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> believe them, will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be ſuch in life and conduct, as the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them, ſo believed, require they ſhould be, and tend to make them. And conſequently, that ſuch believing makes perſons, in all their characters, juſt ſuch as the bible requires they ſhould be; and the not ſo believing is the univerſal reaſon why they remain unlike the bible in life and conduct; defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and guilty in their places, and ripe for aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated damnation.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) THAT this, of conſequence, is the grand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt diſtinction between true believers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ones.—"In this is manifeſt the children of GOD, and the children of the devil: He that doth not righteouſneſs, is not of GOD, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 10.</p>
            <p n="10">10. AND laſtly.—The grand reaſon why all theſe things depend entirely and abſolutely upon faith, is, that they may be perfectly free for any; as free for the worſt as any. GOD is no reſpecter of perſons,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009895_0064_0F7AD538579CA1C8"/>
he would as ſoon have a poor, deſpiſed, or profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon become a believer as any in the world; <hi>i. e.</hi> he has no regard to the world's greatneſs or men's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thoſe who are already publicans and harlots, are as welcome, as kindly welcome to believe and live as any at all; nay, none are welcome 'till to their own knowledge they are as deſtitute of goodneſs as thoſe: For CHRIST came not to call the righteous, but <hi>ſinners</hi> to repentance; and has prepared deſtruction for ſuch as ſin, that grace may abound. Now the whole bible witneſſes this freeneſs of divine grace; but how could it be, unleſs faith alone were the means? The worſt of men may believe what GOD tells them; but what goodneſs can they have to commend them to favour? and yet all the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is to ſinners. He calls ſinners; grace is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſinners, loſt ſinners, wretched, poor, blind, naked ſinners, and for example gloriouſly ſaved <hi>Saul,</hi> the chief of them. They have no works at all but damning ones, but they can believe the goſpel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of mercy brought by CHRIST, as well as any. And for this reaſon believing alone is the mean of acceptance with GOD.—"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe," or matter of ſalvation, "might be ſure to all the ſeed," <hi>i. e.</hi> to all who believe, and ſo appear to be of the elect, or ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> "not to that only which is of the law," <hi>i. e. Jewiſh</hi> believers, "but to that alſo which is of the faith of <hi>Abraham" i. e.</hi> are Gentiles, and ſo have nothing elſe to depend upon but faith.—<hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 16.</p>
            <p>THE conſequence of all this is,</p>
            <p n="1">1 THEY who have notions of a good heart in them, or any thing about them pleaſing to GOD, without CHRIST, as received in faith, or in believing, can't be accepted.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:009895_0065_0F7AD5390C0481F0"/>2. THAT their mouths will be ſtopped, and they all guilt before GOD at laſt, becauſe he did not require any point of perſonal goodneſs to commend them to his acceptance, but that they would believe his own account of grace and glory offered freely, and they would not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT ſuch as will believe his own account of CHRIST'S perfect righteouſneſs, and ſo ſee enough in it, and put their ſouls upon it, "ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life;" however baſe the perſon, or however great the ſinner; and that for all theſe purpoſes the bible, its own Holy Ghoſt, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſtrength, and free grace of CHRIST are near enough.</p>
            <p n="4">4. AND as a conſequent of all, the righteouſneſs of divine conduct will be perfectly clear, in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deſtruction of all who were too righteous to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſalvation by faith, which rejects all perſonal goodneſs in juſtification; and will be accordingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by ſaints and angels forever. And <hi>all</hi> his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections <hi>as</hi> glorious in the ſalvation of thoſe who were deſtitute enough of ſelf-goodneſs to depend on <hi>mercy.</hi> And ſo we find the ultimate deſign of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, that they who will not believe perfect truth, may be made manifeſt, and puniſhed anſwerable to their contempt of divinity; and that they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and put themſelves on mercy, may not fail of the utmoſt perfection and happineſs of their natures by CHRIST; and ſo GOD be glorious in all his works, through his only ſon our LORD, forever and ever, AMEN.</p>
