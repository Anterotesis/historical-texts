            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>FOR so I can in much Truth call you, notwithstanding my going away from you; it having been my seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Resolution this great while to lay, and leave my weary Bones amongst you, and so I may still for ought I know, either through a common Calamity suddenly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, or by a wonderful hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence afterwards restoring. There were many strange Providences at work, to bring me at first to you from afar, which are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to relate (I being at present in no good writing case, besides that writing Letters has been burthensome to me from a child) &amp; I have (all things considered) been as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velously
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000457_0002_0FA5AC359FC63F30"/>
preserved amongst you, especially considering how long we have kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>For you (tho it was a great act of self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial) was I ordained, you have I most dearly (above all People) loved you have I with <hi>some</hi> care, &amp; much hard study (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodily weakness) Taught, and with you have I comfortably and contentedly lived, and with you could I have died; nothing but want of work amongst you, (not Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) unless it had come to starving, and the probable likelihood of its continuance should have parted us; but it hath been my resolution of old, rather to wear out than rust out, and it would quickly kill me, to go on in spending Sabbaths as of late I have done; and I suppose the offer of a thousand pound <hi>Per Annum,</hi> to lead such an idle life, would signifie little to me; many offers and invitations have <hi>I</hi> had elsewhere; yea, to places that might seem at the first blush to please me, but for your sakes they were in vain, and took me up few thoughts. The World (through mercy) hath not hitherto been a prevailing temptation to me, but <hi>I</hi> dare not engage that it never shall.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000457_0003_0FA5AC38774D12F0"/>
The World neither brought me hither, nor kept me here, nor the want of it sends me away; for <hi>I</hi> am taking the most likely way (according to outward appearance) to go from the comforts of it, being besides e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way unfit for so great an undertaking: but Oh the sweetness of Christian Gospel Liberties, though in a Wilderness! is not Communion with God, and his People, in Gospel Ordinances worth venturing by Land or Sea? Yes verily.</p>
            <p>Though the Providence of God hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled me out of the whole Kingdom, and thrust me from poor <hi>Lymerick,</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> most dearly love, and shall <hi>I</hi> fear sinfully hanker after) yet <hi>I</hi> have already made many liars, both of seeming friends and open foes, who often both to my face and behind my back, said, <hi>I</hi> would make but a short stay in <hi>Lymerick;</hi> yet you see though other worthy men, even in times of peace, left you, yet notwithstanding troubles at my first coming, and all along, it hath been my desire, and full design, to stay as long as you have any thing for me to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> ndeed <hi>I</hi> know in many cases, it is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000457_0004_0FA5AC389A9ADE08"/>
duty to stay with a people, (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in these Nations will, I blame them not for it) though there may be no present work for him, when there is some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table probabilities, that the Clouds will flie away after a while; but when I see (in an ordinary way) a Deluge unavoidably co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and God upon his way, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done <hi>Terrible Things in Righteousness; and is going on throughly to purge his Floor:</hi> I say, whilst I see and believe this, how far it is my duty (especially considering those circumstances I lye under, which in divers particulars, none other in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth, which I now name not) only to stay, to do nothing for you more or less, except to be a witness of your Trouble as well as my own, whilst I might (at least for a while) be of use elsewhere: I leave to serious and impartial minds to consider.</p>
            <p>There ever hath been, and I suppose will be different apprehensions amongst all men, about Removes. It being indeed in it self, one of the hardest things in the world, for a man to know where God would have him be; however, there is comfort in this, that if any, whether Minister or People, do in any

dark and difficult case or undertaking; use all Gods appointed means seriously and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, in order to the knowing of his mind, and the duly approving their hearts to him all along in what they do, they may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently on good grounds expect one of these two things, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Either that God will most graciously &amp; sensibly lead them into the way of truth. Or else,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If through blindness or weakness they should miss it, God will certainly forgive them. I am singled out by Providence, and once more in my sickly age turned into the wide world, I hope not to shift for my self, <hi>for the Earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof.</hi> I was cast upon him when a Child, and hope all things shall work [together] for good.</p>
            <p>I have peace in what I have done, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever constructions at home or abroad may be put upon it by godly and learned men, whose judgment I much reverence, and whose Books I am not worthy to carry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; for I am at present wholly laid by the walls as useless, and likely so to be: besides, I know God hath many Servants,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000457_0006_0FA5AC3F0ADA9850"/>
and variety of work for them; some are resolved to stand, yea to ly by it. (<hi>I</hi> blame them not, but suppose it is their duty) God very likely intending himself glory by their sufferings, others are inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move (all doors of usefulness, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shut but bolted) God having work for them elsewhere: an instance of which you have in these two Disciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Joh 21. 18, 19, 20, 21, <hi>verses, Peter</hi> was told by Christ he must suffer, which was the work he was to mind: but he asking Christ <hi>what should become of John,</hi> met with a sharp reproof from Christ, telling him, <hi>what was that to him?</hi> Christ is both infinitely wise, good and soveraign.</p>
            <p>Let all of us, both you and us, see well to our end, either in staying by the stuff (worldliness and presumption being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the bottom) or in plucking up the stakes in order to a remove: for I would not willingly remove either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From novelty, for I am not naturally disposed that way; or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the bare example of others, for they are but few to encourage me: nor,</p>
            <p n="3">3. From discontent with my place work,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000457_0007_0FA5AC3F70233630"/>
or want of wages: nor,</p>
            <p n="4">4. From Cowardize and carnal Fears of trouble, for I expect them wherever I go: Nor,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly (Though many more might be named) For vain hopes of profits and preferments: I steer not a course that promiseth that: but in a word (next to the glory of God) I would remove.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>I</hi> might be a little useful the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of my days for the good of Souls.</p>
            <p>And 2. That I might enjoy God in his pure Ordinances, though but for a while.</p>
            <p n="3">3. and Lastly, That I might be kept from soul pollution: all which things are not so weighed by the Professors of this age as <hi>I</hi> think they ought: for some (nay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many) can be contented to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gospel, and the pure Ordinances of it, having lived so many years before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and not only so, but they can fall into a compliance with their Neighbours in point of Worship; which some I know of cannot do. I do my (dear souls) beseech you in the Lord, to look well to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and to your walking; be nothing like this Generation in either of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000457_0008_0FA5AC4015FC4008"/>
Now at parting (my dear hearts) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting and looking back: I have some comfort as to three things, though as they lye strictly betwixt God and my own soul, I have cause enough of shame and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of face. And the first is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to twelve years liberty past, that in some measure <hi>I</hi> have in season, and out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, revealed unto you the whole counsel of God, to the outmost of my poor ability, the salvation of all your souls. I have earnestly prayed, longed, and laboured for, and am sorry I am forced to leave so many souls in a natural estate, as I found them, and so many half beginnings, that I fear will come to nothing. <hi>O Lord, undertake for them, and send whom thou wilt send, for the perfecting of them: I</hi> could say much more, but <hi>I</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, yet hope in God <hi>I</hi> am free from the blood of Souls. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I</hi> have comfort in the latter end of my time, when my liberty was daily threatned, in that I used all the means I well could with a good conscience for the prolonging of it; yea, though I was reproached for it, as if it was done out of cowardize and fear of a Prison, when alass, it was only out of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000457_0009_0FA5AC40DF9B3F60"/>
true love to you my dearest Friends having a mind to be of use to you any way, tho never so obscurely in private, rather than be laid aside as an useless vessel; which made me sometimes charge some of you, wisely to husband your Liberties; for if nothing were to be done, neither in publick nor private, in Prison nor out, I would be gone. Then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. When I was in Prison, and my publick liberty quite gone, I have comfort in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the forwardness of my very soul, and well-pleasedness in seeing you, and Preaching to you once every day (though at Deaths Door, being sick most of the time) much rather than in being at my own comfortable home, where that Liberty would not be granted me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that I used all means possible for the recovering of my liberty again, which in former times succeeded, but now came all to nothing: what shall I say? it was the Lord: those I too much leaned to, brake under me, and wholly disappointed me, so that at last I was forced to this unhappy choice, either to remain a sickly, useless Prisoner, or to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them that I most dearly love. But though it be one of the saddest Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000457_0010_0FA5AC41AD290CE8"/>
that ever I met with, and hath all most cost me my life; yet <hi>I</hi> would say, <hi>the will of the Lord be done.</hi> Give me leave now in a word (for <hi>I</hi> am quite tired already) to do these five things, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               <hi>to beg of you, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you, to thank you, to pray for you, and to bless you in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I</hi> n the first place, let me beg of you, and that for my self, often have <hi>I</hi> begged of you for your selves, that you would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God in Christ, using all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpose; but that day is over, and the night is come upon poor <hi>Lymerick:</hi> but now at last <hi>I</hi> beg for my self no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, but these two things, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> your pardon and your prayers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Your pardon, i. e. of whatever you have seen amiss in me at any time, in any place, or upon any occasion whatsoever; poor Ministers are subject to like passions as others are: I have not been so exemplary as I ought to be, though I bless God it hath been my daily Prayer, and care, in some measure to adorn the Doctrine of Jesus Christ my Saviour in all things: but alas, we infinitely fall short of our glorious pattern. Oh my dear Souls, set the Lord Jesus Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you alwayes, and walk as he walked; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000457_0011_0FA5AC4390DF1398"/>
good things you have learned, received, heard or seen, in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do, and then the God of peace shall be with you: whatever good word have been dropt to you in publick or private, whatever Rules, Motives, Comforts; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sabbath-discourses, Funeral-Sermons, or Sacramental Speeches you have heard. I beg you treasure them up and suffer them to dwell richly in you: but whatever evil or weakness you have seen in me, let it be buried from your practice for ever; only so far follow me, as I have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ. I do desire to humble my self before God and you his People, and do heartily beg the mercy of God in Jesus Christ for all my miscarriages. My poor sickly body hath sometimes stood in the way of some duties towards you, which yet otherwise I should have delighted in. Pardon and excuse my sudden anger sometimes, it was rather seeming than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and when real, it was nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedness for you &amp; your liberties, which I saw were forfeited and a going, by our secure and negligent and unworthy attending and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let me now Advise you, and though in a few Particulars, yet especially in the first place:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Make your Calling and Election sure:</hi> Oh, my dearly Beloved, see to a saving work of Grace upon your own heart, make sure work for Heaven. If there be a flaw in your chusing of God, and closing with Christ, you are lost for ever. You may be assured of this, from the experience of your <hi>poor Minister,</hi> who hath often waited on you with the glad tidings of the <hi>Son of God; that it is no easie matter to be a Christians</hi> True Religion lies in nothing short of Christ living, breathing, fighting, conquering and reigning in the Soul. <hi>I</hi> must not enlarge here, I refer you to the many thousand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, sweet and searching Truths you have heard: Oh, read, remember and practice them, and read them one to another. That which is the ruin of thousands (as one well faith) of <hi>Professors,</hi> is first an imperfect work of the Law, producing only some fears and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000457_0014_0FA5AC454A940200"/>
Affections; then afterwards an imperfect work of the Gospel, producing some imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hopes and joyes; but all this while they are not humbled at their very heart, nor emptied out of themselves: they do not see Sin, nor believe in Christ after a saving manner; Oh my Dear People! give the infinite God no rest night nor day, till you find sin an intolerable burthen, and be brought to a full rest, &amp; satisfaction in Christ, living upon Christ only, wholly and alwayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Most under the Gospel are convinced, but not humbled, they know every thing, &amp; can talk of any thing, but feel little or nothing with life and power upon their Souls, many seem to be burthened with the sence of their sin and misery; but yet can bear it, and are contented to live without deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from it; Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> get from under the old Covenant, come from under <hi>Adams Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> take heed of fetching life and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to your Spirit at any time, by any thing besides Faith in the blood and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Christ; let Faith, Love, and a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Gospel Obedience do all you have to perform: <hi>I</hi> beg that you in whose hands these Lines may come, would be at the pains
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000457_0015_0FA5AC460F932AD8"/>
to tell the men and women, that formerly attended on my Ministry, and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies one by one, that <hi>I</hi> do most earnestly beg; nay, most seriously Charge you and them, that not one of you venture to meet me at the last day in a state of Nature: Oh let me see you smiling in that day; Oh, let me find you my Joy and Crown then, very likely when <hi>I</hi> now part with you, <hi>I</hi> shall never meet you more in this World; Oh fare ye well my dearest hearts, till the morning of the Resurrection. The good Lord grant us a merry meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave. <hi>I</hi> then advise, charge, and take my leave, my last leave of those eight sorts of Persons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Worldly Persons,</hi> in and about <hi>Lymerick; I</hi> take my leave of you, begging you would yet lay up your Treasure above, cease from things below, do every thing with an eye to Eternity; look on all things as you would when dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: beware of the unlawful use of lawful things, what you love most, fear it most; if any man love the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do Gods Promises, or Mens Bargains favour most with you? come let me meet you

Write small gains on all your Prosperity: where there is much Labour, with checks of Conscience, Gods curse is all the portion you can look for. Oh turn your faces upward, heaven-ward, drive a Trade for another World, and if you do it in good earnest, and do not find it a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Trade than toyling in the World, then send your curse after me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You that are poor and low in the World, in and about <hi>Limerick;</hi> I take my leave of you: do not you meet me out of Christ at the Resurrection of the Dead. I am sorry <hi>I</hi> cannot come at you to speak, but <hi>I</hi> have often done it already: Grow rich towards God, rich in Faith; let not cares for your Body sink your Soul. Oh, the worth of your poor Soul: though you are not worth the ground you go on: the <hi>Poor receive the Gospel,</hi> how is it, that you have slighted and lost it? Christ in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable compels the poor to come in, why have you stood out all the twelve years? You have time for every thing, though poor, and yet can find no time to make your peace with God in, and to live in Divine

communion. Know God is no respecter of persons. Beware of two Hell <hi>s,</hi> one here, and another hereafter: it is not lack of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, time, or trade, or any such thing that damns men, but lack of saving-Grace. I would not have thee damned <hi>poor man.</hi> Oh lift up thy eyes and enquire after Christ, and eternal things: once more I take my leave of thee; the <hi>Lord</hi> grant I may bless thy happy <hi>Lot</hi> at last.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You Old Men and Women of the Congregation, I take my leave of you, tho' sore against my heart; do not venture (<hi>I</hi> charge you) to appear at last without a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of Grace: yo I have spoken to, but alas! how much labouring in vain is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Ministers? you are dropping into your Graves; you must quickly know (and that fully) what you have often heard in that old Abby; Oh, <hi>come in at last, better late than never;</hi> become <hi>Old Disciples:</hi> take heed <hi>of Youthful Sins</hi> in <hi>Old Age;</hi> watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the evils of <hi>Old Age,</hi> which are many: but now I have not time to name them; you have had time to prepare experiences, are they ready? can you hope (on good grounds) to look God in the face, when

If I were to stay here yet our being together would be short, for you are <hi>Old</hi> and I am sickly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You <hi>Young Men and Women,</hi> I now take leave of you, at your peril; let me not see one of you out of Christ at last; if you do, know, your blood is upon your own soul; for unto you frequently and solemnly have I spoken: you have <hi>I</hi> Catechised, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it too, and prayed for. <hi>I</hi> now say nothing, but refer you to the many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>I</hi> have (through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) prevailed with many such to turn to God, and they never repented it: but <hi>I</hi> am sorry <hi>I</hi> must leave so many unconverted young Folks behind me, in such a day of vile Examples a <hi>s</hi> this is, but <hi>I</hi> can't help it; the Lord pity you: thou hast had a day on which depended eternal life, what hast thou done with it? as sure as God liveth thy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> will be thy death and devil.

Oh, what a Preacher will they meet with at Death and Judgment! how many of my Congregation had lusts too strong for their light, and corruptions for their convictions: what shall I say or do for them that have light but no life; that goes to Hell just by Heaven: that have been near to the Kingdom of Heaven, yet fall far short of it: Know, that God by his Spirit hath waited on you, and wooed you, both in the heat of the day, and the wet of the night; how wilt thou ever bear the remembrance of those thousands of sweet and serious Truths that thou hast sat long under, and been often affected and well pleased with, though still to no purpose to this day; after a while it will be in vain to cry, call time again, or my poor sickly Minister again, who hath often <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

I desire not to go from trouble for whither shall I fly from Gods Presence? but I desire to go for work, having none here; and to be better fitted for trouble when it comes: I say little to this, I refer you to the many Sermons of late: I have hitherto proved a true Prophet; but should be glad for your sakes, if free-grace would make me a lyar as to that heavy Cloud, which is hanging over these Nations, as once he made</hi> Jonah <hi>as to</hi> Nineveh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I say once more lay in, and that in good earnest, for Suffering Times, for they will if not most certainly, yet most probably come: put not away the Evil Day: Security hath almost undone us already: Sore Exercises are at the Door: Oh! keep your souls in an undisturbed expectation of Suffering: it is an easie thing for men to speak light of suffering, but when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed come if God give not Suffering Grace, on suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ground: there will be nothing but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, and Betraying the Lord Jesus Christ: Oh! be fast and faithful to God this evil day: my soul Trembles at what I see this sad hour of Temptation will produce on thousands of

Professors: how will they fall like Leaves in</hi> Autumn? <hi>for though men live by a form of Godliness, they cannot suffer, nor dye by it, I see the beginnings of a fear and alteration in this place already: not only as to mens Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but their walking: some are growing loose already: Oh that I had the wings of a Dove, that I might quickly be at rest, from seeing that Security, careless walking, forgetfulness of God, neglect of Duty, immoderate minding the world, frequent vain Company, Tipling, prating, unprofitable talking; with many more evils, that might be named; which are here covering the face of</hi> Limbrick. <hi>I only say, That if your Foundation be not well laid on Christ, only in deep humiliation, you will never stand: I refer you to those few Directions I gave you, how to dye safely, though suddenly; I confess your troubles,</hi> i. e. <hi>the thoughts of them, have much more affected me, than my own; but upon better consideration I am qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, because I think but few will hazard any thing for Christ, his Gospel, and a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but do what men desires them; we are reaping the fruit of our vain attendances: now wrath hath it's day, and your mirth it's night.</hi>

4. <hi>I advise you to a serious, constant, and punctual observation of the Lords Day, the Christian Sabbath: be found in the duties of it: watch your thoughts, words, and wa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that Day. I fear the want of this, hath had an hand in our Sufferings: Professors do not rule their tongues on the Sabbath as the</hi> Puritans <hi>of old did: you might do well to repeat old Sermons, and call in others for their edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especially the weaker sort; for some can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read, Oh invite them, and help them all you can: many of you took Notes, let them not lye by you rusting: but some in one place, and some in another; be doing all the good you can: Oh, abound in Closet and Family Duties, give God his twenty four hours; know it is Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to meddle with any part of it: make bold with your own things, and not of Gods: keep repeating and praying one with another on the Lords day, lest the Sabbath be forgot in</hi> Zion. <hi>I might say many things as this: but for some reasons forbear it. I refer you to what was said lately to it, from</hi> John 20. 19. <hi>The Lord God of Sabbaths so sanctifie every one of you, that you may sanctifie his day, and his Name every day; so as God may have glory, and you the comfort at last, and every body edified

about you;</hi> let God say <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I advise you in case peace and liberty in other places be continued, that you do not content your selves without the Gospel: Oh, the worth of the Gospel! if there be any thing under Heaven to be valued, its the dearly purchased Gospel of Jesus Christ, I can never tell you (though I should set my self to it) what the worth of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, godly, plain, powerful and exemplary Ministry is: Oh, what a sweet thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and with his People in pure Ordinances! Oh, how vile must Sin needs be, that hath a main hand in sending away the Gospel! Men are naked without the Gospel, it is the glory of any place: Oh the Curses that follow its removal! I beg you would be concerned in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; you were too much formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without it, let it be so no more. I was brought hither after a wonderful sort (all things considered) and my removal is not without a wonder. Some godly young man might be had, whose charge is small, and might be less taken notice of than I was,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000457_0034_0FA5AC587062FE50"/>
               <hi>O Lord, take not away thy Spirit from</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick, <hi>but restore thy precious Gospel to it, lest it sleep the sleep of death:</hi> Oh the temporal, spiritual and eternal plagues that fill up the room of a removed Gospel!</p>
            <p n="6">6. I advise you not to be strangers one to another: this hath been an old fault all along notwithstanding my many publick (especially private) Admonitions to the contrary See one another, Pray one with and for another: you may without hazard (I hope) keep dayes of Prayer together. Shall these fail and come to nothing? God forbid. Be stirring up one another, be glad to see each other, and be useful one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both to Soul and Body as there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. Away with this strangeness and selfishness; let your communion be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It grieves me to think that you here, that have heard together, nay prayed and sat down at the Lords Table together, should grow meer strangers one to another, as I greatly fear you will. I can do no more than wish you to your duty: the Lord unite your hearts to himself, and one
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000457_0035_0FA5AC59017CEF88"/>
to another, causing you to live in peace and Oneness of mind, that the God of love and peace may dwell amongst you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And lastly, I advise you to beware of Seducers and Errors: Remember <hi>Acts</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>0. 29. Keep close to your Bibles; to the Law and to the Testimony when any thing is started: Beware of such as cry up the Light within, shun their Books, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary communion with them, pittying their being out of the way. I might say more here, but a word is enough to the wise. I might without blushing say, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 9. Be ware of any Doctrine that makes Christ the favourer of sin, or man the Saviour of himself.</p>
            <p>

            <p n="3">3. Give me leave to thank you: I thank you for all your care and love from first to last. I thank you for your great importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for my settling amongst you, when you were acquainted with me by my provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential

passing through the Town. I thank you for your kind receiving me at first, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my great bodily weakness, and soul unworthiness. I may in some measure say; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>that my temptation that was in my flesh you rejected not, but received me as an Angel of God. I</hi> thank you for your serious, cheerful and constant attending upon my Ministry: and for your care, kindness and tenderness in my sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. I thank you for your ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with me in any lawful thing that at any time I desired of you; and for your standing by me to the outmost of your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in those many troubles and trials that I have met with from first to last. I thank you for your kind Tokens in secret, for your pleading my cause in publick, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing my weakness as you had occasion. I do most heartily thank every one, any one in City or Country that ever did me any kindness less or more, by word or deed. I thank any that would hear me, and I more thank them that did heed me, and I thank to them yet more that I did any saving good as a Nurse, but most of all them that got

their first saving good from me. <hi>I</hi> hope whether <hi>I</hi> be your Nurse or your Father, you will not forget to love and pray for me, though at a great distance. Lastly <hi>I</hi> thank you for your desire of my longer continuance with you: the Lord supply you better; <hi>I</hi> have already acquainted you with the grounds of my removing. <hi>I</hi> n one word, <hi>I</hi> thank God for your love, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pray it may be returned manifold into the bosome of you and yours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Give me leave to pray for you; As for this <hi>I</hi> shall say little; <hi>I</hi> hope that Study of mine may bear witness for my concerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for you. You may guess at my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in secret (<hi>i. e.</hi> as to what <hi>I</hi> praied for) by what you have known in publick and private. <hi>I</hi> pray you may be filled with all the fulness of God: that you may know the love of Christ which passeth knowledg. Oh that you may be filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his will, and may walk worthy of the Lord to all well-pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000457_0038_0FA5AC611D51DC00"/>
unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness. Oh that you may be made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, and may at last have an abundant enterance into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Kingdome of God. The good Lord make all Grace abound toward you, that you alwayes having alsufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work. The Lord sanctifie you wholly, in Soul, Body and Spirit, and grant I may at last see you every one presented without spot, or blemish, or any such thing before the Father, with exceeding joy.</p>
            <p>Now when I am taking leave of all, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Farewel to Sabbaths, Sacraments Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, dayes of Prayer, and Expoundings, and Catechisings; saying Farewel to my Relations and Friends in <hi>England, Dublin</hi> and <hi>Limerick:</hi> Farewel to my Study, and that old Abby, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I do most cordially pray that you all may Farewel in your Bodies, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in your Souls. Oh, that you may

Farewel in your Basket and Store, in your Children, Servants and Neighbours: the Lord grant you may Farewel in your Trade and Traffick, especially Heaven-ward. Oh that you may Farewel in Prosperity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, in all your desertions and afflictions. I wish your welfare at home and abroad, by night or day, in a single or married condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Land or Sea, at Bed or Board. Oh that you may Farewel in the troubles of life and pangs of death; and at your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn appearing at Judgment. Oh that you may Farewel both in time, and through all Eternity. Yea, let mine Enemies Farewel <hi>for ever,</hi> thorough true Repentance and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, given to them <hi>now;</hi> So be it, my heart saith <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. And lastly, Let me bless you, and that in the Name of the Lord: seeing Jesus Christ (the great Head of His Church) hath impowred Ministers so to do. Now the Lord bless you, and keep you; and the Lord make His face shine on you, and be gracious to you: the Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon you, and give you

peace.

            <p>I <hi>Present You</hi> (my dear and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared Friends) <hi>with this small Token and Legacy of my Love, hoping it will not only meet with a kind Reception, but a Christian Improvement amongst you. It was but very lately I put pen to paper, having many Debates within my self whether I should do thus or no, not knowing what Construction might be put upon it, either by Friends or Foes: but my strong Affection to you would not suffer me to be silent, and when I had begun, the same Affection would not suffer me to be short; for I fully designed only half a Sheet,
<pb facs="unknown:000457_0042_0FA5AC6408CBBD50"/>
but writing to you the People of my Love it roundly run without stop or stay to this length: and at last in much peremptoriness I forced my self to conclude, resolving it should look nothing like a Book (though with much ease it might) but like it self,</hi>

               <hi>I confess I am sorry it is so large, lest it prove tedious, and seldome read, and thereby I lose both my end and labour; and yet withal I am sorry it is no larger, seeing I can't Preach my</hi> Farewel Sermon <hi>amongst you, the substance of which is not at all in this</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Such as it is you are welcome to it: read it (I pray) together and alone, and that frequently, seriously and impartially; communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to the men and women of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as you have opportunity. The plainess of its dress I take for granted will never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you; for I only now write to you, just as I used to Preach to you, and Talk with you. It is the Market Language that must save Souls. You stand more in need of a skilful and faithful Physician than an Oratorical one. There are some mispointings and small Errata's in the writing (I writing badly my self got others
<pb facs="unknown:000457_0043_0FA5AC65805DC3E8"/>
to Transcribe it) which I beg you would excuse and mend; for I am not at leasure through mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold distracting occasions to attend it. I am not concerned at the many faults I foresee, &amp; could name that very many persons will find in &amp; with this Letter. Its enough to me that Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness hath boldness,</hi> &amp; <hi>a good man is satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from himself. Many more things I would have said, but for some Reasons leave them to some better opportunity. If God get any glory, and you good by this Friendly</hi> Letter, <hi>I have enough; if it falls out otherwise I can't help it, there is but so much labour lost to the many Moneths and Years before, The Lord renew you in the Spirit of your Minds. The Lord keep you from Hypocrisie and Apostacy, and heal all those Miscarriages that I see growing on the face of</hi> Limerick; <hi>but can't (to the great grief of my heart) help, by reason of my present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. The Lord be with you all,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>This is the Prayer of him for you who once was your Minister, and still remains the Lords Witness either for you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you.</p>
