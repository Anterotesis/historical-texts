            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE CANDID READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU muſt know, my friend, that I am a gentleman in the country, and by craft a <hi>SHAVER</hi> of very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſcope; though I have turned preacher of late and ſeem to be pretty ſucceſsful at my preachment, as the ſole of this ſermon will teſtify. I have been a great man for the news as we Shavers commonly are, and among other fine papers, I uſually took in the <hi>St. James's Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle,</hi> a paper that is filled in all the four corners, but if you aſk with what: on my word, I muſt refer you to people of greater penetration than I am to find that out. Well I paid, and read to no purpoſe for a long while; but at laſt I chanced to ſpy An Extract of a Letter from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and I wot it pleaſed me mightily.</p>
            <p>It told us how that <hi>Six young men were expelled the univerſity for holding Methodiſtical tenets, and for praying, reading and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the ſcriptures in a private houſe.</hi> Well, thought I, that is well enough: but then I did not ſo much approve of the principal crime of thoſe called Methodiſts, being ſaid to be reading and expounding the ſcriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thought I, that is going too far. But not long after I happened to ſee another account from <hi>Oxford,</hi> wrote by <hi>Oxonienſis,</hi> and that account made me reſolve upon ſomething. For he tells us, that one of the Six was formerly a <hi>Publican,</hi> another had been a <hi>Blackſmith,</hi> a third had been a <hi>Barber,</hi> and a fourth had been a <hi>Teacher</hi> in a <hi>School.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012104_0003_0F89C469DAE0C490"/>Well, You muſt know my grandfather was a publican, my uncle a blackſmith, and I myſelf am a ſhaver; which is by interpretation a barber; and my eldeſt ſon, a promiſing lad, is deſtined for a ſchool-maſter. Therefore ſeeing the honours of our family caſt down into the puddle by the arrogance of <hi>Oxonian</hi> prieſts, I began to grow ſurly upon it; but did not yet think of preaching. What brought me to that was finding from the learned <hi>Oxonienſis,</hi> that thoſe young men preached without orders. Then, thought I, I will even have a Trial at it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Well, you muſt know we have a good ſort of a fellow to our parſon; a gentleman who loves his bottle and his friend, if it was for a whole night together, and there is never a youth in all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh who will ſing a merrier catch than himſelf, nor tell a prettier ſtory: with him I am pretty familiar, and I thought I would even borrow his Sunday's ſtile, and his orthodox plan, knowing him to be a true churchman, and I would try what I could do at preaching. But I had certainly been diſappointed in an audience if an happy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination had not befriended me; but no ſooner had I beſtirred my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination than I was waſted from <hi>Clarely Common</hi> to the great hall at <hi>O—d,</hi> before the <hi>V—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> C—r,</hi> and the Heads of Houſes, to whom, after I had mounted the roſtrum with the uſual formality, I preached the following ſermon:</p>
            <p>Concerning which I would have it obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That I pretend not to juſtify any part of the Methodiſts conduct, beſides praying to God, reading, expounding the ſcriptures, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That I cenſure none of the clergy, but ſuch as are againſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, and expounding the ſcriptures, and ſinging of hymns.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That whoever this coat is found to fit, I would have the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man put it on and wear it, as his own: aſſuring himſelf that it was made for him, and that, though a ſhaver, I am his taylor.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> That, perhaps, in gratitude for my great pains, and the new hints given in this ſermon, which may caſt a light upon eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, the <hi>V—e C—r,</hi> and Heads of Houſes, may preſent me to ſome good benefice. And they may depend on it that I ſhall <hi>ſhave</hi> the pariſhoners as handſome as any on 'em.</p>
            <p>Thus, reader, I have told you all about it, and have only to add, that after I had at leizure hours wrote my ſermon fairly out, I carried it to a bookſellor, expecting, that he would be as <hi>fond</hi> of it as I was, which I believe is a <hi>caſe very common</hi> with us authors; but he drew up his ſhoulders, looked ſour upon it, and ſaid he feared it was too coarſe for this polite age. But I aſſured him that the ſtile was quite clerrical, being borrowed from the pariſh prieſt; and what he might hear in many pulpits if he would only travel for it; ſo he agreed to take my word rather than be at the expence and trouble of ſeeking for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof, and it was ſent to the preſs to furniſh you with half an hour's entertainment, and pleaſe</p>

            <head>A SERMON, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>Having the honour of addreſſing ſo learned a body, with bands ſo white, gowns ſo black, and caps ſo orthodox, I take the liberty of ſtriking a little from the common road of preaching, and as this is a ſingular occaſion I ſhall make free with a ſingular text.</p>
            <p>You know, my beloved, it is the way of moſt preachers to chooſe ſome paſſage of ſcripture for their text, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinctly read twice over, you hear no more of the bible till the ſermon is finiſhed; but are entertained with ſuch a lecture as you may find in a news-paper, price two-pence half-penny. But I have the honour of departing a little from this general rule, and ſhall be the firſt who takes his text from a news-paper, and illuſtrates his doctrine by ſcripture-hiſtory, and having broken the ice, as we uſed to ſay, I expect to have many ingenious followers. You will find our text in the <hi>St. James's Chronicle, for</hi> Thurſday, March 17, 1768. No. 1099. <hi>Printed by</hi> Henry Baldwin, <hi>at the Printing-Office,</hi> White Friars, Fleet-Street.

                  <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> laſt ſix ſtudents belonging to <hi>Edmund-Hall</hi> were expelled the univerſity, after an hearing of ſeveral hours, before Mr. Vice-Chancellor, and ſome of the Heads of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for holding Methodiſtical tenets, and taking upon them to pray, read, and expound the ſcriptures, and ſing hymns in a private houſe. The — of the — defended their doctrines from the thirty-nine articles of the eſtabliſhed church, and ſpoke in the higheſt terms of the piety, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarineſs of their lives; but his motion was overuled, and ſentence pronounced againſt them. Dr. —, one of the Heads of Houſes preſent, obſerved, that as theſe ſix gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were expelled for having too much religion, it would be very proper to enquire into the conduct of ſome who had too little; and Mr. — was heard to tell their chief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer that the univerſity was much obliged to him for his good work.</p>

            <p>OUR text is indeed ſomewhat too long, but then, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, we have the more matter to work upon: and you know this is a day in which invention is not very briſk, eſpecially among the gentlemen clergy. But,</p>
            <p>We proceed to proſecute our ſubject after the old ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox plan. Namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To go over our text by way of explication.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Deduce a notable point of doctrine from it, <hi>viz.</hi> That this act of the V—e C—r, and the Heads of Houſes, is defenſible from the conduct of the clergy in all ages, and in all countries.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conclude with ſpecial application.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Explain our text. In doing which I muſt divide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very ſmall parcels, even as the ſkilfull ſurgeon does the fleſh of a hanged malefactor, when he diſſects an organ.— And in the</p>
            <p>Firſt place, <hi>Extract of a Letter from</hi> Oxford.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Oxford</hi> my beloved, is a city in the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> notable for a great univerſity; <hi>i. e.</hi> a place of learning: and it would do you good to ſee the numbers of hopeful young gentlemen who come from all parts of <hi>England</hi> in purſuit of learning, inſomuch that all the colleges are frequently crowded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But you will ſay, What do they learn? To which I anſwer in the negative, as being much eaſier than the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative. For it appears from our text that there are ſome things which they do not learn.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012104_0006_0F89C46C8049EDC8"/>(1.) Praying:—I mean, they do not, in common, learn to pray to God. It ſeems, this is no part of the approved exerciſes of the ſtudents in that univerſity: for, ſays our text, <hi>Six young gentlemen were expelled the univerſity for praying.</hi> From whence we may draw this inference: namely, That if the Vice Chancellor, and the Heads of Houſes, expelled theſe ſix offenders for praying to God; it is natural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they are not guilty of that crime themſelves: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they would fall under that reproof, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) To read and expound the ſcripture, is another thing which ſeems to be there prohibited. Whether <hi>Rocheſter's Poems, Triſtam Shandy,</hi> and ſuch books are eſteemed ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and therefore tolerated, I pretend not to ſay; but one thing is clear from our text, that reading and expounding the ſcriptures is againſt the <hi>Oxonian</hi> law: for <hi>Six young gentlemen were expelled the univerſity for reading and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the ſcriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Singing of hymns is another thing which they do not learn: this is alſo clear from the words. By ſinging of hymns, I mean praiſing of God for bleſſings received according to <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 16. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> But ſinging of pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, cannot be connived at in the univerſity, by the Heads of Houſes; for <hi>Six young men were expelled the univerſity for ſinging of hymns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This was an extract of a <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Oxford:</hi> which ſhews, that there be ſome people there who <hi>can</hi> write, notwithſtanding all the reflections that have paſt upon them; and that although reading is dangerous there, yet an <hi>Oxonian</hi> may write with impunity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Laſt <hi>Friday:</hi>— the better day, the better deed. <hi>Friday,</hi> you know, is a faſt-day; on which it was fitteſt to go about a work of this importance; when the judgment was not fettered with bodily groſſneſs, but purged by an empty belly.</p>

               <hi>Laſt Friday:</hi> It was not a thing that happened in the dark ages of <hi>Monliſh Ignorance,</hi> but what has happened in this <hi>enlightened age of</hi> CHRISTIANITY. It was not when the univerſity was tied hand and foot by <hi>Popiſh</hi> prejudices, and the Heads of Houſes were obliged to ſubmit to their betters;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012104_0007_0F89C46CE9734078"/>
but it was <hi>Laſt Friday,</hi> the act and deed of <hi>Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Six Students!</hi>— What a miracle was it, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that, out of ſo many hundreds of ſtudents, as are at <hi>Oxford,</hi> only Six ſhould be found guilty of praying reading and expounding the ſcriptures. This ſhews the faithfulneſs of their vigilant tutors, in guarding them againſt ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious practices. Now from this, obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there were but Six ſtudents of all the univerſity, who could be detected in thoſe evils of praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much to the honour of that learned body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe Six being expelled;—now there are none left in all the colleges who take upon them to pray, read and expound the ſcriptures:—therefore, gentlemen may with ſafety ſend their ſons to that fountain of learning, without fearing that they will become religious;—there being none left <hi>now</hi> to enſnare them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. They all belonging to <hi>Edmund Hall.</hi>—It ſeems they loved to be together: from whence it may be gathered that they loved one another. A fault which the Heathens accuſed the Chriſtians of old with, but from which mankind in general are now pretty free. It appears as if this <hi>Edmund-Hall</hi> was the only place at <hi>Oxford</hi> in which praying people were to be ſound. But it is hoped that the governors of that Hall will be mulct for their carleſſneſs in ſuffering the ſtudents to read the bible and to enquire after religion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is contrary to the ſenſe of this univerſity.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Were expelled the univerſity.</hi> Deprived of the rights and privileges of the king's loving ſubjects, or as the word ſignifies, they were drove out, forced away, and baniſhed from the univerſity. This religions act was performed by the Vice Chancellor after an hearing of ſeveral hours. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> was ſent for by queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the pious biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> and my Lord Chancellor being determined to have him burnt; but yet to make a ſhew of juſtice they would give him a hearing, withall reſolving not to ſwerve from their bloody deſign. So in like manner, our venerable tutors were determined not to ſuffer <hi>praying perſons</hi> to breathe the univerſity air; yet, being tied to form, they would give them an hearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An hearing of ſeveral hours.</hi>—Ah! my beloved, ye may ſee how remarkably the ſcriptures are fulfilled in that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012104_0008_0F89C47021C1BD28"/>
learned body of divines; where it ſays, <hi>Hear ye indeed but underſtand not, ſee ye indeed but perceive not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. We come to the crime for which they were expelled the univerſity: and I wot it was an heinous crime indeed. This would appear without illuſtrating it from the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the expellers; namely, Mr. Vice Chancellor, and the Head of Houſes. But as I love to remove every hillock out of the way, for your better information, I ſhall explain it. What was their crime then, my beloved, think you? Was it drinking? No, no, it was not drinking, <hi>for they were very temperate.</hi> Was it whoring then, the common practice of many ſtudents? No, it was not whoring neither; for their lives are ſaid to have been very exemplary. I wiſh, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it had been no worſe. But what was it then? Was it ſwearing, and fighting, and abuſing their fellow ſtudents? No, for they ſhunned the other ſtudents, as a wiſe man will <hi>ſhun an attorney:</hi> thus much may be gathered from our text, which intimates, <hi>that they met together among themſelves.</hi> But it was <hi>praying: that,</hi> my beloved, was one part of their crime, <hi>Six young men were expelled the Univerſity for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> For Mr. V—e C—r and the Heads of Houſes will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no praying people to continue in the univerſity.</p>
            <p>Reading and expounding the ſcriptures was another part of their crime. But what in the name of the Pope, can ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have to do with the ſcriptures? What pity is it that the bible is not locked up in the Vatican. But letting that paſs, we find that learning to expound the ſcriptures is no part of the employment of the ſtudents, <hi>Six young men being expelled the univerſity for reading and expounding the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What added to their guilt was, that they carried their religion to a <hi>private houſe.</hi> But what can <hi>private</hi> people have to do with religion, ought not they to do, as their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did; namely, give up their conſciences and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to the guidance of their venerable prieſt? Is it not enough that gentlemen in black know, &amp; underſtand religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but every private perſon muſt be dabbling in it contrary to the ſenſe of this univerſity? I wot, my beloved, that the clergy cannot thrive as they do, if every private houſe muſt become a worſhipping temple; but it is tho't there is little reaſon to fear this, ſeeing our text informs us that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the univerſity are determined to prevent it, for <hi>Six
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012104_0009_0F89C471CFFCF8C8"/>
young men were expelled the Univerſity for being religious in a private houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. Another part of their crime was that they <hi>held Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſtical tenets.</hi> This ſame methodiſt, my beloved, is a cramp word, gathered out of old books, by men of learning, and applied to ſuch who pray, read, and expound the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſing hymns in private houſes. A people never to be tolerated by the clergy. You'll obſerve, that this ſame hard word, which the nation has long rung with, firſt of all was given to the ſons of Eſculapius as a name of honour, and about thirty years ago, was by learned men raiſed up as the witch of Endor (who ſeems to have been a clergy woman too) raiſed the ghoſt of old Samuel.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſame ſons of Eſculapius were phyſicians, ſurgeons, and apothecaries in their day, but then they were quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodical, like the greater part of the old women in black prunella &amp; white cambrick. For inſtance they had not the method of wearing large whigs, gold headed canes, and of wheeling about the ſtreets in their chariots. And with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their phyſic and ſurgery, they were guided chiefly by the dictates of nature without the abſtruſe methods of art. At laſt there aroſe a great man and his name was <hi>Galen,</hi> a mighty man for diſſecting of apes; for it ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in his days in Pagan lands, there were very few criminals who deſerved death, and fewer ſtill who were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſurgeons. Well what ſhould he do, think you; why, my beloved, being bleſt with better ſtars at his nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than his predeceſſors, he took their confuſed &amp; immetho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical practices &amp; reduced them into method <hi>i. e.</hi> form and order. Well, this great man being principal of the College of Phyſicians, he taught his pupils to obſerve orderly rules, otherwiſe <hi>method,</hi> from whence his diſciples were in honour called Methodiſts. So much for learning, now for doctrine.</p>
            <p>Then my beloved the caſe ſtands thus; amongſt the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy there always have been a great number who did not love praying, ſinging of hymns, reading and expounding the ſcriptures, the like may be ſaid of the ſtudents. What they aimed at was a good living without much work, and as one in a certain place ſays, <hi>Thoſe men care not if the Devil take the flock provided they can but get the fleece.</hi> On the other hand, there have been ſome who loved to pray, to ſing hymns, to read and expound the ſcriptures, who if they were
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012104_0010_0F89C472D6AE4258"/>
not permitted to do it in public houſes or churches, would do it in private houſes to the no ſmall diſgrace of the other gentlemen. Well, my beloved, theſe are they who have been called methodiſts, fanatics and enthuſiaſts. Now a word or two about their tenets, and then I diſmiſs this head, for really their tenets, being deſtructive of prieſtcraft, muſt by no means be encouraged.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, and foremoſt, they think that a man ought to atteſt no articles of faith, but what he believes to be true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They think that a man ought not to profeſs to my Lord biſhop that he believes all the thirty nine articles of the eſtabliſhed church to be the true faith of the goſpel when he ſecretly believes in his heart that they are falſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They think that a man ſhould not profeſs to his lordſhip, that he is moved by the holy ghoſt to deſire the office of a deacon, when he conſiders it in his heart as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion and enthuſiaſm for any man to pretend to be moved by the holy ghoſt in theſe days.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They think that after a man has ſubſcribed the thirty nine articles, and ſolemnly ſwore that he believes them, that he ſhould not go and preach doctrines directly oppoſite to the ſaid articles.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They think that no man ought to be permitted to enter the pulpit whoſe life and converſation is <hi>diſſolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe with a great many tenets beſides equally ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to maintain, and therefore, though tolerated by the king and parliament, the Heads of Houſes will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them in the univerſity.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The—of the—defended their doctrines by the thirty-nine articles of the eſtabliſhed church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wot, I fear me much, that this doctor is himſelf tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with methodiſtical tenets; for no body now a-days beſides methodiſts, &amp;c. conſider the thirty-nine articles of the eſtabliſhed church as any teſt of doctrine: as for the clergy it is well known that they are moſtly <hi>diſſenters</hi> from the doctrine of the articles and prayerbook. Ah! beloved, if the truth was known, it would be found that this ſame— prays to God, and reads his bible, or how elſe ſhould he take part with thoſe young men whom the Heads of Houſes expelled the univerſity <hi>for praying, reading &amp; expounding the ſcriptures.</hi> Beſides he would not have ſpoken ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their piety &amp; the exemplarineſs of their lives as the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012104_0011_0F89C4737B92BF68"/>
text tells us he did, ſeeing the ſenſe of the univerſity was, that their praying, reading, &amp;c. was vicious. I fear me, my beloved, that if the Heads of Houſes do not keep a good <hi>look out</hi> after this ſame doctor, it will be difficult for them to keep the univerſity clear from ſuch as pray, and read, and expound the ſcriptures; but <hi>his motion was overruled.</hi> What is one methodiſt among a hoſt of divines?</p>
            <p>Thus, my beloved, I have gone through the firſt part of my plan, and ſhall proceed to the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Namely, to raiſe a notable point of doctrine from it; which is this, viz. That the conduct of the Heads of the Houſes, in expelling the ſix young men from praying, reading, and expounding the ſcriptures, is defenſible from the conduct of the clergy of all ages and countries, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſnarling perſons may ſay.</p>
            <p>To clear this I ſhall produce four inſtances, all of which I ſhall take out of that old antiquated book called the ſcripture. A book which ſets forth the true ſpirit of the univerſity doctors to the very life. The</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Of which inſtances we have in the book of Daniel, chap. iii. wherein ſome tranſactions of the eſtabliſhed church at Babylon are recorded; concerning which I would make the following notes:</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the religion, by law eſtabliſhed was the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the clergy, made and ſet up in the plains of Dura. A place, my beloved, which, if we may give credit to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, very much reſembles the plains of Oxford.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The clergy, who you know have always been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully fond of a <hi>golden god,</hi> would by no means ſuffer an act of toleration to be paſſed in favour of methodiſts and diſſenters; but on the contrary, got an act of parliament on their own ſide, enjoining the ſtricteſt uniformity in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and threatening death to all diſſenters: for it ſeems this prince was too eaſy and like ſome of our former princes in England, was ſo much afraid of the clergy, that he was obliged to conform, and ſo eſpouſed an act of uniformity, which they hoped would bring good griſt to their mill, verſ. 6.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This law eſtabliſhed, the clergy were impatient to have the ſubjects of this great king brought to the teſt: which they thought beſt to do by appointing a public feaſt;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012104_0012_0F89C47441BA8528"/>
on which it was required that every man, and mother's ſon ſhould fall down before, and worſhip this golden god ſet up by the king, as the tool of the parſons.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That there were four degrees of learned men, whom, I ſuppoſe dwelt in the univerſity at Babylon: firſt, there were <hi>magicians,</hi> who were with them, the ſame as doctors of divinity are with us in our univerſities: ſecondly, there were <hi>aſtrologers,</hi> or men of learned ſciences, much the ſame with our maſters of arts: thirdly, there were <hi>ſorcerers,</hi> who I ſuppoſe, were either fellows of the college, or batchelors of arts, appointed to be tythe gatherers; and, fourthly, there were chaldeans or ſtudents of their divinity, and other fine arts: and,</p>
            <p n="5">V. That all thoſe gentry were very vigilant in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and informing againſt diſſenters, verſe 8. <hi>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accuſed the Jews.</hi> That is to ſay, certain young ſtudents, being ſpurred on to it by their tutors who care not to appear in ſuch a dirty affair themſelves, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Strict as the law was, there were ſome who took upon them to pray to God, like thoſe ſix young gentlemen who were expelled the univerſity for praying. But what were they think you? why truly, they were dſſenters and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts, for they would not conform to the form of worſhip by law eſtabliſhed, therefore were diſſenters; and they were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts, if praying to God denominates a man a methodiſt. But what followed, trow ye? why, as ſoon as they were found out to be non-conformiſts, the doctors of divinity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed them of rebellion; and had the king been as fond of burning diſſenters, as their reverences were, theſe men had in a trice been executed, without having another chance for their lives: But he was not quite ſo fiery, but gave them another trial. If you'll read the chapter through you'll ſee the upſhot of it, and how the doctors of the univerſity were confounded, and the diſſenters were readmitted to the king's favour, for God did work for them.</p>
            <p>I paſs on to the days of <hi>Darius:</hi> a prince who had a praying nobelman for his firſt miniſter of ſtate, and, for ought I know to the contrary, he might be lord of the treaſury, as well as the chancellor of the empire. His name was Daniel, and by birth a Jew. Well, my beloved, being ſo very great, he was grievouſly envied, by the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012104_0013_0F89C474F8220E60"/>
inferior placemen, though they kept it ſecret, and ſpoke him fair to his face; and he was very much abuſed by thoſe who were out of place. If we may judge of ancient times from what appears in ages more modern, we may ſuppoſe that the times took a turn ſomething like the following.</p>
            <p>One man cries out againſt his being a favourite, and too intimate with the queen or queen's mother, as their kinſmen do upon ſimilar occaſion; another complains of his being a foreigner, and a captive, ſo highly dignified, whilſt the natives were neglected: perhaps their news-papers might be ſtuffed with clamours againſt the exotic favourite; and the incenſed mob might be taught to cry out, liberty and Babylon for ever—but no Jew—no favourite—no captive. Well, my beloved, all the <hi>inns</hi> and <hi>outs</hi> might have fretted themſelves to death, without being able to do any thing againſt this prime miniſter, this ſame Daniel, the king's favourite, if they had not applied to the principal clergy, the Heads of Houſes. But I trow, the reverend doctors, the magicians, the maſters of the art of aſtrology, &amp;c. &amp;c. no ſooner embarked in the popular cauſe but they were more than a match for the favourite, who had fallen by means of their reverences, if the Almighty had as little to do with him, as he has to do with the greateſt part of the clergy.</p>
            <p>Well, my beloved, the Heads of Houſes and the diſaffected ſtateſmen met altogether, and conſulted what was the beſt way to overturn the ſtate of this praying favourite. But the conduct of Daniel was ſo exemplary, that they knew they ſhould be able to find nothing wrong in him, unleſs they could entrap him in matters of religion. Therefore having firſt perſuaded the king, that <hi>the church was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> they urged the neceſſity of a law being made, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting any man's praying unto God. Well, <hi>Darius</hi> the king, was not ſuch a novice in politics but he knew the neceſſity of having the clergy on his ſide, and therefore though he could not ſee into that part of their myſterious divinity, made the decree according to the plan concerted by that learned body.</p>
            <p>But it is thought that he would have ſtrained a point with them, if he had known that they were aiming at the life of his faithful favourite.</p>
            <p>But how ſtiff theſe bibliſts are? for this Daniel went on praying to God, reading and expounding the ſcriptures <hi>in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012104_0014_0F89C475B62EB270"/>
a private houſe,</hi> notwithſtanding the king had under the direction of the clergy ordained otherwiſe; this was enough to have provoked the <hi>Heads of Houſes to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him the Univerſity</hi> had he belonged to it, but he not belonging to it, they were obliged to be ſatisfied with put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to death without expelling him.</p>
            <p>Now leſt any ſhould object to the clergy having the honour of deviſing this ſcheme, becauſe there is no notice taken of them in hiſtory; let it be obſerved, that it was never known that many great men or noblemen were ever given to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere in religious matters, and ſtateſmen in all ages have been wiſe enough to take up with the religion which the prieſts have preſcribed to them, therefore what you give of honour to any body in this affair, let it be given to the clergy. And I paſs on to make a compariſon betwixt that affair and this before us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They could find no occaſion of fault in Daniel; ſo it was with the ſix young men who were expelled the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, for their lives were ſaid to be pious and exemplary.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They thought they might entrap him in ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the law of his God. So likewiſe, theſe young men though they were no whoreſters, no gamblers, no drunkards, &amp;c. yet they could be trapped in matters relating to their God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This ſame Daniel notwithſtanding the penalty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the edict againſt any who ſhould take upon them to pray to God, perverſely, rebelliouſly, and obſtinately perſiſted in his uſual apoſtolical, puritannical, nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical and methodiſtical manner of praying to God in a private houſe. So no doubt but theſe ſix young men knew that it was againſt the will of the Heads of Houſes, &amp;c. that any of the ſtudents under their care ſhould pray to God in a private houſe; for ſays our text, <hi>Six young men were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Univerſity, for praying, reading, and expounding the ſcriptures in a private houſe;</hi> yet they perſiſted in it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, under this head. Daniel preſident of the princes, kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God as aforetime. But how will you be able to find ſuch puritanic conduct among our Britiſh noblemen: for I wot that a praying nobleman is pretty near as great a rarity as a white crow upon Malvern hills. The</p>
            <p n="2">II. Inſtance of clerical conduct which gives countenance
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012104_0015_0F89C47689A50A38"/>
to the late act of the Heads of Houſes I ſhall bring from the clergy of that famous univerſity at Jeruſalem, in the days of Chriſt and his apoſtles. In the eſtabliſhed church of Judea there were articles of faith and a canon law, which all the clergy profeſt to believe, regard and defend. This confeſſion of faith was firſt compiled by Moſes the founder of that church, and afterwards ratified and confirmed by Ezra and Nehemiah, their two principal reformers; even as the thirty nine articles of the eſtabliſhed church were ratified and confirmed by our Engliſh reformers. I know you'll be ready to think that the clergy deemed it an honour to tread in the ſteps of thoſe pious reformers; but I trow, my beloved, ye are greatly miſtaken; for the <hi>Heads of Houſes</hi> of the univerſity at Jeruſalem, even did as many others have done ſince, make the commandment void to eſtabliſh their own traditions. Perhaps you will be ready to ſtartle like the cows in July, when bit by the envious flies, when ye hear of a univerſity at Jeruſalem: but I aſſure you, it was there that the doctors (i. e. teachers) of the law dwelt, and their law was their divinity. Now, where do the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dogs delight to reſort ſo much as to a place were the carcaſe is, or where ſhall we ſee ſuch ſwarms of reverend doctors as at the univerſity. Thoſe phariſees, thoſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, thoſe ſcribes, and thoſe doctors were all gownſmen, but whether they wore the very ſame uniforms with the gentlemen of Oxford univerſity, my author does not ſay. Yet thus much may be gathered from the hiſtory, that if that wandering Jew who they ſay has lived ever ſince the times I am ſpeaking of, ſhould chance in his travels to call at Oxford, he would think upon his longevity that from the manners of the men it was old Jeruſalem riſen again from its ruins. But we will drop this, and come to the matter in hand, which is to give a juſt account of thoſe clergy, that you may ſee that the heads of houſes have not depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a jot from the rules of their clerical anceſtors.</p>
            <p>The Jeruſalem clergy finding that their living depended upon ſubſcribing the articles given by Moſes, and the homilies compiled by the prophets; they could for the ſake of a venerable reputation, and a fattiſh living, or, as ye would ſay, <hi>for the good of the church,</hi> very readily ſubſcribe, and atteſt them upon oath, though many of them, called ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees, did not believe any thing about them. Now not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012104_0016_0F89C47828D04DA0"/>
to take notice of the vulgar opinion, namely, that there are a great many ſadducees in our univerſities; I cannot but obſerve the weakneſs of thoſe who blame ſuch of the clergy who ſwear to articles they do not believe, ſeeing that was the practice of the clergy of the firſt eſtabliſhed church that was in the world.</p>
            <p>About ſomething more then 1700 years ſince, there aroſe ſome diſſenters who made a great ſtir among the people, and brought great uneaſineſs upon the clergy. I do not mean that thoſe were diſſenters from the articles of faith which was of old given to the ſaints; but they were diſſenters from the clergy, and did not ſpare to detect their errors, both in principles and practice; a practice which our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern methodiſts are ſaid to be guilty of, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the Heads of Houſes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe were laymen, not regularly educated at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and who took upon them to preach without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing authority from the archbiſhop of Jeruſalem; I think his name was Caiaphas, and I wot he was primate of all Judea. Well, thoſe men were not only laymen, but the riff-raff of them, even fiſhermen: note, they were not attorneys or merchants clerks; nor were they chymiſts, nor apothecaries, but fiſhermen. And yet they preached, and yet they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the ſcriptures, to the great confuſion of the holy trade of prieſtcraft. The eſtabliſhed church was now thought to be in danger. And how it could be thought ſo was ſomething ſtrange, ſeeing thoſe praying and preaching diſſenters proved all their doctrine from the articles and homilies given by Moſes and the prophets, the ſame as our modern methodiſts prove their doctrines from the articles and homilies of the church of England; and the church of England has been thought in no ſmall danger from theſe ſame methodiſts, upon grounds equally ſubſtantial. Believe me my beloved, the reverend, the learned, the zealous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Sacheveral, was not the firſt nor the laſt, who was grieved for fear of the church. But he is dead and gone, therefore I return to the clergy at Jeruſalem; and ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but remember how active they were in procuring the deſtruction of Jeſus Chriſt, and when he was riſen from the dead and aſcended into glory, they abated nothing of their zeal for their eſtabliſhed church.</p>
            <p>For no ſooner were they aware of the power of the apoſtles
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012104_0017_0F89C478B9A4E988"/>
doctrine, (by apoſtles I mean thoſe who took upon them to pray, read, and expound the ſcriptures in private houſes, as you may ſee in the ſubſequent part of the hiſtory) as theſe ſix young men who were expelled the univerſity are ſaid to have done. Seeing, I ſay, their extraordinary fervour in preaching, they cried out againſt them as perſons drunk with new wine, by which we may underſtand <hi>enthuſiaſm.</hi> Acts ii. 13 Well, my beloved, this is the very cry of the clergy againſt all ſuch as preach Jeſus and the reſurrection, and from their mouths the vulgar catch the ſound; ſo that with many, a methodiſt, an enthuſiaſt, a diſſenter, and a fanatick, are thought to be ſynonimous terms. From hence we may learn that ſlander may as well be thrown in a ſermon as in a farce, and will iſſue with as good a grace from a pulpit as from a theatre. But no more of this, becauſe our time draws towards the other end.</p>
            <p>It is very remarkable how zealous thoſe of the gentlemen of the gown, who aimed no higher than a good fat benefice, have always ſhewed themſelves when the doctrine of Chriſt in its ſimplicity hath been preached; for why? truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it lays the ax to the root of the tree of prieſtcraft, and throws down the importance of the parſon into the dirt. If the clergy were all to obſerve the rules given by Chriſt to his diſciples in his ſermon upon the mount, where would be all their riches and grandeur, their coaches, their livery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their plate? But ye know, that theſe rules are different from this craft, whereby we parſons get our wealth, as heaven is different from hell. But as prieſtcraft is lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it will be ſure to find ſupporters, whilſt the houſes have got one head left upon them.</p>
            <p>In Acts v. we find that Peter and the reſt of his praying, reading, and ſcripture-expounding brethren, were brought before the Vice Chancellor and the Heads of Houſes for a hearing, and after a hearing of ſeveral hours they took coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to ſlay them, v. 33. But there was one Gamaliel, the head of a certain houſe who ſided with them, and probably proved their doctrine from the articles of the Jewiſh church as by law eſtabliſhed. I trow this ſame Gamaliel was tinctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the doctrine they preached, as—of—who defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the faith of the ſix young men who were expelled the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of—for praying, &amp;c. may be ſuppoſed ſecretly to have
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012104_0018_0F89C479869EEA70"/>
believed in the articles which he once ſubſcribed, though he dared not to avow his faith openly.</p>
            <p>There is one thing in the account that is ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, namely, the wiſe motion of doctor Gamaliel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled the bloody deſigns of the prieſts; but it was not ſo at the other univerſity, for altho' — of — defended and proved the methodiſtical doctrine from the articles of the church, and ſpoke highly of the piety and exemplarineſs of their lives, his motion was over-ruled and the ſix young men were expelled.</p>
            <p>Another thing we may take notice of, namely, thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctors had a law by which they could put people to death for praying, reading, &amp; expounding the ſcriptures; but our univerſities have no ſuch law, or it is no way doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but that the ſame zeal which will, under a proteſtant government, expel the ſtudents of the univerſity for praying &amp;c. would, for the ſame reaſons, burn offenders at a ſtake, were they favoured with a popiſh king. So that if the Heads of Houſes were leſs bloody in their deſigns than their anceſtors, it is not to imputed to want of good-will, but to the proteſtant reſtraints which they are under.</p>
            <p>It would be endleſs, my beloved, to point out all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which the Jewiſh, and the — clergy agree; I ſhall therefore leave them to another occaſion, and ſhall paſs on to another very famous church, in that part of the world and after that I ſhall come nearer home, within our own ken. And,</p>
            <p n="3">III. This famous church was the church of Diana, at Epheſus; and I wot, in this church there was many a good living in the gift of the univerſity, and I trow, that the Heads of Houſes were very careful that none ſhould enjoy one of them unleſs he was well known to be a true ſon of the church, that is to ſay, a promoter of the ſale of the ſhrines of Diana, and a worſhipper of the image that fell down from Jupiter.</p>
            <p>This Diana was in her day, a lady remarkable for hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtags, and ever ſince, her clergy have been as remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable for the hunting of (not ſtags but) a good benefice. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my beloved, this ſame huntreſs was the perſonage worſhipped by moſt people of Aſia, and ſhe had many, very many clergy, who adored her for the ſake of gain: <hi>for by this craft we have our wealth,</hi> ſaid they.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:012104_0019_0F89C47A3596BC18"/>There was a famous univerſity for the training up of young gentlemen in the holy craft of making ſhrines for the goddeſs, and a lucrative craft they found it my beloved, for they had it in their power to ſell a brazen ſhrine for a golden prize; a thing which others beſides them practice.</p>
            <p>This univerſity was at Epheſus, a very populous city, where water was cheap, but fire very dear; and here were many colleges and halls for the training up of young men in the craft of <hi>getting wealth.</hi> Every hall had a Head, and over all the Heads of Houſes was a Vice Chancellor, the rev. Dr. Demetrius by name. As for praying, reading, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the ſcriptures they meddled not with them, but were to the higheſt degree, intent upon getting wealth.</p>
            <p>Well, they carried on this craft for many years, till at laſt there came ſome itinerant preachers to town, who made it their buſineſs to pray to God, to read, and expound the ſcriptures, and ſing hymns in private houſes, contrary to the ſenſe of that univerſity. This was no ſmall mortification to the clergy who very well knew that if real religion, or praying, reading, and expounding the ſcriptures was tolerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it would put an end to their lucrative prieſtcraft, and their reverences would fall into diſgrace. But to prevent ſuch a cataſtrophe the reverend Dr. Demetrius, Vice Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, aſſembled the Heads of Houſes to conſult what was beſt to be done; and it was reſolved <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> to cry out, <hi>the church was in danger,</hi> that under pretence of ſaving this church, they might ſave their own profits. Well, they cried out, that <hi>the church was in danger,</hi> that <hi>the church was in danger,</hi> till they had ſufficiently inflamed the rabble, then they laid hold on the itinerants, had them before the Heads of Houſes, who gave them ſuch treatment as praying people may expect to meet with from the clergy of the—. It happened however, as in a late caſe, that there was one man of integrity and honour amongſt them, much like the Head of — Hall, only with this difference, the one was a Notary-public, and the other is a gentleman in holy orders. Well, this attorney it ſeems being recorder of the city, thought that the clergy carried their authority a little beyond the rules of moderation and decency, a thing by no means uncommon for ſome gentlemen of the cap and gown. This town-clerk took up the cauſe of his itinerants, and in a ſpirited, ſenſible manner, defended their
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012104_0020_0F89C47D93CFEE10"/>
conduct and tenets, not from the thirty-nine articles but from the articles of natural religion and morality, and ſpake very highly of their piety and good behaviour. I cannot but remark that in this affair the town-clerk was more ſucceſsful than the gentlemen who pleaded the cauſe of the ſix methodiſts at Oxford; the former over-ruled the purpoſes of Diana's clergy; but the univerſity clergy over ruled the motion of the latter, according to our text: for though he defended their doctrine from the thirty-nine articles of the eſtabliſhed church, and ſpoke very highly of their piety and the exemplarineſs of their lives, <hi>theſe ſix young men were expelled the univerſity for praying, reading, and expounding the ſcriptures, and for ſinging hymns in a private houſe.</hi> For why? why truly, my beloved, becauſe praying, reading, and expounding the ſcriptures is not the craft by which we get our wealth. For proof of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I refer you to ſtubborn facts; namely, that you ſhall ſeldom ſee a divine who makes a point of praying, reading, and expounding the ſcriptures, and of ſinging hymns in private or public houſes, who keep their equipage, or poſſeſs your fat livings. I wot, my beloved, that one drone eats more honey than four laborious bees; for proof of this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the reverend Dr. Pliny, an author of approved merit and a great divine.</p>
            <p>But I paſs on to the fourth eſtabliſhed church the clergy of which, in all reſpects, poſſeſſed the ſpirit of univerſity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, or Heads of Houſes; and I trow, it is a church of great pretenſions, the clergy of which are as infallible as the moſt holy mother pope Joan that lady, who was Chriſt's vicar, and Peter's ſucceſſor, and carried the keys of heaven, hell, and purgatory in her pocket, when ſhe was in her prime, and her moon ſhone at full. I gueſs by this time you know that I mean the good old, one catholic, roman, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, pontifical, univerſal, mother church, in the boſom of which our fore-fathers of the ſurcingle ſlept ſo ſnug, wrapt about with abbey lands as with warm blankets. And if I may ſpeak the ſentiments of my ſable brethren of the univerſity, we wiſh for the ſake of thoſe lands, that we were all ſafe rolling in her boſom once more. But I will not keep you in ſuſpenſe about this.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Church the conduct of whoſe clergy was ſo near a kin to the conduct of the clergy of —. In the days of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012104_0021_0F89C47F387CD0C0"/>
Betſey, the veſtal queen, the clergy ſuffered great diſcontent. For why? becauſe praying, reading and ſcripture expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people were ſuffered to live, and were even tolerated in the univerſity, which was a kind of counterbalance to the emolument their reverences had enjoyed in the days of Mary of ſcarlet memory, for as ſoon as this orthodox lady had aſcended the throne, matters took a very agreeable turn, and the right reverend biſhops, Bonner and Gardiner began to work for the good of the church. Like true bred D— D—s they ſearched every corner of the land for matters to work upon; and who ſhould they pitch upon, know ye but thoſe miniſters and others who prayed to God, read, and expounded the ſcriptures, and ſung hymns? For thoſe clergymen were much like unto others, they diſcouraged praying to any beſides ſaints of their own cannonization; and as for the ſcriptures, they found it for their intereſt that the ſenſe of them ſhould be concealed. And no doubt other people of the ſame practices have reaſons equally ponderous to aſſign for their conduct.</p>
            <p>Who was Cranmer, my beloved? Why truly, though he was primate of England, he took upon him to pray, read and expound the ſcriptures, and as one ſuch, according to the laws of Trent council, he was expelled the convocation and burnt to death, as an enemy ſo the clergy, Latimer, and Ridley, and Hooper, and Taylor, and Bradford, and Hunter, and Philpot, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. were all of them guilty of thoſe heinous offences of praying, of reading, of expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptures, and of ſinging of hymns. The ſame crimes with which the Oxford methodiſts were charged, and for which they were expelled the univerſity.</p>
            <p>Thus, beloved, I have with much pleaſure gone ſo far thro' with my firſt propoſed plan, and from what I have advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we may raiſe the following remarks; 1. That the ſpirit of our D — D —'s has been the ſame in all ages, a noble ſpirit of oppoſition to methodiſtical tenets. The magicians, the aſtrologers, the ſorcerers, and the chaldeans, the ſcribes, the phariſees, the lawyers, the ſadducees, and the doctors, and the ſhrine-makers, and the inquiſitors, and the roman biſhops, and the vice chancellors, and the heads of houſes are all of the ſame religion; namely to <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe praying, reading, and expounding of the ſcriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012104_0022_0F89C48054C3EB00"/>2. That the ſtate of religion in our land is likely to be ſoon upon a very reſpectable ſooting, ſeeing no more than ſix, out of the vaſt number of ſtudents at Oxford, took upon them to pray to God, to read, and to expound the ſcriptures; ſo that it is hoped the many pariſhes in England, will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have parſons who will let their pariſhioners have their own way, and go quietly to hell without diſturbing of them. Whereas was not care taken to ſuppreſs praying people in the univerſity, we ſhould have the nation ſwarming with them, much to the detriment of p—c—ft</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is obſerveable that we have found out more fully what four of thoſe ſix gentlemen were, ere they ſet foot in the univerſity; one was a publican, another a ſmith, a third a barber, and a fourth a teacher, under W—, as it is written by the reverend Dr. Oxonienſis Gazetteer, No. 12199, April 8, 1768, and I wot, my beloved, though my kindred are profeſſors of ſuch arts they are to be held as dangerous ſciences; therefore muſt not be tolerated by the clergy.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. And foremoſt the clergy has ſuffered much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from the blackſmith, and whilſt the bitterneſs of the loſs of the abbey lands belcheth from our ſtomachs, we pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella gentlemen will never forgive the blackſmiths. Quere, For why? Anſ. Becauſe he was a blackſmith's ſon, lord Thomas Cromwell by name who ſtripped the church, that is to ſay, the clergy, of thoſe warm, thoſe fat abbey lands. No more blackſmith's I pray you now — we'll have none of them. Therefore Mr. V—e C—r did well in expelling the man becauſe he had been a blackſmith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. One other of them was a publican, <hi>i. e.</hi> a tax gatherer, and I ſuppoſe, M. V— C—r thought that the difference betwixt <hi>tax gathering</hi> and <hi>tythe gathering,</hi> being ſo very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling that after a young man had ſufficiently learned at home to gather taxes, it was quite needleſs for him to come to the univerſity to learn to <hi>gather tythes.</hi> I wot, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that the old grudge betwixt the phariſees and the publicans has not yet ſubſided. For, as the learned <hi>Oxoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> obſerves, the V—C— expelled a man, the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, for having been a publican.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And in the next place another had been a <hi>barber,</hi> That is to ſay a <hi>ſhaver.</hi> Believe me it is dangerous to play with edge tools, and razors are keen things; but keeneſs muſt not be admitted at O — d. A ſhaver if tolerated,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012104_0023_0F89C480F5EA1020"/>
might be as bad as a blackſmith; but no more of this, we'll have no more ſhavers, my beloved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth was a teacher in a ſchool, under W —y. But who, or what, this ſame W — y is, whether an hill, an old abbey, an holy college, or an oak-tree, the accurate <hi>Oxonienſis</hi> does not ſay. But this ſchoolmaſter who taught under it, be it what it will, was juſtly expelled. For why? Becauſe he departed ſo very far from the rule eſtabliſhed among ſtudents. The common rule obſerved by the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful young gentlemen of the gown is, before they have ſo much as learned the firſt leſſon of themſelves, they conclude that they are able to teach others; witneſs ſo many a dull parſon. But this man though he had been accuſtomed to teach others, meanly debaſed himſelf, ſo far as to receive inſtructions from others; but ſuch a mean opinion of one's ſelf being no way likely to add weight to the importance of the parſon, muſt not be tolerated. I ſhall not now ſay any more; intending ere long to write a commentary on the goſpel of Oxford, as written by the learned, the juſt, the accurate, and the reverend doctor <hi>Oxonienſis.</hi>
