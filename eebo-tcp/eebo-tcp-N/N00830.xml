            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT the Time when (a few Months past) these <hi>Sermons</hi> were Preached, I had not the least thought of Printing them. But several of my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have not only importuned my Consent thereunto, but brought me transcribed Copies as they were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from me in Short-hand, with a desire that they might be sent to the Press; and that therefore I would first <hi>peruse</hi> them: which I have done; and must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the <hi>Reader,</hi> that if he does expect any thing <hi>Curious</hi> or <hi>Critical</hi> in what is herewith emitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will find himself disappointed, There is nothing <hi>Elaborate</hi> therein more than what is usual in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Course of my Ministry.

               <p>THE Apostle in this, with the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and following Verses, Exhorts Believers to adorn their Profession of the Gospel, with an Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. There are several <hi>Motives</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whereby this Exhortation is urged.</p>

men. <hi>The Grace of God which brings Salvation,</hi> the Gospel which is a Doctrine of Grace, and which does bring to men the Tidings of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, teaches them to <hi>deny all Vngodliness,</hi> that they should be careful of being Guilty of Sins against the First Table of the Moral Law: and to <hi>deny all worldly Lusts,</hi> that they should Abstain from all Sins against the Second Table of that Law: and that they should <hi>Live Soberly</hi> in respect of themselves: <hi>i. e.</hi> that they should be Temperate, &amp; Live <hi>Righteously</hi> in respect of men. And that they should <hi>Live Godly,</hi> which implieth the Exercises of Duties of Piety and Religion, which have God for their Object. This does the Gospel Teach men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Motive the Apostle useth, is, in that such a Life is the way to Blessedness; as in the words which have been read. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is the way to Happiness. They that bring forth Fruit to Holiness, shall in the End have Everlasting Life. Against this might be objected, we see Holy men many times mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Outward respects, and they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. His <hi>Incarnation</hi> is called His <hi>Appearing</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. By His <hi>Appearing</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He has brought Life and Immortallity to light. The Son of God did appear in the form of a man to Save the world, and therefore to Dy, that He might accomplish Salvation for all that should believe on Him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then, there is a Second <hi>Appearing</hi> of Christ, which is yet to be expected, Namely, His <hi>Appearing</hi> to Judge the world. He has once <hi>Appeared</hi> to Save the world, He will again <hi>Appear</hi> to Judge the world. And this is by way of <hi>Eminency</hi> called His <hi>Appearing.</hi> The Original word signifies an <hi>Illustrious</hi> and <hi>Glorious</hi> Apppearing.</p>
               <p>The words afford unto us Three Doctrines.</p>

Thus Hope is put for the good hoped for, Gal. 5.5. <hi>For we through the Spirit, wait for the Hope of Righteousness by Faith.</hi> By the Hope of Righteousness is meant the Righteousness which we hope for. We (sayes the Apostle) do by the assistance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, Hope for a Righteousness that will Justifie us, that will make us appear Just and Righteous before God; not by our own works, but by Faith, Colos. 1.5. <hi>For the Hope which is laid up for you in Heaven.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>the good hoped</hi> for which is laid up in Heaven. And this is called a <hi>Blessed Hope,</hi> on a double account.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

this Life Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that Believeth</hi> has <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Life.</hi> He <hi>has</hi> it in the beginnings of it. A man whose Sins are Pardoned, is a Blessed man, Psal. 32.1. <hi>Blessed is the man whose Sins are forgiven,</hi> and unto whom God does not impute Iniquity. That man that has Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Blessings bestowed on him, (in which <hi>Blessedness</hi> doth chiefly consist) is truly a Blessed man, That man that has Grace in his Soul, and that has a sure Title to an inheritance in Heaven, is a Blessed man. Nevertheless, though Believers here are as to their <hi>State</hi> Blessed, they are subject to many miseries, many afflictions and sorrows must they undergo while in this world; As <hi>Iob</hi> said, Job 2.10. <hi>Shall a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good at the hands of God, and not evil.</hi> In this world Believers do not receive only good, but evil. But in the World to come, they shall then receive good &amp; not evil. It was therefore said of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luk. 16.25. That <hi>in his Life time, he had his Evil things, but now he is Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; now he is gotten into the other World, there is no more evil things attending of him, there is nothing but what is comfortable. But to speak more particularly, there are several things comprehended in this <hi>Blessedness,</hi> which is the object of the <hi>Believers</hi> Hope.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>They hope for</hi> Salvation <hi>at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi> When He appears He will appear to them as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.

And all that Good, all that Blessedness which is contained in this Comprehensive word, <hi>Salvation</hi> is that they hope for, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.8. Putting on the Breastplate of Faith, and Love, and for an helmet, <hi>the hope of Salvation.</hi> There is Salvation in respect of Deliverance from outward Evils. This Believers hope for, Isa. 60.20. <hi>The dayes of thy mourning shall be ended.</hi> And there is <hi>Salvaton</hi> in respect of Deliverance from Spiritual &amp; from Eternal Evils. Sin is a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al evil; the temptations of Satan are spiritual evils; &amp; the Torments of Hell are Eternal Miseries. There is the Worm that Dyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Believers hope for deliverance from this, Isa. 45.17. <hi>Israel shall be Saved in the Lord with an Everlasting Salvation.</hi> Deliverance from Everlasting Misery, is an Everlasting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And this is that which Believers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, at the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Salvation of them all, will not be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till then, Heb. 9.28. <hi>He shall appear the Second time without Sin unto Salvation.</hi> The Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was a Type of this Salvation. <hi>Moses</hi> then said to them, (as in the 14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirst, no more Pain, no more Crying, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Spiritual Evils, neither Sin nor the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, shall molest them any more for ever. Now then this will be a Blessed Day, and therefore the hope of it is a Blessed Hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Believers hope that at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ, their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies shall be restored to Life again.</hi> Isa. 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise.</hi> As for dead Believers, when the dead Bodies of the Prophets shall arise they shall arise too. The Resurrection of the Body is a special object of the Believers <hi>Blessed Hope.</hi> It was therefore a principle thing in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, &amp; that he was Persecuted for, Act. 23.6. <hi>For the Hope of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead am I called into Question.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Act. 24.15. <hi>I have Hope towards God, that there shall be a Resurrection from the dead.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, their immortal Souls must be separated from their Bodies for some time, they know not how long, and in the mean time their bodies consumed in the rotting Grave. Believers hope that then they shall have the very same Bodies restored to them again, which their immortal Souls were in before Death made a separation, but wonderfully and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously Changed as to the qualities thereof. 'Tis true also concerning Unbelievers, wicked
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000998_0012_0FAEE82DE3C9DD80"/>
men, that they shall rise out of their Graves, and enjoy the very same Bodies that they had in this world. We may not think, that the Bodies that have sinned, shall escape the Fire of Hell, and that another Body that never sinned, shall suffer instead of it. Thus as to Believers, they shall have the very same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. That Body that did serve God and Glorifie Him in this world, shall be made to live again in that Day. As the Body of Christ now in Glory, is the very same which did lye in the Grave. That very Body that was Crucifyed, is now at the Right-hand of God. So shall it be as to Believers on Christ, 1 Cor. 15.53. For <hi>this Corruptible, must put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, This</hi> Corruptible and not another. And the Resurrection of the Body which is the Blessed Hope of all Christians, will be at the Appearing of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23 We shall rise every one in their own order, <hi>they that are Christs at His Coming.</hi> It will be <hi>at the Last Day. Martha</hi> said to Christ, when He told her that her Brother should rise again, Joh. 11.24 <hi>I know that he shall rise again, in the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the last day.</hi> And this is also signified &amp; sealed to Believers in the Sacrament. When they partake at the Lords Table, this Glorious Truth is signified, and the Promise of it seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them. Joh. 6.54 <hi>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood has Eternal Life, and I will
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000998_0013_0FAEE82EA51CABE0"/>
Raise him up at the last day.</hi> That very Body, that did Sacramentally eat the Flesh of Christ, and that did drink of the Blood of Christ, He will Raise it up at the Last Day. And this blessed truth, has ever been the Faith and Hope of Believers, even in all ages of the world. This was that <hi>Iob</hi> did hope for and was assured of, Job 19.26 <hi>I know that my Redeemer Liveth, and that He shall stand on the Earth at the latter day, and though after my skin worms destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh I shall see God.</hi> It is as much as if he had said, I know that there will be a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Appearing of the Great God my Saviour, and that though my Body be consumed in the rotting Grave, it shall be restored to Life in that Blessed Day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Believers hope that at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ, their Bodies shall undergo a Blessed Change.</hi> Not only that they shall be restored to Life, but be Blessedly Changed from what they are. They are now subject to many infirmities, which will then be perfectly and forever removed from them Phil 3.21 <hi>He shall Change our vile Bodies.</hi> We look for a <hi>Saviour</hi> from Heaven that shall Change our vile Bodies: whatever it is makes our Bodies subject to vileness, to meaness, that shall be done away. There are Bodily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are the fruit of Sin, and some part
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000998_0014_0FAEE82F4DA65E98"/>
of the Curse. So are all Bodily Diseases. There are some Bodies subject to Chronical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, which are <hi>Ludibria Medicorum,</hi> all the Physicians in the world cannot cure them. <hi>Asa</hi> was Diseased in his Feet, and sought to the Physicians, and doubtless had the Advice of the Ablest Physicians in the Kingdom, but they could not help him. The Resurrection will Cure all Diseases. The Diseases which the Bodies of Saints carry to the Grave with them, shall not come out of the Grave, again. There are Bodily infirmities also, which are not the effect of Sin, which men would have been subject unto if they never had sinned; such as Hunger, Thirst, want of Sleep, and the like. If <hi>Adam</hi> never had sinned, his Body would have stood in need of Food, that so it might be continued in Life. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever he had sinned, God said to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16. <hi>That he might eat of all the Trees in the Garden of Eden,</hi> one only excepted. And we find <hi>Adam</hi> subject to Sleep before ever he sinned against God. But after the Resurrection, they shall be freed from the sinless infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Humane nature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.30. <hi>In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection they are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> Now the Angels of God in Heaven, never Sleep, Eat, Drink, nor need they any such thing to support their Natures. So shall it be with Believers after the Resurrection. They
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000998_0015_0FAEE8300CBDEAC8"/>
shall Hunger no more, neither Thirst any more. Their Bodies shall then be endowed and adorned with Glorious properties, which the body of <hi>Adam</hi> in his first Estate had not. They will be more happy in respect of their Bodies, then <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise was. They will have a greater Glory on their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies than he had. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. <hi>The Body is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>own in Dishonour, it shall be raised in Glory.</hi> That <hi>Glory</hi> may in special <hi>intend</hi> a <hi>Lustre,</hi> that the body will have on it; like that which was on the face of <hi>Moses</hi> when he had been with God in the Mount And like that which was on the Face of Christ, when transfigured in the Mount, and His <hi>Face did shine like the Sun.</hi> Their bodies shall have no Impediment to the operation of their Souls. Now their bodies are a great hindrance to the operation of the Soul. They will not be so after the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Yea, and they shall be Immortalized bodies. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52, 53. <hi>The Dead shall be Raised incorruptible and we shall be changed. For this Corruptible, must put on Incorruption, and this Mortal must put on Immortality.</hi> In that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect also, they shall be more happy then <hi>Adam</hi> in his first Estate was. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20 36. <hi>They shall be Equal to the Angels, neither can they Dy any more.</hi> This is more then could be said of <hi>Adam.</hi> His body was not so immortal that it could not dye, for it did dye after he

sinned. But as for Believers, at the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, their Bodies shall be made like to that Body which Christ has now in Heaven. <hi>Phil,</hi> 3.21. <hi>He shall change our vile bodies, that it may be fashioned like unto His Glorious Body.</hi> Therefore it is said, they shall <hi>bear the Image of the Heavenly</hi>: 1 Cor. 15.49. <hi>As we have born the image of the Earthly, so also we shall bear the image of the Heavenly.</hi> As we have born the image of the Earthly <hi>Adam</hi> in respect of the Mortality of our Bodies, we shall bear the image of the Second <hi>Adam</hi> in respect of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality as to our Bodies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Believers Hope that at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ, they shall see Him with exceeding Ioy.</hi> True it is, Unbelievers in that day shall see Christ: they that have slighted Him, despised Him, and would not believe the Gospel, they shall see Him in that day. Yea, all the men in the World, or that ever were, or shall be; they shall see Him in that day. The <hi>Iews</hi> that Crucified Him, <hi>Pilate</hi> that Condemned Him, shall see Him in that day; but little to their comfort. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Every Eye shall see Him, and all they that pierced Him, and all the Kings of the earth shall wail.</hi> They shall see Him to their Wo and Wailing, when then they shall think with themselves, This is He

That is a blessed thing: to have seen Christ though in his state of Humiliation, was a blessed and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing: therefore did Christ say <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16, 17 <hi>Many Prophets and Righteous men have desired to see the things that you see and have not seen them. But blessed are your Eyes for they see, and your Ears for they hear.</hi> The holy Prophets desired nothing more then that (if it had been the Will of God) their Eyes might have seen the Son of God appearing in Flesh.

They fell from their First Estate. They that are now Devils in Hell, were once in Heaven; but having sinned against the Great God, HE banished them forever from that holy place.

for the appearing of Christ, that do not believe that he will appear This Hope is an assured hope. Believers so Hope for, so Look for Christs appearing, as that they are sure that they shall see him, Job 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>25 <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that He Shall stand on the Earth in the Latter Day, and that in my flesh I shall see God.</hi> The Apostle also sayes, 1 John 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2 <hi>We know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him.</hi> Tis true, that there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who do not know their own interest in this Blessedness, that have Doubts and Fears, through the weakness of their Faith. Nevertheless, this they know and beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, and are sure of, that Christ will appear from heaven. They that do not believe this, do not look for the Blessed Hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Looking for the Blessed Hope does imply <hi>frequent</hi> thoughts concerning it. As a person that looks for the return of an absent Friend, has <hi>frequent</hi> thoughs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, so they that look for Christs coming, will have <hi>frequent</hi> thoughts concerning him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul·</hi> He had multitudes of thoughts, but there was one thought that did in a special manner delight his Soul, that did comfort him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> no thought did delight and comfort more
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000998_0029_0FAEE83EF9D89FD0"/>
than that of desiring the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> A man that looks for this is still remembring of it. As the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, Psal. 42.6 <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee from the Land of Iordan, and of the Hermonites, from the Hill Missar. Iordan</hi> was <hi>Eastward</hi> of the land of <hi>Canaan, Hermon</hi> was <hi>Northward, Missar</hi> (as some observed) was <hi>Southward.</hi> Thus they that look for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Christ, where ever they be, in what part of the world soever, thoughts concerning Christs Apppearing come into their mind.</p>
               <p n="3">3· This Looking for the Blessed Hope does imply a Longing for it· The man that looks as he ought to do for the Appearing of Christ, <hi>Loves that Appearing.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8 He longs to see that Blessed Day. Believers in the dayes of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> who did look for the First Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Son of God, they wished for, longed for, prayed for it continually, and did desire nothing more. Mat. 13.17 <hi>Many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Righteous men have desired to see those things which you see.</hi> That was to see the day when Christ would appear in the world. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> saw it and was glad· It was a joyful Meditation unto him, to think that Christ should come into the world. When God told him' that <hi>in Him all Nations should be Blessed:</hi> In which was implyed, a promise of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that made his heart glad within him· So they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000998_0030_0FAEE83FED505B68"/>
that look for the Second Appearing of Christ, wish and long for it. 2 Pet. 3.12 <hi>Looking for, and hastning unto the Coming of the day of God.</hi> They that <hi>Look</hi> for it as they ought to do, <hi>hasten to it</hi>; that is with holy wishes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Cant. 8.14 <hi>Make hast my Beloved, and be thou like to a Roe on the Mountains of Spices</hi>: The words are a Prayer for the coming of Christ. The Spirit and the Bride say Come; as in Rev. 22.20 <hi>Come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi> That is the Spirit of one that does aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. and Lastly, This Looking for, does imply a Preparing for the Blessed Appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ. As one that looks for another to come, especially if it be a Great person, he will make suitable preparation for him So they that look for the Appearing of the Great GOD our Saviour Jesus Christ, will make a suitable preparation. They are a People ready, a People <hi>prepared for the Lords coming.</hi> Mark 13.33 <hi>Watch and Pray for you, know not when the time is.</hi> You know not when the Lord will appear, therefore you must be alwayes upon your Watch, and alwayes Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and live a life of Prayer, alwayes Watch
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000998_0031_0FAEE8408AB8EB38"/>
against those things that would unfit you for the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus for the Second thing, pass we to the Third.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. Enqui.</hi> What Reason have Believers to look for the Blessed Hope?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Answ.</hi> 1. The Reason why they should look for this Blessed Appearing of Christ, is because of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it. If it were a doubtful matter, they would not have so much reason to look for it. But it past all doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their Hope is that that shall not be disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Rom. 5.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Hope maketh not ashamed.</hi> When Believers hope for the coming of Christ, they shall not be ashamed by being disappointed. As for the time of Christs Appearance, and of their arriving at the Blessed Hope, it may be sooner than they look for, or longer; but as to the thing it self, they never shall be disappointed. The Anchor of their hope, tis an Anchor that will hold, Heb. 6.19 <hi>Hope is the Anchor of the Soul, su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and stedfast.</hi> Therefore it is called <hi>a Good Hope,</hi> 2 Thes. 2·16 <hi>God has given us Everlasting Consolation, and good Hope through Grace.</hi> That is a <hi>good Hope,</hi> when a man hopes for good and shall certainly attain that good. Believers are as sure to enjoy their hoped for Blessedness, as if they now had it in actual possession. They are as sure to rise
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000998_0032_0FAEE8415E7CB7D0"/>
out of their Graves at the Last Day to Eternal Life, as if now it were done. They are as sure when the Judgment is over to go with Christ to Heaven, and to be with Him there to Eternity, as if now they were there. Eph. 2.6 <hi>He has raised us up together, and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Iesus.</hi> We are as sure to be raised up together in that Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed day, when the Great God our Saviour Christ shall appear, and as sure then to ascend into Heaven, as if now we were there. This is Evident from several things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In that the Good and Blessedness which they hope for, is in a sure Hand and in a safe Place.</hi> In whose hands is it, but in the Hands of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, 2 Tim. 1.12 <hi>I know whom I have believed, who is able to keep that I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Him.</hi> What was that <hi>Paul</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to God? It was his Soul, his Salvation, and all that Good he hoped for in another World. He had committed it all into the Hands of God, whom he knew was able to keep it for him. As a man that has a Jewel, and is afraid of losing it, if it were in his own keeping, therefore does commit it to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a faithful Friend, that is more able to secure it for him· So it is here: And it is well for us that our Blessedness is not in our own keeping, for if it were, we should certainly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000998_0033_0FAEE84230947E30"/>
lose it. Our First Father did so. <hi>Adam</hi> his Life was put into his own hands, and he lost it, and proved a bankrupt when the Stock of the whole world was in his hand. But now the Blessedness of Believers being in Gods hand, who has ingaged to keep it for them, they are sure of it. None shall deprive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them of it. As Christ sayes concerning His <hi>Sheep,</hi> they shall have Eternal Life, John 10.29 <hi>My Father is Greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of His hands.</hi> As for Believers, and their Eternal Life, tis in the Hands of God. And as their hoped for Happiness is in a sure hand, so 'tis in a <hi>safe Place.</hi> That sure hand keeps it in a safe place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Scripture speaks of a <hi>Treasure</hi> in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.20 What is that <hi>Treasure in Heaven</hi>? 'Tis that same thing with the <hi>Blessed Hope.</hi> There no Thief can break through and steal. 'Tis <hi>Laid up</hi> there, Col. 1 5 <hi>The hope which is laid up for you in Heaven·</hi> The Blessedness you hope for, is laid up in a safe place: 'tis laid up in Heaven for you. 'Tis therefore said to be <hi>Reserved</hi> there, 1 Pet. 1.4 <hi>An inheritance reserved in Heaven for you.</hi> This is mentioned as the reason why the Hope of Believers is so sure and stedfast, because what they hope for is out of sight. 'Tis in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19 Here they are in a tempestuous Sea; but come what Storms can, they are safe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, because of their Anchor-hold, which

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Believers Hope of Blessedness is built upon a sure and never failing Foundation.</hi> And therefore, 'tis a sure Hope they have reason to look for it. For what is the Foundation of it?</p>

The Glorious Attributes of God, is the Foundation that the believers hope is built upon. Psal 147.11 <hi>He takes pleasure in them that hope in his Mercy.</hi> Then the Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is the Object of their hope. Now the Mercy of God will not fail. Lam 3.22 <hi>His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions fail not.</hi> Therefore the hope that is built thereon, will not fail. The Love of God is the Foundation of the Believers hope, and that is unchangeable. Jer. 31.3 <hi>I have Loved thee with an Everlasting Love.</hi> The Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God is the Foundation of the Believers hope, and that fails not.

of men? Yea, for the sins of all the men in the World, that shall believe on the Name of Christ? The Angels of Heaven could never have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the justice of God, for any one sin: Only Christ the Son of God could do it. And he has done it by the Price of his own Blood. Heb 10 19 <hi>We have boldness to enter in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.19 <hi>The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.</hi> What is that but Christ? That Sacrifice Christ as our Priest has offered, is a <hi>better hope.</hi> That is it believers may build upon: they may safely venture their Souls on the merit of Christs most precious Blood; that has purchased for them all the blessedness they hope for. Moreover, the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ is a ground of Hope to believers. For what can hinder men from being Blessed but only Sin? Now from the Resurrection of Christ, a believer may conclude his Sins are Pardoned: that God has been satisfied in the Death of Christ, otherwise He would never have been raised from the Grave. Therefore does the Apostle say, Rom. 4.25 <hi>He arose again for our Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> For Christ was brought to the Prison of the Grave as our Surety. Well, but in as much as God let Him out, and by an Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Arm broke the gates of the Grave, and let

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Believers hope is built upon their Vnion with Christ.</hi> Col 1.27 <hi>Christ in you the Hope of Glory.</hi> Therefore believers have a sure hope of Glory, because Christ is in them. Christ dwells in them by his Holy Spirit. He has taken an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal possession of them. Were it not for this, notwithstanding all that Christ has done, men could not hope for Blessedness: But now the believer may say, in as much as Christ is in me and I in Him, therefore shall I live forever, Joh 14.19, 20 <hi>Because I live therefore you shall live also, you in me and I in you.</hi> I am United to you sayes Christ, therefore as sure as I live, you may conclude you shall live also. So long as a mans Head is above water, he cannot be Drowned.

               <p n="2">2. Another Reason why Believers should look for this Glorious Appearing of Christ is, because of the Exceeding Greatness of that Blessedness which they thus hope for. Eph. 1.18 <hi>That being enlightned, you may kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are Adopted, God has Adopted them, so do they become heirs. Therefore the inheritance is theirs, and there is Riches in it. Men give Portions to their Children according to their Riches.

Therefore should they Look for it, Wait for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is worth Waiting, Looking, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for. All the pains that can be taken, when it comes, it will infinitely make amends for. There is nothing more desirable than Life. This Blessedness is called Life, Rev. 2 10 <hi>I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> A Kingdom is the greatest Happiness men on Earth are capable of enjoying.

               <p>Several things may be mentioned as <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations</hi> of this great Truth.</p>

For which cause they cast Stones at him. For which of my good Works said Christ, do you Stone me; Not for any good Works, (say they) Joh. 10.33 but for Blasphemy because thou being Man makest thy self God. But their Fore-Fathers, the holy Patriarks of Old, did believe and did take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the Faith of it, that God would Assume the Nature of man. Thus <hi>David</hi> believed, Psal. 110.1 <hi>The Lord said to my Lord.</hi> The <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be <hi>Davids</hi> Son, yet he calls him his Lord. So then, he did believe that his Lord would become a Man, that the great God would appear in Humane Nature, and that He should be of his Family too. And long before <hi>David, Iob</hi> had the same Spirit of Faith,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000998_0050_0FAEE8523441BF20"/>
he believed that God would appear in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man. Sayes Job 19.26 <hi>In my Flesh I shall see God.</hi> He did then believe that God would become a Man; for the Divine Nature cannot be seen with bodily Eyes. <hi>God</hi> is the Invisible God. <hi>Iob</hi> knew that with his bodily Eyes he should at the latter day see <hi>God,</hi> and therefore that <hi>God</hi> would assume the Nature of Man, in which he would become Visible to men. That Christ has the Nature of <hi>God</hi> in Him, is Evident;</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the Essential Names and Titles of the <hi>True God</hi> are given to Him in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

is an Explication or Interpretation of the Name <hi>Iehovah.</hi> Again, there is that title of <hi>I AM,</hi> which is peculiar to the true God. When Christ appeared to <hi>Moses,</hi> He assumed that Name, Exod. 3.14 <hi>I AM TH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord of Hosts is the King of Glory.</hi> The words are spoken concerning Christ These are Titles fit for none but the great God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is evident that Jesus Christ is in respect of Nature God, in that He is <hi>Gods own Son.</hi> Rom. 8.32 <hi>God spared not His own Son.</hi> Christ is not (as Believers are) the <hi>Adopted Son</hi> of God, but His <hi>Own Son</hi> in respect of Nature, in respect of Eternal Generation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is styled in Scripture, The Begotten Son of God: Joh. 1.19 <hi>We beheld His Glory, the Glory as of the only Begotten of the Father.</hi> Now a Father and an own Son, are of the same Nature. So is Christ of the same Nature with the great God. And in that respect He is as great as God the Father: Joh· 5.18 <hi>He said that God is His Father, making himself equal with God.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:000998_0052_0FAEE8541422F010"/>
Christ in respect of his Humane Nature, is not Equal with God, but infinitely Inferiour to Him; and in respect of his Office as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <hi>Mediator,</hi> though on that account, He is Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to all Men and Angels yet Inferiour to God. Therefore did Christ say, Joh. 14 28 <hi>My Father is greater than I.</hi> Considered as <hi>Mediator,</hi> the Father is greater than He. But then in respect of his Person, as he is the Son of God, so the Father and He are Equal: <hi>My Father and I am one. Ioh.</hi> 10.30 That is the Second Demonstration of the Truth before us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The incommunicable properties of the Great God are to be affirmed of Iesus Christ.</hi> There are Properties and Attributes of God which are <hi>Communicable,</hi> such are Wisdom, Holiness, Goodness and the like. But they are not in Creatures in that proportion as they are in God. All the wisdom and goodness that is in all the Angels in Heaven, is like but as a drop of water to that which is in the Ocean, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that which is in God. But then, there are also <hi>Incommunicable Properties</hi> of the Divine Nature, which cannot be affirmed of any but the Great God.</p>
               <p>As now, <hi>Eternity</hi> is an Incommunicable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the great God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.27 <hi>The Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God shall be thy Refuge.</hi> He alone is the Eternal God. That is Eternal, which has
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000998_0053_0FAEE854EBC04D58"/>
neither beginning nor ending. There are some Creatures which shall never Dy; Angels and the Souls of men are Immortal. But there is no Creature which has not had a beginning. But God is from Everlasting: Psal. 90.2 <hi>From Everlasting to Everlasting, thou art God.</hi> This must be said, and it is necessary unto Salvation that we should believe this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ. We may not think that He was not, until he was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> He was God in Heaven before he was Man on Earth. Therefore, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.62 <hi>What do you say,</hi> (sayes Christ) <hi>if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?</hi> Christ was before in that Heaven whether he did ascend, even before ever he was seen among men in this world. <hi>Abraham</hi> lived about two thousand Years before Christ was born, and yet Christ was before <hi>Abraham:</hi> Joh. 8.53 <hi>Before</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>was, I am,</hi> sayes Christ. He was then before he came into the world: when the world began Christ was. Time began with the world: but in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1 it is said, <hi>In the Beginning was the Word,</hi> that is Christ, and <hi>the Word was with God.</hi> When the world began Christ was with God, yea before the world began: Joh. 17 5 <hi>The Glory which I had with thee before the world began.</hi> And therefore from all Eternity: Mic. 5.2 <hi>Whose goings forth hath been of Old, from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:000998_0054_0FAEE8558CC349C8"/>
Christ is from Everlasting, therefore He is the great God.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Omnipotency</hi> is another Incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Attribute of the Great God. There are Creatures which are said to be Mighty. Angels are styled <hi>Mighty Ones: Ioel</hi> 3.11 But there is no Creature which is Almighty: But Christ is so. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8 Christ there sayes, <hi>I am the Alpha and Omega.</hi> He is styled, <hi>the Lord God Omnipotent.</hi> When the day shall come (and it will come, and God grant it may come quickly) when Christ shall Reign Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously before the whole World, then will it be said, as in Rev. 19 6 <hi>The Lord God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Reigns.</hi> Christ is the Lord God Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and therefore He is the great God.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Omnipresence</hi> is an Incommunicable Attribute of the Great God. <hi>Ier·</hi> 23.24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth saith the Lord.</hi> That is peculiar to God to fill Heaven and Earth, to be in all places at the same time. And ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this is to be affirmed concerning Christ: Joh. 3.9 <hi>None hath ascended into Heaven, but the Son of Man who is in Heaven.</hi> To be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and on Earth too at the same time, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the great God: Yet it is true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ Therefore Christ said, in Mat. 18.20 <hi>Where there are two or three gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my Name, there am I in the midst of

them.</hi> Where ever there are Christians Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in the Name of Christ, there is He in the midst of them; yet they may be far distant one from another, it may be Ten Thousand Miles, as far as the East is from the West.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Omniscience</hi> is an Incommunicable Property of the great God There are some men that know a great deal, that have very enlarged Understandings, and Angels know much more than they; but none of them knows all things: none of them has an <hi>Infinite Vnde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>; that is proper to the great God, Psal 147.5 <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat is the Lord, his Vnderstanding is infinite.</hi> But this must be affirmed of Christ, that he knows all things, as <hi>Peter</hi> confessed to him, Joh. 21.17 <hi>Lord</hi> (sayes he) <hi>thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est all things.</hi> To see what ever is in the hearts of men, is peculiar to the great God: 1 King. 8.39 <hi>Thou only knowest all the Hearts of the Children of men.</hi> And yet this is to be said concerning Christ: He knows how the hearts of men stand inclined and affected; He knows what ever is there. There is not a thought in the heart, but it is known unto Him. The Son of God has Eyes like to a flame of Fire. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23 <hi>He Searches the Reins and Heart</hi>: therefore he is the great God. That is the Third Demonstration.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:000998_0056_0FAEE85709FFE020"/>4. <hi>Iesus Christ has done, does do, and will do such things, as none but the great God can do.</hi> He has done that which none but the great God can do. None but God can Create: Isa. 40.28 <hi>The Eternal God, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth.</hi> None but the great God is the Creator: But Christ is the <hi>Creator.</hi> There is is not any <hi>Creature</hi> in the world, but came out of his hands, it was made by him: Joh. 1.3 <hi>The world was made by him, and there was noth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng made without him.</hi> All Creatures are either visible or invisible, belonging either to the upper or lower world, all of both those were made by Christ: Col. 1.16 <hi>He has Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all things that are in Heaven or on Earth, Visible and Invisible, by him and for him they were Created·</hi> So to be the Author of that which is a true and proper Miracle, is peculiar to God: Psal 136.4 <hi>He only does great Wonders.</hi> That God only who is the God of Nature, can change the course of Nature, and act above the Constituted order of Nature, when ever he shall please. But Christ has done glorious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and that by His own Power. The <hi>Iews</hi> had a marvellous expectation that when the <hi>Messiah</hi> came, he would do wonderful things; that he would be the Author of many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. They had reason to expect it from the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> And when
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000998_0057_0FAEE85B2A0CC928"/>
Christ came, some said, <hi>When the Messiah comes, shall he do more Miracles than this man does?</hi> He did such Miraculous things, the like was never done in the world before. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.32 The man that had been Born blind, and was by Christ made to see, sayes, <hi>Since the world began it was never heard, that a man should open the Eyes of one born Blind.</hi> 'Tis true, the Apostles did Wonderful things, Miraculous things; but it was not they, but Christ by them that did <hi>them.</hi> Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> said to some, Acts 3.12 <hi>Why do you look on us, as though we had by our own Power done this.</hi> No, it was by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Power of Christ, that we did it sayes the <hi>Apostle</hi>· But when Christ did Miraculous things, they were done by him through his own Power. Therefore he said to the <hi>Leper,</hi> Mat. 8.3 <hi>I will be thou Clean. I will,</hi> none but the great God might speak such a word, or say <hi>I will</hi> that it shall be so. It shews, that Christ had an all Powerful Will; that he can do what ever he will do. And therefore He is the great God.</p>
               <p>And there are such things done by Christ at this day, as do Declare him to be the great God. None but the great God can preserve and uphold the world in being. All <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> would return to <hi>their first nothing,</hi> if the infinite Arm of God did not uphold them: Neh. 9.6 <hi>Thou even thou art Lord abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hast made Heaven and Earth, and all things that are therein, and thou preservest them all.</hi> It is Gods work to preserve the Creatures that are in the world. Now this is true concerning the Lord Jesus Christ: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3 <hi>He upholdeth all things.</hi> The Son of God upholds all things by the Word of his Power; then he is the great God. Therefore Christ sayes, Joh. 17.5 <hi>I work hitherto.</hi> Namely in upholding the world, in preserving the world, in governing the world and all Creatures therein. <hi>Preservation</hi> is a continued <hi>Creation</hi>; and so does Christ work hitherto.</p>
               <p>And <hi>He will</hi> do such things as Declare him to be the great God. For he will raise the Dead from their graves, and none but the great God can do that: Acts 26.8 <hi>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should Raise the Dead?</hi> Were there not a God of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power, it were impossible as to those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that have been devour'd by Fishes in the Sea, and by wild Beasts upon the Land, which has been the <hi>Fate</hi> of many a true Believer. It was a common thing in the dayes of the <hi>Roman Pagan Emperors,</hi> to throw Christians to the wild Beasts to Devour them. Now that those Bodies that have been Devoured by <hi>Beasts</hi> should be restored to Life, how incredible may it seem to carnal Reason?

many times, and throw the Ashes into the Rivers on purpose to confute their fancy, that their bodies would arise again. Who but an infinite God, can make those very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to come together and live again? But Christ can do it, and will do this very thing.

more than this; For men are beneath Angels. Christ in respect of his becoming a man, is <hi>made a little lower than the Angels</hi>· But then, Oh! how great was his condescention, in that He was willing to be not only a man, but a Poor mean man, in the Opinion of the world; 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.9 <hi>You know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that tho' He was Rich, yet for our sakes He became Poor.</hi> He was Rich, all the Riches in the world belong to God. <hi>Christ</hi> the great God, though he were Rich, yet became Poor for our sakes. <hi>A Poor Man,</hi> one that had not where to lay his Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One that was Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, Scoffed at, Spit upon, Buffeted, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. That HE who is the great God should condescend to this, what a wonderful thing is it? That He should condescend not only to be a man, but to be <hi>Enosh,</hi> a Sorrowful Man. We read in the Gospel, of his Weeping; we never read of Christs Laughing, but of his Weeping more than once. He Wept over the grave of <hi>Lazarus</hi>; He Wept over <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And we read of his Sighing; He fetch'd deep Sighs and Groans, several times.

                     <hi>We see the Reason of several Glorious things which are to be Affirmed concerning the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> As now, we see here the reason why Christ did not faint, and sink under that Burden of his Office, as <hi>Mediator</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause He is the great God. Had any meer Creature had that burden on him, were it an Angel, he could not have subsisted under it. He is able to perform His Office of a <hi>Mediator</hi> in all respects· Christ is able to discharge his Prophetical Office, to Instruct all the Elect of God, in all Ages. There are Hundreds of Thousands, yea, Millions of Souls, that he has instructed as a Prophet: This is because he is the great God; otherwise if he had been no more then a man, then a creature, he could not have done it. Whence is it he did not sink under the weight of his Sufferings? Christ suffered such things, as no man in the world ever did the like. It is said, <hi>His visage was marred more than any of the Sons of men.</hi> Yet he did bear up under those sufferings. He suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, not only in his Body, but also in Soul, when he <hi>made His Soul an Offerring for Sin.</hi> How should he have been able to bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wrath of the Father, that lay upon him when he was Surety for the Elect of God,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000998_0065_0FAEE860D8976900"/>
but that he is God? And so his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did support his Humane Nature, and made him capable of enduring such things, as never man did or could do. Likewise, we see the reason why the Sufferings of Christ were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Meritorious, <hi>viz.</hi> because he was God. That the Elect of God might be redeemed from Death, it was necessary that a Life should be given for them, yea, and a Life that was more worthy, then the Life of all Men and Angels was given for them; that is the Life of him who is God: 1 Joh. 3.16 <hi>God laid down his Life.</hi> That cannot but be a Life that is infinitely precious Some mens lives one of them is more precious then a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of other men. Well, but the Life of Christ is of more value, then the lives of all the men in the world, because he is the great God. Therefore his Blood has infinite Merit in it. Acts 20 28 <hi>God has purchased his Church with his own Blood.</hi> God, that is Christ, who is the great God. That Blood which is the Blood of Him who is the great God, must needs be of infinite worth and value: Nothing else could Redeem one Soul; nothing but the Blood of him who is the great God; and that is of value sufficient to <hi>Redeem</hi> Thousands, yea Millions of Souls. Nothing else could make Atonement for Sin, no not for the least sin that ever was committed; but the Bloud of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000998_0066_0FAEE86351C87D80"/>
Christ, because he is the great God is enough to make Atonement for the greatest sins that ever men were guity of. Suppose they have been guilty of never so many sins, there is Merit enough in Christs Blood to obtain the Remission of them all, because he is the great God. This also is the Reason, why <hi>the Man Christ Iesus</hi> is exalted above all Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: It is because that Man is one person with the Son of God, therefore is he set above all Angels, and Arch-Angels· Angels in heaven are all made subject to him. He did no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ascend into Heaven, but God made him to sit down on his Throne: Rev. 3·21 <hi>I am sat down with my Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In respect of Christ there are wonderful things to be said. Our Nature is exalted and dignified above the Nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. There is not an Angel in Heaven, of whom it can be said, that Angel is the great God. But there is a Man in heaven, a Man now at the Right-hand of God, of whom it may be said and must be said, <hi>that Man is the great God.</hi> This is marvellous indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The great Commandment of the Gospel is, that men should go to Christ, give themselves unto him; look up to him, and depend on him for Pardon, Life, Grace, yea for all that their souls stand in need of.

He is so in a General sense, &amp; in respect of the profession we make of his Name; we all of us say Christ is our Saviour. But alas! Many a man that sayes so, will in the last Day, when the Great God, and our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> shall appear, find himself utterly disappointed, and deceived, in his hopes of salvation. Christ has said, Not every one that sayes to me <hi>Lord, Lord</hi>; that is, that call themselves after my Name, <hi>shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Many that call themselves Christians, and say, I hope to be saved by Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will in that Day say unto them; <hi>I never knew you.</hi>

It concerns us then to Examine whether we have an Interest in Christ as a Saviour? This is a Duty in special incumbent on believers, when they approach unto the Table of the Lord: 1 Cor. 11.28 <hi>Let a man Examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so let him Eat of that Bread and Drink of that Cup.</hi> The Church of Christ ought to Admit none into their Communion, but such as can Examine themselves, and such as we may rationally hope do and will Examine themselves; Namely, whether they have a real <hi>Interest in Christ,</hi> yea, or no. Therefore we should Examine, <hi>what our Faith is,</hi> whether we have true Faith? 2 Cor. 13.5 <hi>Examine your selves, try your selves.</hi> This is a duty of great moment, <hi>Examine, Try</hi> whether you be in the Faith? <hi>Know you not that Christ is in you, except you be Reprobate?</hi> Would you know whether Christ be in you, whether you have a true and real Interest in Christ, <hi>Have you true Faith?</hi> You may know by that. Have you given your self to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> not your <hi>Names</hi> only, but your <hi>Hearts</hi> to Christ? Have you made with him an Everlasting Covenant, a Perpetual Covenant, never to be forgotten? Have you given your self to the Lord accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace: Have you Accepted of Christ on his own Terms as he is offered in the Gospel? And has Christ saved you from the Dominion of sin? Then

be it known unto you, that he has saved you, from the <hi>Damnation</hi> of sin. Is sin Mortified in you? 'Tis said, Rom. 6.5 <hi>The Old man is Crucified, and the Body of sin is Destroyed.</hi> If sin be Crucified in thee, it is certain that Christ has been Crucified for thee. They that are Christs, have crucified the Flesh with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and lusts, that they never had done if Christ had not been crucified for them. Again, have we the Spirit of the Lord Jesus? Rom. 8.9. <hi>If any man have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, do we obey <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> Heb. 5.9 <hi>He is the Author of Salvation to all that Obey him.</hi> Have we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>CHRIST</hi> the Lord? No man did ever receive Christ aright as a Saviour, but did at the same time receive him as Lord. He is a Prince and a Saviour. Well then, if he be our Saviour, he is our Prince also.

                        <hi>How are Believers indebted to the Lord Iesus Christ, in that he is their Saviour.</hi> And what is it he has saved them from?

A Question is <hi>Propounded,</hi> but is not <hi>Answered,</hi> nor can be; How great? <hi>It is laid up</hi>; where? In heaven. How great is that Salvation, that Blessedness? None can ever say how great it is. It has not entred into the Heart of man to conceive, how great that Glory is, which Jesus Christ by being our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, has obtain'd for us.

Therefore what do we owe to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ? And how are we indebted to Him? It cost Christ dear to obtain this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us: He has obtain'd it in no easie way.

Would you know how these <hi>Churches</hi> may come to be saved? Let the Churches become such as once they were, and I dare boldly declare it, Christ will save them.

The Scripture is full of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and those Promises shall all of them be performed to the utmost, in the Day of Christs Appearing. For what is it that the Lord hath Promised to Believers?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He has Promised that they shall have a Glorious Resurrection unto Eternal Life.</hi> That their Dead bodies shall Rise again.

Mat. 22.31 <hi>As touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Dead, have you not heard that God said,</hi> (He said it to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Bush) <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob; <hi>he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</hi> And therefore because of the Covenant, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> must Rise out of their Graves. Believers have given themselves to God, Body and Soul; they have not only given their Souls but their Bodies also to Christ. So then, God is in Covenant with them in respect of their bodies, as well as of their souls. As for the Soul, that is immortal, and by vertue of the Covenant their Bodies that are Dead, shall be Raised to Life again. And this is a great part of that Blessedness which believers hope for.

Their bodies shall then be freed from all such Evils as at present they are subject unto. They shall never endure any Pain more, they shall never be subject to any Disease in the least any more. Aye, and they shall not be subject to Mortality any more. Luk. 20 26 <hi>The Children of the Resurrection are equal to the Angels of God, neither can they Dye any more.</hi> Their bodies are then so Immortalized as that they cannot Dy any more. And this Blessedness they shall have at the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> sayes, Job 19.25 <hi>I know that my Redeemer shall stand on the Earth at the latter Day.</hi> And sayes he, <hi>although worms shall after my skin destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh I shall see God, at the latter day.</hi> Now that Latter Day is the same with the Day of the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.
