            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE CANDID READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS at the earneſt deſire of the church people in <hi>Great-Barrington,</hi> and not from any inclination of appearing in print, I ſend the following plain and inelegant diſcourſe abroad; and as there are ſome expreſſions in it, may appear harſh, and the facts they relate to, improbable in a land of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and where the oppreſſors can juſtly claim but toleration, I think it expedient to advertiſe the reader of thoſe facts, and then leave him to judge of the expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Some of the firſt ſettlers of the town of <hi>Great-Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> were <hi>Dutch</hi> people, who profeſſed themſelves <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and engaged and paid a <hi>Lutheran</hi> miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for coming among them four times every year. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came among them, they joined in ſettling two diſſenting miniſters, and contributed largely to build the meeting-houſes in <hi>Great-Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> and <hi>Sheffield;</hi> but could receive no benefit from either, as they did not believe the principles of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> conſtantly taught in both, and could not
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:009948_0003_0F7B3AA78581D9E0"/>
have their children baptized unleſs they would openly profeſs it.—Being deſirous, their children ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſacred ordinance of baptiſm, they were obliged to go thirty or forty miles to a <hi>Lutheran</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, for that purpoſe. Seeing they received no advantage from the diſſenting miniſter, and hired one of their own, they applied to the town to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their circumſtances, and to allow them a part of the taxes they paid Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> to help pay their own miniſter for viſiting them; but this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſire was rejected with diſdain, and invectives: However they made no diſturbance, but attended Mr. <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s meeting, until he compelled them to leave it, by preaching the miſterious notions of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and irreſpective decrees, and the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good and happineſs to the moral ſyſtem, by the introduction and abounding of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon this they became uneaſy, and told him they could not, in conſcience, come to hear, and have their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren learn ſuch doctrines for the goſpel. Some of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> laboured under the ſame uneaſineſs, and could not admit the doctrines he conſtantly taught, to be true, and according to the revealed will of GOD: Nevertheleſs if he believed them, he might preach them, but he ought not to compel others to hear and learn them; which however was in ſome meaſure the fact; for when ſome who were diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, abſented for a few days from his meeting, he inſtigated, from his deſk, his people to proſecute them with the utmoſt rigour of the law: The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was, ſeveral aged and ſober men were put into the ſtocks, and two into the public goal;—their crimes were very atrocious, they could not, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, come to hear preached what they could not believe;—but they were <hi>Lutherans.</hi>—One <hi>Engliſhman,</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:009948_0004_0F7B3AA8591CD158"/>
Mr. <hi>Hamlin,</hi> was more criminal, yet, he was old, ſick and lame, ſo that he could not go abroad; but then he was a churchman. Call you this liberty of conſcience?—'Tis the ſame that was granted to churchmen, when <hi>preſbyterianiſm,</hi> in days of that arch-hypocrite <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> had rule. 'Tis liberty upon the ſame footing that the <hi>papiſt</hi> court of inquiſition grants to <hi>proteſtants,</hi> of puniſhing the body for the good of the ſoul; the ſame as our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, thoſe famous patrons of religious liberty, allowed the <hi>Quakers,</hi> of fines, ſtripes, impriſonments, and death; and yet this is boaſted of as a merrito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deed, whilſt they proclaim their indulgence, and lenity to all, by words. But to proceed; in proceſs of time, the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>

                  <p>Called <hi>Lutherans,</hi> becauſe they embrace the principles of Dr. <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> divine, who about the year 1517, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> church; upon which many of the nobility, clergy and common people joined with him, effected the reformation of ſeveral whole electorates and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.—His opinions are now held by moſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> churches, a few only excepted, of the <hi>Calviniſts.</hi>

               </note> together with ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, became acquainted with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and worſhip of the church, and in <hi>September</hi> 1762, they invited me to viſit them; I did, and preached there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> declared their conformity to the church, put themſelves under my paſtoral care, and I have viſited them as often as was conſiſtent with my other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and have prevailed with ſundry other miſſionaries to do the ſame; and when no miniſter was there, they conſtantly aſſembled upon the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and performed divine ſervice, according to our book of common prayer, and read good printed ſermons. From this time, that they were regularly embodied in the public and avowed profeſſion of the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:009948_0005_0F7B3AA970CB8BF0"/>
church of <hi>England,</hi> 'twas reaſonably preſumed, they would no longer be compelled to attend at the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meeting, to hear what they did not believe; nor be obliged to pay taxes to ſupport the diſſenting teachers, the which they had hitherto done;—but what ſignifies <hi>reaſon, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> when in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with <hi>paſſion, will,</hi> and <hi>intereſt!</hi> The truth was loud; and clamorous threatenings were thundered out, that if they would not come to meeting, they ſhould ſuffer fines and impriſonment; but when <hi>that</hi> had no effect, upon better advice, the execution was ſuſpended, and changed into railing, calumniating, and anathemas, and a more rigorous collecting of their rates to pay Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> whom they did not hear; to ſupport the propagation of what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved erroneous. The church people began, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rates for another year were due, as I think, they raiſed a large and elegant church, and hired a young candidate for the miniſtry, as a reader, and ſteadily attended the worſhip of the church. Seeing they had expended ſo much money, for the church, and in every reſpect were known profeſſors thereof, 'twas preſumed they would now forego obliging them to pay to Mr. <hi>Hopkins;</hi> but like thoſe which the wiſe man tells us are never ſatisfied, they more ſtrenuouſly inſiſted upon the rates, and becauſe the money could not be raiſed exactly when called for, ſome had their goods diſtreſſed and ſold, at under rates; and ten of the more aged and ſober men, were ſent to the public goal, until the rates were paid. Time would fail me to relate the particular aggrevations which attended theſe oppreſſions; theſe are eaſily conceived, when the characters of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors are known. Notwithſtanding all theſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the violent oppoſition made, the church

people have unanimouſly proceeded, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended large ſums of money,<note n="*" place="bottom">In a piece wrote at <hi>Great-Barrington,</hi> and publiſhed in the <hi>Boſton Gazette, September</hi> 17, 1764, it is aſſerted, that <q>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are at the chief expence in this undertaking (that is in building the church) declared for the church of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>eſcape rates,</hi> and <hi>ſave</hi> money.</q> 'Tis evident the author ran foul of truth with his eyes open, it being ſaid by the diſſenters that the churchmen will ruin their eſtates in building their church. 'Tis certain they have expended tenfold larger ſums<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than if they had continued nonconformiſts, and this voluntary. As to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping rates, if Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> was the author of that piece, he muſt know, by a notable inſtance of craft, that he was miſtaken, which inſtance was, that when the taxes were gathering of the church people, for Mr. <hi>H—s,</hi> he went privately to ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> families, and offered to free them from paying him rates, if they would break off and not join with the church of <hi>England,</hi> the which propoſal they rejected, and have been forward, upon all occaſions, to pay towards the church. What credit, are honeſt people then to give to ſuch nameleſs ſtuff, and yet I know ſome, whether honeſt, or not, who love to hear and propagate ſuch malicious tales!</note> in ſo far compleating their church, that they can conveniently attend the public worſhip there. Now whoever will candidly and impartially conſider theſe facts, and as being done in land of profeſſed freedom, and by a people who can juſtly claim for themſelves but toleration, will not think any expreſſions in the enſuing diſcourſe, ſarcaſtical or ſevere.</p>

            <p>IF it is a maxim of unchangeable truth, that dependant creatures ought to pray, and offer their praiſes to the eternal, perfect, and gracious parent of the univerſe, who created, preſerves, and continually can bleſs them; it is as certain, there ought and muſt be <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> proper for that purpoſe. Such obvious truths, laying level with the loweſt rational capacity, are and need not be directly commanded or revealed; for when the truths, from which they flow, are made clear and evident, the weakeſt rational can form the concluſion: 'Tis true divine wiſdom hath given us ſufficient information, in the new teſtament, that ſome portion of time ſhould be obſerved, and devoted for the purpoſe of religion; and alſo, that ſome places ſhould be ſet apart for the ſame; although neither are particularly and expreſsly commanded, and why need it?—Seeing the hints and information

Seeing prayer is put for, and is the moſt eminent part of the worſhip of GOD in his houſe, it therefore includes all the leſſer or ſubordinate, parts of the ſervice to be performed there; ſo that our duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this houſe of GOD, is comprehended in and expreſſed by this general term of prayer;<note n="*" place="bottom">Let it be obſerved then, that preaching being ſubordinate to praying, people in moſt congregations are very blameable in neglecting that part of the worſhip of GOD, which is of the greateſt importance, by either coming very late, or elſe only hearing the miniſter pray.</note> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches whereof are accurately deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Epiſtle ii. 1.—<q>I exhort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that firſt of all, <hi>ſupplications, prayers, interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and <hi>giving</hi> of <hi>thanks,</hi> be made for all men;</q> which imports both the privilege of ſuch unworthy and inferior beings as we are, to addreſs that dread <hi>being,</hi> the majeſty of heaven and earth, and our obligation to perform the ſame, together with the method how;—for to <hi>ſupplicate,</hi> imports our privilege and duty of petitioning GOD, through the merits of CHRIST, to pardon our ſins, to turn away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our evils, temporal and ſpiritual, for and from ourſelves and others.</p>

incumbent, and of which the royal pſalmiſt had ſo high and adequate conception, that principally, and above all others, this was his deſire, and actual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit: <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxvii. 4.—<q>One thing have I deſired of the LORD, that will I ſeek after; that I may dwell in the <hi>houſe</hi> of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to <hi>enquire</hi> in his <hi>temple.</hi>
               </q> And indeed this is ſo eminent a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, ſo much conducive to the honor of GOD, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and cheriſh in our minds worthy apprehenſions of him, and juſt thoughts of ourſelves, tending ſo much to our preſent comfort, and future happineſs, and by GOD'S appointment, the requiſite condition to obtain his bleſſing upon our endeavours, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins, and that eternal life which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by CHRIST, that we ought to eſteem it, as <hi>David</hi> did, the earneſt deſire of our ſouls, and make it our conſtant employ, and improve every favorable opportunity of publicly worſhipping that glorious and gracious GOD, who alone can here bleſs and reward us.—That this diſtinguiſhable part of the ſervice of GOD might be performed in a proper and acceptable manner, we have a moſt excellent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, pious and comprehenſive liturgy, compiled by good and wiſe men, which approves itſelf worthy to be uſed by all ſorts and conditions of men; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to raiſe, and increaſe, a ſpirit of true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to fix the ſoul upon its holy employment; to engage the attention, and animate the whole man; by which the true penitent may confeſs his ſins, bewail his infirmities, and importune for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; the indigent may ſue for grace, protection, and relief; the grateful ſhout forth his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments; in a word, whatever concerns a ſinner, or ſaint, in the great work of public prayer, here is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009948_0011_0F7B3AAF04984500"/>
preſcribed, both as to <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>method,</hi>—that which is <hi>right, proper, pious</hi> and <hi>engaging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The matter is collected from the holy ſcriptures, or in every inſtance agreeable thereunto; no vain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; no frivolous controverſies, which ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or enthuſiaſtic heads have been and daily are forming, to the decay and diſcredit of true religion and devotion; no new-fangled notions, or bold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, trifling and indecent expreſſions; which ſerve, <hi>where</hi> uſed, to perplex and bewilder the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to tickle and pleaſe the fancy, or to turn the ſoul from the important and ſolemn work it ſhould be about.

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009948_0012_0F7B3AAFC3DF8420"/>
find and uſe the matter; which is <hi>plain, proper,</hi> and <hi>engaging,</hi> and which, I doubt not, will appear ſo to every one, who will impartially read, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, the book of common prayer.</p>
            <p>As to manner or method, it begins with ſome ſelected texts of ſcripture read by the miniſter, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a ſolemn exhortation to all preſent; which puts them in mind of what thoſe texts declare, and alſo of all the ſucceeding parts of duty which they meet to perform; calling upon them, with one heart and voice, to the firſt part of prayer, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enſues; by which means all have <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> to compoſe their minds, and to conſider <hi>where</hi> and <hi>what</hi> we are, and the buſineſs we are going about, which is to kneel down, and unitedly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſins, and to pray for the pardon of them. The miniſter then, as the ambaſſador of GOD, through CHRIST, declares the bleſſings of the goſpel, of pardon and remiſſion, to all true believers and penitents: To which is added the LORD'S prayer, by all preſent, with petitions, that GOD would open our lips, and prepare our hearts to declare his praiſe; the which we do ſtanding,<note n="*" place="bottom">This was a geſture ever uſed of old by good men, in reading hymns of praiſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> xviii. 4.—2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxiii. 30. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ix. 5.</note> by repeating a large portion of the pſalms, whereby as they help to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our gratitude, ſo they engage our attention, and inſtruct our minds into the knowledge of GOD'S will; after which a chapter out of the old teſtament is read by the miniſter ſtanding, and the people ſitting, to which is added, a hymn to praiſe GOD for teaching us his will: We then hear another chapter out of the new, which ſets forth unto us ſomething relative to the great work of our redemption by JESUS CHRIST;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009948_0013_0F7B3AB188DF02E8"/>
after that immediately enſues a pſalm of thankfulneſs; to evidence the truth of theſe things we have heard, we are then to repeat, with one <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>voice,</hi> the ſummary of the chriſtian religion called the apoſtles <hi>creed;</hi> we are then directed to pray to, and interceed with our all-gracious GOD and heavenly father, for his <hi>grace,</hi> for <hi>peace,</hi> for <hi>protection,</hi> for ourſelves, for our king, and his family, for our church, and its rulers, for all ſorts and conditions of men, and as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires, for all other things needful for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others; and laſtly, to return our unfeigned thanks for our creation, preſervation, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and for all GOD'S favors to us and all men. One thing is obſervable through the whole; every prayer, and almoſt every general petition, begins with ſome one of the divine attributes, and concludes, through the merits of CHRIST.

The great deſign of erecting this houſe, is to meet and join in the uſe of public prayer; but as the knowledge of religion is requiſite, in order for mens becoming religious, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews we come not to this knowledge without teaching, (<hi>Rom.</hi> x. 14) and as all men have not time nor capacity to inſtruct themſelves, therefore, a further deſign, is, that the true principles and duties of our holy religion might be here taught and learned, the ſum of which religion is contained in theſe two terms, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi>—Under the head of faith will be taught, the <hi>exiſtence</hi> and <hi>attributes</hi> of one eternal, good, wiſe, great and ſelf-exiſting GOD, who created, preſerveth, and governs the univerſe, and all creatures; that he is to be adored, loved, and obeyed; that when man had ſinned, and had expoſed himſelf to juſtice and puniſhment, incapable of relieving himſelf, that GOD ſo loved the world, that he ſent his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; (<hi>John</hi> iii. 16)—that he aſſumed human nature, taught, both by precept and example, mankind, all holy living; died a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſins of the world, and thereby to make peace for us: <q>And, having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf, by him I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven;</q> (<hi>Col.</hi> i. 20) and ſealed and ratified a covenant of grace, whereby ſinners may obtain <hi>pardon, grace,</hi> and everlaſting ſalvation. Theſe particulars will be taught as matters of faith; as neceſſary for every one firmly to believe, together with many other conſequential principles: Abſtruſe and needleſs ſpeculations, that tend only to confuſe the ignorant, diſtract the weak, and advantage none, will be omitted and diſcarded,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009948_0015_0F7B3AB2C1E8E058"/>
as being contrary to the genius of chriſtianity, and the deſign and buſineſs of its miniſters. Under the head of repentance, will, we reaſonably expect, be taught, what the grace of GOD, which hath appeared bringing ſalvation, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the offers and terms of ſalvation to all men, teacheth, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; (<hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 12) <hi>i. e.</hi> to quit and turn from all vice and immorality; all profaneneſs and debauchery; all injuſtice, malice, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and idolatry; to pray to GOD, for his pardon, and for his grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to do ſo no more; but heartily and faithfully to do what he has required; to love, fear, and ſerve GOD, with all our ſouls, and power; to cordially embrace, and ſtedfaſtly believe his revealed <hi>will;</hi> to govern our paſſions, and live in the regular exerciſe of our reaſon; to love, and do good to our fellow-men every where: Under each of theſe particulars are comprehended many other duties, which the preacher will not fail of inculcating, in plain, ſober, and engaging words and manners. In a word, we are to expect the plain principles of the goſpel, and not the whims and notions of men; the religion and duties which CHRIST our Saviour taught, which is to promote true holineſs, and genuine god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and honeſty, and not miſterious and uſeleſs ſpeculations, impracticable and impoſſible duties; which make men either proud or deſperate, where and when preached and believed.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly repreſented both the worſhip and principles of the church, I ſhall now as briefly mention the advantages that you may reaſonably expect, in conſequence of building this houſe, and having theſe particulars performed therein. All reaſonable actions are done to gain ſome deſign and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009948_0016_0F7B3AB4E94BF1F8"/>
end; and it may juſtly be ſuppoſed, that you expected the advantages ariſing, would be ſufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence you for the coſt and trouble you have and will be at; that you would not contentedly ſuffer ſo many inconveniencies, <hi>perſecutions,</hi> and more than <hi>hoſtile barbarities,</hi> and take ſo much pains, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſo much of your intereſt, if you had not the proſpect of reaping ſome advantage. The motive is good; this has ever been preſented by the wiſe and good parent of nature, to excite and animate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be religious. The firſt advantage you may expect is the worſhipping GOD almighty, agreeable to your faith, and according to his revealed will.<note n="*" place="bottom">Note, Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his ſcholars, make a wide difference in GOD'S revealed and ſecret will: by the one, all have the offers of life and ſalvation; by the other, only a few, and the reſt are reprobated by the ſame will. Vid. <hi>Cal.</hi> inſt. lib. 3. c. 24. <hi>Gill, Cole,</hi> and others.</note> This is moſt certainly a very great benefit, unto all ſuch as are, by the grace of GOD, willing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to join heartily therein. You come here not only to hear another pray, but to attend and join, both with heart and voice, to pray to and praiſe your GOD. In other aſſemblies, you can but hear another pray his own prayer, if that may be called his own which he knows not before he prays, and remembers not afterwards; whereas we ought to pray as well as ſing praiſes with the ſpirit and with the underſtanding alſo, which may be performed here, but as things at preſent are, cannot be done in the other aſſemblies in this land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi>—You always hear the revealed will of GOD read, a large portion being always appointed, ſo that you will always when you meet here, certainly hear your GOD ſpeaking and teaching you what to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009948_0017_0F7B3AB5B174DF98"/>
believe and do for ſalvation. In other congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſcriptures are wholly laid aſide for the preacher to produce ſomething more pleaſing and excellent; juſt as though a glow-worm would yield a more pleaſing and advantageous light than the meridian ſun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi>—We commemorate the remarkable events of our ſaviour CHRIST, particularly his miraculous birth, as upon this ever joyful and memorable day, and for that purpoſe we always partake of that holy and valuable inſtitution, by which we unworthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are allowed ſpiritually to eat the fleſh and drink the blood of our ſaviour JESUS CHRIST, and thereby to be evidences of, and to ſhew forth his death to future ages: And you, my brethren, who deſign this day to come to his holy banquet, ſhould duly remember yourſelves, and ſo to have examined your hearts and repented of your ſins, as preparedly to be partakers thereof, that ſo you may receive ſpiritual bleſſings from the ſacred appointer and author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi>—Another advantage to be expected, is, that the preacher will entertain and inſtruct your minds, not with unreaſonable miſteries, mere ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive notions, or impracticable duties, which ſerve only to diſtract and bewilder mens underſtanding; but that from the exiſtence and perfections of one GOD; from the wonderful love and work of one only Saviour; from the agency of one only ſpirit, he will proceed to explain and enforce the plain duties of a holy life; furniſhing your minds with proper argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and goſpel motives, to become truly holy, in heart and converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi>—Another advantage, and that not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, will be, that your miniſter will be inveſted with a proper commiſſion, and with competent
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009948_0018_0F7B3AB5D9F2D280"/>
authority from CHRIST, the head of the church, to execute the work of a miniſter among you.</p>
            <p>This is an advantage which the <hi>diſſenters</hi> in this land can juſtly lay no claim to, unleſs every layman has authority to ordain; which appears ſo glaringly abſurd, that many curious diſtinctions are trumped upon the ignorant, and when theſe fail, 'tis denied what our Saviour expreſsly declared (when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned his apoſtles) of <q>lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world.</q> Whoever can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly conſiders the fate of the preſumptuous invaders of this office, under the old, and the appointment by CHRIST and his apoſtles, under the new teſtament, and that for fifteen hundred years after, none but ſuch as were ordained in this line of ſucceſſion, were allowed in the chriſtian church, as the hiſtory of all ages of the church teſtify, will have reaſon to eſteem it a privilege to be under a miniſtry which is juſtly unexceptionable in this particular.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, to mention but this one, which crowns all the other advantages, and for to attain this, the others are only deſigned as helps and means; in the proper uſe of them, through the goodneſs and mercy of GOD, by the merits and mediation of JESUS our common Lord and Saviour, you may obtain the pardon of your ſins, the aſſiſtance and bleſſings of heaven, peace, unanimity, and contentment in this preſent world; and in the future, when this mortal ſhall put on immortality, when contention and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſhall be confined to its proper abode, may come the poſſeſſion of that everlaſting ſalvation, that incorruptible crown of glory, that heavenly reſidence, of <hi>life, light,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> which is reſerved in heaven for all true and obedient chriſtians. This, my brethren, is a prize! worth all your ſtriving; a reward, beyond
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009948_0019_0F7B3AB684CFF2E8"/>
all your doings for the ſervice of GOD, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion; an advantage, that will more, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more, than recompence you, for all the <hi>ſcoffs, ridicule, hatred, oppoſition,</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> caſt at, and laid upon you by others; for all the fatigue, anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety and coſt, you have voluntarily undergone and expended; or let you be ever ſo liberal for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in completing this edifice, or engaged in the ſervices thereof, and of religion in general, this will abundantly recompence you for all: This great advantage, reward, and recompence, you muſt ever eſteem as <hi>ſuch;</hi> never to flatter or deceive yourſelves, as to imagine, upon the one hand, you have earned, and therefore may demand it as wages due to you; nor, upon the other, that you ever ſhall poſſeſs it, notwithſtanding what you have hitherto done, unleſs now, and for the future of your lives, you live agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the conditions thereof; the which is evident upon both ſides, from <hi>Heb.</hi> v. 9, ſpeaking of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of CHRIST, <hi>verſe</hi> 4, the apoſtle ſubjoins, and being made perfect, he became the <hi>author</hi> of eternal <hi>ſalvation,</hi> unto <hi>all</hi> them that <hi>obey him.</hi> Here ſee CHRIST, and not man, is the author and beſtower of this ſalvation; yet you alſo ſee, although CHRIST is both author and giver, he will beſtow it upon none but ſuch as will <hi>obey</hi> him; ſo that we can have no juſt expectation of this, the greateſt of all other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, unleſs we faithfully and truly <hi>obey</hi> him. My time only permits me to mention that <hi>obedience</hi> which we muſt perform in this houſe, in order to reap the advantages propoſed, which is briefly thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi>—Be always careful to be here before the worſhip begins; and when you enter this houſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you enter the houſe of GOD; therefore drop all ceremony to your fellow-men, all the care and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009948_0020_0F7B3AB76272D518"/>
concerns of your worldly buſineſs and employment; all improper thoughts and reflections, and have <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s reflection upon your minds,—"How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the houſe of GOD! This is the gate of heaven!" (<hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 17) let therefore a more ſolemn awe and reverence be paid here. "Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of GOD, and be more ready to hear than to give the ſacrifice of fools:—Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty to utter any thing before GOD," <hi>Eccles.</hi> v. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seccondly.</hi>—When the worſhip begins, join devoutly and engagedly therein; let your hearts be ſincerely animated, your affections diſcreetly warmed, and your attention ſtedfaſtly fixed; for it is a moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and aggravated provocation, <q>to draw near GOD, with our mouths, and with our lips to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, but to have removed our hearts far from him.</q> As we are compounded of ſoul and body, and as both are redeemed, we ſhould ſerve and honour GOD with both; thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> infers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 20, "for ye are bought with a price, <hi>therefore</hi> glorify GOD in your <hi>body,</hi> and in your ſpirit which are GOD'S."—Neither ſhould be neglected, in the worſhip of GOD; but it is the ſervice and worſhip of our ſouls, that moſt excellent part of us, that is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally regarded; that of the body is inſignificant and criminal, unleſs conducive to that of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi>—When you pray for the pardon of your ſins, be reſolved to forſake them; when for grace and GOD'S holy ſpirit, be determined and engaged to receive, embrace, and comply therewith. When you return thanks, let a ſenſe of GOD'S favors and bleſſings be deeply imprinted in your ſouls, and with your voices; let your ſouls, and all that is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009948_0021_0F7B3AB810147098"/>
within, join in praying to and praiſing GOD'S holy name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi>—When the word of GOD is read or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the miniſter, be all ſilence and attention to hear and learn GOD'S holy will, and your duty, taking up a firm reſolution to perform whatſoever you underſtand to be his will and your duty.—The goſpel is, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s language, <q>the power of GOD unto ſalvation, unto every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth;</q> (<hi>Rom.</hi> i. 16)—and in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, <q>the incorruptible ſeed by which we are born again,</q> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 23.—From whence you are therefore to learn what is GOD'S will, what he has and will do for your good and ſalvation, and what you have to do to comply with, and come to the poſſeſſion of the ſame.</p>

            <p>Laſtly—We ought to conclude the public ſervices of religion, by heartily joining in prayer for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from GOD upon what we have heard, and what we have performed; for although <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> water, 'tis GOD that gives the increaſe.—And ſince the miniſter, who is the ſervant and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of CHRIST, only has authority to pronounce the bleſſing of GOD, you ſhould reverently wait, and with attention receive, joining with one heart and one voice, in that ſummary concluſion, AMEN, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it might be ſo, that GOD would bleſs you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

If you, my brethren, would conduct yourſelves after this manner, in the ſervice of GOD, and your redeemer JESUS CHRIST, in this houſe of CHRIST'S, which you have with much labour and expence erected for theſe purpoſes, you will not ever find either your coſt or labour in building, nor your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, care, and diligence in performing theſe, and the other duties of our holy religion, unrewarded; but that it will be found, from the great goodneſs of our heavenly father and creator, through the merits and interceſſion of JESUS CHRIST our redeemer, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely rewarded—Unto whom, with the holy ſpirit, let us now, and ever in this houſe, as it is in heaven aſcribe all honor and praiſe. AMEN.</p>
