            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Cannot eaſily Expreſs the Great Joy, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Satisfaction the People in our Parts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, when they heard ſome Gentlemen of <hi>Boston,</hi> purpoſed to Meet, Adviſe, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of proper Ways and Means, to Extricate you and us, out of our almoſt Inſupportable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Oppreſſions, daily and inſenſibly, increaſing upon us, for want of a Sufficient Medium of Trade and Commerce. — And I freely confeſs, I was pleaſed at it, and almoſt perſwaded to believe, that ſome Good would come of it: But our hopes (being built on a ſandy Foundation) ſoon fell away; our Rejoycing ceaſed, and we were reduced to our former Melancholy Views: and upon the arrival of your Laſt Weeks Gazette, we were (<hi>Even to a Man,</hi>) wonderfully ſurprized, and filled with juſt Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Scorn, upon the firſt Reading an <hi>Infamous Advertiſement,</hi> cramm'd into that Gazette, <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Authority</hi>; in which the Shameleſs Author, takes upon him an uncommon freedom (not to call it impudence,) to Ill-Treat Villify, a Reverend and Worthy Gentleman, whom we ever deemed a true and faithful Friend to his Country, and who ſhew'd

himſelf to be ſuch an One, ſome Years paſt, when many Others (conſidering their Stations in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) were under ſtricter Obligations to appear, were afraid to be Gap-men, and proteſt againſt the Groſs Injuries, Arbitrary and Illegal Actions of the then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and becauſe he ſtood up for the Laws and Rights of his Country, he was ſent to Goal, and Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from his Miniſtry, fined <hi>Fifty Pounds,</hi> paid Coſt, and gave l. 1000.

            <p>Sir, If you find ſuch Arguments like to prevail, you may aſſure all you Converſe with, from me, that the main, if not the only reaſon, why you had not a conſiderable Number of Men from, and about our parts, to attend <hi>Laſt Tueſday Evening,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Draughts, ſuch as we were capable of framing, was, leaſt their weak Eſſays, if they did not pleaſe <hi>ſome few among you,</hi> and got into their hands, (as Unavoidably they would,) that then, their plain, honeſt, well-meaning Attempts would ſerve to <hi>fill up the next Gazette,</hi> with Opprobrious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt them: If not their Names and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons handled, with the ſame Scurrillity the late Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was entertained with, upon the like Occaſion: for how can we Expect to fare better than he? When the moſt we are able to offer, muſt needs come far ſhort of what he put forth on that head.</p>
            <p>Verily, ſhould we <hi>Honeſt Ruſticks</hi> be Condemned, and hung up without any <hi>Tryal,</hi> in ſuch an Indecent, and Unmanly Way; I am prone to think Our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Stomachs,</hi> would not Digeſt ſuch Filthy Traſh. And what very much aggravates this matter, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it Deep Reſentments, is, (If we are rightly Inform'd) that every one that belongs to, and reſides at the Place where this NOBLE atchievement took its Birth, are maintain'd at the Charge of this Province;

Now Good Sir, had you &amp; I, and the Generality of the Inhabitants within this Government, the ſame Opportunities and Ways, (and would improve them,) of being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Province Bills</hi> as the Officers and Soldiers at <hi>Caſtle William</hi> have, we might then ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And ſhould our Inconveniences continue growing ſtill more and more upon us, and ſo far get the Maſtery over us, as to bring us into Diſpondences, we ſhould ſoon Groan under the fatal Conſequences of ſuch a Calamity.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore in <hi>no Wiſe,</hi> cheriſh or harbour ſuch <hi>Puſſill-animity</hi> within our Breaſts; but put far from us, all ſuch deſpicable thoughts.

            <p>The Oppreſſions, and Grievances that our Fathers lay under, during that Government are too many and too Groſs really (ſome of them,) to recount now: and yet they held out, and ſurmounted thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Calamities: And ſhall <hi>We</hi> of <hi>their Race</hi> and <hi>Poſterity</hi> (even before ſome of them, have their Heads laid in the Grave,) eſpecially under ſuch a happy <hi>Conſtitution</hi> as we now Live and Breath in; ſhall <hi>we</hi> ſeem in the leaſt to be diſmayed for our petty Troubles compared with theirs?

And may they not avoid all, who for the ſake of <hi>Perferments,</hi> or fear of looſing a <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Penſion,</hi> will Change their former Notes, and <hi>turn</hi> Courtiers? And if Publick Spirited Men are Choſen to repreſent the People, will it not be their principal Aim and Bent, that the <hi>Council-Board</hi> be filled up with <hi>ſuch</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,

Tho' perhaps ſome of the Methods to attain that End, ſhould not <hi>Immediately</hi> advance their <hi>Private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> but in ſome meaſure rather Impede and Obſtruct it.
