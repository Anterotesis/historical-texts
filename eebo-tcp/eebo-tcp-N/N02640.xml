            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It is moſt certain that the Day of Judgment will come, and that it will be very dreadful to all the Wicked. But ſeeing theſe things muſt be, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all manner of converſation; always looking for the coming of Chriſt: At whoſe coming the Sun ſhall be darkned, the Moon ſhall not give her Light, the Stars ſhall be ſhaken, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat: Who can hear of all this and not be wonderfully diſmayed? O! who dares eat or drink or ſleep, or take a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes reſt, beſure theſe days ſhall come. O wake ye Drunkards, and weep all ye drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Wine, becauſe of the new Wine, for it ſhall be pulled from your Mouths: Gird your ſelves, and lament ye Prieſts, howl ye Miniſters of the Altar, alas! for the day of the Lord is at hand.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE ſhall be this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That 'tis a Goſpel-truth that Chriſt that came into the World in the form of a Servant, will one Day come as a Judge, attended with all his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be ſo, then firſt for a Uſe of Exhertation.</p>
            <p>USE. 1. Let us all be warned, and while we have time provide for that Day. Yet the Weather is fair, we may frame an Ark to ſave us from the Flood: yet are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at the gates of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and yet is <hi>Jonch</hi>

Yea the Apoſtle prays; nay, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead that ye be reconciled unto God. But here a queſtion will ariſe, how will Chriſt appear.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer! He will appear only as a Man to Judge us, who as a Man appeared to be Judged; Conſider this ye that are going to the Bar, what a ſight will this be to the Faithleſs Jews, Stubborn Gentiles; wicked Chriſtians, when every Eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo that receive him? This is the Man (ſhall they ſay) that was Crucified for us, and again Crucified by us; who alas! every Sin is a Croſs, every Oath is a Spear; and when that Day is come, you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the man whom thus you do Crucifie by your daily Sins? ſure this will be a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight: Where is the bloody Swearer that can tear his wounds and heart, and blood? At this day all theſs words ſhall appear, the Heart be Viſible, the Body and Blood be Senſible of good and bad: then ſhall that ſearful voice proceed from his Throne, Where is the blood thou ſpilledſt?

            <p>As Chriſt ſhall appear in the form of a Man, ſo this Man ſhall appear in a glorious Form; Oh ſinners look about you, the Judge is coming, a fire devours before him, and behind him a flame burns up on every ſide, the People tremble and all faces gather blackneſs; here is a change indeed, he that was at the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Adulterer for a while may flatter Beauty, Swearers grace their words with Oaths, the Drunkards kiſs the Cups, and drink his Body's health till be bring his Soul to ruin; But remember for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgment. Sad comfort in the end; when the Adulterer ſhall ſatisfy his Luſt, when he lies on a Bed of fire, all hugged and embraced with thoſe flames: The Swearer ſhall have enough of Wounds and Blood, when the Devils tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Body, and Rack his Soul in Hell; The Drunkard ſhall have plenty of his Cups when Scalding Lead ſhall be poured down

            <p>Uſe. 2. For comfort to the Saints, the Judges Favourites. Now (ſeeing that you are GOD's Servants) Satan ſhall be trod under your Feet, &amp; you with your Maſter Chriſt ſhall be carried into the Holy of Holys; You may Remember how all the Men of God in their greateſt anguiſhes here below, have fetcht Comfort by the Eyes of Faith. At this Moment <hi>Job</hi> rejoyced being caſt on a Dunghill, that his Redeemer Lived, and that he ſhould ſee him at the laſt Day ſtand on the Earth. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> longed and cryed, Come Lord Jeſus come quickly. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.28. Now therefore little Children abide in him, that when he ſhall appear, we may have confidence, for he ſhall Reward every Man according to his Works. But I proceed.</p>

God is their Judge, Heaven their Foe, the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride them, Angels hate them; Good Lord, what a world of miſeries hath ſeiz'd on theſe miſerable Souls; Their Executioners are Devils, the Dungeon Hell, the Earth ſtands open, and the cruel Furnace ready boiling to Receive them; Oh! how will theſe poor Souls quake and tremble? eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of his body will bear a part in this Puniſhment; Eyes weep, Hands wring, Breaſt beat, Heart ake, Voices cry now, O Man of Earth, What will all thy wealth avail thee? what can all thy Pleaſures profit thee? One drop of water to cool thy tongue in theſe flames is worth more than all the Pleaſures in the World, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the Sentence of the Juſt and Wicked; and now is the Judge ariſing from his glorious Seat; the Saints guard him along, and the Sentenced Priſoners are delivered to the Jaylors; What a ſcreech of horror will be heard.

Here is the end of the Godly, the fruition of this end, the reward it ſelf. What can I ſay, but Live in God's fear, and the Lord reward you, nay he will ſo, if you Live ſo, for then ſhall he reward every Man according to his Works.</p>
