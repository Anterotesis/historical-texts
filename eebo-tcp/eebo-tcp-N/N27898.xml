            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Bear ye one another's Burdens.</head>
            <p>ONCE upon a time methought I ſet out upon a long journey, and the place through which I travelled appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a dark Valley which was called the valley of Tears. It had obtained this name not only on account of the many ſorrowful adventures which poor paſſengers commonly meet with in their journey through it; but alſo becauſe moſt of theſe Travellers entered it weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crying, and left it in very great pain and anguiſh. This vaſt valley was full of people of all colours, ages, ſizes,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037163_0003_100CDEDE1093D5E0"/>
and deſcriptions. But whether white or black, or tawney, all were travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſame road; or rather they were taking different little paths which all led to the ſame common end.</p>
            <p>Now it was remarkable that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the different complexions, ages, and tempers of this vaſt variety of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet all reſembled each other in this one reſpect, that each had a burden on his back which he was deſtined to carry through the toil and heat of the day, until he ſhould arrive by a longer or ſhorter courſe at his journey's end. Theſe burdens would in general have made the pilgrimage quite intolerable, had not the Lord of the Valley, out of his great compaſſion for theſe poor Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, provided among other things, the following means for their relief.</p>
            <p>In their full view over the entrance of the Valley, there were written in great letters the following words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <q>Bear ye one another's Burdens.</q>
            <p>Now I ſaw in my viſion that many
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037163_0004_100CDEE0D270D728"/>
of the Travellers hurried on without ſtopping to read this inſtruction, and others, though they had once read it, yet paid little or no attention to it. A third ſort thought it very good advice for other people, but very ſeldom appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to themſelves. In ſhort I ſaw that too many of thoſe people were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they had burdens enough of their own, and that there was therefore no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to take upon them thoſe of others; ſo each tried to make his own load as light, and his own journey as pleaſant as he could, without ſo much as once caſting a thought on a poor over loaded neighbour. Here however I have to make a rather ſingular remark, by which I ſhall plainly ſhew the folly of theſe ſelfiſh people. It was ſo ordered and contrived by the Lord of this valley, that if any one ſtretched out his hand to lighten a neighbour's burden, in fact he never failed to find that he at that moment alſo lightened his own. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the obligation to help each other, and the benefit of doing ſo were mutual. If a man helped his neighbour it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happened that ſome other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037163_0005_100CDEE2DF49F2E0"/>
came by and by and helped him in his turn; for their was no ſuch thing as what we call <hi>independence</hi> in the whole Valley. Not one of all theſe Travellers, however ſtout and ſtrong, could move on comfortably without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for ſo the Lord of the Valley, whoſe laws were all of them kind and good, had expreſsly ordained.</p>
            <p>I ſtood ſtill to watch the progreſs of theſe poor way-faring people, who mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſlowly on, like ſo many Ticket por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with burdens of various kinds on their backs; of which ſome were heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſome were lighter, but from a burden of one kind or other, not one Traveller was entirely free.</p>

               <p>A ſorrowful Widow, oppreſſed with the burden of grief for the loſs of an affectionate huſband, would have been bowed down by her heavy load, had not the ſurviving children with great alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtepped forward and ſupported her. Their kindneſs after a while, ſo much.

lightened the load which threatened at firſt to be intolerable, that ſhe even went on her way with chearfulneſs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The Husband.</head>
               <p>I next ſaw a poor old man tottering under a burden then ſo heavy, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him every moment to ſink under it. I peeped into his pack, and ſaw it was made up of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> articles; there was poverty, oppreſſion, ſickneſs, debt, and what made by far the heavieſt part, undutiful children. I was wondering how it was he had got on even ſo well as he did, till I ſpied his wife, a kind, meek, Chriſtian woman, who was doing her utmoſt to aſſiſt him. She quietly got behind, gently laid her ſhoulder to the burden, and carried a much larger proportion of it than appeared to me when I was at a diſtance. She not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſtained him by her ſtrength, but cheered him by her counſels. She told him that "through much tribulation we muſt enter into reſt," that "he that overcometh ſhall inherit all things." In ſhort, ſhe ſo ſupported his fainting

            <div type="section">
               <head>The kind Neighbour.</head>
               <p>An infirm blind woman was creeping forward with a very heavy burden, in which were packed ſickneſs and want, with numberleſs other of thoſe raw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, out of which human miſery is worked up. She was ſo weak that ſhe could not have got on at all, had it not been for the kind aſſiſtance of another woman almoſt as poor as herſelf; who, though ſhe had no light burden of her own, cheerfully lent an helping hand to a fellow traveller who was ſtill more heavily laden. This friend had indeed little or nothing to give, but the very voice of kindneſs is ſoothing to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And I remarked in many other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that it was not ſo much the degree of the help afforded, as the manner of helping that lightened the burdens. Some had a coarſe, rough clumſy way of aſſiſting a neighbour, which, though in fact it might be of real uſe, yet ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037163_0008_100CDEE9A3EBF410"/>
by galling the Travellers, to add to the load it was intended to lighten; while I obſerved in others that ſo cheap a kindneſs as a mild word, or even an affectionate look made a poor burdened wretch move on cheerily. The bare feeling that ſome human being cared for him, ſeemed to lighten the load. But to return to this kind neighbour. She had a little old book in her hand, the covers of which were worn out by much uſe. When ſhe ſaw the blind woman ready to faint ſhe would read her a few words out of this book, ſuch as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing—"Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted." "I will never leave thee nor forſake thee." "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."</p>

               <head>The Clergyman.</head>
               <p>A pious Miniſter, ſinking under the weight of a diſtreſſed pariſh, whoſe worldly wants he was totally unable to

The Miniſter, being no longer bowed down by the temporal diſtreſſes of his people, applied himſelf chearfully to his own part of the weight. And it was pleaſant to ſee how thoſe two perſons, neither of them very ſtrong, or rich, or healthy, by thus kindly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, were enabled to bear the weight of a whole pariſh; though ſingly, either of them muſt have ſunk under the attempt. And I remember one great grief I felt during my whole journey was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I did not ſee more of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and concurring kindneſs, by which all the burdens might have been ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided. It troubled me to obſerve, that of all the laws of the Valley there was not one more frequently broken than <hi>the law of kindness.</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The Negroes.</head>
               <p>I now ſpied a ſwarm of poor black men, women and children, a multitude
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037163_0010_100CDEED915BB1F0"/>
which no man could number; theſe groaned, and toiled, and ſweated, and bled under far heavier loads than I had ſeen. But for a while no man helped them; at length a few white travellers were touched with the ſorrowful ſighing of thoſe millions, and very heartily did they put their hands to the burdens; but their number was not quite equal to the work they had undertaken. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, however, that they never loſt ſight of thoſe poor heavy laden wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and as the number of thoſe generous helpers encreaſed, I felt a comfortable hope, that before all the blacks got out of the Valley, the whites would fairly divide the burden, and the loads would be effectually lightened.</p>
               <p>Among the travellers, I had occaſion to remark, that thoſe who moſt kicked and ſtruggled under their burdens, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made them ſo much the heavier; for their ſhoulders became extremely galled by thoſe vain ſtruggles. The load, if borne patiently, would in the end have turned even to the advantage of the bearers (for ſo the Lord of the Valley
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037163_0011_100CDEEFDAD57220"/>
had kindly decreed) but as to theſe grumblers they had all the ſmart and none of the benefit. But the thing which made all theſe burdens ſeem ſo very heavy was, that in every one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, there was a certain <hi>inner pacquet,</hi> which moſt of the Travellers took pains to conceal, and carefully wrap up; and while they were forward enough to complain of the other part of their burdens, few ſaid a word about this; though in truth it was the preſſing weight of this <hi>secret pacquet</hi> which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to render the general burden ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. In ſpite of all their caution, I contrived to get a peep at it, I found in each that this pacquet had the ſame label; the word SIN was written on all as a general title, and in ink ſo black that they could not waſh it out. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that moſt of them took no ſmall pains to hide the writing; but I was ſurprized to ſee that they did not try to get rid of the load but the label. If any kind friend who aſſiſted theſe people in bearing their burdens, did but ſo much as hint at the <hi>secret pacquet,</hi> or adviſe them to get rid of it, they took fire at
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037163_0012_100CDEF192769BB8"/>
once, and commonly denied they had any ſuch article in their portmanteau; and it was thoſe whoſe <hi>secret pacquet</hi> ſwelled to the moſt enormous ſize, who moſt ſtoutly denied they had any.</p>
               <p>I ſaw with pleaſure, however, that ſome who had long laboured heartily to get rid of this inward pacquet at length found it much diminiſhed, and the more this pacquet ſhrunk in ſize, the lighter was the other part of their burdens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p>Then, methought, all at once, I heard a voice as it had been the voice of an angel, crying out and ſaying, "Ye unhappy Pilgrims, why are ye troubled about the burden which ye are doomed to bear through this Valley of tears? Know ye not that as ſoon as ye ſhall have eſcaped out of this Valley, the whole burden ſhall drop off, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ye neglect not to remove that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward weight of SIN which principally oppreſſes you?

At firſt ſetting out on his journey, each Traveller had a ſmall lamp ſo fixed in his boſom that it ſeemed to make a part of himſelf, but as this <hi>natural light</hi> did not prove to be ſufficient to direct them in the right way, the king of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in pity to their wanderings and their blindneſs, out of his gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion promiſed to give theſe poor way-faring people an additional ſupply
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037163_0015_100CDEF88B5E5EB0"/>
of light from his own Royal Treaſury. But as he did not chuſe to laviſh his favours where there ſeemed no diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to receive them, he would not beſtow any of his oil on ſuch as did not think it worth aſking for. <hi>Ask and ye shall have,</hi> was the rule he laid down for them. Many were prevented from aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through pride, for they thought they had light enough already, preferring the feeble glimmerings of their own lamp to all the light from the king's treaſury. Yet it was obſerved of thoſe who rejected it, as thinking they had enough, that hardly any acted up to what even their own light ſhewed them. Others were deterred from aſking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> told that it not only pointed out the dangers and difficulties of the road, but by a certain reflecting power, it turned inward on themſelves, and revealed to them ugly ſights in their own hearts, to which they rather choſe to be blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for thoſe Travellers <hi>chose darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</hi> Now it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that theſe two properties were inſeparable, and that the lamp would be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037163_0016_100CDEFAE42BFE98"/>
of little outward uſe, except to thoſe who uſed it as an internal reflector. A threat and a promiſe alſo never failed to accompany the offer of this light from the king, a promiſe that to thoſe who improved what they had, <hi>more should be given, and a threat that from those who did not use it wisely, should be taken away even what they had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I obſerved that when the road was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, when terrors and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and death beſet the faithful travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, then on their fervent importunity, the king voluntarily gave large and bountiful ſupplies of light, ſuch as in common ſeaſons never could have been expected; always proportioning the quantity given to the neceſſity of the caſe, <hi>as their day was, such was their light and strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though many choſe to depend entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their own lamp, yet it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that this light was apt to go out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> left to itſelf. It was eaſily blown out by thoſe violent guſts which were perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally howling through the wilderneſs, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037163_0017_100CDEFCE4683890"/>
indeed it was the natural tendency of that unwholeſome atmoſphere to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it, juſt as you have ſeen a candle go out when expoſed to the vapours and foul air of a damp room. It was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſight to ſee multitudes of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers heedleſsly pacing on, boaſting they had light enough, and deſpiſing the offer of more. But what aſtoniſhed me moſt of all was, to ſee many, and ſome of them too accounted men of firſt rate wit, actually buſy in blowing out their own light, becauſe while any ſpark of it remained, it only ſerved to torment them, and point out things which they did not wiſh to ſee. And having once blown out their own light, they were not eaſy till they had blown out that of their neighbour's alſo; ſo that a good part of the wilderneſs ſeemed to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit a ſort of univerſal <hi>blindman's buff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> each endeavouring to catch his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, while his own voluntary blindneſs expoſed him to be caught himſelf, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat each was actually falling into the ſnare he was laying for another, till at length, as ſelfiſhneſs is the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of blindneſs, "catch he that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037163_0018_100CDEFE78344670"/>
catch can," became the general cry, throughout the wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>Now I ſaw in my viſion, that there were ſome others who were buſy in ſtrewing the moſt gaudy flowers over the numerous bogs, precipices, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls, with which the wilderneſs abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thus making danger and death look ſo gay, that poor thoughtleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeemed to delight in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Thoſe pit-falls did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear deep or dangerous, becauſe over them were raiſed gay edifices with allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring names, in which were ſinging men and ſinging women, and dancing, and feaſting, and gaming, and drinking, and jollity, and madneſs. But though the ſcenery was gay, the footing was unſound. The floors were full of holes, through which the unthinking merry-makers were continually ſinking. Some tumbled through in the middle of a ſong, many at the end of a feaſt, and though there was many a cup of intoxication wreathed with flowers, yet there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poiſon at the bottom. But what moſt ſurprized me was, that though no
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037163_0019_100CDF00A2769DD8"/>
day paſt over their heads in which ſome of thoſe merry-makers did not drop through, yet their loſs made little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on thoſe who were left. Nay, inſtead of being awakened to more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and ſelf denial by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dropping off of thoſe about them, ſeveral of them ſeemed to borrow from thence an argument of a direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tendency, and the very ſhortneſs of the time was only urged as a reaſon to uſe it more ſedulouſly for the indulgence in ſenſual delights. <hi>Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die. Let us crown our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with rose-buds before they are withered.</hi> With theſe and a thouſand other ſuch little mottos, the gay gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of the wilderneſs were decorated. Some admired poets were ſet to work to put the moſt corrupt ſentiments into the moſt harmonious tunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe were ſung without ſcruple, chiefly indeed by the looſer ſons of riot, but not ſeldom alſo by the more orderly daughters of ſobriety, who were not aſhamed to ſing to the ſound of inſtruments, ſentiments ſo corrupt and immoral, that they would have bluſhed to ſpeak or read them;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037163_0020_100CDF039F5E5D70"/>
but the muſic ſeemed to ſanctify the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, eſpecially ſuch as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with love or drinking.</p>
            <p>Now I obſerved that all the travellers who had ſo much as a ſpark of light left, ſeemed every now and then, as they moved onwards, to caſt an eye, though with very different degrees of attention, towards the <hi>happy land,</hi> which they were told lay at the end of their journey: but as they could not ſee very far forward, and as they knew there was a <hi>dark and shadowy valley</hi> which muſt needs be croſſed before they could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the <hi>happy land,</hi> they tried to turn their attention from it as much as they could. The truth is, they were not ſufficiently apt to conſult a map which the king had given them, and which pointed out the <hi>road</hi> to the happy land ſo clearly, that <hi>the way-faring man though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> could not err.</hi> This map alſo defined very correctly the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>happy land</hi> from the <hi>land of misery,</hi> both of which lay on the other ſide of the <hi>dark and shadowy valley;</hi> but ſo many beacons and light-houſes were
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037163_0021_100CDF0538E27830"/>
erected, ſo many clear and explicit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections furniſhed for avoiding the one country and attaining the other, that it was not the king's fault, if even one ſingle Traveller got wrong. But I am inclined to think that in ſpite of the map, and the king's word, and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of aſſiſtance to get them thither, that the Travellers in general did not heartily and truly believe after all, that there was any ſuch country as the <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py land;</hi> or at leaſt the paltry and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient pleaſures of the wilderneſs ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted them, the thoughts of the <hi>dark and shadowy valley</hi> ſo frightened them, that they thought they ſhould be more comfortable by baniſhing all thought and forecaſt.</p>
            <p>Now I alſo ſaw in my dream, that there were two roads through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, one of which every Traveller muſt needs take. The firſt was narrow, and difficult and rough, but it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſafe. It did not admit the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to ſtray either to the right hand or the left, yet it was far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of real comforts or ſober plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037163_0022_100CDF075ACC5DE8"/>
The other was a <hi>broad and tempting way,</hi> abounding with luxurious fruits and gaudy flowers to tempt the eye, and pleaſe the appetite. To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this dark valley, through which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Traveller was well aſſured he muſt one day paſs, ſeemed indeed the object of general deſire. To this grand end, all that human ingenuity could invent was induſtriouſly ſet to work. The Travellers read, and they wrote, and they painted, and they ſung, and they danced, and they drank as they went along, not ſo much becauſe they all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for theſe things, or had any real joy in them, as becauſe this reſtleſs activity ſerved to divert their attention from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being fixed on the <hi>dark and shadowy valley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The king, who knew the thoughtleſs temper of the Travellers, and how apt they were to forget their journey's end, had thought of a thouſand little kind attentions to warn them of their dangers. And as we ſometimes ſee in our gardens written on a board in great letters, BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARE OF SPRING GUNS—MAN TRAPS
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037163_0023_100CDF09CE7DBF50"/>
ARE SET HERE; ſo had this king cauſed to be written and ſtuck up before the eyes of the Travellers, ſeveral like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and cautions, ſuch as <hi>Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction—Take heed lest ye also perish—Woe to them that rise up early to drink wine—The pleasures of sin are but for a season.</hi> &amp;c. Such were the notices directed to the <hi>broad-way</hi> Travellers, but they were ſo buſily engaged in plucking the flowers, ſometimes before they were blown, and in devouring the fruits, often before they were ripe, and in loading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with <hi>yellow clay,</hi> under the weight of which millions periſhed, that they had no time ſo much as to look at the king's directions. Many went wrong becauſe they prefered a merry journey to a ſafe one and were terrified by certain notices chiefly intended for the <hi>narrow-way</hi> Travellers, ſuch as <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

shall be turned into joy,</hi> alſo, <hi>your joy no man taketh from you, and they that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I alſo ſaw in my dream, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny travellers who had a ſtrong dread of ending at the <hi>Land of misery,</hi> walked up to the <hi>Strait Gate,</hi> hoping that though the entrance was narrow, yet if they could once get in, the road would widen; but what was their grief, when on look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cloſely they ſaw written on the inſide <hi>narrow is the way;</hi> this made them take fright, they compared the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription with which the whole way was lined, ſuch as, <hi>be ye not conformed to this world—deny yourselves, take up your cross,</hi> with all the tempting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the wilderneſs. Some indeed recollected the fine deſcriptions they had read of the <hi>Happy Lana, the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den City, and the Rivers of Pleasures,</hi> and they ſighed: but then, thoſe joys were diſtant, and from the faintneſs of their light they ſoon got to think that what was remote might be uncertain, and while the preſent good increaſed in bulk by it's nearneſs, the diſtant good
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037163_0025_100CDF0E919530B0"/>
receded, diminiſhed, diſappeared! Their faith ſailed, they would truſt no farther than they could ſee; they drew back and got into the <hi>Broad Way,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a common but ſad refuge in the number and gaiety of their companions. When theſe ſaint-hearted people, who yet had ſet out well, turned back, their light was quite put out, and then they became worſe than thoſe who had made no attempt to get in. "For it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that is, it is next to impoſſible, for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance."</p>
            <p>A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ew honeſt humble Travellers not naturally ſtronger than the reſt, but ſtrengthened by their truſt in the king's word, came up by the light of their lamps, and meekly entered in at the <hi>Strait Gate;</hi> as they advanced farther they felt leſs heavy, and though the way did not in reality grow wider, yet they grew reconciled to the narrowneſs of it,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037163_0026_100CDF109CAF79B0"/>
eſpecially when they ſaw the walls here and there ſtudded with certain jewels called <hi>promises,</hi> ſuch as <hi>he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</hi> And <hi>my grace is sufficient for you.</hi> Some when they were almoſt ready to faint, were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by ſeeing that many niches in the <hi>Narrow Way</hi> were filled with ſtatues and pictures of Saints and Martyrs, who had borne their teſtimony at the ſtake, that the <hi>Narrow Way</hi> was the ſafe way; and theſe Travellers, inſtead of ſinking at the ſight of the painted wheel and gibbet, the ſword and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, were animated by theſe words written under them, <hi>those that wear white robes came out of great tribulation,</hi> and <hi>be ye followers of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time there came a great multitude of Travellers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all from <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea;</hi> this was the largeſt party I had yet ſeen: theſe were <hi>neither hot nor cold,</hi> they would not give up future hope, they could not endure preſent pain; ſo they contrived to deceive themſelves by fancying that they reſolved to keep
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037163_0027_100CDF138C018068"/>
the <hi>happy land</hi> in view, yet that there muſt needs be many different ways which led to it, no doubt all equally ſure, without being all equally rough; ſo they ſet on foot little contrivances to attain the end without uſing the means, and ſoftened down the ſpirit of the king's directions to fit them to their own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Sometimes they would ſplit a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in two, and only uſe that half which ſuited them. For inſtance, when they met with the following rule, <hi>Trust in the Lord, and be doing good,</hi> they would take the firſt half, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſy with a general ſort of truſt, that through the mercy of the king all would go well with them, though, they themſelves did nothing; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, many made ſure that a few good works of their own would do their buſineſs, and carry them ſafely to the <hi>happy land,</hi> though they did <hi>not</hi> truſt in the Lord, nor place any faith in his word. Thus ſome periſhed by a lazy faith, and others by a working pride. A large party of <hi>Pharisees</hi> now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had ſo neglected their lamp, that they did not ſee their way at all,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037163_0028_100CDF15C1B65EA8"/>
though they fancied themſelves to be full of light; they kept up appearances ſo well, as to delude others, and moſt effectually to delude themſelves with a notion that they might be found in the right way at laſt. In this dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion they went on to the end, and till they were finally plunged in the dark valley, never diſcovered the horrors which awaited them on the diſmal ſhore. It was remarkable that while theſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were often boaſting how bright their light burnt, in order to get the praiſe of men, the humble travellers, whoſe ſteady light ſhewed their good works to others, refuſed all commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the brighter their light ſhined before men, ſo much the more they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that they ought to glorify not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but <hi>their father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now ſet myſelf to obſerve what was the particular lett, moleſtation, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, which obſtructed particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers in their endeavours to enter in at the Strait Gate. I remarked a huge portly man who ſeemed deſirous of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037163_0029_100CDF18361AEFD8"/>
in, but he carried about him ſuch a vaſt proviſion of bags full of gold, and had on ſo many rich garments which ſtuffed him out ſo wide, that though he puſhed and ſqueezed, like one who had really a mind to get in, yet he could not poſſibly do ſo. Then I heard a voice crying, <hi>woe to him that loadeth himſelf with thick clay.</hi> The poor man felt ſomething was wrong, and even went ſo far as to change ſome of his more cumberſome vanities into others which ſeemed leſs bulky, but ſtill he and his pack were much too wide for the gate. He would not however give up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo eaſily, but began to throw away a little of the coarſer part of his baggage, but ſtill I remarked that he threw away none of the vanities which lay near his heart. He tried again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it would not do; ſtill his dimenſions were too large. He now looked up and read theſe words, "how hardly ſhall thoſe who have riches enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God." The poor man ſighe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to find that it was impoſſible to enjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his fill of both worlds, <hi>and went away sorrowing.</hi> If he ever afterwards caſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037163_0030_100CD601A2356E58"/>
a thought towards the <hi>happy land,</hi> it was only to regret that the road which led to it was too narrow to admit any but the meagre children of want, who were not ſo encumbered by wealth as to be too big for the paſſage. Had he read on he would have ſeen that <hi>with God all things are possible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another advanced with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſucceſs, for having little world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riches or honours, the gate did not ſeem ſo ſtrait to him. He got to the threſhhold triumphantly, and ſeemed to look back with diſdain on all that he was quitting. He ſoon found, however, that he was ſo bloated with pride, and ſtuffed out with ſelf ſufficiency, that he could not get in. Nay, he was in a worſe way than the rich man juſt named; for <hi>he</hi> was willing to throw away ſome of his outward luggage, whereas this man refuſed to part with a grain of that vanity and ſelf-applauſe which made him too big for the way. The ſenſe of his own worth ſo ſwelled him out, that he ſtuck faſt in the <hi>gateway,</hi> and could neither get in nor out. Finding now
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037163_0031_100CDF1BEC515A28"/>
that he muſt cut off all thoſe big thoughts of himſelf if he wiſhed to be reduced to ſuch a ſize as to paſs the gate, he gave up all thoughts of it. He ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that humility and ſelf-denial which might have ſhrunk him down to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dimenſions; the more he inſiſted on his own qualifications for entrance, the more impoſſible it came, for the bigger he grew. Finding that he muſt become quite another manner of man before he could hope to get in, he gave up the deſire; and I now ſaw that though when he ſet his face towards the <hi>happy land</hi> he could not get an inch forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the inſtant he made a motion to turn back into the world, his ſpeed became rapid enough, and he ſoon got back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>broad way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many, who for a time were brought down from their uſual bulk by ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, ſeemed to get in with eaſe. They now thought all their difficulties over, for having been ſurfeited with the world, during <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir late diſappointment, they turned their backs upon it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly enough. A fit of ſickneſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037163_0032_100CDF1EAD0F2FD0"/>
which is very apt to reduce, had for a time brought their bodies into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſo that they were able juſt to get in at the <hi>gateway;</hi> but as ſoon as health and ſpirits returned, the way grew narrower and narrower to them; they could not get on but turned ſhort, and got back into the world. I ſaw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny attempt to enter who were ſtopt ſhort by a large burden of worldly cares; others by a load of idolatrous attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but I obſerved that nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a more complete bar than that vaſt bundle of prejudices with which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes were loaded. Others were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally obſtructed by loads of bad habits which they would not lay down, though they knew it prevented their entrance. Some few, however, of moſt deſcriptions, who had kept their light alive by craving conſtant ſupplies from the king's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, got through at laſt by a ſtrength which they felt not to be their own. One poor man, who carried the largeſt bundle of bad habits I had ſeen, could not get on a ſtep; he never ceaſed how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to implore for light enough to ſee where his miſery lay, he threw down
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037163_0033_100CDF20F765F608"/>
one of his bundles, then another, but all to little purpoſe, ſtill he could not ſtir. At laſt <hi>striving as if in agony</hi> (which is the true way of entering) he threw down the heavieſt article in his pack; this was <hi>selfishness,</hi> the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low felt relieved at once, his light burnt brightly and the reſt of his pack was as nothing.</p>
            <p>Then I heard a great noiſe as of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters at work. I looked what this might be, and ſaw many ſturdy travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who finding they were too bulky to get through, took it into their heads not to reduce themſelves, but to widen the gate; they hacked on this ſide and hewed on that; but all their hacking, and hewing, and hammering, was to no purpoſe, they got only their labour for their pains; it was poſſible they might have reduced themſelves, but they could not widen the way.</p>
            <p>What grieved me moſt was to obſerve that many who had got on ſucceſsfully a good way, now ſtopped to reſt, and to admire their own progreſs. While they
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037163_0034_100CDF2293B53638"/>
were thus valuing themſelves on their attainments, their light diminiſhed. While theſe were boaſting how far they had left others behind, who had ſet out much earlier, ſome ſlower Travellers, whoſe beginning had not been ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, but who had walked carefully, now out ſtripped them.
