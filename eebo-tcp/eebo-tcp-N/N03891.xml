            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Zebulun and Naphtali were a People that jeoparded their Lives unto the Death, in the high places of the Field.</hi>

            <p>THIS Chapter contains a <hi>Song,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by a glorious Victory obtained over <hi>Jabin</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and is entitled, The Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak;</hi> The former was a <hi>Propheteſs</hi> in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the latter by an immediate Call from GOD, was <hi>General</hi> of the Army at that Time; and they both did worthily in their Places. <hi>Deborah</hi> was truly a <hi>Mother in Iſrael,</hi> by being a Mother <hi>to Iſrael;</hi> thoughtful and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even as a tender Mother, to deliver the People, as tho' her own Children, from Oppreſſion, and to ſave them from Ruin: Yea, and altho' it does not appear, that, in the Day of Battle, ſhe fought with her Hand, yet her pious Soul was in Exerciſe, being lifted up to GOD in the Heavens, and doubtleſs contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted more by her fervent Prayers to the vanquiſhing of the Enemy, than <hi>Barak</hi> by his Martial Weapons; and therefore ſays ſhe, "My Soul thou haſt trodden down Strength": Not but that the <hi>General</hi> acted his Part prudently, and with a Spirit of true Courage, and had the Praiſe of it: And not at that Time only, but moreover, he is celebrated by the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004788_0004_100DEB7654B18028"/>
Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s Deliverer, and a Man eminent for his Faith.—And it may not paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved, that the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at that Juncture, to ſerve in the War; and by ſo doing won the Heart of the Propheteſs, and ſhe gave GOD the Praiſe of it; as alſo, becauſe the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> offer'd themſelves ſo very willingly.—Particular Mention is here made of the ſeveral Tribes which aſſiſted, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Benjamin, Machir</hi> and <hi>Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Iſſachar</hi> and <hi>Napthali:</hi> But then, alas! ſome there were which <hi>declin'd</hi> the Service, as <hi>Reuben, partly,</hi> becauſe of the Diviſions among them, but whether the Conteſt was between themſelves, or with the other Tribes, is uncertain; and <hi>partly,</hi> by Reaſon of their ſecular Occaſions, or becauſe they choſe to purſue their own private, rather than to promote the public Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: And truly, a contentious, as alſo a covetous and worldly Spirit, very often proves the unhappy Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Perſons refuſing to lend a Hand to promote the public Weal. <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Aſher</hi> alſo declined; but <hi>Meroz</hi> is eſpecially condemned and curſed; and the Curſe, it ſeems, took effect, for we read no more of it: Not, that GOD wanted their help; No; for rather than not accompliſh his own Work, "the Stars from Heaven muſt fight in their Courſes"; which may probably refer to the Thunder, Lightning, and Storms of Hail ſent at that Time, and on that Occaſion: Yea, and not the Heavens only, but alſo the Waters under the Heavens, and in particular, the ancient River <hi>Kiſhon</hi> miniſtred to the Salvation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by ſweeping away and drowning a Multitude of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who probably eſſay'd to paſs over to the other Side, and ſo eſcape.—And then, the Propheteſs goes on to give <hi>Jael,</hi> her Siſter-Heroe, the Praiſe of her valorous Act, in putting a full End to <hi>Siſera'</hi>s troubling of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by Means of her deadly Nail and Hammer: And having ſpoken of the Diſappointment, which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004788_0005_100DECD18E8652A0"/>
would thereby enſue to his Mother and the other Ladies of the Court, ſhe concludes with a pathetick Requeſt to GOD, for the like Deſtruction of all his Enemies; and for the Encouragement and Salvation of all true Iſraelites.</p>
            <p>AND now, O how much does it redound to the Honour of this <hi>Mother in Iſrael,</hi> that ſhe diſclaimed all Right to the Honour of that great Exploit! As ſhe had been firſt in the Action, ſo alſo ſhe now leads in the Thankſgiving, ſaying in effect, "Not unto me, Not unto us, but to thy Name, O LORD, be the Glory." Verſes 2d and 3d, "Praiſe ye the LORD for the avenging of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the People willingly offered them. Hear O ye Kings, give Ear O ye Princes, I, even I will ſing unto the LORD, I will ſing Praiſe unto the LORD GOD of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>"—And truly, all the People had abundant Reaſon, for a long Time after, to remember this Victory with repeated Thankſgivings; for, it not only brought them a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happy Peace and Quiet, but moreover, the whole Land had Reſt for the Space of <hi>Forty</hi> Years.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Napthali</hi> ſeem to have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves, on that Day, by their Boldneſs and Activity: They were the <hi>firſt</hi> that offered for that Service, moved thereunto, it's probable, partly from the Conſideration of <hi>Barak'</hi>s belonging to one of thoſe Tribes, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that of <hi>Napthali;</hi> but much more from the Senſe which they had, above any other, of the Hardſhip of enduring the Yoke, they lying neareſt to the Oppreſſor: Theſe People being ſpirited from above, choſe rather to die like Men, than to live any longer like Vaſſals to the vileſt of Men; and therefore, fir'd with Zeal for GOD, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they ſoon liſted into the Service, and being thus enter'd, they would not baulk ſo good a Cauſe, but in the Day of Battle, jeoparded their Lives to the Death in the high Places of the Field; or, in the plain and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004788_0006_100DECD31C793328"/>
open Field.—Indeed <hi>Barak'</hi>s Orders were to take <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> Men out of theſe two Tribes, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; but becauſe ſome out of ſome of the other Tribes <hi>willingly</hi> offered themſelves, therefore they were accepted: However, <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Naphtali</hi> were doubtleſs the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> appointed to that Place by their General, yea and chooſing it rather than any other, altho' the Place of greateſt Danger: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they did not, in the <hi>Day</hi> of Battle, ſhrink back nor ſeek to flee, but like Men filled with heroick Courage, puſh'd on, and having ſet their Faces like a Flint, they encounter'd even the Chariots of Iron with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dread of Danger, and diſdain'd the King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors himſelf in ſo juſt a Cauſe.—It is ſaid indeed, that they <hi>jeoparded their Lives</hi>—; but the goodneſs of their Cauſe made them quite unmindful of their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, being fully determined either to conquer, or die on the Spot.</p>
            <p>AND now, it is obvious to us all, that this was ſpoken, and is here recorded, by way of <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them,</hi> that they were thus forward and valorous; and alſo, as a great <hi>Favour of GOD to Iſrael,</hi> that they had ſuch Men among their Tribes: So that, we may take this for our OBSERVATION,</p>
            <p>THAT when a Number of Men do in a juſt Cauſe, and there is urgent Neceſſity for it, jeopard their Lives to the Death, in behalf of their Country, it affords Matter of <hi>Thankſgiving unto GOD,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to ſuch Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND our Obſervation will hold true, as to thoſe who jeopard their Lives upon the <hi>mighty Waters,</hi> as well as to ſuch who do ſo in the <hi>Field</hi> of Battle.</p>
            <p>AND this may be ſpoken to, as the Time ſhall admit, under <hi>Four General Heads.</hi>

I. THAT the Church and People of GOD have Enemies to Encounter.</p>
            <p>II. IT is lawful, and ſometimes highly neceſſary, for the People of GOD, ſome of them at leaſt, to take up Arms and go forth to War.</p>
            <p>III. A Soldier's Life is in very great Jeopardy, eſpecially in the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>IV. THAT when a Number of Men do in a juſt Cauſe, and there be Neceſſity for it, jeopard their Lives to the Death, in behalf of their Country, it affords Matter of Thankſgiving unto GOD, and Commendation to ſuch Men.</p>
            <p>SOMETHING I ſhall ſay to <hi>Each</hi> of theſe; then, offer a few Words by way of <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the honourable <hi>Artillery Company;</hi> and then conclude with ſome Advice to thoſe, who are about to engage in the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Warfare</hi> under Him who is ſtronger than the ſtrong Man armed.—And all with my uſual and affected Plainneſs of Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> THE Church and People of GOD have Enemies to Encounter.</p>
            <p>PARTICULAR Chriſtians have their Enemies, and meet with their Troubles in the World, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Perſonal Troubles both inward and outward; and ſometimes Domeſtick Troubles of one kind and another, too many, yea, and ſome of them <hi>too bad,</hi> to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited:—And beſides theſe, the People of GOD have oftentimes <hi>open</hi> and profeſſed Enemies to encounter; ſo that the Church on Earth may fitly be ſtiled the Church militant, to diſtinguiſh from the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant. It is true indeed, GOD's People do not delight in War, or to breed and continue Strifes with their Fellow-Mortals; No; but they are oftentimes obliged to ſtrive and fight, to kill or be killed.</p>

AND as for their Enemies <hi>at this Day,</hi> they are ſuch as are not only Enemies to their outward <hi>Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> ſeeking to impoveriſh them by preying on their Subſtance and making Spoil of their Eſtates; as alſo, Enemies to their <hi>Liberty,</hi> ſeeking to captivate and ſometimes to retain them in Slavery and cruel Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: But moreover, they are Enemies alſo, to that pure and holy <hi>Religion</hi> which they make Profeſſion of, and accordingly uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to bring the true Worſhippers to a falſe Way and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worſhip, even to pay divine Homage unto Creatures not able to help and ſave: Yea, they would deſtroy, if they could, even to the Foundation, ſuch as have not their Mark, and do diſclaim the <hi>Pope'</hi>s Supremacy; their Language is much like that of the Children of <hi>Edom</hi> in the Day of <hi>Jeruſalem'</hi>s Trouble, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 7. <hi>Raſe it, raſe it even to the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And this leads me to ſay, that they are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the very <hi>Lives</hi> of GOD's People: Their tender Mercies are Cruelty, and that the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are inſtructed, and do embrace it as an Article of their Creed, That to deſtroy Proteſtants is to do GOD and the Church good Service.</p>
            <p>AND truly, not only now, but even <hi>all along,</hi> the Church of GOD has had her Enemies, namely, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> of old:—And as for the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, they were perſecuted by the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors, at no leſs than <hi>Ten</hi> ſeveral Periods; which were no ſooner over, but the <hi>Arians</hi> aroſe, who altho' they called themſelves Chriſtians, yet perſecuted the Orthodox worſe than ever profeſſed <hi>Pagans</hi> had done; inſomuch, that the Church was in imminent Hazard of being ſwallowed up by that Flood. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Antichriſt</hi> aroſe, known by the Name of the Man of Sin, who has perſecuted more than all that were before him: Yea, and as the Quarrel between
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004788_0009_100DECDB65CA4160"/>
the Kingdom of GOD and the Kingdom of Satan among Men, commenced from the Day of the firſt and grand Apoſtacy, ſo we may depend upon it, that as long as there is a <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> there will be Days of Trouble to the Church of GOD on Earth.</p>
            <p>AND now, If it be enquired, <hi>Who</hi> it is that ſtirs up Men to appear as Enemies to the Church of GOD? I reply; That the <hi>LORD of Hoſts</hi> orders and over rules in this Matter: The Sword is one of GOD's ſore Judgments; and agreably, we often read, that it was the LORD who ſtirred up one Nation and another to vex and diſturb his People <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And even ſo it is at <hi>this</hi> Day.—But then, it is proper to add, that altho' the Enemies of GOD's People ſeek to impoveriſh and even to extirpate them, yet, the moſt High has wiſe and good Ends herein: He does it for his own <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> to magnify his Name, and to make glorious his Attributes, and more eſpecially his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> for hereby he clearly and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully teſtifies his Hatred of Sin, and his ſore Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt Sinners: Alſo at ſuch a Time, he takes the Opportunity to glorify his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> in preſerving his Church amidſt ſo many Dangers, which may well be look'd upon as one of the great Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of divine Providence, and even like the Buſh burning and yet not conſumed: Yea, and I may truly add, that the People of GOD <hi>themſelves</hi> are wont to glorify him in Days of Adverſity more than at other Times: In the primitive State of the Chriſtian Church, which was a Time of much Tribulation, how greatly was the Kingdom of CHRIST advanced, and his intereſt promoted in the World, beyond what it was when a proſperous State came on.—In a Word, GOD Almighty's Intent is not to deſtroy his Church, No, but rather that the Faith and Patience, Courage and Fidelity of his Servants may for a Seaſon be prov'd and improv'd, and be found to Praiſe and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004788_0010_100DECDD2F300078"/>
Honour and Glory: And doubtleſs, the Judge of all the Earth is <hi>Righteous</hi> in theſe his Diſpenſations, for the very beſt of Men need to be purged that ſo they may bring forth more Fruit; and as for the People of GOD in general, they ſtand in need of Correction in Order to their Reformation.—And it may not be amiſs to add, that the glorious God has an Eye herein to his People's <hi>Enemies</hi> alſo, even to weaken and waſte, and ſometimes utterly to deſtroy them, or a conſiderable Branch of their Power.</p>
            <p>HENCE then we may <hi>infer,</hi> That External Peace and Proſperity is not a ſure Evidence of a true Church.—Some have been too apt to break Charity with particular Perſons, becauſe they have been exerciſed with many and grievous afflictions in the World; <hi>Job'</hi>s <hi>Friends</hi> (for Inſtance) were inclined to cenſure and even condemn him on this very Account, but they were upon a wrong Foundation, and were ſoon convinced of it: And truly, it was Matter of Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to the holy <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> to obſerve, that, ordinarily, good People had a larger Share of Trouble diſpenſed to them than others had, "until he went into the Sanctuary of GOD, where he ſoon underſtood what was to be the End of the wicked, namely, that they were exalted, that ſo their Fall might be the more grievous and infamous."—And as it is a Truth with reſpect to particular Perſons, that the Righteous may be in Adverſity, and the Wicked in Proſperity, ſo alſo as to <hi>Societies;</hi> and therefore, a true Church may be afflicted and perſecuted, and even almoſt deſtroyed; and at the ſame Time, a falſe Church may be in great Power and Splendor.—If we <hi>review</hi> the State of the Church of GOD under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and how grievouſly was ſhe afflicted. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 1, 2, 3. "Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth may Iſrael now ſay; many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth,—the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004788_0011_100DECE1829623D0"/>
Plowers plowed upon my Back, they made long their Furrows." And ſo, if we conſider <hi>again</hi> the State of the Church under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> we ſhall find, that many a Time "ſhe was killed all the Day long, and, for CHRIST'S ſake, was counted as Sheep for the Slaughter." The Primitive Chriſtians (tho' in Reality, the beſt, yet) were repreſented to the World as the very worſt of Men, and accordingly, unto them was given the moſt barbarous Treatment; ſo that the Continuance of the true Chriſtian Religion down to this Day, deſerves, as was before noted, to be look'd upon as a ſtanding Miracle: Yea, when we revolve in our Minds, how Earth and Hell combin'd, what a mighty Force was raiſed, what Books were written, and what Laws were made, againſt the Church, even in its Infancy, we muſt needs ſay, It is the LORD'S doing that ſhe is preſerved, and it ought to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our Eyes: Behold, "This is GOD'S He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, which hath been as a ſpeckled Bird, and which all the Birds round about have been, and ſtill are, againſt:" Nor may the Church expect to be at Reſt for any conſiderable Space of Time together, until the Man of Sin be taken out of the Way.—True indeed, it was the Expectation of the generality of GOD's ancient People, that the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would be a Temporal Kingdom, attended with worldly Pomp and Power, and that all Nations would, ſpeedily after his appearing, be ſubdued under him, and that there would be and continue to be a univerſal Peace; and not only ſo, but moreover, that the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> would be Chief and Princeſs among the Nations: But, this was no other than a vain Dream, for altho' it is true, that there was an univerſal Peace in the Empire when the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was born, and therefore the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was then ſhut; yet, our Saviour himſelf expreſly ſaid, "My Kingdom is not of this World," and cautioned
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004788_0012_100DECE3B403CFA8"/>
his Diſciples, ſaying, "Think not that I am come to ſend Peace," i. e. External Peace and Proſperity: Yea, and he foretold, "that there would be great Commotions among the Nations, Wars, and Rumours of Wars," which Prediction of his has been ſince abundantly verified, and is ſo at <hi>this</hi> Day.—A way then with that falſe Poſition, namely, That External Peace and Grandeur is a ſure Note of the true Church:—And let not any vainly imagine, that by liſting under CHRIST'S Banner, they ſhall be exempt from outward Troubles, or get out of the reach of perſecuting Foes; No, No; for ſays our Saviour, "in the World you ſhall have Trouble;" and "who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow me:" Chriſtians muſt expect not only inward and ſpiritual, but alſo outward and bodily Troubles, even Troubles from the World as well as from the Fleſh and Devil: Which I here mention, not to diſcourage any of you from walking in the right Ways of the LORD, but that you may not be ſurprized when ſuch Days of Trouble come on, and to deſert that good Cauſe which you profeſs to eſpouſe: Your beſt way is to expect and prepare for Troubles of one kind and another, that ſo you may glorify GOD in and under them, and may alſo ſee a glorious Iſſue of the ſame; that is, either be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>from</hi> them to your own ſpiritual Advantage, or be deliver'd <hi>by</hi> them out of the reach of all Evils both moral and paenal.—Which leads me to ſay, Oh! How much more deſireable is <hi>Heaven</hi> than Earth! And, Oh! how ardently ſhould the Saints of the moſt High long to be there, and be giving all Diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure! You may be ſure that there are no Conteſts there; No; for the Inhabitants of that better Country are cordial Friends to one another, and unfeignedly delight in each other's Society. There is nothing at all to offend or
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004788_0013_100DECE7102DAD88"/>
diſturb you in that holy Mountain, nay, but there is Fulneſs of Joy and Pleaſures evermore; and good Reaſon for it, ſeeing the Saints ſhall be perfect in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and be confirm'd in that State.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the <hi>Second</hi> general Head, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That it is lawful, and ſometimes highly neceſſary, for the People of GOD, ſome of them at leaſt, to take up Arms and go forth to War.</p>
            <p>I HAVE not Time to prove this at large, neither is there ſo much Need of it, ſeeing it has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently done in your hearing, on the like Occaſion, at one Time and another: And therefore, I ſhall ſay in a few Words only:—And,</p>
            <p>THAT it is a Thing <hi>lawful</hi> on ſome Occaſions to go forth to War, is undeniable; inaſmuch as we not only find the People of GOD ſo doing in Days of old, but moreover, that they were directed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the moſt High himſelf to do ſo: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I need not ſtand to cite Texts of Scripture for the Proof of this; any Child that has read the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Part of the Holy Bible can't but know that there are very many to this Purpoſe: Neither is it counter-manded by any Text in the New-Teſtament. And,</p>
            <p>NOT only is it <hi>lawful,</hi> but ſometimes highly <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to go forth to War; namely, that ſo the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD may preſerve and defend the pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD among themſelves againſt bold Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: As alſo, that they may deliver ſuch as are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for Righteouſneſs ſake from violent Oppreſſors: And it is even ſometimes neceſſary for the recovering, and ſo for the defending of Lands and Goods; but rather for the defending of Lives and Liberties, and the recovering of Captives:—But then, when-ever we take up Arms, either for the Defence or the Recovery
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004788_0014_100DECEAF3B38110"/>
of our Cities and People, we ſhould learn to conſider them not only as ours, but as the Cities and People of our <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YEA, it may be ſometimes neceſſary for People to take up Arms againſt <hi>their own Country-men;</hi> I mean, againſt ſuch as go about to deſtroy the pure Religion, and to introduce and impoſe the worſhipping of <hi>falſe Gods.</hi>—Alſo, againſt ſuch as reſiſt public Juſtice, or thoſe who will not deliver up, but protect, notorious Offenders, and ſo prevent their receiving condign Puniſhment; for, ſuch Perſons are Enemies to a Country or Nation, and deſerve to be treated as ſuch: And it was for this Reaſon that the <hi>other</hi> Tribes in <hi>Iſrael</hi> made War with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> yea, and they had Warrant from GOD himſelf to do ſo.—Alſo, ſuch as wickedly rebel againſt their lawful Prince, and try to dethrone him, are to be ſubdued by Force of Arms: And for this Reaſon King <hi>David</hi> made War firſt againſt <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> and his Party; and afterwards againſt his Son <hi>Abſolom</hi> and thoſe that adher'd to him.—And in a Word, this is neceſſary, when a Nation cannot otherwiſe preſerve or recover its juſt Rights; and more eſpecially, when the Enemy is more bold and daring than common, and threatneth ſpeedily to waſte and deſtroy, and there is Information given of a mighty Hoſt either come, or coming forth on that Deſign.</p>
            <p>BUT without theſe, or ſome of theſe Grounds and Reaſons, the People of GOD may not, as I conceive, take up Arms for War: The Provocation muſt be juſt, and the Call of Providence clear, otherwiſe, by making War, People take a ready Courſe to bring Miſchief upon themſelves; even as King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> tho' a very good Man, yet was ſlain in Battle and his Army routed, when he <hi>too raſhly</hi> engaged againſt <hi>Pharaoh-necho,</hi> who had neither done, nor deſigned him any wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004788_0015_100DECEC79B5D978"/>
AND to what has been ſaid it may be proper to add, That it belongs to the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of a People to make and appoint a War: Men in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Capacity plainly tranſgreſs if they pretend to make a War, or knowingly do any Thing which leadeth thereunto, contrary to the Commandment, or without the Knowledge, of their Civil Rulers; That is to ſay, unleſs thoſe Rulers do ſo <hi>violate their Oath,</hi> as to become a People's <hi>avowed</hi> Enemies, and do very <hi>apparently</hi> join with ſuch as ſeek their Ruin: For, altho' I conſtantly teach "Submiſſion to the King as Supreme, and unto the Governour as unto him that is ſent," yet, I ſee no Reaſon to exhort Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to paſſive Obedience, and Non-Reſiſtance, in the <hi>utmoſt</hi> Latitude of the ſame.</p>
            <p>AND now, from what has been ſaid, we may ſee the Miſtake of ſuch, who affirm that <hi>every</hi> kind of War is unlawful: They chiefly urge the <hi>Sixth</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for the Proof of their Aſſertion; but as I conceive, this is not at all to the Purpoſe; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the Intent of that Law is to prevent our killing an <hi>honeſt</hi> Man, for his Money's ſake, and the like; as alſo, our ſlaying a Perſon <hi>privately,</hi> becauſe of ſome Wrong which he has done us, for the Magiſtrate is GOD's Miniſter to execute Judgment.—And, in a Word, This Precept was given in order to preſerve and maintain humane Society, by being tender of each other's Lives; but was never underſtood by the Church of GOD as enjoining them to ſpare the Lives of ſuch, who evidently ſeek to deſtroy their Comforts and their Lives too; for indeed, this would be, in effect, to deſtroy themſelves.—But then, it may not be thought amiſs for me to add, That as it cannot be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince will have Recourſe to the Sword until all other Remedies fail; ſo neither is it conſiſtent with our <hi>holy Religion,</hi> for People to proſéute a War with a Spirit of Malice
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004788_0016_100DECEF85F8E288"/>
and Hatred, and as tho' we took delight in diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls, unprepar'd for it, into Eternity. Violent Invaders and barbarous Oppreſſors may be puniſhed, yea, and put to Death too, but then all this ſhould be without Rancour and Malice in the Hearts of the Conquerors: Nay, we ought ſo far to love even our open Enemies, as to accept of any reaſonable Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; yea, and ſo as (ſuppoſe we are oblig'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Battle, then) to pray, that if any fall by our Hands, that GOD would be pleaſed to have Mercy on them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE next general Head is, that a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's Life is in very great Jeopardy, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>IT is very true indeed, that every Man's Life is expoſed, and that continually; for we have all of us forfeited our very Lives as well as the Comforts of the ſame: The Wages of Sin is Death, and it is of the LORD'S Mercies that we are not all conſum'd before this Day; even becauſe he delighteth not in the Death of Sinners, but waiteth that he may be gracious. Many, <hi>many</hi> Dangers does the moſt High deliver us out of, yea, and doubtleſs, many which at preſent we are not at all ſenſible of; we ought therefore to look upon our Preſervation in the World as a Wonder of divine Goodneſs, and to give GOD the Praiſe of it, and ſtudy to live to his Glory. Oh! ſeeing we live from Day to Day on the Fruits of his Bounty, let us live to his Glory, and not give him Reaſon ſtill to complain of us, that although "he has nouriſhed and brought us up, yet we rebel againſt him." Surely it becomes and concerns us all to be humble, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſincere in the Way of Well-doing, and always upon our Watch, as not knowing at what Hour our LORD will come: It is a preſumptuous boaſting of to Morrow, that occaſions Sinners to delay their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004788_0017_100DECF1A64D0208"/>
Repentance, until they have neither Heart nor Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for it.</p>
            <p>BUT then, all will grant that ſome Men's Lives are more expoſed than others, and theſe at ſome Times more than at others; and a Soldier's Life in particular, and that more eſpecially in the Field of Battle. This is a Time when many, <hi>very</hi> many are ſlain, and one ſeems to be in hazard as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> moſt probably, conſider'd himſelf in the Quality of a Soldier, and as a Man of War, when he ſaid as in Pſal. 119, 109. <hi>My Soul is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in mine Hand.</hi> Q. D. There is but a Step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and Death; and I look upon my Life to be in as great Danger, "as a valuable Treaſure is of being violently taken away, which a Man carries <hi>in his Hand:</hi>" And yet, this Man of GOD did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, either in the open Field, or by the Treachery of a diſſembling Courtier, but in his Bed, and amidſt his Friends: But, alas! Who can ſay, how many <hi>Thouſands,</hi> and <hi>Ten Thouſands,</hi> have come to their End by the Sword; ſome diſpatch'd in a Moment, and others ſoon giving up the Ghoſt by Reaſon of their mortal Wounds.</p>
            <p>BUT I need not ſtand upon the Proof of ſo <hi>evident</hi> a Truth; and therefore ſhall only add a few uſeful <hi>Reflections,</hi> and then proceed. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS teaches us that ſuch Men are <hi>diſtinguiſhingly</hi> favour'd, whoſe Lives are preſerv'd in the Day of Battle: They and their Friends with them ſhould pay a very grateful Acknowledgment to the Preſerver of Men, not only for what Exploit may have been done by their own and other Men's Hands, but alſo for that Preſervation and Deliverance, which they in particular have experienced. Oh! never learn to ſay after the Manner of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> It was our good <hi>Fortune</hi> to eſcape with our Lives; but extol the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004788_0018_100DECF3B3CA06B0"/>
Name of GOD, and ſhout forth his Praiſes, becauſe he hath covered your Heads in the Day of Battle. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. HENCE let Soldiers be prevailed with to realize their Danger <hi>before</hi> they go forth to War. You may not imagine, that you are going, at ſuch a Time, only to take a Walk, or a Voyage; nor that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition will be no other than a pleaſant Diverſion; Nay,—but expect to meet with Hardſhips, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well not only the Fatigue, but alſo the Hazard; and be perſwaded "to ſet both Houſe and Heart in Order, as not knowing but you may die and not live."—Yea, and while you are <hi>in</hi> the Service, keep up a lively Senſe of your Danger, and indulge not (like many others) a ſecure, heedleſs Frame of Spirit; but very often, and in the moſt humble Manner, reſign your Lives into the Hands of your Redeemer; and not your Lives only, but even your very Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him in the Exerciſe of Repentance towards GOD, and of Faith in our LORD JESUS CHRIST, earneſtly entreating, that they, when-ever call'd for, may ſee his Salvation: And in an humble Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, "be of good Courage, and play the Men, for your People and for the Cities of your GOD, and the LORD do that which ſhall ſeem good in his Sight."</p>
            <p>AND let me go on to ſay, Oh! how very deſireable is it, that even <hi>all</hi> ſuch as go forth to War be <hi>Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded</hi> Perſons?—Soldiers ſhould not only labour to be ſatisfied, that a War be begun and proſecuted on juſt Grounds, (or at leaſt, that the Grounds be not unjuſt and oppreſſive) and then be <hi>willing</hi> to go forth in the Service; but moreover, they ought to be giving all Diligence that they may be <hi>actually</hi> prepar'd for Death.—Say not, this is to act the Part of <hi>Cowards:</hi> For truly, it is not only the Way to die in Peace,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004788_0019_100DECF65958BD30"/>
but moreover, it is the very beſt Courſe to become <hi>valiant</hi> in fighting: The good Man, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> will certainly make the beſt Soldier; ſo then, all ſuch as would be good Soldiers let them become good Men; that is, let them repent of their Sins, and make their Peace with GOD, and War againſt their Luſts, becauſe theſe war againſt their Souls; for ſuch as theſe are (as I ſaid) moſt likely to be truly valiant in Battle. Death, you know, is ſtyled the King of Terrors; well then, he who can with ſome Comfort look Death in the Face, needs not much fear the facing of any other Enemy: The religious <hi>Heroes</hi> who were very famous for Exploits, became (as is obſerv'd in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) valorous and victorious <hi>by Faith:</hi> For, "this emboldens Men's Minds by looking unto Things not ſeen, and by deriving Strength from above; yea, and it engages the LORD of Hoſts on their Side."</p>
            <p>AND ſuffer me to add, That as I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that neither our gracious <hi>Sovereign,</hi> nor his Excellency our <hi>Governour,</hi> will knowingly honour any Man with a Commiſſion, who is <hi>noted</hi> among Men for <hi>perſiſting</hi> in ſome <hi>foul Immorality;</hi> ſo I ſhould think, it highly concerns all ſuch Gentlemen, who ſhall receive, or have received Commiſſions for proſecuting the War, to ſee to it likewiſe, that they don't (if poſſible to prevent it) admit any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Character to ſerve as Soldiers under them; or, if they be admitted, then to <hi>oblige</hi> them to reform their Manners, "and for this End, it <hi>Lenitives</hi> will not anſwer, then to diſpenſe the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives</hi> of Martial Diſcipline;" and this not only in Pity to ſuch Men, but alſo in Kindneſs to the whole Company or Army, leſt GOD Almighty be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by Reaſon of the Offences of thoſe bold Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and their Commander's Connivance at the ſame, to deliver all up to the Will of the Enemy.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004788_0020_100DECF8B14B08A8"/>
We find in <hi>Joſh. 7.</hi> That the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was put to Flight before the Men of <hi>Ai</hi> becauſe of the Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of <hi>Achan:</hi> True indeed, his Treſpaſs was great, for it was Sacrilege, which is the converting to a private Uſe, that which is devoted to the Glory of GOD; but then, this Sin of his was <hi>unknown</hi> to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and moſt probably to the <hi>People</hi> too, and yet they were forced to flee before their Enemies. Is it reaſonable then to expect, that ſuch Commanders ſhall proſper, who are <hi>fully 'acquainted</hi> with the <hi>foul</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of theſe and thoſe private Soldiers, and that they <hi>perſiſt</hi> therein, and yet admit them to join in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle againſt the Enemy.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS you'll ſay, if this Doctrine be received, we ſhall have but <hi>few</hi> Soldiers indeed: To which I <hi>reply,</hi> that if a due Care was taken about this Matter, it would moſt probably promote a Reformation of Manners both in the Army and Navy, and be a Means of Reſtraint unto many Perſons, and to thoſe at leaſt who delight in nothing ſo much as to ſerve in the Wars: And as for ſuch who refuſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, what great Matter of Service can be expected from them? Will not a <hi>few</hi> Men under the Smiles of Heaven, do far greater Exploits than <hi>ten times</hi> that Number, who (the moſt of them) by their bold Tranſgreſſions, are continually bidding <hi>Defiance</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf?</p>
            <p>AND the Truth is, it becomes and concerns even a <hi>whole Land,</hi> before the Hoſt goeth forth to War, to humble themſelves, and turn to the LORD, and to implore the Pardon of their Sins, and the divine Preſence to be vouchſafed to their Forces; and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not to carry them hence. It is worthy of our Obſervation, "That the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were defeated in their <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Battle with the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> but in the <hi>third</hi> Engagement they obtain'd a compleat Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for now at laſt, they came up to their Duty
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004788_0021_100DECFB6914B170"/>
which they had before neglected: Indeed, they had before enquired of the LORD, <hi>Who ſhall go up firſt?</hi> And then again, <hi>Shall we go up?</hi> But the <hi>Third</hi> Time they <hi>faſted</hi> and <hi>prayed,</hi> and <hi>implored</hi> the divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and <hi>then</hi> they had the deſired Succeſs." And doubtleſs, the People of GOD ſhould alſo, in <hi>theſe</hi> Days, ſeek, and continue to ſeek, his Face in the Ways of his Appointment, as they would expect his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to be with them.—A People's Cauſe may be good, and their Number great, but altho' they have both Right and Strength on their Side, yet theſe may not be depended upon, to the Neglect of the Duty of ſeeking, in the moſt ſolemn Manner, the Preſence and Favour of the moſt High. Certainly, we have abundant Reaſon to humble our ſelves before GOD, becauſe our Nation and Land, and our ſelves among others, have provoked Him to ſtir up a Nation of <hi>ſo mean a Character,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </note> to diſturb and impoveriſh us at the Rate they do: And O! that our Days of Prayer with Faſting, may be always duly attended, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we have to do with that GOD who will not be mocked, and who hearkens whether Perſons ſpeak aright; that is to ſay, whether <hi>each</hi> one for himſelf enquireth, ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> And then breaketh off from Sin, and caſteth away his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and returneth unto the LORD. Oh! that there were ſuch an Heart in us! "Then would GOD quickly ſubdue our Enemies, and turn his Hand againſt our Adverſaries; but our Times would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure."</p>
            <p>COME we now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt general Head, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That when a Number of Men do, in a juſt Cauſe, and there be Neceſſity for it, jeopard their Lives to the Death,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004788_0022_100DECFD77B2C230"/>
in Behalf of their Country, it affords Matter of Thankſgiving unto GOD, and Commendation to ſuch Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS is Matter of <hi>Commendation</hi> unto ſuch Men. True indeed, it cannot be a pleaſant Exerciſe, in it ſelf conſider'd, to any, but only thoſe who are loſt to the common Principles of Humanity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Fellow-Creatures: But yet, for Perſons to engage in Battle with an Eye to the Will and Glory of GOD, and for the Preſervation of a Town or Country, <hi>this is Praiſe-worthy:</hi> They take, as we ſuppoſe, the moſt proper and effectual Method to ſecure and defend the Liberties, Properties, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe is precious unto a People: And without Doubt, all will readily acknowledge, That when <hi>ſome particular Perſons</hi> from among themſelves, do <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offer</hi> to expoſe and jeopard their Lives, for thoſe good Ends and Conſiderations, they do <hi>worthily</hi> in their Day.—And as this has a direct Tendency to preſerve a Country from Ruin, and to prolong the Lives and Liberties of the People, ſo alſo to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Enemy; or at leaſt to ſubdue them ſo far as to bring them to ſubmit to proper Terms.</p>
            <p>AND if I may be allow'd to make a particular Mention of the <hi>Aboriginal Natives,</hi> who have at one Time and another, from Generation to Generation, even compelled the People of this Land to take up Arms againſt them: There is (as I conceive) no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſo likely to ſubdue, or to humble them, as <hi>to March forth in Queſt of them;</hi> for, by ſo doing, they are not only prevented coming into our Towns, and ſlaughtering, or captivating the Inhabitants, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Spoil of their Goods; but moreover, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weary of their uſual Places of Reſort, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they can be no where ſecure, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under a Neceſſity to petition for Peace.—And
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004788_0023_100DECFFAE6B58B8"/>
we may be ſure, that <hi>ſuch Men</hi> as ſhall (having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Encouragement) <hi>voluntarily offer themſelves</hi> for this Service, if there be again Occaſion for it, (which we pray GOD to forbid!) are moſt likely to trace the Enemy carefully, and fight them valiantly: And the Truth of all this, I think, appears from the Inſtance of the <hi>brave</hi> LOVEWELL and his <hi>reſolute Soldiers,</hi> in the <hi>laſt Indian War,</hi> whoſe Activity and Courage, I doubt not, was what, under Heaven, brought that War to a Period.</p>
            <p n="2">2. AND as it is Matter of Commendation to ſuch Men, ſo alſo, and indeed much more, of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> unto <hi>God;</hi> for ſurely, it is <hi>He</hi> who inclines and ſpirits them unto this difficult and dangerous Service: Yea, and it looks like a very <hi>ſignal Smile</hi> of Providence upon a Land, when a Number of its Inhabitants are ſo diſpos'd: It may be <hi>hoped</hi> that the moſt High has not determin'd ſpeedily to abandon ſuch a Country, and to give it up to the Will of the Enemy; but that there is Mercy ſtill <hi>in Reſerve</hi> for ſuch a People.</p>
            <p>BUT I need not enlarge.—Only let me add a few Words by Way of <hi>Improvement:</hi> And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. LEARN that ſuch Men are worthy of Blame, who after they have engaged in this Service do <hi>deſert</hi> and forſake it: Much better it is not to enter upon it, than afterwards to abſcond, and ſo relinquiſh the Service of GOD and their Country.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS alſo teaches us, That it is juſt Matter of <hi>Lamentation,</hi> when ſuch Men as <hi>offer themſelves</hi> to this kind of Service, are either ſlain in Battle, or taken off in the Camp by ſome fatal Malady: They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Honour from their Country, even that their Fall be lamented: The Loſs thereby ſuſtained is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and very ungrateful as well as ſtupid are
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004788_0024_100DED0142489070"/>
ſuch a People, who do not ſorrowfully reſent it: And I wiſh, we may not have many ſuch Deaths e'er long to mourn over<note n="*" place="bottom">Preached <hi>at the Time</hi> of the Expedition to the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies.</hi>
               </note>. And further,</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHAT we have heard may afford <hi>ſome</hi> Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Mind to thoſe among us, who have been, or may be, in this Way, bereaved of deſireable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives: It ſhould be <hi>ſome Allay</hi> to your Grief, to conſider, that theſe your departed Friends died in the Service of GOD and their Country, and therefore died honourably, and will be remembred with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as their Country's Friends and Benefactors: Yea, and if they were good Chriſtians, then the LORD of Hoſts himſelf will graciouſly reward their Deſires and Endeavours to ſerve his Cauſe, and to advance his Intereſt in the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHAT we have heard may alſo teach us, That it is but juſt and reaſonable, that ſuch as tarry at Home be <hi>helpful,</hi> all the Ways they can, to thoſe who go forth to War.—And more eſpecially in theſe <hi>two</hi> Ways, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By <hi>Prayer</hi> to GOD on their Behalf. We are obliged by the Bonds both of Nature and Religion to pray one for another; but in a peculiar Manner for thoſe of our Friends, who <hi>voluntarily</hi> hazard their Health, their Limbs, and even their very Lives, in the Country's Service: Pray therefore for them, that the LORD would go forth with them, to direct and ſafe-guard them, and to make them both valorous and victorious: We may not depend on their Conduct and Courage, their Number and Strength; No, No; but ſeek to engage the LORD of Hoſts on our Side; and if he be for us, who can be againſt us? This is
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004788_0025_100DED04C5B6AD50"/>
a ſafe, a cheap, and eaſy Way of helping them, and even the <hi>Handmaids</hi> of the LORD may in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be very helpful in a Time of War. And truly, we ſhall all be very unkind to our Soldiers, yea, and to our ſelves too, if we either neglect or trifle in this Exerciſe. And,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) WE muſt <hi>reform</hi> our Manners as well as pray for Succeſs. See for this, Deut. 23. 9. <hi>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked Thing:</hi> Not then only, but then without fail: Not ſome only, but all the People are hereby enjoined to keep themſelves, not from ſome only, but from every wicked Thing.—And it concerns <hi>us all,</hi> at <hi>this</hi> Day, carefully to obſerve it, left GOD be provok'd to give the Victory to our Enemies. A Time of War, we all ſay, ſhould be a Time of Reformation; and truly, we may not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expect the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to hear and anſwer our Prayers for Succeſs, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 3.) Is it not our Wiſh, that GOD would be graciouſly preſent with our Brethren and Neighbours in the <hi>preſent</hi> War? But now, we do not in a <hi>ſuitable</hi> Manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this Thing, and our Prayers are no better than Mockery, unleſs we put away Iniquity far from our Tabernacles, and alſo endeavour every one to keep himſelf from his own Iniquity: Our Sins (<hi>Sirs!</hi>) are our moſt deadly Enemies; theſe war againſt our own Souls; yea, and they are GOD's Enemies too, and conſequently to repent of them, and to return unto the LORD, is the very beſt Way to proſper; for, as King <hi>David</hi> acknowledged, "Thine, O LORD, is the Greatneſs, and the Power, and the Victory."—And if there be any other Way wherein we can ſhow Kindneſs to ſuch as are already gone, or that may hereafter go forth in this Service, whether by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a freſh Recruit of Men, or of Proviſions, or by
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004788_0026_100DED06E54E6A40"/>
miniſtring Relief to the ſick and wounded, and the like; O! let us not be wanting herein, but readily embrace the Opportunity; for both Humanity and Juſtice demand it of us.—And as for their being well rewarded, our honoured Rulers will not be Strait-handed in that Article: And Oh! that <hi>Heaven</hi> may graciouſly recompenſe them infinitely above what is in the Power of Man to do! To proceed,</p>
            <p n="5">5. IF ſuch do well who <hi>freely</hi> jeopard their Lives when there is juſt Occaſion for it, then it is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable for any of us to go about to <hi>diſcourage</hi> ſuch as <hi>offer</hi> themſelves, and are <hi>ſuitably qualified</hi> for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: By thoſe that are ſuitably qualified, I intend, ſuch as are capable of weighing Matters, and acting prudently, and who, being Perſons of a ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, are likely to undergo the Hardſhips of the Service, and who are Men of Courage and Activity, and are ſtrongly inclined to this kind of Service; and eſpecially, if they are alſo <hi>Religious</hi> Men: Yea, and ſuch as are not bred to War (as the Phraſe is) may not be diſcourag'd from going forth on this Occaſion, they being ſpirited for ſuch above any other Service, and having obtain'd a competent Degree of Skill for that End, alſo able to endure Hardneſs; and deſerving the good Character of <hi>Sober-minded</hi> Perſons: Thus, <hi>Deborah</hi> in our Context, Verſe 14. takes particular Notice, <hi>that out of Zebulon came thoſe to Battle, who handled the Pen of the Writer.</hi> And in a Word, to diſcourage ſuitable Perſons from going forth on ſuch an Occaſion, is to prefer a private before the public Intereſt, which is a Thing that may not be indulged: Yea, and tender <hi>Parents</hi> have ſometimes a Call to deny themſelves in this Article; as, when their Sons diſcover that they have a very great Inclination to this kind of Service:—And yet, I would take the Opportunity to ſay unto <hi>Children</hi> who are ſo inclin'd,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004788_0027_100DED091B7C9B18"/>
that I cannot adviſe you to break away, contrary to your Parents Mind: If they <hi>cannot</hi> be prevailed with to give their Conſent, I ſhould think you had better deny your ſelves, and by ſo doing, <hi>honour</hi> your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> who are the Inſtruments of your Being, and by whom, under GOD, you have been alſo nouriſhed and brought up.</p>
            <p n="6">6. and <hi>laſtly,</hi> I ſhall offer a few Words by Way of <hi>Direction</hi> to ſuch as may hereafter <hi>offer</hi> themſelves to be improv'd in this Service. And,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) BE <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> in this Matter: Not only pretend to it, but be ſo in the Sight of him who ſearcheth all Hearts: It is not proper to go forth meerly to gratify ſome particular Friend or Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of yours, but let your own Spirits be free and chearful in this Affair, that you may be properly <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> and be reckon'd by Heaven as ſuch. We read, "that the LORD loveth the chearful Giver," or, him who chearfully diſpoſeth of Part of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to pious and charitable Uſes; how much more, the Man who chearfully hazards his <hi>Life</hi> in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of GOD and his Country.—And it may be proper here to add, That ſuch Men as are pointed out by lawful Authority, and <hi>preſt</hi> by Order of the ſame, to go forth in this Service, they ſhould not only, either go themſelves, or provide others to go in their Room, but they ſhould do it <hi>willingly;</hi> for they ought to look on themſelves as call'd by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to aſſiſt in the War, either in Perſon or by Proxy; and therefore may not ſo much as in their Hearts decline the Service, leſt they expoſe themſelves to that <hi>bitter Curſe</hi> denounced in our <hi>Context, againſt ſuch as came not to the Help of the LORD againſt the mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:004788_0028_100DED0A9DBFE7E0"/>
(2.) GET well arm'd, as alſo well inſtructed in the Arts of War.—Be <hi>well arm'd</hi> with Inſtruments proper for the Service: Counſel and Strength for War are not enough without Weapons of War. We find in our Context, Verſe 8. <hi>That there was not Shield or Spear ſeen among Four Thouſand in Iſrael:</hi> And it was doubtleſs Policy in their Oppreſſors thus to diſarm them, well knowing that unarmed Men are quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Service, and an eaſy Prey to the Enemy: And, let your Armour be Armour of <hi>Proof,</hi> ſuch as you know to be good by your own Experience; and ſuch as you are uſed to, and ſo can the more readily manage it.—And labour to be <hi>expert</hi> in handling your Weapons; ſkilful and dexterous, that ſo you may be able the better to defend your ſelves, and annoy your Adverſaries.—And I may not omit to adviſe you, to get well acquainted with the <hi>Way and Manner</hi> of the Enemy which you are to encounter, and <hi>how</hi> they commonly manage their Battles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the plain and open Field, or elſe by lurking in Swamps, and behind the Trees of the Woods, watching for an Opportunity to diſcharge unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon you; that ſo your Conduct may be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—And I ſhall ſtill further add, That what Nation ſoever you ſhall be called forth to oppoſe and war againſt, you may not imagine that <hi>Stratagems</hi> of War are unlawful. We find in that fore-cited 20th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Judges,</hi> "That notwithſtanding GOD had given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> an Aſſurance of Succeſs, yet, they were not remiſs and negligent, nay, but improv'd the beſt of their Skill for the effecting of what GOD had promiſed: In the two firſt Engagements they thought it needleſs to uſe any Art, or to form any Stratagem; but the <hi>third</hi> Time they made Uſe of ſome Policy, for they ſet Lyers in wait, and laid an Ambuſh, and ſo gain'd the Point, even as their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> had gain'd <hi>Ai,</hi> and that by divine Direction
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004788_0029_100DED0E05694100"/>
too." <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8. So that Piety and warlike Policy do very well conſiſt together, and may not be look'd upon as preventive or ſubverſive of each other.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Put your Truſt</hi> in the <hi>Hope of Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Saviour thereof.</hi> Truſt in him to lead you forth and inſpire you with Courage; to teach your Hands to War, and to cover your Heads in the Day of Battle, and to grant you the deſired Succeſs. Tho' you be ever ſo well armed, yet truſt not in your Armour; and tho' ever ſo well inſtructed in the Arts of War, and fully acquainted with the Manner of the Enemy as to their Way of Fighting, yet do not truſt to your own Skill; and tho' ever ſo void of Fear, yet truſt not to your own Proweſs and Courage; and ſuppoſe your Leaders, as alſo your Fellow-Soldiers be ever ſo expert and valorous, yet do not place your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them; "For it is better to truſt in the LORD than to put Confidence in Men, yea, than to to put Confidence in Princes." I beſeech you to realize, that there is abſolute Neceſſity of the <hi>divine Conduct</hi> to lead and guide an Army, and ſo alſo a Navy, in ſuch an important Affair; for what is even an <hi>Achitophel</hi> but a Fool, and what is his Counſel but Fooliſhneſs, when GOD hideth Counſel from him? Yea, and there needs the divine Preſence alſo to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> Men's Hands and to <hi>encourage</hi> their Hearts <hi>in</hi> the Day of Battle, becauſe they have neither Strength nor Courage at Command; Self-Confidence therefore is but vain Confidence, "and he that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in himſelf is a <hi>Fool;</hi> yea, <hi>curſed</hi> is the Man that truſteth in Man, and that maketh Fleſh his Arm; but <hi>bleſſed</hi> is the Man that <hi>truſteth</hi> in the <hi>LORD,</hi> and whoſe Hope the LORD is."—In a Word, you muſt labour (as I ſaid before) to be well accoutred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for War, but yet, think not that your <hi>Gun</hi> or your <hi>Sword</hi> ſhall ſave you; No; but when you
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004788_0030_100DED0F87AE1080"/>
               <hi>March,</hi> let your Truſt be in GOD to direct your Path, and to ſafe-guard your Perſons; and when you <hi>Watch,</hi> put your Truſt in the Keeper of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who never ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth; and when you <hi>Fight,</hi> let your Truſt be ſtill in him to fight for you: And finally, by Faith in Prayer be caſting all your Burdens on the LORD, and he will care for you.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) SEE that your <hi>Aim</hi> and <hi>End</hi> be <hi>right</hi> in this hazardous Undertaking. Oh! do not aim chiefly at the gaining either of Honour, or Wealth; for what will it profit a Man, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? And how can you expect any other but the Loſs of <hi>that,</hi> if your Hearts be not right with GOD? Go not therefore for Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, but of a <hi>ready</hi> Mind, and with an hearty Deſire to ſerve GOD and your Country; namely, by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pull down and deſtroy the Kingdom of <hi>Satan</hi> in the World, and ſo to make more Room for the Growth and Increaſe of the Kingdom of CHRIST.—Not that you may imagine, that the moſt High can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accompliſh his Purpoſes without you; No; but yet <hi>freely</hi> put your ſelves into his Hands, to be made Uſe of as Inſtruments for the ſubduing his Foes, and making the ſame to become his Footſtool.</p>
            <p>WHAT ſhall I ſay more?—Keep your ſelves from every wicked Thing: That is to ſay, Keep your <hi>Hearts</hi> with all Diligence; as alſo your <hi>Eyes</hi> that you may not covet; and your <hi>Hands</hi> that they may do Violence to no Man; your <hi>Tongues</hi> that they may neither curſe Men, nor take the Name of the LORD your GOD in vain, nor utter any Thing falſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful; ſhun <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Luxury;</hi> and keep holy the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> as you would expect to proſper (ſo far, I mean, as is conſiſtent with your own Defence and Preſervation): And be not of a <hi>mutinous</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable Spirit; but keep your <hi>Places,</hi> obſerve good
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004788_0031_100DED110D22A008"/>
Orders, and obey ſuch as are, or may be, ſet over you; and keep <hi>faithful</hi> to one another: Be of one Heart, and ſtand by each other for mutual Relief and Succour; and fail not to keep a good <hi>Watch,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how many Lives depend upon it. (<hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 11.) And above all, get and keep in <hi>good Terms</hi> with the <hi>LORD of Hoſts;</hi> and behave in all Reſpects, as becomes thoſe whoſe Souls are continually in your Hands, and yet, your Times are not ſo, but in the Hands of the LORD of the whole Earth.—Oh! be prevailed with to be in the Fear of the LORD every Day, yea and all the Day, for <hi>in that</hi> there is ſtrong Confidence; but on the other Side, Sin takes off the Edge of Valour, and Guilt will make Men Cowards: All ſuch as would look Death in the Face without Terror, muſt keep Peace with GOD, and preſerve a Conſcience void of Offence.—And finally, when-ever you ſhall prove <hi>victorious,</hi> give GOD the Praiſe, and in Token thereof, devote a Part of the Spoil you ſhall take from the Enemy, a <hi>Tenth</hi> at leaſt, to pious and charitable Uſes, after the Example of faithful <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as you may find it recorded in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20.</p>
            <p>AND now, Brethren, our Prayer for you is, that when you go forth to War, then "the LORD JESUS, the Captain of our Salvation and the LORD our Righteouſneſs may go before you, and the Glory of the LORD be your Rere-ward."</p>
            <p>AND thus having ſpoken to the <hi>Four</hi> General Heads,</p>
            <p>I AM now to proceed, as I propoſed, to offer a few Words by Way of <hi>Addreſs,</hi> with all due Reſpect, to the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Honourable Company,</hi> who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us hither this Day;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH what has been ſaid is deſign'd prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, tho' not ſolely, for you, and you have ſo

            <p>YOU are not ignorant, that <hi>three</hi> Years <hi>over</hi> and above a <hi>Century</hi> are now paſs'd and gone ſince the giving forth of your <hi>Charter,</hi> containing certain valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Privileges and Immunities; whereby it evidently appears, that the Honourable <hi>General Court,</hi> being willing to encourage a Military Spirit in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> did put great Honour upon this Company, even in the <hi>early</hi> Days of the Country; which, as it was a bright Inſtance of their Wiſdom and Goodneſs, ſo, we are now <hi>thankful</hi> to the moſt High, that the Reputation and Honour of this Company has been ſo well preſerved unto this Time; and <hi>the rather,</hi> becauſe I can't but think, this ſame has been a good Means of caſting the <hi>greater Dread</hi> upon thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are no Friends to our Religion, and envy us the Poſſeſſion of ſo good a Country:—Indeed, <hi>New-England</hi> in general has been famous abroad for the Spirit of Soldiery, and for ſetting apart ſeveral Days in a Year for Military Exerciſes; but, <hi>Sirs,</hi> Strangers as well as your own Country-men, all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge your ſelves to be the Flower and Choice of all our Forces: And we doubt not, but you will, the Smiles of Heaven continuing upon you, as we pray they may, ſtill preſerve the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Honourable Company,</hi> and keep alive our Hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it:—And in Order hereunto, there are <hi>Two</hi> Things which you will bear upon your Minds, and endeavour the Proſecution of.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Firſt</hi> is, <hi>The Original Deſign of forming the Artillery Company</hi> in this Town; even, that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the beſt Faſhion, and of exalted Stations in the Militia, in every Part of the Province, as well as Perſons of a lower Rank, might have the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to become more and more ſkilful in the Uſe of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004788_0033_100DED158E8721A8"/>
Martial Weapons.—You are very ſenſible, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, from the Appearance which you make this Day, that the happy Time is not yet come, wherein the Nations ſhall learn War no more; and therefore you judge it to be ſtill needful as well as lawful to know how to uſe the Sword and Muſket, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole Art of War in the various Parts of it, which, conſidering to whom I ſpeak, I need not go about to enumerate; you will therefore, I truſt, admit of ſcarce any Avocation, but will all, to a Man, conſtantly attend and diligently improve your Exerciſes at the appointed Seaſons for the ſame, and more eſpecially in <hi>this</hi> gloomy and dark Day; and that not only as a manly Diverſion, but, on purpoſe that you may be ſtill more expert for War, and ſo the better prepar'd (if there ſhould be Occaſion for it) either to Face the Enemy your ſelves, or to furniſh the Country with expert Commanders for that End; "Each of them reſembling the Son of a King."—And whereas it is <hi>now</hi> (as you well know) a Time of War, you will therefore the rather make Choice of ſuch Gentlemen, <hi>this Day,</hi> for your <hi>Officers,</hi> as are moſt capable of leading you, and are moſt likely by their own Example to inſpire you with Valour, and whom you have good Reaſon to think you can wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly fight under.—And now, if there was Need to add any Thing by Way of Encouragement to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Martial and Warlike Spirit, I ſhould only put you in Remembrance of what you are not unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with; namely, "That Skill and Experience in Arms has in all Ages been the Original of <hi>Nobility;</hi> and that many Perſons, even of mean Extraction, have, by Feats of Arms, riſen to the higheſt Honours which their Fellow-Soldiers were capable of conferring upon them."—But being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and many of you, to the Praiſe of GOD be it ſpoken, ſome of the firſt Rank, therefore a <hi>Goſpel</hi> Motive will be more
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004788_0034_100DED1855FB1EF8"/>
acceptable; namely, that hereby you will be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified for the ſpecial Service of <hi>The Man upon the Throne,</hi> who is no other than our <hi>LORD RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER,</hi> whom to ſerve is Honour indeed; and all whoſe faithful Servants and loyal Subjects ſhall be crown'd with Glory and Honour immortal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE <hi>other</hi> Thing which you will alſo bear in Mind, is, <hi>The true Deſign of ſetting up and ſtill upholding theſe your Anniverſary religious Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> Namely, that ſo <hi>your Military Exerciſes may be ſanctified by the Word of GOD and Prayer:</hi> And accordingly you will, doubtleſs, heedfully obſerve the good Inſtructions of the former, and follow our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with and for you, with your beſt Endeavours, that ſo you may not, any of you, occaſion any Blemiſh to your Profeſſion and Character, whether as Soldiers, or as Chriſtians; And therefore, will not only improve your Powers in order to excel in Military Skill, but alſo be upon your Watch that no corrupt Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may proceed out of your Mouths; and inſtead of approaching to the <hi>leaſt Degree</hi> either of <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> or <hi>Extravagancy,</hi> you will labour to be making a <hi>religious</hi> uſe of your Military Exerciſes, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are capable of being <hi>improved</hi> to very great Advantage in your <hi>Spiritual</hi> Warfare; and by ſo doing will ſet a very bright Example before the <hi>Militia</hi> of the <hi>whole Country,</hi> (whoſe Eyes are much upon you) even of all Chriſtian Vertues, as well as of Military Skill and Valour.—And truly, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I can't but hope, that you may be Inſtrumental to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the too general Abuſe of our <hi>public Trainings;</hi> for, the Officers and Soldiers in our ſeveral Towns cannot, I think, for Shame, do any other but improve ſuch Days to better Purpoſes than of late, when they ſhall behold your Order, and are given to underſtand, that even your whole Conduct both <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out of</hi> the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004788_0035_100DED1AC07514A8"/>
Field, is ſuch as well becomes <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soldiers.—I hope, <hi>Sirs,</hi> it may, and I have no Reaſon to think any other but it may, be truly ſaid concerning the Honourable <hi>Artillery Company</hi> on this Day, as I find it was, on the like Occaſion, juſt <hi>Fifty Years</hi> ago, namely, "Here is a large Band of Soldiers, among whom, this whole Day will not afford one Man drunk, nor one Oath ſworn, nor one Curſe drop'd, nor one obſervable Miſbehaviour."—Oh! go on, go on, to excel.—</p>
            <p>AND thus I have ſpoken to the <hi>Two</hi> Things which you are to bear in Mind:—And I need not enlarge—, for I make not the leaſt Doubt, but that you will, to a Man, preſerve and maintain a loyal Spirit and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards our rightful and gracious Sovereign KING GEORGE IId; As alſo, yield all due Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his <hi>Excellency;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Governour BELCHER, in whoſe Audience it was deliver'd.</note> as to him who perſonates His Majeſty <hi>among us.</hi>—Nor have we any Reaſon at all, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to think any other, but that Love to your <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> mightily prevails in you; and are perſwaded it will do ſo, to that Degree, as to conſtrain you voluntarily to devote your Eſtates, as alſo to <hi>jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardiſe</hi> and even ſacrifice your very <hi>Lives,</hi> for the Defence and Preſervation of the ſame, if Need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:—And how ſoon, <hi>My honoured Friends,</hi> your ſelves, and others with you, may be put upon <hi>ſo ſevere a Tryal,</hi> GOD Almighty knows; for when a People are ſeated on a good Soil, and are generally very ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to heap up Wealth, and are ſo far ſucceeded as to be reckon'd flouriſhing, and at the ſame Time noted for being at Diſcord among themſelves, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, they <hi>invite</hi> the Enemy to come in upon them like a Flood; and doubtleſs, they will the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>accept</hi> the Invitation, <hi>if there be no Danger of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004788_0036_100DED1CB938C208"/>
meeting with much Reſiſtance:</hi>—And if this be indeed the preſent State of <hi>this</hi> Province, "O! Tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> left the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> rejoice, and the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed triumph."—<hi>Triumph,</hi> I ſaid, as well they may, even <hi>before</hi> the Battle.—But why did I ſay, <hi>Tell it not abroad?</hi> Seeing the Enemy is already fully apprized of our <hi>Negligence,</hi> and juſtly have us in Deriſion on the Account thereof.—And indeed, we our ſelves ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acknowledge it to be a great Neglect, that the Province ſhould be, and remain for ſo long a Time, and more eſpecially in this Time of War, in ſo weak and unfortified a Poſture; but yet, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, People differ in their Sentiments as to the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, nor am I about to undertake to determine at whoſe Door it lies; but, I think, I can do no leſs than pray, that ſuch <hi>Light</hi> may break forth upon us, as may <hi>ſpeedily</hi> and effectually <hi>diſcover how</hi> to redreſs this Grievance; and that <hi>if</hi> any are Blame-worthy in the Matter, they may be convinc'd of it, <hi>whoever they be,</hi> and be led to the Diſcharge of that Duty, which they, in this Article, owe to GOD, their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country;</hi> and no longer leave ſo good a Land, and which has already coſt ſo much Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Naked and Defenceleſs.—Pray, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> miſtake me not, for I do not imagine, that it belongs to this <hi>Honourable Company</hi> to provide Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks for us; nor do I intend to ſay much more upon it; for if a Man <hi>at a Diſtance</hi> may be allowed to conjecture, I am inclin'd to think, that it is a very tender Point; however, I ſhall take the Opportunity, and as I conceive, without giving juſt Offence to any, to make my affectionate <hi>Moon</hi> to you on this Head, as one deeply concern'd for <hi>New-England's</hi> Welfare, and to ſay in one ſhort Sentence, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>I am heartily ſorry, that the Government can't unite in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for our neceſſary Defence; and do as heartily wiſh, that there may be no more Occaſion for this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004788_0037_100DED1F0C86DD08"/>
And I doubt not, but that each of you <hi>concur</hi> with me herein.—Not that I am come hither to teach you, that Means of Defence, ſuppoſe we were ever ſo well provided with them, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in; No, No; but yet, I think, all will grant, that it is High-handed Preſumption to live in the Neglect of proper Means, and at the ſame Time to expect Protection, unleſs we had a Promiſe made us of ſome miraculous Preſervation, which I hope none among us are ſo ignorant and unwiſe as to pretend to.</p>
            <p>BUT leſt any ſhould think that I diſcover more Zeal than Prudence, or, that I harp rather too long upon this String, I will <hi>ceaſe from Man,</hi> and direct mine Eye to an Over-ruling and All-governing <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidnece</hi> in this Matter: And, if our Day be almoſt expir'd, and our Part of the <hi>New-World</hi> (as <hi>America</hi> is ſometimes call'd) has ſinn'd away their Privileges, no Wonder that Things are thus, nay, but rather, that we are not all conſum'd:—You are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that we have already run out, ſince the laying the Foundation of <hi>Plymouth Colony</hi> (ſo called) <hi>One Hundred and Twenty Years</hi> compleat; (it ended the laſt Winter) which, you know, was the very Space of Time granted by Way of Reprieve to the <hi>Old World,</hi> to repent in: I <hi>don't</hi> mean, that it from hence <hi>neceſſarily</hi> follows, that <hi>our</hi> Years are <hi>certainly</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd and finiſh'd, and our Sands quite run down: And yet, if you will be at the Pains to conſult the Hiſtorical Part of the Holy Scriptures, you may eaſily learn from thence, that becauſe GOD's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People would not be reformed, neither by the Judgments of his Mouth nor of his Hand, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their Rebellion, therefore he caſt them off; yea, and this is written <hi>for our Warning;</hi> ſo that, without a Spirit of Prophecy, conſidering, that <hi>New-England</hi> has left her firſt Love, and not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004788_0038_100DED22AC7689B0"/>
with to remember from whence ſhe is fallen, and to repent, and do her firſt Works, it ſeems as tho', either a Reformation, or a Deſolation, will come on before long.—And now, this leads me to ſay, Thanks be given to <hi>Zion's King,</hi> that there are ſo many at this Day, more eſpecially in this Town, who are aſking the Way to <hi>Zion</hi> with their Faces thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, inſomuch that the Kingdom of Heaven ſeems to ſuffer Violence, and as tho' People were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take no Denial.—And yet, whether this be a Token for Good to the Land in general, or whether thoſe particular Perſons only ſhall ſave their own Souls, is what I muſt leave undetermin'd:—But whoever they be, Oh! let them ſtill preſs forward, and haſten to the City of Refuge, before the Purſuer overtake them.—Such as theſe I am further to ſpeak unto, when I have expreſs'd my ardent Deſire, that <hi>this Honourable Company</hi> may be a Nurſery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Soldiers, and that <hi>each Man</hi> may do worthily in his Day, "and come off at laſt more than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror;" and <hi>all of you together</hi> "ſtand before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in your Hands, and cry with a loud Voice, ſaying, Salvation to our GOD which ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever;" <hi>Amen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now I come, as you remember I propoſed, and which I have my Eye and Heart more eſpecially fixed on, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> To offer ſomething reſpecting the Chriſtian's <hi>Spiritual Warfare;</hi> and direct my Speech more eſpecially to ſuch as are now under <hi>Convictions</hi> and <hi>awakenings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if it be Praiſe-worthy for Soldiers to jeopard their Lives in a Time of War, in Defence of their Country, Then ſurely it is highly commendable for
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004788_0039_100DED24F346ADB0"/>
every Chriſtian to engage in and proſecute the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> (which is the more neceſſary) <hi>Warfare,</hi> under JESUS the Captain of our Salvation.—And for this End, ſuffer me to beſeech and adviſe you as follows, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Weigh the Matter well in your own Minds:</hi> Not as tho' there is any juſt Reaſon to heſitate; but, that you may know and underſtand what you do, and may not be ſurprized and diſcouraged by Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations when they come: Conſider well, I ſay, what the Chriſtian Religion will coſt all ſuch who eſpouſe it, namely, "That they muſt deny themſelves, and take up their Croſs, and follow CHRIST.—Oh! cheriſh your Convictions, and pray over them, until you have good Reaſon to think that your Hearts are right with GOD: Now, Now if ever, you muſt be Voluntiers, for, "all the LORD's People are a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling People."</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. GET and <hi>improve,</hi> yea, and be <hi>expert</hi> in the Uſe of the <hi>Spiritual Armour.</hi> No part may be left
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004788_0040_100DED269C2DDE00"/>
naked and expos'd without great Hazard, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>whole Armour</hi> of GOD muſt be put on: Thus for Inſtance, You muſt have on the <hi>Breaſt-Plate</hi> of Righteouſneſs; namely, all Chriſtian Graces, or the Love and Practice of univerſal Holineſs: And your <hi>Loyns</hi> muſt be girt about with <hi>Truth;</hi> that is, be not Double-minded, or of a double Heart, but ſincere and upright: And <hi>Faith</hi> acted on the Promiſe, Grace, and Righteouſneſs of CHRIST, muſt be your <hi>Shield:</hi> And <hi>Hope,</hi> ſuch as is well-founded, muſt be your <hi>Helmet:</hi> And you muſt take with you the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Spirit, which is the <hi>Word of GOD;</hi> for Scripture Arguments are the moſt powerful: And your <hi>Feet</hi> muſt be <hi>ſhod</hi> with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace; that is, You muſt be ſtock'd with <hi>Patience,</hi> and your Spirits ſteel'd with <hi>Reſolution,</hi> that ſo you may walk on, in a ſteady Pace, amidſt all your Difficulties and Temptations: And finally, You muſt <hi>pray</hi> always with all Prayer and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Spirit, and <hi>watching</hi> thereunto with all Perſeverance, and Supplication for all Saints.—I have not Time, you ſee, to ſay much of the ſeveral Parts of this divine Armour; nor may I ſtand to ſhow you the Uſefulneſs and Neceſſity of the ſame:—But this I would ſay, <hi>Stand your Ground,</hi> and be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged becauſe you meet with Oppoſitions; for you muſt reckon upon it, that not only many a ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmaelite,</hi> but moreover, a malicious, tempting <hi>Devil</hi> will often annoy and trouble you: Yea, it's probable, you will have it frequently ſuggeſted to your Minds, either, that there is no GOD; or, that He is unjuſt and unkind; or, that the Scriptures are not the Word of GOD; or, that you have committed the Unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin, and the like:—But marvel not at all at the Matter; for many, very many have already expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the like; yea, and as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> expreſſes it, "There hath no Temptation taken you, but ſuch as
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004788_0041_100DED29A0BC7A58"/>
is common to Man;" at leaſt to <hi>ſuch</hi> Men, who are making their Flight from <hi>Sodom,</hi> or <hi>Egypt, ſpiritually ſo called,</hi> and are <hi>haſtening</hi> towards the promiſed Land, the <hi>Heavenly Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT now, leſt you ſhould run into a <hi>fatal</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; let me here <hi>caution</hi> you againſt looking upon every Reluctance againſt Sin, which you may find and feel in your own Breaſts, as a ſure Indication that you are really engaged in the Chriſtian's Spiritual Warfare: For, there is certainly a very great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between that <hi>Reluctance</hi> which is in the <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,</hi> and the <hi>Combate</hi> which is in the <hi>Regenerate;</hi> And that firſt, As to the <hi>Principle</hi> thereof; for in the unrenewed it ariſes from Love to Reputation, or Fear of Wrath, and the like; but in others, from a real Hatred of Sin, and a true Love to GOD.—And then, there's Difference as to the <hi>Seat of it;</hi> for in the Natural Man, the Combate is between one Faculty and another; thus, the Affections go one Way, and the Judgment and Conſcience another; but now, in the Regenerate, there ariſeth a War with every Faculty, as, the Judgment againſt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Will againſt the Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the true Reaſon of it is, becauſe there is Sin and Grace, Fleſh and Spirit, co-habiting in every Faculty.—And then moreover, there is Difference as to the <hi>Extent of it;</hi> for the Unrenewed do combate only with ſome groſſer Sins, but the Renewed with all Sins.—And finally, as to the <hi>Event</hi> and <hi>Iſſue of it;</hi> for in the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, there is, at beſt, no more than a temporary refraining from ſome Sins; but in others, their Luſts are more ſubdued, and they become ſtill more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and reſolute in reſiſting Sin, and in ſerving GOD.—And now, from what has been ſaid, if your Combate proves to be that of the <hi>true Chriſtian'</hi>s, Oh! be very thankful for it, and take Courage; fear not, but go on and proſper; for the LORD is with
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004788_0042_100DED2C5E74EBB8"/>
you while you be for him.—Yea, and if your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate be no other than the Reluctance of an <hi>Enlightned Conſcience,</hi> yet be not diſcouraged, ſaying, There is no Hope; Nay, but be thankful for the Convictions you are under, eſteem them as a great Mercy, and cheriſh them as you would a dear Friend; hearken to the Voice of GOD in and by the ſame, and follow them with ſerious Meditation, alſo with fervent Prayer to the GOD of all Grace.—And thus, according to the very utmoſt of your Ability, open the Door to CHRIST, and then you may humbly hope that <hi>He</hi> will ſo diſplay his mighty <hi>Power,</hi> as to open it <hi>effectually,</hi> and that he will come in, and ſet up his Throne in your Hearts. And this brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4. HAVE your Eye to the <hi>Captain</hi> of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, even JESUS, whom the Father hath given to be a Leader, and a Commander to the People: <hi>Unto him</hi> muſt you <hi>look</hi> if you would be ſaved: That is to ſay, you muſt <hi>look</hi> and <hi>mourn,</hi> becauſe you have by wilful Sin, as it were, crucified him afreſh: And moreover, ſo <hi>look</hi> to him as to <hi>believe</hi> in him, that is, accept of his kind and gracious Invitation in ſuch a Manner as to cloſe with him and embrace him in all his Offices, chearfully depending on him both for Strength and Righteouſneſs, and very gladly venture your Souls and their Salvation in his Hands. Yea, every Day be <hi>looking</hi> on him, and <hi>admire</hi> him as the Chief among Ten Thouſands; and this will lead you to <hi>look</hi> and <hi>long</hi> after a further Acquaintance with him: Yea, and you muſt <hi>look</hi> and <hi>follow</hi> after him; that is, labour to imitate him in all his imitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and to be ſincerely obedient to all his Words of Command. Alſo, <hi>Look</hi> and follow him in the Way of <hi>paſſive</hi> as well as active Obedience; <hi>Eye</hi> his Hand and Counſel under all afflictive Diſpenſations,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004788_0043_100DED2EED142D28"/>
and reſign your Wills to his. And finally, with the <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Hope</hi> and Expectation, look and <hi>wait,</hi> until he ſhall fulfil all your Deſire, and cauſe you to ſee his Salvation.</p>
            <p>AND as you muſt look to your Leader in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Reſpects, ſo alſo, you muſt take the utmoſt Care to <hi>aim aright</hi> in <hi>whatever you do,</hi> and ſo become good <hi>Marks Men</hi> in a ſpiritual Senſe. Not only in your religious Performances, but moreover, in your natural and civil Actions, let the <hi>Glory of GOD</hi> be your Scope and <hi>Mark:</hi> Yea, and let Holineſs unto the LORD be written upon all your <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> as well as your Employments: And in a Word, Let all be done as <hi>to</hi> the LORD and <hi>for</hi> the LORD, that ſo you may <hi>taſte that he is gracious.—</hi> Not that you may be <hi>over-ſolicitous,</hi> as awaken'd Sinners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are, to obtain <hi>ſpeedy Comfort;</hi> No; but rather deſire that you may become <hi>truly humble,</hi> and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the Conſolations of GOD; and learn to be very willing, that He ſhould take his own Time to apply the ſame to you: And when-ever the good Spirit ſhall ſee meet to do this, I now ſolemnly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you againſt being puffed up, as alſo againſt a ſecure Frame of Spirit: Indeed, you muſt be very thankful, but then at the ſame Time be alſo very watchful, and be ye cloathed with Humility.</p>
            <p>AND now, Is there any Need that I ſhould tell you, that if you are Chriſtians indeed, then, of what Age, Sex, or Quality ſoever you be, you are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly engaged in an <hi>holy War;</hi> yea, and nothing leſs than your future and everlaſting Weal depends upon your fighting the good Fight of Faith under the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious JESUS.—Neither are you unacquainted, and O! that you would keep it in Mind, that your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are not only numerous, but alſo malicious, and

very politick; yea, and <hi>unwearied</hi> in their Aſſaults: True indeed, if you reſiſt them, ſtedfaſt in the Faith, then they will flee from you; but alas! they will <hi>ſoon rally again,</hi> and be upon you; either with the <hi>ſame,</hi> or with ſome <hi>new</hi> Temptations: And therefore, as ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> "Be ſober, be vigilant;" <hi>Be ſober;</hi> that is, Govern your ſelves, both the outer and inner Man, by the Rules of Temperance, Modeſty and Mortification: And <hi>be vigilant,</hi> or watchful; that is, Not only in Prayer and other religious Exerciſes, but at <hi>all</hi> other Times, both when alone and in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.—And the Truth is, The Strength of our Adverſary <hi>as to us,</hi> lies in our Treachery and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if we are but faithful to CHRIST, and true to our own Intereſt, we ſhall be in no Danger at all of being led Captive by the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs.—</hi> O! Beware, <hi>beware Children,</hi> of giving Place to the Devil, and of deſerting, in any Meaſure, ſo good a Cauſe, and ſo kind a Saviour. Are not your <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and your other <hi>godly Friends</hi> jealous over you, leſt you ſhould turn again to Folly, and, like too many others, begin in the Spirit and end in the Fleſh: Wherefore, I beſeech you, be not high-minded but fear; and yet, be not timerous and faint-hearted, but ſtrong and very couragious; Go ye forth in the Name of the LORD of Hoſts, and fight not as thoſe that beat the Air, and only make a vain flouriſh; but be reſolute and in good earneſt, as thoſe that muſt either conquer or be conquer'd, <hi>fight or die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND Oh! How can you chooſe but be valorous, when you conſider (and I hope you will <hi>often</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider) the Goodneſs of your <hi>Cauſe;</hi> as alſo the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Skill, Power and Good-will of your HEAD and GENERAL; and moreover, that your Armour (it being ſuch as the Goſpel directs to and enjoins) is <hi>Armour of Proof;</hi> by the Improvement of which,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004788_0045_100DED33CAF9C8B0"/>
great, <hi>very</hi> great is the <hi>Army</hi> which has, through our LORD JESUS CHRIST come off <hi>Conquerors:</hi> Yea, and <hi>you</hi> ſhall do ſo too, if you are not wanting to your ſelves.—And then, <hi>O then,</hi> What a glorious Reward ſhall be given you! No leſs than "to ſit down with your glorious LORD on his Throne, even as he overcame, and is now ſet down with <hi>his Father</hi> on his Throne."—Yea, and let me tell you, that he has overcome, not only <hi>before you,</hi> but alſo <hi>for you,</hi> if you will but prove loyal to him; ſo then, what have you to do, but only to <hi>purſue</hi> the Victory under that glorious Conqueror, through whom your Weapons, which are not carnal but ſpiritual, ſhall be mighty for the pulling of ſtrong Holds?—And if you ſhould be, at any Time, through Surprize, obliged to <hi>Retreat;</hi> O! make haſte and delay not to <hi>make good your Ground;</hi> and for that End, <hi>come on charg'd afreſh</hi> with a greater Degree of Courage and Reſolution; <hi>renewing</hi> (without fail) your <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in the <hi>Wiſdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of your <hi>great Commander,</hi> and ſkilfully improving, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that <hi>particular</hi> Part of your Armour which you have Reaſon to think will be moſt ſerviceable at that Juncture.—And, what tho' the <hi>Devil</hi> be ſtiled <hi>the God of this World,</hi> yet be not diſmayed, for he is ſo to thoſe only who ſubmit to him as ſuch, and are led Captive by him at his Will; and both <hi>they</hi> and <hi>their god</hi> (ſuch an one as he is) ſhall be caſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they continuing in Bondage to him, into the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.—And this leads me to ſay, That as you would not be triumph'd over by the Prince of the Power of the Air, O! Beware of <hi>his Agents;</hi> I mean, <hi>Enticers to Sin,</hi> who are no other than <hi>Factors for Hell;</hi> ſhun their Company as you would a <hi>Peſt-Houſe;</hi> yea, and "have no Fellowſhip with <hi>any</hi> of the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, but rather reprove them, for
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004788_0046_100DED35F1306C28"/>
one Sinner oftentimes deſtroyeth much Good."—And let me go on to exhort you to be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo, left the <hi>Things of the World</hi> prove a Snare to you; namely, the Honours, Pleaſures and Profits of the ſame, all and every of which the Devil is wont to improve (or rather abuſe) for the choaking the good Seed of the Word, and diverting the Soul from GOD and Duty: Watch therefore and Pray leſt you be <hi>thus</hi> overcome by the evil one.—And not only ſhun and avoid all Appearances of and Approaches to Sin with your outer Man; but moreover, ſuppreſs and ſubdue the very <hi>firſt</hi> Motion to Sin which may at any Time <hi>ariſe in your own Breaſts,</hi> leſt it ſpread like the <hi>Cloud</hi> we read of, which at the firſt appeared no larger than a <hi>Man's Hand,</hi> but ſoon cover'd and blacken'd the <hi>whole</hi> Heaven: And thus with the beſt of your Skill endeavour to pull down the ſtrong Hold of <hi>in-bred Luſts</hi> which war againſt your Souls, as well as to ward off ſurrounding Temptations; for (believe me) the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> with its <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Luſts,</hi> muſt be crucified, otherwiſe you ſhall never obtain a Conqueſt over the World and Devil.—Yea, and not only your Inclination to Vice and Wickedneſs, but moreover, that <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> which is in you to <hi>rely</hi> and <hi>depend</hi> upon your own ſuppoſed <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Actions,</hi> muſt be <hi>ſubdued</hi> and <hi>abhorred,</hi> otherwiſe you will periſh, after all your Labour and Pains, with a Lye in your Right Hand.—And I ſhall further add, that being ſenſible where your Weakneſs chiefly lies, and <hi>from what Quarter</hi> you are moſt in Hazard, you may not fail to <hi>double</hi> your Guard there, and to uſe all needful <hi>Precaution,</hi> leſt you be ſurprized and taken.—And altho' at preſent, indeed, through the Goodneſs of GOD, you are not called to reſiſt unto Blood, yet, you are always oblig'd to ſtrive <hi>againſt Sin,</hi> "and eſpecially, that Sin, or thoſe Sins, which do more <hi>eaſily beſet you,</hi> and <hi>

Race ſet before you, <hi>looking</hi> (as I ſaid before) unto JESUS the Author and Finiſher of Faith: And by ſo doing, you will be in the Way to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all Events of Providence, even the <hi>Fiery Trial</hi> it ſelf, and nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate you from the Love of GOD: Nay, but having in the preſence, and by the Aſſiſtance of GOD, CHRIST, and <hi>good Angels,</hi> acted your Part in the <hi>Field</hi> of this World, as becomes the Followers of the Lamb; you ſhall, without fall, be conducted by ſome of thoſe benign and ſpotleſs Spirits, into the Preſence-Chamber of the LORD of Glory, and ſhall live and reign with him for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>MUCH, <hi>very</hi> much more might be ſaid upon the Subject, and it is no eaſy Thing to forbear; but truly, I begin to feel ſomething of a Rebuke in my own Mind, for having gone the Length I have, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that this People and their Children are under the Inſpection and Guidance of <hi>ſeveral ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Leaders</hi> in the Church, and under CHRIST, who are eminently Men of GOD; have themſelves, without Doubt, experienced the New-Birth, and are much more able than I am, Experimentally as well as Doctrinally, to lead you in the Paths of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: I hope you are thankful for, and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to improve thoſe burning and ſhining Lights, which the great Head of the Church has here ſet up; otherwiſe, you may juſtly fear that Darkneſs will ere long come upon you.—Not that you may look on any Man or Council upon Earth, as the Father, Founder and Author of your Religion; No, No; but yet, you muſt follow the Footſteps of the Flock, under the Conduct of ſuch who are eminently and really, as well as profeſſedly, and by their Office, the Bridegroom's Friends; being themſelves <hi>ſound</hi> in the

Faith, and preach up the Doctrines of <hi>Grace;</hi> and eſpecially inſtruct you to build your Hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Happineſs upon the <hi>Free Grace of GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Precious Merits of our Lord JESUS CHRIST,</hi> which are the <hi>only Pillars</hi> on which your <hi>Hope</hi> muſt ſtand, if you would not have it fail you in that Day when GOD ſhall take away your Souls: Yea, a Hope thus founded is neceſſary not only to your future Safety, but alſo to your preſent Fruitfulneſs and Flouriſhing:—And tho' I know but little, yet, ſo far as I do know any Thing of the Matter, I muſt needs ſay, that I am fully perſwaded, that the more you adore and rely upon <hi>Free Grace through JESUS CHRIST,</hi> the more will your Souls be in Health and proſper: And let me intreat of you to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.—True indeed, you muſt have Reſpect to all GOD's Commandments; this we conſtantly teach and affirm; yea, and <hi>you will,</hi> without Doubt, be careful to maintain good Works, if you have a good Principle within you: But what I ſay is this, that you may not have the leaſt Dependance upon your Works of Righteouſneſs, Charity, or Piety, to juſtify you before GOD, but muſt <hi>build</hi> on CHRIST, the Rock of Ages, and the Hope of all true <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites:</hi> "He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life;" and (altho' there be ſome that can't reliſh it, yet) it is a certain Truth, "that there is no other Name under Heaven, given among Men, whereby we may be accepted and ſaved:"—Wherefore, as you love your own Souls, I beſeech you, Let thoſe three Words, which are often uſed in Military Exerciſes, and are more <hi>inſtructive</hi> than any other that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be in Uſe on ſuch Occaſions, Namely, <hi>To your Leader,</hi> be often ſounding in your Ears; and let the ſame have their due Influence on your whole Man, and at all Times; ſo that whatever you do, ſee that

you do it in the Name of CHRIST, and don't dare to perform any Duty, nor to ſtir one Step, without having your Eye <hi>to him</hi> for Guidance, Strength, and Righteouſneſs; and ſo, let the Life which you live here in the Fleſh, be by Faith in the <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> who has commanded, ſaying, "<hi>Look unto me,</hi> and be ye ſaved."</p>
            <p>BUT tho' it be hard to forbear—yet, leſt I ſhould treſpaſs too much upon your Patience, I ſhall now draw towards a Cloſe.</p>
            <p>AND notwithſtanding I readily acknowledge, that it is the Duty of Chriſtians firmly to adhere to <hi>all</hi> the Principles of our holy Religion, as revealed to us in the holy Scriptures, "and not be like Children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine"; yet, I would adviſe you to hold faſt, more eſpecially, the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin;</hi> and that of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>New-Birth;</hi> that alſo of <hi>Juſtification by Faith, without the Works of the Law;</hi> and finally, that of <hi>The Decrees;</hi> to which I may add, that of the <hi>Saints Perſeverance;</hi>

            <p>AND <hi>to conclude</hi> the Diſcourſe; Let every <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> here preſent, of what Order, Age, Relation, Complexion, or Language ſoever, be exhorted, in the Words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> "to awake out of Sleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now is your Salvation nearer than when you believed."—Let the <hi>Scoffers</hi> of the Age, and ſuch as refuſe to be reformed, mock on, if they pleaſe; but be <hi>you</hi> up and doing, and ſo get ready for your LORD'S Coming.—As the Damnation of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hardned Wretches draws daily nearer and nearer, and their Steps do even <hi>now</hi> take hold on Hell; and it won't be long before Almighty GOD will mock at their Calamity, even as now they mock at his Counſels: So does the Salvation of all thoſe that love our LORD JESUS CHRIST in Sincerity draw near apace; and ſurely, O ye Children of the moſt High, as you <hi>draw nearer</hi> to the <hi>Centre</hi> of your Delight and Joy, ſo your <hi>Motion</hi> ſhould be the <hi>more quick</hi> and lively, and your Souls more on the Wing of Faith and holy Love, and be going from Strength to Strength, until every one of you ſhall appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD your Saviour in the heavenly Zion, with Songs and everlaſting Joy upon your Heads; and
