            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>To the Reader.</head>
                  <p>THE following Letters were publiſhed in France in <hi>1791.</hi> They contain a relation of events which are ſaid to have taken place in that country in <hi>1782.</hi> Although the work is probably in ſome degree fictitious, and has every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a novel, the reader may be aſſured that it is, in a great meaſure, founded upon facts. The author ſeems to have had it in view to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move many religious and other prejudices from the minds of the French people, and to ſhow that ſeveral inſtitutions of the Roman Catholic reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were, in their nature, injurious to national and individual happineſs. This he endeavours to do, by giving the hiſtory of ſeveral perſons who were extremely unhappy in conſequence of the abſurd laws and religious inſtitutions of their country, and thereby convince his readers that a reformation was neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The cuſtom of forbidding marriage to the clergy, and the inſtitution of monaſteries, by which many perſons were excluded from ſociety, are here ſhown to be abſurd and unnatural; and the time is anticipated when the prejudices of the people ſhould be removed, and thoſe deſpicable eſtabliſhments at an end.</p>
                  <p>On reading the title-page, the reader will find a part of it to be, "<hi>The Neceſſary Divorce.</hi>" This has reference to an inſtance mentioned in the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:035743_0004_1006ABBC55AE56B8"/>
hiſtory, where it is thought to be ſuitable and neceſſary that a huſband and wife ſhould not only be ſeparated, but even obtain a divorce, although they are perſons of the ſtricteſt virtue, and their conduct unimpeachable. This the Editor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be a curious queſtion, which he would chooſe to leave to the deciſion of the reader. But he will venture, for himſelf, to affirm, that the law of divorce granted by the French National Aſſembly, can no more be juſtified than that of Moſes, and that they can urge no better reaſon to palliate their criminality than "the hardneſs of the people's hearts."</p>
                  <p>The unparalleled profligacy of manners this nation has manifeſted in the courſe of the late revolution; their open and daring profeſſions of atheiſm, and trampling on every divine precept; but more eſpecially their wanton depredations on our commerce, and refuſing to come to an amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſettlement of differences between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, has filled the minds of Americans with an abhorrence of the French name. This has, in ſome inſtances, injured the ſucceſs of the work: But the Editor has, on the whole, received ſuch ample encouragement, by ſubſcriptions, that his fears of not ſucceeding in the publication, merely becauſe the author was a Frenchman, are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſipated.</p>
                  <p>Wiſhing his countrymen and their poſterity a perpetual continuance of that portion of civil and religious liberty they have hitherto enjoyed, and at preſent experience—conſcious that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work is calculated to ſhow the deformity of vice, and the beauty and advantages of virtue, the Editor cheerfully commits the publication to their candid peruſal.</p>

                  <head>A LETTER From the Tranſlator to ***** ******.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHEN you firſt put Emilia de Varmont into my hands for my amusement, I was far from expecting that your favour would be productive of such serious consequences. On the first perusal of it my mind was sensibly affected with the interesting nature of the events it related. After communicating the substance of the history to several intimate friends, and finding their opinion of its merit accorded with mine, I was led, by an almost invincible impulse, to think of translating and publishing it, for the perusal of my countrymen at large. This, as I have informed you, would have been long ago accomplished, had I not been obliged, by a languishing state of health, to defer the undertaking.</p>
                  <p>By comparing the translation with the original you will find that I have taken several liberties. To the title-page I have made several additions, and instead of "Les Amours du Curé Sevin," I have put, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of Curate Sevin.</hi> Several names of persons which I supposed could not be pronounced by mere English readers, so as to have an agreeable sound, I have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by others, which I think may be pronounced with less difficulty.</p>
                  <p>As far as was consistent with a free translation, I have, through the whole work, with few exceptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035743_0006_1006ABC640534468"/>
endeavoured to render the exact sense of the original. In several instances I have given an idea similar, but not strictly the same. In one or two places I have had the extraordinary presumption of giving a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly contrary to that of the author: but I have made no alteration that will so materially affect the merit of the work as the lustre that it will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably lose by appearing through the medium of a translation.</p>
                  <p>In reviewing, as well as perusing the work, I have frequently, and with much pleasure, observed the very natural and striking contrast between the vicious and virtuous characters; such as Madame de Varmont and Madame Florival; young Varmont and Bovile; Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, who is an instance of libertinism, and Dolerval, his brother, who is a pattern of sensibility and virtue. The two sisters, Celina and Emilia de Varmont, are, upon the whole, two excellent patterns of religious life and virtuous conduct, though not free from the prejudices of education, and the little errors and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings inseparable from human nature. As they are victims of misfortune, in consequence of the cruel customs of their country, by which a hard-hearted mother exercised over them an undue authority, their history will afford an instructive lesson to our youth: for it will show them, by comparison, the salutary nature of the laws of their country, the superior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we enjoy for national and private happiness, and may teach them to prize, as they ought, those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable blessings.</p>
                  <p>In the letters of Murville, you must be sensible, are some expressions which could not, consistently with our notions of decency, be admitted in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Some of these I have totally expunged from the work; others I have so modified as to render them less exceptionable.</p>
                  <p>From what I have here mentioned, it seems natural to remark the great difference between the sentiments
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035743_0007_1006ABCAB18F2628"/>
of different nations respecting matters of decency. I would not be understood to have any reference to the unpolished part of any country; for we know that in all countries there are some low characters, who, in open violation of all established rules of decorum, will make no scruple of using language which the more refined part of the community would esteem highly indecent; but I would refer to the most polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of a nation, by whose writings and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may form an opinion of their prevailing taste. If we look into ancient authors, who were doubtless as virtuous as the moderns, we there find many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which, if used by the writers of the present day, would bring on them the contempt of every reader; and yet those very authors, owing to the great difference of manners between the former and latter ages, could make use of those expressions without any impeachment of their characters. In the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament, which you have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less read in our language, every subject is treated of with the greatest plainness: nor was there any need of reserve at a time when every subject might be spoken of without giving the least offence. Amongst all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where civilization has extended its sway, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there are none more scrupulous in these respects than the English and Americans. Perhaps France, your native country, considering the advantages she has enjoyed, has felt the effects of civilization as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially as any nation in Europe; and yet, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances before mentioned, we can discover in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of the French people, almost as great sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity as prevailed in ancient times. From what has already been said, which is much more than I at first intended, I would infer, that although we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have in our writings a sacred regard to the prevailing taste of our country, and avoid everything which excites impure sentiments, we ought not to conclude that other nations are less virtuous than we,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035743_0008_1006ABCCAF5D7148"/>
because they exercise more freedom in their expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>Through every preceding age, the friends of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have had to deplore the perverseness of human nature, which has been the occasion of bloody and innumerable wars between different nations. These wars, which have been caused by the clashing interests of neighbouring powers, have brought on the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful necessity of inspiring the individuals of each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending nation with mutual hatred; we also, even in this enlightened age, have to lament that this frightful policy is still prevalent. Out of numerous instances which might be given, there are none more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than those of England and France. It is well known to you, that it has often been the practice of the two different courts, while France was a monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, to teach their subjects that the opposite court and their subjects formed a nation of brutes. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the late friendly disposition which the people of the United States exercised towards France, it has also become fashionable amongst us, since we have received so many injuries by the detestable policy of the French Directory, to stile the French a nation of barbarians. Although it is probable that the late extraordinary war which France has had to sustain against internal and external foes, may have rendered the French people more so than at any period since Europe has been civilized, I am far from believing that the term will universally apply. The one to whom I am now writing, with whom I am proud to be acquainted, whose mind is richly fraught with all the knowledge necessary to render him an agreeable companion, and a valuable citizen, can evince to the world the absurdity of such an opinion. For myself, I am always best pleased with those who entertain as favourable an opinion as possible of nations as well as individuals. Tins disposition inclines me to believe there are many worthy charters in every nation;
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035743_0009_1006ABCFC2C3E6A8"/>
and that, in all countries, human nature is much the same, allowing for the difference of climate, modes of living, and prejudices of education.</p>
                  <p>Lamenting with you the wretched degeneracy of the French nation—a degeneracy which is the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable consequence of war and civil commotions, I cannot leave you without expressing my warmest wishes that France may soon be restored to peace and good government. Of this, however, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising appearance. Whilst many are expecting that the war will continue till Europe has reverted to her former state of barbarism, and others are looking for a more extensive civilization, it seems fruitless to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard an opinion: for the great events which have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed each other in such rapid succession, since the revolution, have often baffled the prophetic skill of men who have formed their conjectures, on passing events, from the history of former ages.</p>

                  <p>THE probability that the following let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may fall into the hands of ſome readers, who may not underſtand many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to the ceremonies and inſtitutions of the Roman Catholic Religion, induces the American Editor to prefix a few ſketches to the work, to render it more intelligible.</p>
                  <p>In the early ages of Chriſtianity, after it had ſpread its benign influence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, in a great degree, prevalent in almoſt every nation on the eaſtern continent, it gradually loſt ground, and its happy effects were greatly diminiſhed, by reaſon of the wickedneſs and lukewarmneſs of many of its profeſſed votaries; and the churches were rent with hereſies, and torn aſunder by headſtrong, contending parties.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate of things, the Roman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whoſe conqueſts and power had been coextenſive with the world, undertook to connect the Chriſtian religion with the civil power, and mold it to a ſyſtem of ſtate policy. The better to effect this purpoſe,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:035743_0011_1006ABD741020E80"/>
it became neceſſary to mingle the Chriſtian, Jewiſh and Pagan religions together. The temples of the Heathen deities were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into churches; the images of thoſe deities, ſuch as Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva, &amp;c. were taken away, and replaced with images of ſaints, male and female. The pure doctrines of the goſpel were clouded with a multitude of ſuperſtitious ceremonies, by which its original ſimplicity was almoſt ſubverted. The miniſters of the goſpel, who before this time had been in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtation, and, like Jeſus Chriſt, their great Maſter, of a meek diſpoſition; like him, never interfering nor meddling with civil government, any farther than practiſing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining and enforcing obedience to it, were many of them, at this time, advanced to high offices in church and ſtate, and inveſted with great wealth and civil power; whilſt lower orders of the clergy were nearly as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent as the common people: All of them, however, acting under the authority of the Roman Emperor, called the Pope, who aſſumed the title of ſupreme head of the church, and exerciſed complete and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled authority over all orders and ranks of men, both in a civil and eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical capacity. Every poſſible method was taken to throw all the wealth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the hands of the church and ſtate.
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:035743_0012_1006ABDA4BCEDF78"/>
The prieſts had the pretended power of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſins, and, by their prayers, releaſing the ſouls of wicked men from purgatory; for which they obtained frequent and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times large ſums of money from the people. Religious houſes of men and women were eſtabliſhed, called by the different names of abbies, cloiſters, convents, or monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. To theſe houſes multitudes have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in every age of the Roman Catholic church, beſtowed their fortunes on theſe inſtitutions, or caſt them into the boſom of the church for charitable uſes, took a vow of living ſingle through life, and ſpent their days in this retirement. This they have been perſuaded to do, ſometimes for the purpoſe of atoning for heinous crimes, or gaining, by their piety, extraordinary merit in the ſight of God, to entitle them to a better place in heaven. The better to effect theſe deſigns, the people were kept in great ignorance; prayers were made in an unknown tongue; the common people were not permitted to read the ſcriptures; all the decrees of the church and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the clergy were deemed infallible.</p>
                  <p>Thus the pure, benign, and heaven-born light of true religion was greatly obſcured; and the true church, conſiſting of a ſmall number of faithful and enlightened follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, like a forlorn, though beautiful and
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:035743_0013_1006ABDC146FB468"/>
chaſte, female pilgrim, was conſtrained to wander here and there, without any reſting place, to eſcape the defilement and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of eccleſiaſtical tyranny. It would require many and large volumes to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the many inſtances of ſocieties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, who, in every age of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſurpation, nobly defended the cauſe of true and uncorrupted religion, and who, by the intolerant ſpirit of this corrupted church, were perſecuted and ſlain becauſe they would not adhere to its anti-chriſtian principles.</p>
                  <p>Millions ſucceeding millions have been mangled and tortured to death by this MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER of ABOMINATIONS, becauſe they would not ſubſcribe to principles which they viewed with abhorrence, (the embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which they believed would expoſe them to everlaſting miſery in a future world) and renounce thoſe on which they founded their hopes of eternal felicity. Candour obliges me, as a proteſtant, to acknowledge that this ſpirit of intolerance is not peculiar to the Romiſh church alone; nor would I affirm that it is any article of that religion to butcher the heretics. Every different ſect of proteſtants which have ariſen ſince the reformation, have diſcovered a degree of the ſame ſpirit: every one, in their turn, have accuſed the other of popery, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:035743_0014_1006ABE3329088C8"/>
each other, at leaſt with ſentiments of hatred, if not with fire and ſword. In this particular, every candid proteſtant will allow that we have all had a little popery. This principle of perſecuting another for a difference of opinion, whether in politics or religion, when it actuates a body of men, and is blown up into a flame by ſome ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and unprincipled demagogue, will always lead them to perſecute or deſtroy thoſe who think differently from themſelves. The enemies of all religion have often urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this as an unanſwerable argument againſt the Chriſtian ſyſtem. But ſurely nothing can be more unjuſt. We might as well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that riches and health, which in their own nature are the greateſt of all temporal bleſſings, are in themſelves a curſe, becauſe ſome men pervert them to the vileſt of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: or we might join with thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken politicians who would aſſert, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberty is not a bleſſing to any people, becauſe the modern government of France has diſgraced the name of it by embracing a ſyſtem of tyranny, and, under the maſk of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm, committed the moſt enormous crimes. The fact is, that ſuch is the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſition of man, that every faculty of body or mind, every peculiar bleſſing or acquirement, is often, by a miſimprovement of it, rendered a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:035743_0015_1006ABEBC54E90F8"/>The limits preſcribed me, will not admit of enlarging on this ſubject. It muſt ſuffice me to ſay, that it required ſeveral ages for this corrupt ſyſtem to arrive to its higheſt ſtate, and that, ſince the reformation in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, its influence and power have been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually decreaſing; and although in ſeveral nations, its influence in ſentiment is yet conſiderable, the power of the Pope, as a political prince, ſeems to be annihilated.</p>
                  <p>The convents are large, ſtrong and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious buildings, ſome of which, with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous apartments and grates to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, have almoſt every appearance of a priſon. Adjoining theſe buildings are large gardens, ſurrounded with ſtrong and high walls, eſpecially thoſe appointed for women. On the top of theſe walls are pieces of glaſs, or other ſharp ſubſtances, faſtened into them, ſo that no perſon can get over them but with difficulty. In the front of theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is a large hall, called the parlour of the convent. To this numbers of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious belonging to the cloiſters, ſometimes repair for converſation. And when a father or brother wiſhes to ſee a daughter or ſiſter who has become a nun, they go into the parlour, where they can ſee and converſe with her through the grates of the windows. Some are diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of royal convents. Theſe are buildings of
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:035743_0016_1006ABF0593C05A0"/>
the nobleſt ſtructure, and have all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal beauties of a palace. The royal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, which are diſtinguiſhed by the name of Abbies, are ſupported by government. They are eſtabliſhed for the ſupport of young gentlemen and ladies who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the nobility, and whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are ſo ſmall that they cannot live in the world in a ſplendor ſuitable to their rank.</p>
                  <p>The perſons who are intended to lead the monaſtic life, remain in theſe houſes for a conſiderable time, in a ſort of probation, called the novitiate. The term of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitiate is a year, but it may be lengthened at the pleaſure of the candidate or director of the convent. It is required of both ſexes to be uniform in their dreſs. The uniform of different monaſteries is various: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſome orders of nuns wear a white dreſs, with dark coloured veils; others a black dreſs, with veils of a different colour. The veil is formed of a long ſtrip of gauze, or ſome other thin ſtuff, which comes over and below the face to a conſiderable length. The ceremonies at the time of taking the vow are performed with great ſolemnity. One of them is, that after the woman has taken the vow of perpetual celibacy, and ſolemnly dedicated herſelf to God and a life of religion, ſhe lies proſtrate before the altar
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:035743_0017_1006ABF4AEBD8F98"/>
for ſeveral minutes, and is covered with a pall, to make the ceremony reſemble a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and ſignify that ſhe is dead to the world. The women, at the time of taking the veil, cut off a part of their hair, and put upon their heads a ſort of bonnet or cap, to which they faſten the veil, which they muſt wear to the end of their lives, and is to be conſidered as a badge of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When a woman has once taken the veil, ſhe can never go beyond the walls of the convent or adjacent gardens; nor can ſhe, eſpecially if ſhe belongs to the ſtricter orders, ever ſee any man, not even the neareſt relation, beſides the prieſt and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, except through the grates. She may, however, be removed from the convent to which ſhe belongs to another of the ſame order, if ſhe is diſpleaſed with her ſituation, and can give ſufficient reaſons why ſhe is diſſatisfied; but ſhe cannot remove with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out permiſſion from the biſhop, to whom ſhe is obliged to ſtate the reaſons why ſhe wiſhes for a removal.</p>
                  <p>The monks have the ſame permiſſion, but with this difference, that inſtead of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the biſhop, they need only apply to the general of their order.</p>
                  <p>Time would fail me to enumerate all the various orders of monks; ſuch as Capuchins, Bernardins, Jacobins, Benedictines, &amp;c.
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:035743_0018_1006ABF78F75DAF0"/>
ſome of which ſhave their heads entirely, and wear long beards; others that leave only a narrow lock of hair on the back part of their heads, ſo contrived as to reſemble a crown; others that wear nothing but ſandals upon their feet; and ſome that go entirely barefoot.</p>
                  <p>At the head of theſe houſes are placed perſons of auſtere piety, who are to keep a ſtrict watch over the perſons committed to their charge, ſee that the conduct of their lives is conformable to their profeſſion, and give them all the inſtruction neceſſary for their ſituation. To aſſiſt them in devotion, and ſerve them as a confeſſor, a prieſt is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to every convent. There is alſo, for every religious houſe, a church or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Although in all the convents the prieſt has permiſſion, at times, to viſit every apartment and every perſon in them, he is not permitted to ſleep within the walls of thoſe appointed for women, but has a houſe appointed for him without.</p>
                  <p>The religious houſes of women are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made uſe of as ſeminaries of learning, for the inſtruction of young ladies. The nuns are employed for teachers. Here they can be inſtructed in every uſeful and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental branch of knowledge; ſuch as read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, writing, plain needle work, and every thing belonging to an ordinary education,
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:035743_0019_1006ABFD76AAF6F0"/>
muſic, painting, embroidery, &amp;c. belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an education more refined: and if the nuns cannot teach them, they hire maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for that purpoſe. Theſe privileges they can enjoy without taking the veil. Other ladies, at any time of life, having met with misfortunes, or any cauſe inclining them to retire from the world, if they are perſons of good character, may occaſionally repair to the convents, and, by paying for their board, may enjoy the privileges of retirement for any length of time, and leave it whenever they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>In moſt of the large cities throughout thoſe countries where the Romiſh religion prevails, there are one or more convents. Before the late revolution, the city of Paris,<note n="*" place="bottom">Brooke's Gazetteer.</note> in France, contained three abbies of men, five of women, fifty-three convents and communities of monks, and ſeventy nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries and communities of women, which amounted to one hundred and thirty-four in that city alone. It has been ſaid, that the general of the Dominicans in Spain, has boaſted that he could bring 200,000 monks into the field without any great diminution of their number in the convents. From this we may ſafely conclude, that the number of thoſe in the aforeſaid countries
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:035743_0020_1006AC0230B44300"/>
who lead the conventual life, muſt, in all, amount to ſeveral millions. Beſides thoſe built in large cities, there are ſome monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries built in places of retirement, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times adjoining or in the midſt of large foreſts, at a conſiderable diſtance from any inhabited part of the country.</p>
                  <p>Some convents are of an order who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs great wealth, enjoy the comforts and conveniences of life even to luxury, and are only reſtricted to certain rules, which are not very ſevere; others are extremely poor, and are neceſſitated to employ ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to go into the adjacent country and aſk charity for their ſupport: ſome, on the contrary, are reſtricted to rules which have ever been eſteemed, by proteſtants, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſuperſtitious and ſevere; much more ſo than the mild and benevolent ſyſtem of the goſpel requires: for inſtance, there are ſome orders who ſleep in their cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins every night, and every day viſit their graves, out of which they throw a ſmall quantity of earth to keep them in perpetual mind of death. The ſtricter orders never eat any fleſh, have frequent and ſevere faſts, live upon a ſpare diet; but fiſh are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times allowed to all. There is an order of monks who make a vow of perpetual ſilence, and are, accordingly, compelled never to ſpeak on any occaſion until the time of their
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:035743_0021_1006AC06D08E1D08"/>
diſſolution approaches; when, if any part of their hiſtory is thought worthy of being communicated, or any momentous affair lies upon their minds, they are at liberty to reveal it: of this the Benedictine Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey La Trappe is a remarkable inſtance. It is ſeated in the dioceſs of Seez, which is a town in a territory of France, called Perche, in a large valley encircled by moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The monks in this abbey cover their heads with a large hood, ſpend moſt of their time ſitting in a ſtooping poſture, and looking downwards, by which means they ſeldom ſee each other. It ſeems to be a neceſſary caution, or an eſtabliſhed rule amongſt them, not to look at one another; for the expreſſion of the features is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo commanding, that it would be more difficult to keep ſilence. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the garden belonging to this monaſtery, as given by an ingenious Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh writer<note n="*" place="bottom">See Sketches from Nature, vol. i. p. 163.</note> who has viſited it in perſon, is ſo worthy of a place, that I ſhall here tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it in his own words: "Both the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and monaſtery are encircled with a wood; it participates the gloom of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it belongs to—every member cultivates his own ſolitary ſpot—inſtead of the luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant beauty of odoriferous flowers, is ſeen
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:035743_0022_1006AC0D676AFCF8"/>
only beds of herbs and vegetables, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of tobacco, which all monks are particularly fond of. Around it are long walks of pines and cypreſſes, here and there intermixed with clumps of the ſame kind of trees; and benches placed at the roots of ſeveral of them, deſigned for repoſe or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation."</p>
                  <p>There have doubtleſs been inſtances of perſons, who, by a due improvement of the advantages theſe religious houſes afford for contemplation and retirement, have carried their piety to an extent which can ſeldom be equalled by thoſe who are embarraſſed with the cares, buſineſs and cuſtoms of the world. But the condition of theſe devotees is ſo perfectly unnatural, ſo contrary to the original deſign for which man was created, that many have conſidered the cloiſters bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calculated to promote the purpoſes of impiety and impurity of life than thoſe of religion. When we conſider that the ſtrength of human paſſions is not always diminiſhed by privation, but is moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally increaſed in conſequence of it, to the eye of reaſon it ſeems clear, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents cannot be favourable to religion or morality. The circumſtance of the Romiſh prieſts being conſtrained to live always in a ſtate of celibacy; their frequent occaſions of entering the religious houſes of women;
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:035743_0023_1006AC14AD0325C8"/>
their cuſtom of being in private with every perſon at the time of confeſſion; the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that they are not all virtuous men, nor all the women in the cloiſters of the ſtricteſt piety, have given ample grounds for perſons of a ſuſpicious temper, to form an opinion of their characters and conduct unfavourable to their reputation.</p>
                  <p>But the cuſtom which prevails in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that have embraced the Romiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of parents ſending their daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly to the convents, and obliging them, by compulſory meaſures, to take the veil, that they may beſtow their fortunes on a favourite child or children, or preventing a daughter from marrying a perſon they do not approve, is an inſtance of extreme bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity. To behold an amiable and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daughter, poſſeſſed of every attraction, both of mind and perſon, compelled, by cruel cuſtom and unfeeling parents, to linger away her golden morning of life in a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual priſon, where the expreſſive look, the enchanting ſmile, and every pleaſing quality of her mind and features are all loſt to the world, muſt be painful to the beholder. Thoſe charms which were given her by the creator of the world for the wiſeſt and moſt benevolent deſigns, and which ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring youth of the other ſex would have deemed an invaluable treaſure, are ſecluded,
<pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:035743_0024_1006AC169CC97608"/>
by impenetrable walls, from all the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſociety. Such a ſpectacle muſt excite in the boſom of compaſſion, the tendereſt pity for the victims of tyrannical cuſtom, and the livelieſt indignation againſt thoſe abominable inſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>It is generally known in proteſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that celibacy is enjoined upon all the Romiſh clergy; but if it were not known, the neceſſity of ſaying any thing upon that ſubject in this place, is ſuperſeded by a note annexed to the 66th letter of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing work.</p>
                  <p>Reſpecting divorce, the law in Catholic countries is, perhaps, more ſtrict than even the chriſtian religion requires. Our Saviour himſelf admitted of one inſtance in which it is allowable. But amongſt the Catholics it has generally been unattainable in any caſe whatever. In ſome few inſtances it has been obtained by a ſpecial licenſe from the Pope, who, for a large ſum of money, would give indulgences for diſpenſing with every ſacred obligation. By reaſon of the many compulſory marriages which took place in European countries, the ſtrictneſs of this law became a ſubject of frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. This has been eminently the caſe with France; and it was not late in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution before they attempted and obtained a repeal of this and ſeveral other ancient
<pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:035743_0025_1006AC1B0858AC48"/>
laws: but, unfortunately for the nation, the French, in their rage for a reform, have, in many reſpects, gone beyond all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able limits. Yet, if we conſider that they were a people who were generally deſtitute of much information, and had long groaned under a vaſt weight of oppreſſion, which would make even a wiſe man diſtracted, and often miſled by artful and intriguing wretches who deſerve not the name of men, we ſhall not be aſtoniſhed at their exceſſes; nor ſhall we be over-liberal in aſcribing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar depravity to the natural diſpoſition of the French people. Perhaps it would well become the citizens of the American ſtates, before comparing the conduct of the French with that of our own countrymen, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting in our ſuperior virtues, to view them as emerging from the dark clouds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition, whilſt we, though not free from prejudices, are repoſing in a clearer ſunſhine of moral and ſcientific light.</p>
                  <p>From what I have ſaid in any part of this introduction, I truſt I cannot be accuſed of wilfully miſrepreſenting the Romiſh Church; and, if I am inaccurate in any particular, the candid reader will impute the error to want of information. I am ſenſible that even that ſyſtem, when unconnected with the civil power, is as little injurious to ſociety, and, perhaps, blended with as few dangerous
<pb n="xxix" facs="unknown:035743_0026_1006AC21221799A0"/>
errors as that of ſome ſects of Proteſtants. Nor is it to be doubted but there have been, amongſt the Catholics, men of very liberal ſentiments and genuine piety. From many writers who profeſs that religion, eſpecially in France, have proceeded ſermons, and other writings on moral and religious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that would do honour to any Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant divines. They believe, in common with Proteſtants, in ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant doctrines of divine revelation. But we believe, notwithſtanding, that they are in moſt egregious errors, in teaching for doctrines the commandments of men, and making religion too much conſiſt in external ſhow and oſtentatious ceremonies.</p>

                     <p>WEEP for me my dear Emilia! commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the victims of the convent with ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic tears! Thou art no longer the conſolation of thy ſiſter—thy wretched ſiſter, whoſe life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed but by ſorrows that will be laſting as its duration.</p>
                     <p>It was but this morning—yet it ſeems already an age, an age of grief and anxiety—this very morning I took the veil; the eternal ſacrifice has arrived to its conſummation.</p>
                     <p>And it was, my deareſt Emilia, with the moſt cruel intentions, that the widow of our father, (who deſerves not the endearing title of mother) on the very day in which he breathed his laſt, cauſed thee to be ſnatched from the convent where we had the miſerable conſolation of ſighing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: it was neceſſary we ſhould be ſeparated to render us a more eaſy conqueſt; whilſt we were united, we were too ſtrong againſt her tyrannical perſuaſions. Not that I was blinded to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to believe your courageous counſels could

                     <p>But the woman who is called your mother and mine, was preſent. But how can ſhe be called ſo when ſhe has neither educated nor ſupported us? She is not ſo, for her hatred has conſtantly been
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035743_0029_1006AC30DCD852B8"/>
employed to drive us from her, and purſue us wherever we went. For her darling ſon, and for him alone, ſhe has reſerved all her maternal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Of this he is a proper object, for his heart is an exact image of her's.</p>
                     <p>You have much to fear from this cruel brother; although he is ſcarcely twenty years of age, yet his heart is deſtitute of pity, and his eyes are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of tears. Could you have believed, that he alſo could come and attend the ſacrifice of a ſiſter? He attended it with an air of ſatisfaction! When the arches of the temple reſounded with my cries, even ſtrangers who were preſent could not but weep, and Madame de Varmont herſelf turned pale; but the young man was perfectly unmoved. Great God! I am terrified to think or his future deſtiny! for what dreadful fate doſt thou reſerve him? for what unknown crimes was he brought into exiſtence?</p>
                     <p>Let this picture of my grievous ſituation, O lovelieſt Emilia, be always before your eyes—let it conſtantly maintain in your mind the livelieſt anxiety. Do not forget, that the unhappy lot which has been caſt for me, is the ſame they are preparing for yourſelf. You are not, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſo feeble and timorous as I am; this makes me hope you will ſpurn their wicked ſolicitations, their cruel intreaties, and odious threatenings. But I have ſtill greater fear from their artifices, and warn you to be guarded againſt them; for they are capable of trying the moſt ſhameful artifices that can be imagined; for inſtance, they may tell you that Celina lives peaceably and contented; but Oh, if they ſhould preſume thus to tell you, ſhew them this letter, obſcured by my tears and ſigned with my blood!</p>

                     <p>YOUR ſiſter, ſometime ago, reconciled her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the only condition which become her fortune, and that of her parents; and I expect you will not be tardy in imitating ſo good an example.</p>
                     <p>I am ſo well convinced of this, that I have juſt now diſmiſſed all your maſters: For I did not ſuppoſe that a nun had any need of muſic, nor dancing; nor did I think it neceſſary that ſhe ſhould be deeply ſkilled in foreign languages; and as to your own language, you already know more of it than is needful for pronouncing your vows.</p>
                     <p>To-morrow morning I ſhall ſend for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of your clothes. Your father delighted in inſpiring you with a taſte for luxury, and ideas of coquetry, by which he would certainly have ruined you. Beſides, what benefit would it be to you at preſent, to have ſuch an elegant wardrobe? for in eight days, at moſt, you are going to wear the dreſs of the novitiate. It this ſhould chance to be a ſituation to which you can never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, do not accuſe me of having forced you to accept of it; your reproaches are all due to the memory of M. de Varmont, whoſe ſhameful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance and diſſipation have ſo far diminiſhed his fortune, that the remainder is barely ſufficient for the advancement of my dear ſon; the intereſting youth who is the only ſolace of his mother, and the only hope of his family. But you, and your
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035743_0031_1006AC38E8F0F118"/>
ſiſter will continue your former idolatry for your father. And why ſhould I be ſurpriſed at it? he was all ſimplicity, and you adored him becauſe he was the torment of my life.</p>
                     <p>I muſt tell you, young lady, that I have but a few words to ſay to you. You are untractable, opinionative, and have a mighty talent for argument; but you muſt know that the tyrannical power of your father has ended with his life; that now it is my turn to command, and my commands ſhall be obeyed.</p>

                     <p>THE incloſed is a letter I received this morning from my mother, ſent me from the parlour of the convent, which I ſend you in haſte, being overjoyed to find that my two laſt have reached you by the way you pointed out, and that you conſider it a ſafe means of correſpondence. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the cruel orders of my mother gave me no ſurpriſe, I was much aſtoniſhed on recognizing the perſon by whom ſhe ſent them; it was M. Bovile, that young man of elevated ſtature, noble figure, and pleaſing deportment, whom our father called his pupil; whom he ſometimes brought home with him, and whoſe exploits he mentioned with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual delight, when he returned from his late cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</p>

                     <p>"I underſtand you," anſwered M. Bovile, "but I deſire you, in the firſt place, to hear my defence. Do me the juſtice, Madamoiſelle, to believe, that I had no ſooner received the intelligence of M. de Varmont's illneſs, than I neglected no means of obtaining permiſſion to leave Breſt, where the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my ſtation detained me. I have, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, arrived too late to embrace your reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able father; too late to ſave your elder ſiſter, but not too late, I hope, to defend you."</p>

                     <p>ATTEND, my ſiſter: he returned this morning, and you will be ſurpriſed at the extraordinary declaration he has made me.</p>
                     <p>"I come," ſays he, "to aſk you whether you had rather marry than comply with the arbitrary will of your mother; and whether, from what you have ſeen of me, you have any objections to my perſon? As I have ſeldom had the happineſs of ſeeing you, and am to you almoſt an entire

ſtranger, I can expect nothing more. But what I ſay of myſelf with reſpect to you, I can almoſt ſay of you, Madamoiſelle, with reſpect to me. If I ſhould ſwear that I adored you, it would be a falſehood which you could not believe. But with ſincerity can I declare, that whatever is intereſting in your youth, beauty or misfortunes (and greatly intereſting they are) makes a ſenſible impreſſion on my heart. You are, I make no doubt, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of inſpiring the heart with livelier ſentiments than theſe, and I am convinced that I might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after experience them; but this is what I cannot engage before hand. Many women who were, perhaps, as handſome as you, have never been paſſionately beloved, and were not leſs happy in conſequence of it. All that I can promiſe you, therefore, if my offers are not rejected, is this, that none of thoſe women who believe themſelves the idols of their huſbands, will have more reaſon to boaſt of their kind and faithful attention than yourſelf: for my wife, next to my country, ſhall always be the object of my tendereſt care and moſt anxious ſolicitude."</p>
                     <p>When this extraordinary man had thus ſpoken, he was about riſing to take his leave, whilſt I, Celina, overwhelmed with a confuſion and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, to which nothing could be compared but my embarraſſment, ſtood liſtening, in ſilence, as if he had not ended his ſpeech. After a few moments of ſilence, he thus reſumed his diſcourſe: "I have to lament, Madamoiſelle, that I can give you but a few hours for deliberation; my ſhip is in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and waiting for me, and the war calls me away. Reflect on this matter till evening: this evening I muſt return for your anſwer, and if it is favourable, I ſhall haſten to Madame de Varmont

to obtain her conſent; to-morrow we muſt be married, and the day after I muſt depart."</p>
                     <p>He then bowed reſpectfully, and went away; but in an inſtant afterwards he returned.</p>
                     <p>"Do not," ſaid he, "put off the execution of my deſigns till the end of the campaign. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, young woman, concerning my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; you muſt be ſenſible it is a dangerous one. Do not, inconſiderately, riſk the repoſe of your life with the dangers of mine. But who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide for you in this critical moment? Will you be guided by the cuſtoms of the world? I believe you will not; for they are prepoſterous, and will be of no avail. Decide, then, for yourſelf, and decide with calmneſs. Never ſhall I be tempted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you were in haſte to marry, nor do I make theſe propoſals on ſuch a ſuppoſition; but I have taken the liberty to believe you are deſirous of being freed from this confinement, and the perſecution of your mother. I muſt now take leave of you till evening."</p>
                     <p>O my ſiſter, what advice can you give me? it ſeems that I ought not to heſitate in accepting his perſon and protection; but I know not what anſwer to give him: I ſhall, therefore, wait until I hear from you.</p>

                     <p>PARDON me, my once lovely, but now long loſt Eleanor! I am, for the firſt time, about to afflict you with a ſubject which ſhall never be recalled to your remembrance. Yes, that Bovile whom you ſo tenderly eſteemed—that Bovile who ſo paſſionately deſired to obtain you—whoſe deſires and endeavours would have been crowned with
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035743_0036_1006AC50019EA088"/>
ſucceſs, had there ever been a father diſpoſed to give his daughter to the one who beſt knew how to merit her, by a love at once the moſt ardent and reſpectful—that Bovile, whoſe deſpair, when they gave you to the arms of another, threatened to coſt him his life—that Bovile whom your ever reſpected commands, and yours alone, after ſuch a misfortune, could have perſuaded to live; yet had determined to live ſingle, that he might always have it in his power to worſhip your image with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction—that Bovile has altered his mind.</p>
                     <p>You wrote yeſterday, if I miſtake not, that my intended wife muſt be an engaging perſon; but you, more eaſily than any other perſon, will be perſuaded that this is not the reaſon why I have changed my former reſolution. I know otherwiſe, and what truth may not be told to you, Eleanor, whom no truth can offend, if it is not flattering nor diſhonourable? there is nothing, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more deceitful than the phyſiognomy of a young girl; I know that the moſt handſome are ſeldom the beſt. But if the one in queſtion were the beſt amongſt the greateſt beauties, I could not marry in a country where the bands of Hymen are bound with ſuch a frightful indiſſolubility, without ſome diffidence: nor am I inſenſible how neceſſary it is to know our own minds before we enter into an engagement which nothing but death can diſſolve. Nevertheleſs, every thing conſpires to convince me of the propriety of my conduct in haſtening my marriage with this young ſtranger, the daughter of my benefactor, and reſcuing her from the unhappy condition which they are preparing for her. But can ſhe, in good faith, ever cauſe me to repent the haſtineſs of my proceedings? Admitting that this woman may one

day be guilty of ingratitude, and wanting in due reſpect towards me, I ſhall then conſole myſelf, and juſtify my preſent conduct, by recollecting the motives which, at that time, gave me no liberty of choice nor reflection. On the contrary, what happineſs, what ſupreme felicity for us both— what an inexhauſtible ſource of enjoyment it would be, if I ſhould find ſhe poſſeſſes thoſe virtues which I may juſtly expect! if I ſhould find the ſweeteſt recompence of my imprudent ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in their very object! But be this as it may, can I, in this extraordinary inſtance, give way to perſonal conſiderations? Have I any right to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate when it is incumbent on me to fulfil an obligation? And if I ſhould, in this inſtance, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the performance of my duty, would it not be one, amongſt many inſtances, wherein ſelf-love has given countenance to ingratitude?</p>
                     <p>We ſhall neither of us forget, Eleanor, that a ridiculous and diſcouraging prejudice threatened to make me languiſh in the obſcurity of an inferior rank, in which obſcurity I might have died, and been of no ſervice to my country: but a brave man diſdained not to take notice of the little merit I poſſeſſed, without inquiring into my birth and rank in life. Thoſe officers who were noble fearing I might become their equal, did all in their power to prevent it; but my generous benefactor procured my advancement, and made me their ſuperior; raiſed me in ſpite of prejudice, and ſhielded me from the ſhafts of envy. Did he liſten to the mean counſels of perſonal intereſt, when, for my ſake, he incurred the reproach of his fellow officers, and the enmity of men in power? Was the courage he exerciſed in not abandoning me to the power of my enemies, leſs than that by which I ſhould now be
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035743_0038_1006AC57B932FD78"/>
actuated on marrying his daughter? That M. de Varmont, Eleanor, was a man ſuperior to the preſent generation. Notwithſtanding the enmity of a few individuals, our navy may well lament his loſs: but to me, the loſs is quite irreparable. To him do I owe my good fortune, my talents and fame. To him do I owe the unexpected happineſs of having, in early life, rendered impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervices to my country. I am now going in haſte to obtain the anſwer of Emilia.</p>

                     <p>WHERE is the woman ſo inſenſible to the charms of laudable actions, as not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud your noble conduct? Generous Bovile! if I had obſerved the ſame conduct in any other man, it would have gained my admiration, but obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in you does not excite my ſurpriſe: How I pity and deſpiſe young Varmont! How juſtly is he puniſhed for his hatred of the intereſting Emilia! How happy might he be if his heart was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally cruel! From how many, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motives to his, would ſome brothers have rejoiced on ſeeing you married to a ſiſter!</p>
                     <p>And where can we find ſuch a mother as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Varmont? Fortunately for mankind, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ſeldom produced her like.</p>
                     <p>You have juſt given me great chagrin, Bovile, without intending it. Receive my confidence, for I do not deſire to conceal from you any of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows or anxieties but ſuch as I am not permitted to reveal.</p>

What gives me the greateſt uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, to conſider that Murville, my elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is one of Varmont's intimate friends. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my brother is of a good diſpoſition, and a well-meaning perſon, he may be corrupted in his morals by ſuch a dangerous connection.</p>

                     <p>Yes, your brother-in-law! for by this time, without doubt, you are married. Oh that this union may be a recompence for your former mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes!

                     <p>MY mother, O Celina, has determined that I ſhould quit France—that I ſhould aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſiſter—that my exile and ſeparation from you ſhould be perpetual! All-ſeeing God! whoſe

piercing eyes can read the thoughts of men, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on their hearts, to thee can I appeal, and declare that I have never merited her hatred!</p>
                     <p>Of this circumſtance I was unacquainted till very lately, even at this critical moment while we are preparing for our embarkation. My huſband, wearied with my importunities, was not able to conceal any longer that horrible circumſtance.</p>
                     <p>You may now behold in me an inſtance of a wounded imagination, ſurrounded by perſecuting phantoms. No ſooner was I acquainted with the dreadful engagement my huſband had made, than I leaned forward againſt the window, upon my elbow, and gave myſelf up to grief. A young man, ſtanding in the ſtreet facing our inn, gazed at me with ſo much attention that he attracted mine. Judge how great was my terror when I ſuppoſed it to be my brother, and was ready to ſhrink from his ſight! yet, terrified as I was, my eyes were every moment mechanically turned towards the object of my fear; but he preſently turned round and went away, when, by obſerving his hair, I diſcovered my error. My brother's hair is of a deep red, but that of this young man was brown.</p>
                     <p>In a few minutes we ſhall be ready to ſail. I am going on board one of the ſhips belonging to the fleet of merchantmen, which is to be eſcorted by a ſquadron of armed ſhips, in which Bovile commands a frigate: for he choſe not to expoſe me with himſelf on board a ſhip ſubject to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and dangers of a naval engagement. We are bound to the Weſt-Indies, and at the end of our voyage he expects to leave me at Martinique, where he owns ſome plantations. He purpoſes to ſpend ſeveral months with me every year, at that place, and will devote to me every hour he can
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035743_0044_1006AC6E772AAE40"/>
ſpare from the duties of his ſtation. Kind Heaven, that takes pity on the unfortunate, has reſerved for me a recompence for my former unhappineſs, and has given it to me in the beſt of men, and moſt generous of huſbands. But ah, my deareſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina! what will become of thee? Thou art now alone. Methinks I now behold thee in gloomy ſolitude! Thou hadſt but one ſiſter, and ſhe is torn from thee forever. It will prove true, indeed, that on the day of my marriage I embraced my ſiſter for the laſt time.</p>
                     <p>A letter has juſt arrived in the well-known hand of Celina, and with eagerneſs I am going to read it.</p>

                     <p>THE day before yeſterday, Emilia, ſome hours after our parting, and your departure for Breſt, the ſon of Madame de Varmont—indeed ſhe inſiſts on my calling her by no other name than Madame de Varmont; and ſince ſhe, as well as her ſon, are nothing to me, and I have no longer any mother nor brother, he ought to be called M. de Varmont—M. de Varmont, then, has preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make me a viſit; but before I had time to reproach him for his hard-heartedneſs, his avarice, and that thirſt after riches which made him ſuffer, or rather deſire, I ſhould be ſacrificed; before I could ſay one word againſt it, he ſaid, "Your ſiſter, I
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035743_0045_1006AC782A011128"/>
hope, is well married, and my fortune, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, is greatly diminiſhed; you cannot, therefore, any longer accuſe me of ambition; for it was I who perſuaded Madame de Varmont to give little Emilia a dowry of ſix hundred thouſand livres."</p>
                     <p>As your had informed me that the generous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, in order to obtain you, was obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the receipt of a ſum they had never paid him, you can eaſily conceive what an effect his ſpeech had upon me. Deſirous of knowing whether he was undauntedly perſevering in falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and whether he could ſupport the weight of unmerited praiſe, I praiſed his benevolence, and extolled his juſtice. I can aſſure you, Emilia, that he ſeemed to hear me with that innocent and mild ſerenity, with that noble and virtuous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, which a few days before I had ſeen in your huſband, and which I ſhould have thought had never been obſervable in any men but ſuch as were really benevolent. But learn, my ſiſter, for it is neceſſary you ſhould be warned how much you ought to miſtruſt this moſt fatal enemy you can have; learn, I ſay, with what reflections he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded my approbation of him: "Doubtleſs," ſaid he (ſtrutting about with an air of ſelf-impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) "one would not willingly pay ſo handſome a ſum, but it is likely that it may be repaid me at ſome future time: your ſiſter is of a weakly conſtitution, and if ſhe ſhould die without any children, her huſband is able to repay me her dowry."</p>
                     <p>On hearing his laſt expreſſions, I trembled with indignation, and could ſcarcely forbear in loading him with reproaches; but cautiouſly checking my
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035743_0046_1006AC7A292080E0"/>
reſentment, I gave him an indignant, ſignificant glance, and withdrew.</p>
                     <p>A ſhort time ſince, a domeſtic of Madame de Varmont came to inquire of me, whether I had ſeen her ſon on the day before yeſterday. It ſeems, from this circumſtance, that he left Paris almoſt immediately after making me that viſit. All that is known reſpecting his departure is, that he took poſt horſes, and, for a ſervant, he took with him the inſolent Lafleur, whom he has made his friend and confidant. Although Madame de Varmont has been accuſtomed to the abſence of her ſon, ſhe ſeemed, in this inſtance of it, to be more anxious than uſual. The reaſon for her being peculiarly anxious ſeems to be, that he went away, this time, without taking leave of her: and I alſo, I muſt confeſs, am aſtoniſhed at a precipitation ſo great, and ſo full of myſtery. If he had nothing in view but going on thoſe parties of pleaſure which have ſometimes occupied him for whole weeks together, and with which our father was ſo much diſpleaſed, it ſeems ſtrange that he did not acquaint his mother of it, for he generally informs her of all his move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What then can be his intentions? Where can he be gone? Indeed I care not, provided he will go ſo far that he will never return to terrify either you or me with his odious preſence.</p>

                     <p>AH! what have I read? There never was a letter that came more ſeaſonably than yours; but it has redoubled the terror and anxiety with which I was agitated before. Can it be that it was Varmont whom but juſt now I ſaw? Heavens! how tormenting it is to fear thoſe we would wiſh to love! Can it be poſſible? It is poſſible, indeed, for I have been told that he might have painted his hair: and if it was he, moſt certainly he has not come here after me. What does he want of me? What more can he exact of a ſiſter, who is going into perpetual exile? Although I cannot imagine what his deſigns can be, I cannot but tremble, and ſhall feel reſtleſs till I am on board the ſhip; alas! on board the ſhip which is ſoon to meaſure the immenſity of ocean between the deſtination of Emilia and her abandoned ſiſter!

                     <p>YOU have become very humorous, M. de Varmont. Did you ever before come into a city where I was without making me a viſit? And when was it ever known before that your hair, which I have ſeen of a beautiful red (not wiſhing to offend you), has, chamelion like, changed to ſo dark a ſhade, as to indicate ſome intended miſchief at heart? However, lord Jupiter, in ſpite of your ſimple diſguiſe, I knew you at the firſt glance of my eye; and if you pleaſe, you may aſk M. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur, your Mercury, whether I have loſt my ſkill in phyſiognomy. At firſt he lied, evaded my queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſwore it was neither you nor he; but I brandiſhed my cane over him, and made him confeſs that he was Socia, and that you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at Breſt, acting the Amphitrion.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>The Amphitrion is a French comedy, written by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier; it is founded on the following ancient ſtory: Jupiter came from above attended by Mercury: Jupiter and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Mercury, in a fit of gallantry, took on them the forms of Amphitrion and Socia, who was Amphitrion's ſervant. In this diſguiſe, while the honeſt huſbands were abſent, Jupiter took poſſeſſion of Amphitrion's wife, and Mercury that of Socia. Neither of the wives could diſcover the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the uſurpers and their huſbands, who were driven from their own doors at their return.</p>

                     <p>But your rogue of a valet has ended in making
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035743_0049_1006AC876FECEBC0"/>
me his dupe. I obliged him, as I ſuppoſed, to direct me to your lodgings; but, inſtead of that, he gave me a falſe direction. Yeſterday evening I looked for you every where, but learned, to my vexation, that your honor was not to be found. This morning, at break of day, being called home by urgent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, I left Breſt, wiſhing you, my diſloyal friend, all the bad ſucceſs in the world.</p>
                     <p>Are you not ſurpriſed that I have made ſo little progreſs in my journey, that I am no farther than Chateaulin this evening? I'll tell you the reaſon, my friend: 'tis becauſe I am born to good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as well as you: for at day-break this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, between Breſt and Doulas, I found a prize, a ſweet young female, upon the highway. You will be ready to inquire what ſhe was doing there. I'll tell you, my friend: She was moſt gently winding her way towards the other world, and if my poſtilion had not taken care, he would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully have aſſiſted her in finiſhing her courſe; for he partly rode over her, which ſo affected me that I could not be comforted. Only conſider, that even in a ſwoon, apparently dead or dying, her hands bloody, and her face wounded, ſhe had ſtill a thouſand charms. Muſt ſhe not then be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely beautiful?</p>
                     <p>But who could have left her in ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Some ſavage beaſt, moſt certainly! for it is impoſſible but ſuch beauty muſt have diſarmed the fierceſt barbarian amongſt men. The next queſtion is, to whom does ſhe belong? I cannot tell, for ſhe is yet ſpeechleſs. What I moſt wiſh to know is, whether ſhe is a wife or a maid. But I hope ſhe will ſpeedily recover, and then I ſhall ſoon ſettle that point without perplexing her with queſtions. In ſuch caſes I prefer ſearching;
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035743_0050_1006AC925B5AE248"/>
and have more faith in its reſult than a thouſand interrogatories. I love to ſee for myſelf.</p>
                     <p>In expectation of that happy moment, and as a preparatory ſtep to it, I put the fair cripple in my poſt chaiſe. For that purpoſe I engaged freſh horſes from thence to Doulas; for in the miſerable village where we were there was no phyſician to be found. We came as far as Chateaulin: here I am, writing to you near the bed of my fair pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, who is ſcarcely any better.</p>
                     <p>I can now acquaint you with ſomething quite ſingular, and which has not a little alarmed me. Whilſt writing to you I chanced to mention your name, and had no ſooner done ſo than ſhe repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Overjoyed at hearing her ſpeak for the firſt time, I ran precipitately to her bed. She, ſeemingly, exerted all her ſtrength to look at me; but with a look full of anxiety and confuſion, "Varmont!" ſaid ſhe, "do you know him?"</p>
                     <p>"Know him," anſwered I; "yes, I am his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friend." Upon this ſhe ſprang to the other ſide of the bed, as if terrified at the ſight of me. "Are you alſo acquainted with Vermont?" con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I. But the poor little creature was gone. Notwithſtanding her ſwoon, the phyſician, who has not diſcovered any dangerous wound upon her, expects that in a few days ſhe will be able to give us her hiſtory; and I have made a ſtand here, in order to wait upon her: ſhe is well worth the pains; and when there is a fair proſpect of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery I ſhall take her away with me.</p>
                     <p>Now I think of it, what a deal of noiſe they made laſt night in the harbour of Breſt! Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous raſcals attempted to burn the fleet and the convoy, which was ſoon expected to ſail. It was ſaid that the Pallas had been on fire, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035743_0051_1006AC9427565BB8"/>
of the captain had ſaved it. That Bovile is a prodigy of vigilance and activity, and although I do not like him, I am forced, in ſpite of me, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem him and do him juſtice. Well would it be for him if all his enemies reſembled me; for he has a multitude of them, and ſome are moſt implacable. When I left the captains of the ſquadron they were in a diſpoſition which forebodes nothing good to him. I will bet an hundred againſt one that he will not have a proſperous campaign. And what ſilly demon adviſed your father to take a ſubject who was but a common ſailor in a merchant ſhip to incorporate him with us? Why ſhould he wiſh to have him outſtrip every body elſe, and ſupport him as a captain againſt wind and tide? It was ſhocking to ſerve a man ſo; he might as well have drowned him.</p>
                     <p>Ah! I had forgot; I was told that one of the merchant ſhips in the fleet had blown up. Fie upon it! the accounts were exaggerated. As for myſelf, I had too much and too urgent buſineſs to permit my longer ſtay, ſo that I was obliged to come off without going into the harbour for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inquiries. That the Pallas received but little damage, and the reſt of the fleet remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt, is important. But as for the ſhip blown up, it was but a merchantman, a mere trifle! As for commercial affairs, I don't concern myſelf with them.</p>
                     <p>Farewell, Varmont; I am going to feel the pulſe of my little patient. If ſhe does not run diſtracted on hearing the name of Varmont, and proves to be an acquaintance of yours, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you. You muſt inform me who ſhe is; what is the beſt mode of commencing an attack upon her, and what hopes I may entertain of being ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. But never fear; I truſt that by the time
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035743_0052_1006AC990B00C1D8"/>
your anſwer will arrive, I ſhall have nothing to hope for. You know I am not fond of long ſieges, but beſt pleaſed with a ſudden aſſault.</p>
                     <p>Since you are ſo prudently concealed in Breſt, I ſhall not ſend this letter to you there, but ſhall, in great innocence, direct it to M. de Varmont at Paris.</p>

                     <p>She paſſed the laſt night in almoſt continual faintneſs. Her attendants underſtood nothing ſhe ſaid, for her ſpeech was incoherent, and her voice extremely feeble. Only in ſome inſtances, when her fever increaſed ſo much as to give her unuſual ſtrength, ſhe cried out: "Fire!" and a moment afterwards, by a ſtriking contradiction, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a villain, who, ſhe ſaid, aſſaſſinated her, and caſt her into the water.</p>
                     <p>That a daring young fellow might have wiſhed to burn her, I can eaſily conceive, and, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, can conceive with what flame; and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he had not been unſucceſsful, I could pardon the attempt. But to aſſaſſinate her! to drown her! to deſtroy heaven's maſter-piece, and give her the waves for a ſepulchre! If the whole universe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains one man who could have conceived ſuch a
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035743_0053_1006AC9B19AE95C0"/>
horrible thought, he might deſervedly be called a villain. But I determine, for the honor of human nature, to ſupport it as an impoſſibility, until ſuch times as the exiſtence of ſuch a monſter can be proved.</p>
                     <p>Could you Varmont, (a name ſhe cannot hear without ſhuddering with horror), commit crimes of this nature? No; it is not even poſſible. What ſeems moſt probable is, that you have innocently conſpired againſt what ſhe, like all other girls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly calls her honor; and as you are not very ſkilful in the art of pleaſing, I can eaſily divine how the whole romance was carried on. In the firſt place, ſhe repulſed your aukward addreſſes with firmneſs; then my poor friend called haſtily to his aid the principle, that when flattering ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes will not avail, he may be juſtified in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force. This, between you and me, is a little brutal. But avoiding digreſſions; in the next place, the affrighted fair one, finding every door faſt ſhut, made her eſcape by jumping out of the window; and if, by misfortune, ſhe met with any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident on the highway before I found her, ſhe will tell me what it was. But as for theſe ſurrounding flames, theſe purſuing waves, and the cruel aſſaſſin who wiſhes to deſtroy her, they are but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of her delirium in a burning fever. We know how greatly the mental powers are diſordered when the body is tortured with pain.</p>
                     <p>This morning, as I went into her chamber, ſhe opened her eyes, and in ſome meaſure recovered her ſenſes: then ſhe aſked me, "Where we were?"</p>
                     <p>"At Chateaulin, Mademoiſelle," anſwered I. I ſaid Mademoiſelle, becauſe it is ſo agreeable to ſay what we deſire may prove true; for greatly did I deſire ſhe might prove to be a girl.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:035743_0054_1006AC9E31769130"/>"O that I might be carried to Breſt again," cried ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible," anſwered I; "it is impoſſible to take you to that place."</p>
                     <p>"Though I ſhould die there," continued ſhe, "I could wiſh to rejoin the fleet."</p>
                     <p>"The fleet has ſailed."</p>
                     <p>"Sailed!" cried ſhe: and with a deep ſigh and a look of unſpeakable anguiſh, ſhe again cloſed her charming eyes.</p>
                     <p>This evening, having come to herſelf again, ſhe aſked me, "Where we were?"</p>
                     <p>"At Chateaulin," Mademoiſelle, ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>"But who are you, Sir?"</p>
                     <p>"I am Murville." Like an echo which rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berates the laſt ſyllables in a ſentence, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them, ſhe ſeveral times ſaid, "ville, ville!" Then a little recovering her ſtrength, ſhe half-raiſed herſelf, and leaning on her arms, exhibited the moſt exquiſite figure I ever beheld; her eyes were fixed on me, and her air was ſo engaging, that it touched me to my very ſoul. She had not, as yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, an air of terror and anxiety, but of intereſt and ſatisfaction: "ville, ville!" repeated ſhe with a moſt charming accent. "Pray repeat your name, Sir; I heard but the end of it."</p>
                     <p>"Murville, Mademoiſelle." She ſeemed to be fatigued by reaſon of the extreme attention ſhe gave me, and could no longer ſupport herſelf againſt her weakneſs, but fell down upon her bed almoſt as lifeleſs as before.</p>
                     <p>It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the charming girl has ſome attachment, and although I cannot divine whether it is an attachment by love or marriage, yet I am confident ſhe is ſome way attached to a happy mortal, whoſe name terminates like mine.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035743_0055_1006ACA2B29979D8"/>
So much the better for me; it is a fortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which I conſider as a favourable omen. Your name, my dear friend, ſounds not ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in her ears: hear what has juſt paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and judge for yourſelf.</p>
                     <p>A ſhort time ſince ſhe aſked, with tears in her eyes, "Is the fleet departed?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Mademoiſelle."</p>
                     <p>"What! all the ſhips and all the Captains?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, all."</p>
                     <p>"Then I muſt die! now I am bereft of every hope, and every ſupport; and into what hands have I fallen!"—"Into the hands of a civil man," replied I, "who ſwears that he will never do you the leaſt injury."</p>
                     <p>"No injury!" repeated ſhe. "Can it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I have been deceived? Have you not mentioned the name of a certain perſon?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I mentioned my own name, which is Murville."</p>
                     <p>"But another, another! Ah! it is poſſible that in my fearful delirium I might have been dreaming; and now I am awake, ſuppoſe it to have been a reality. Did you not tell me, Sir, that you were the intimate friend of —"</p>
                     <p>"Of Varmont; yes, young woman, I did tell you ſo." Poor Varmont! I am grieved for you! But painful as it may be, I muſt tell you the truth: This is the ſecond time ſhe has fainted on hearing your name mentioned.</p>

                     <p>BELIEVE me, Varmont, ſhe does not love you at all. Hear the converſation we have had together, and you will be convinced of it.</p>
                     <p>"What have I done to you?" ſaid ſhe. Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was ſtill delirious, I made no reply.</p>
                     <p>"What have I done to you, M. Murville, to deſerve your hatred?"</p>
                     <p>This ſpeech was ſo well directed to me that I inſtantly replied: "You have done nothing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe me, young woman, and I am very far from hating you."</p>
                     <p>"Why then are you connected with the cruel men who perſecute me?"</p>

                     <p>"In truth I am not; I am in no one's intereſt but my own."</p>
                     <p>"Who delivered me into your hands?"</p>
                     <p>"You came into my hands by mere accident; you was dying on the public road. There it was that I found you; I took you up, and ſpared no pains to reſtore you to your ſenſes."</p>
                     <p>"What were your motives?"</p>
                     <p>"Your ſituation excited my pity, and I was charmed with your beauty."</p>
                     <p>"But have you no intention of delivering me into the hands of him you call your friend?"</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>"No," replied I with earneſtneſs, "I would not deliver you into the hands of the greateſt monarch on earth; believe me, I ſhould be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely happy if I might be permitted to keep you for myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"And would you defend me againſt him?"</p>
                     <p>"Againſt him? yes, againſt the whole world."</p>
                     <p>"Will you take that engagement upon you?"</p>
                     <p>"Whilſt you confide in my protection no one ſhall do you the leaſt injury, I give you my word for it, and pledge my honor."</p>
                     <p>For a while ſhe ſeemed to be more eaſy, and ſomewhat relieved from a load of anxiety; but a little afterwards, with an anxious look, ſhe ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"How can I rely on the word of a man who is his friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Truly, young woman, I cannot do myſelf juſtice without acknowledging that I am not a very good ſubject, but I ſhould do myſelf no injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by ſaying that I am a better one than he."</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" replied ſhe, "where can a worſe than he be found?"</p>
                     <p>This laſt reflection of her's ſhows how little ſhe eſteems you, and proves her to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your merit: but this is a matter of your own concern, and you muſt take it upon yourſelf.</p>
                     <p>For myſelf, I have ſworn to defend her againſt every enemy. By theſe aſſurances ſhe was ſo much encouraged, that her phyſician, in a few hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, found her much better; her fever was greatly diminiſhed; ſhe no longer appeared to be the prey of continual perturbation; thoſe fits of

extreme anguiſh which made us deſpair of her life had ſubſided. Her body, however, was ſtill in a languiſhing ſtate, and her mind alternately labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſome weighty affliction. The departure of the fleet was to her a cauſe of great grief; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that ſhe ſometimes cried bitterly.</p>
                     <p>Forbear, Varmont, forbear to lay claim to her, for if ſhe don't cordially deteſt you, may the devil fly away with me!</p>
                     <p>Tell me, then, vain miniature of ſelf-love, tell me, Varmont (in a whiſper), whether you had not a rival who went away in the fleet whom ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to you?</p>
                     <p>In further converſation with her, I plunged her again into her former ſad condition, by one unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate word. Who could have foreſeen ſo great an accident?</p>
                     <p>"You are continually ſpeaking of Breſt, young woman; have you any family connections there?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" cried ſhe pityfully, "I have loſt all my relations!"</p>
                     <p>"Did your father go away in the fleet?"</p>
                     <p>"As for my father, I have but too ſoon loſt him?"</p>
                     <p>"Your mother? your brother? Have you any brother?"</p>
                     <p>"My brother! my brother!" repeated ſhe in a frightful voice; and on a ſudden her countenance was entirely changed, and by a convulſive motion ſhe threw her arms forward and her head back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a frantic manner; drops of cold ſweat ran down her face, increaſing with paleneſs to ſuch a degree that I feared ſhe could live but a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>It is clear, Varmont, that amongſt all thoſe whom ſhe conſiders as her perſecutors, you are not the moſt deteſtable. It is evident that ſhe has a

                     <p>YOUR ſilence aſtoniſhes me, my friend; you ought to be perfectly ſatisfied with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. For three days paſt I have written regularly by every courier. Whenever I have quitted a public houſe, I enjoined it upon the hoſt to ſend forward immediately any letters which might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from Paris, directed to me; but I can hear nothing from you after all my pains. Without examining any further into the reaſons why you have denied me the information I might juſtly have expected from you, I am ſtill willing to repoſe in you ſome confidence.</p>
                     <p>For a beginning I will take the trouble of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over my former diſpatches: after this inform you that a part of my conjectures is verified, but that the other was deſtitute of common ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>This terrible brother who gave me ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs is the object whoſe departure ſhe mourns, whom ſhe often calls from on board the fleet; it is he whom ſhe holds moſt dear: you have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no rival in the fleet. It ſeems, then, that the poor creature has had no admirer but you. This was quite unfortunate for her; ſhe deſerved a much better fate. But for me, who muſt be a great
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035743_0060_1006ACBACF9AF6F0"/>
gainer by a compariſon with you, it will be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fortunate. As to the conformity of that name, which terminated ſo much like mine, and which I conſidered as ſuch a lucky circumſtance, I feel more happy on that account than ever, for it happens to be the ſame as her's. She calls herſelf by the name of Terville. But what gives me the greateſt ſatisfaction is, to learn that ſhe is really a maid. M. de Varmont, I hope ſhe is ſo in every ſenſe of the word; I hope, that ſince you had the ill addreſs of letting her get away, that ſhe did ſo before you accompliſhed what ſhe calls your crime.</p>
                     <p>Ah, the cunning little gipſy! becauſe ſhe wiſhes to ſpare herſelf the bluſhes that a relation of her tribulations and your inſults might occaſion her, ſhe has beſought me never to pronounce your name in her hearing, nor ſay any thing about you in any converſation. She has my promiſe that I will not; but I am not ſo much her dupe as to fulfil that promiſe; for I expect in your great frankneſs, that you will readily make known all thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which her diſcreet modeſty forbids her to reveal.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another engagement ſhe has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to make with her, which is, that I am never to give you any information concerning her, and above all things, not to acquaint you with her being in my poſſeſſion: and as ſoon as I informed her what I could not but acknowledge, that you already knew how ſhe came into my hands, ſhe manifeſted the ſtrongeſt deſires of leaving Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin and flying to this place. We came here yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and the poor creature was ſo full of miſery that we were forced to make three ſhort journies of it. Since our arrival at Langey ſhe has been much better; her wounds are almoſt healed; her
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035743_0061_1006ACBF5F344800"/>
nights are more comfortable; her fever is almoſt gone; and her appetite returns. How I rejoice to think, that in a few days ſhe will recover her health, her winning graces, and florid complexion! then ſhall I behold her in all her native beauty; then ſhe will be worthy of all my attention!</p>
                     <p>She has made me ſwear to protect her until ſhe is entirely reſtored to health; but I rely on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting her a much longer time: and though I promiſed not to give you any account of her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and place of retreat, I ſee no neceſſity of keeping my word, becauſe I do not fancy thoſe inconveniences which ſhe imagines may ariſe on account of ſuch a diſcloſure. Can it be poſſible that M. de Varmont will be ſo unreaſonable as not to yield to the influence of my ſtars, which have, in this inſtance, gained over his ſuch an evident aſcendency? No; certainly he will not be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate as to purſue a handſome girl to my houſe, when ſhe has only eſcaped from his arms to fall into mine.</p>
                     <p>Would it be juſt in you to look ſurly at me, in caſe I ſhould not be willing to let you have her again? If you ſhould, I would publiſh your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant behaviour. Am I to blame becauſe you were never capable of winning the affections of one woman? Muſt I, when I have found means of winning thoſe you cannot, immediately abandon them to gratify your ſpleen? Here, for inſtance is a lovely girl whom you have tormented and frightened to death; but I have found her, cheered and coaxed her, and prepared her for myſelf. You could never have done any thing with her; but I, in a little time, ſhall do all I can wiſh to do. In ſuch a caſe you ought to give me a complete reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. If you can derive any conſolation from it,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035743_0062_1006ACC3E8131C08"/>
lament the loſs of her. Caſt a longing look out of the window from which ſhe made her eſcape; but give up all thoughts of ever ſeeing her again. Are you deſirous of trying my candour and juſtice on this point? if ſo, come to-morrow and ſee whether the weak creature will give you the preference to me; and, if ſhe will, I will immediately give her up. Come, come, Varmont, ſay no more about her, but anſwer me without delay.</p>

                     <p>O ELEANOR! fortune was ſoon weary of regarding me with ſmiles! ſo great are her firſt reverſes, that it requires all my courage to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them!</p>
                     <p>We were yeſterday almoſt ready to ſail, when the wind aroſe with ſuch violence as to make us fear an approaching tempeſt. So great were our alarms that we remained in port, not daring to riſk the convoy in ſuch a dangerous ſtorm as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended would take place; but there was only a ſudden guſt of wind, which we ought not to have feared; yet, in obedience to the ſignals, we were obliged to come to anchor. This delay has coſt us dear. There is every reaſon for believing that if we had ſailed laſt evening, according to our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our merchants would not have to-day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the loſs of the richeſt ſhip in the fleet; nor I, Eleanor, the loſs of a treaſure unſpeakably more
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035743_0063_1006ACC79608ABB8"/>
precious than theirs; a treaſure of whoſe value I had begun to be very ſenſible, although it had been but a ſhort time in my poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>About midnight, the Centaure, the ſhip in which my wife was embarked, blew up with a dreadful exploſion. So violent was the exploſion, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral broken, flaming parts of it were driven to the Pallas,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Pallas was the name of the frigate commanded by Bovile.</note> and it was with the greateſt difficulty and the moſt ſpeedy exertions, that the burning of that ſhip was prevented. Conceive the horrors of my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the intereſting Emilia is loſt, whilſt the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my ſhip requires all my attention. Even at the preſent moment, whilſt I am writing to you, I muſt not, and cannot without diſtraction, give way to grief for my loſs. The intereſt of my country compels me away; I muſt depart; I muſt fulfil my duty.</p>
                     <p>This morning, whilſt the neceſſary repairs of the Pallas were in forwardneſs, I went on ſhore, and made fruitleſs and melancholy ſearches for Emilia. The ſea brought none but dead bodies to the ſhore; but neither the body of Emilia, nor any trace of her was to be found.</p>
                     <p>Unhappy woman! why did I not leave her in the cloiſter? In taking her away from what ſhe called her tomb, I have more certainly brought her to an untimely end. When I put her on board this ſhip, I placed her on her funeral pile. Every precaution I have taken for her ſafety or happineſs has produced a contrary effect. Alas! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing is human prudence!</p>
                     <p>A conſideration which increaſes my affliction is, that there probably are amongſt my implacable
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035743_0064_1006ACCF06C19D40"/>
enemies, ſome who are ſuch accompliſhed villains, that no means of revenge would be left untried by them, were they ever ſo baſe. They had no hopes of beginning the fire on board of my ſhip, for they knew that my vigilance never ſlumbers; but they flattered themſelves that from the Centaure, near which we lay at anchor, the flames might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Pallas; they knew alſo that I would ſooner periſh with my ſhip than abandon it. This conjecture, horrible as it is, appears but too well founded. There was but one man ſaved out of the whole crew of the Centaure; and, if we may believe him, he was ſaved by nothing leſs than a miracle. But we all know the character of this ſailor, and how diſobedient he is to the orders of the Captain; for he jumps into the ſea at the leaſt appearance of danger. However it may be, his depoſition is as follows:</p>
                     <p>"That he ſlept like the reſt of the crew till he was diſturbed by a light noiſe. He ſaw a boat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by one man only, coming on board the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taure, and one of the paſſengers received the watch from the ſide of the ſhip as he deſcended from it, and jumped into the boat. At the ſame inſtant he, the deponent, gave an alarm; but it was too late, for the fire was inſtantly diſcovered in ſeveral parts of the ſhip at once, and, in a moment afterwards, it blew up with a horrible exploſion, although it was not laden with any warlike ſtores."</p>
                     <p>Now, Eleanor, tell me what you think of it, whether you do not believe the loſs of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taure was more likely to have been effected by a horrible conſpiracy, than the inexcuſable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Captain. Tell me whether you do not believe they had been plotting my deſtruction. Cruel men! if they had nothing more in view than,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035743_0065_1006ACD5452444D8"/>
by adverſity, to ſoften the ſtoiciſm for which they reproach me, they have but too well ſucceeded. I lament the loſs of my young wife, ſo ſoon ſnatched away from my enraptured eyes—perhaps from my growing affection. My young ſpouſe is now no more—one of the world's faireſt ornaments has been a mere haſty paſſenger through it. Alas! it has appeared but a moment to leave a more laſting remembrance of it, like a roſe which we have ſeen in a fine vernal morning, ready to unfold its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the ſun, whoſe fleeting luſtre and tranſitory graces we remember with livelieſt regret in the winter, whilſt ſurrounded with ice and ſnow. I mourn her rare attractions forever loſt; but the moſt laſting ſorrow I ſhall feel, will not be on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her youth, talents, nor periſhable beauty, but the train of amiable and ſubſtantial virtues, whoſe germ was implanted in her heart. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her precipitately, without knowing her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and diſpoſition. But whilſt another poſſeſſes you, ah! how long a time would be requiſite for making another choice ſo good as the one I lately made! I cannot but weep! Deign to think, Eleanor, that there are ſome misfortunes ſo great as to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the greateſt fortitude—deign to think that Bovile's ſituation requires the conſolations of friendſhip!</p>

                     <p>INDEED, Murville, I cannot tell what to think of your ſublime nonſenſe! A dear brother call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the fleet—a rival in the fleet—a girl eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! May heaven confound me if I underſtand a word of all this!</p>
                     <p>Your Mademoiſelle de Terville has many tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and fears. So much the worſe for her. Does ſhe have more comfortable nights? Does her appetite return? So much the better for you. Do all you can and all you pleaſe with her health and graces, it will divert me; and the devil take me if this is not the firſt time I have heard any thing about her.</p>
                     <p>To continue: my great frankneſs, Sir, will not, in this matter, nor any other, have any thing to do with your dull impertinence. I have told you a thouſand times before, and now tell you ſeriouſly, that you make uſe of language ſo inſulting that I ſhall not put up with it. Upon the whole, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, it ſeems you have written to me, I know not from whence, ſeveral letters before theſe I have received, which have not come to hand, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it of little conſequence whether they do or not.</p>

                     <p>AHA! you diſown the pretty girl, and are affronted. You are then more in love than I apprehended. That you are in love, I can eaſily divine, for I who am writing to you, am often ready to yield to its influence myſelf. Excellent perſon! how much more ſhould I be pleaſed with her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and modeſt airs, if they gave leſs uneaſineſs? And ſince ſhe ſeems ſo affected with my careful attention, ſo charmed with the leaſt reſpect ſhown her, how can I tell her that I am diſintereſted? It would be much more agreeable to hear her ſpeak of her gratitude, if ſhe did not accompany the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion with aſſurances of her eſteem. This begins to bear hard upon me; for the eſteem of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent girl is to me an intolerable burden; and ſhe is, I believe, as perfect a picture of innocence as I am of libertiniſm.</p>
                     <p>When I am not in her preſence, I come to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and return to my natural feelings; and in order to reduce my adverſary, form admirable projects; projects ſometimes ſo violent as would become a character like yours: but let her come into my ſight, and I ſtand confounded in the unactive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of her charms. Her charms, which even now, in the beginning of her convaleſcence, are ſuperior to the vaſt idea I had formed of them! I ſtand ſtruck with amazement, view and admire her, but can proceed no further!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:035743_0068_1006ACE3B8E92338"/>But of what can I accuſe myſelf? Is there at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any thing better to be done? The time for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes moſt certainly is not yet come. To attack her now would be the wrong way of obtaining her affections—this would be no better than downright violation.</p>
                     <p>I cannot deny that her preſence confounds me: ſhe ſpeaks only, and I am diſconcerted: ſhe looks at me, and I am melted into tenderneſs; the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my thoughts is inſtantly diſſipated; I no longer feel any other than thoſe ſilly emotions, the emotions which come from the heart. What an enchantreſs! How eaſily are the moſt ardent paſſions calmed by the accents of her ſweet voice! What bold reſolutions are vanquiſhed by her timid looks! In ſhort, how powerful is her weakneſs!</p>
                     <p>Good God! what have I been writing! it frightens me. Hah, it is done! it is all over with me! undone forever! I have become—amorous; in love after the manner of certain folks whoſe ſituation has often excited my mirth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Soon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, ſoon ſhall I be reduced to the bleſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe amuſing gentlemen whom we have often ſeen, and for a long time, dying with Platonic love: going perpetually from door to door, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the innocence, ſeverity and chaſtity of their miſtreſs to every perſon they meet.</p>
                     <p>O no, Mademoiſelle, no! you ſhall love after my faſhion; if you don't, zounds! you ſhall go to M. de Varmont again; he'll attack you in a ſoft, polite and delicate manner, and will not ſhrink from your prudiſh airs.</p>
                     <p>In fact, I wonder at myſelf! what needleſs blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, what waſting of paper is this! when I firſt began I intended to anſwer your harmleſs epiſtle in a word or two. Now I am not ſurpriſed that you

pretended, as I ſuppoſed, not to underſtand my late letter; my valet, a Briton blockhead, who took charge of my diſpatches at Chateaulin, inſtead of carrying them to the poſt-office, took it in his head to go and treat his countrymen at the tavern; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt felt in his pockets, I found my three firſt letters again, and now ſend them incloſed. Read them, my dear Sir, and you will find that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Terville is really an old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your's, and that all diſſimulation on your part will be fruitleſs. To conclude; I make no doubt, but after a little reflection, you will get rid of that fit of ill humour with which you was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; but if, on the contrary, you determine to take the thing in earneſt, M. de Varmont, beware of taking needleſs trouble.</p>

                     <p>YES, 'tis Emilia who writes to you; Emilia, by a prodigy ſnatched from the moſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening dangers.</p>
                     <p>You remember how I was terrified at the ſight of my brother, and ſtill more by your letter which informed me of his myſterious departure, and ſcarcely breathed before I went on board the ſhip, which I conſidered to be the ſafeſt of aſylums. Senſeleſs wretch! there it was that the ſnares of death ſurrounded me.</p>
                     <p>I ſlept there, however—but oh, with what ſleep! what dreams diſturbed my repoſe! an aſſaſſin hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his naked ſword at my breaſt, demanded my life and inheritance. It was the young man I ſaw in Breſt; but I was no longer deceived by the falſe colour of his hair; it was red; his hands alſo— merciful God! his murderous hands were ſtained with my blood!</p>
                     <p>On a ſudden I was awaked by a frightful tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and beheld the ſhip in flames; I called aloud for Bovile, but he could neither hear nor aſſiſt me. My fear increaſing as faſt as the rapid conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to eſcape the flames I fell into the ſea. The ſea in great commotion rolled with boiſterous waves; often was I plunged as it were to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the deep, and as often raiſed again to the ſurface of the waters; at length being driven againſt a boat, I clung to it, and implored the aſſiſtance of two men who were in it, but who were ſcarcely viſible, to take me in; one of them held out an aſſiſting hand, the other—Oh, Celina! Celina! the pen falls from my trembling hand—the other— Ah, my ſiſter! for pity's ſake make me believe, that overpowered by a too real danger amongſt the raging billows which re-demanded their prey, my imagination, tormented with diſmal forebodings, and harraſſed with the ideas of my troubleſome dream, has formed an imaginary enemy and unreal dangers. Strive to perſuade me, that though in the fearful diſorder of my ſenſes, I was not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken as to the frightful words I am going to relate. I might at leaſt have been deceived as to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible voice that uttered them. With trembling, my ſiſter, I confeſs that I recognized—I believe — I conſent to ſay ſo—that I recognized the voice of the hard-hearted young man who lately came ſo often, in behalf of Madame de Varmont, to tell me that I alſo was born to die in the cloiſter.

What I heard, and but too well underſtood, was, "What are you doing? Perhaps it is ſhe! puſh her off! ſtrike her!" O my ſiſter, I hear thoſe dreadful words a thouſand times in a day! and in every interval of recollection the dreadful voice of Varmont reſounds in my ears!</p>
                     <p>Believe me, Celina, however horrible my ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions may appear, they are ſo well founded that I ſhall not be tempted to ſeek further information. Ah! I beſeech you, let the execrable ſecret remain eternally between my ſiſter and me!</p>
                     <p>I am yet ſo feeble and ſo dejected that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly continue my relation; for thoſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ideas which are frequently repreſented to my mind in all their horror, ſtill overpower me.

                     <p>WELL, how fares it with you, my dear Dolerval! you have not written to me in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035743_0072_1006ACF5DBAB7348"/>
a long time. What has become of you? Will neither muſic, painting, geography, botany, nor a thouſand ſimilar trifles, give you one moment of leaſure? That I neglect you a little myſelf is a thing of courſe, for I am conſtantly in purſuit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable objects. At preſent I am peculiarly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, having now in my mind, and hoping ſoon to have in my arms, the rare attractions of a young laſs about ſixteen.</p>
                     <p>How you would be charmed with the ſweet creature! She ſeems to poſſeſs, in a ſupreme degree, that precious ſenſibility which has ſo tainted our unhappy ſiſter, and which you are ſo abundantly full of yourſelf—yes, you, my poor Dolerval, upon whoſe beautiful countenance it may be ſeen at a mile's diſtance. Don't you know, my brother, that this effeminate tenderneſs of yours gives you an air of innocence that makes you look ſhockingly? So ſhockingly you look, that I am ſometimes forced to confeſs to myſelf that you muſt have, in one reſpect, more ſenſe than I have, or you could not, in ſpite of that good natured mien, appear to have ſo much ſenſe remaining.</p>
                     <p>But let us return to the dear girl, for I ſtrive in vain to ſpeak of any thing elſe. Leap for joy, my brother! there is in the world one virtuous girl, and ſo virtuous as to make one tremble on ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her. She is alſo poſſeſſed of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common modeſty that I cannot but laugh whilſt her preſence overawes me. Very baſhful beſides, as baſhful as Dolerval by the ſide of a young girl! There is one thing between you and her, that puzzles me beyond meaſure. How is it? Do you take it upon you to mimic her prudiſh airs, or has ſhe, on the contrary, really ſtolen them from you? When I behold her I can ſcarcely perſuade myſelf
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035743_0073_1006ACF9EDFCF300"/>
that I ſee any thing more than a copy; but when I reflect on the innocence of your manners, I tremble leſt ſhe may be the original in diſguiſe. It would be a fine affair to ſee you ſide by ſide! What an excellent ſubject for the imitation of a painter! Upon honor, Dolerval, ſhe was made for none but you, and if I were but a little leſs taken with her, I would ſend her to you to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the ſtage.</p>
                     <p>But of this, my friend, there is no poſſibility; for I find myſelf in ſo good a way, and ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in it, that I cannot ſtop. This morning I preſumed to make her ſome propoſals. That ſhe was not ſurpriſed at them is very well; but I am very ſorry ſhe was not offended, for I could much better reſiſt her anger, than overcome her mild confidence. Worſe than this, ſhe turned my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to noble ſentiments, and talked in awful language. I acknowledged to her, that I had a great veneration for the ſublime virtues, confeſſing, at the ſame time, my inability of attaining to their heroiſm. But the preſumptuous little creature fooliſhly replied, that ſhe had too much eſteem for me to deſpair of teaching me the practice of them. Tell me then, Dolerval, is wiſdom ingrafted by accident? You who are ſo full of it muſt certainly know.</p>
                     <p>But a little while ago I was ſpeaking of your innocence. What has become of it, Dolerval? What do you do with it? Excellent fellow! What a memorable example you will leave to the preſent corrupt generation!</p>
                     <p>The truth is, you are walking gravely along in the footſteps of your romantic ſiſter! and as ſhe is alſo mine, I could wiſh for her own good to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe her to change her courſe. Let her learn then,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035743_0074_1006AD020E7942E0"/>
that when an old fellow marries a young woman, to bear his pocket expences, he muſt expect to put up with the little inconveniences of matrimony: and provided his young wife beſtows on her old huſband what little he ſtands in need of, ſhe may in good conſcience diſpoſe of the innocent but troubleſome ſuperfluity that remains—a ſuperfluity which her boſom friend has the privilege of uſing or neglecting at his will. Tell her this from me— underſtand me—let her conſider it well. It will happen very naturally, that Bovile, whom, upon your word, I believe to be very amiable, may, at his next return, become very happy. Old Florival will have nothing to loſe by this arrangement, but his wife will have every thing to gain. Then ſhe will revive; then ſhe will leave off pining in ſuch a pitiful manner. Let her determine upon it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. This ſhould have been done ſeven years ago.</p>
                     <p>I am not going to forſake you; upon you ſhall I be laviſh in beſtowing good principles—Oh that ſomebody would do the ſame by me! Give me your opinion, Dolerval, concerning the conduct I muſt obſerve towards Mademoiſelle de Terville. Let me ſee whether you adviſe me to uſe violent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with her or not.</p>
                     <p>Give me your ſentiments, Dolerval, I beſeech you. Varmont will ſoon give me his in writing. Take care that his letter does not come before yours. He will adviſe me to try my ſtrength with her; but you will counſel me to effeminate behaviour. What ſhall I do in ſuch caſe? I will tell you. Wiſdom repoſes in the medium of two extremes. I ſhall vigorouſly puſh forwards then towards happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the eternal goal of wiſdom. And when the medium has given me complete ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035743_0075_1006AD0954A24D88"/>
I ſhall impudently tell Varmont he was a villain for his advice, and you, Dolerval, a poor ſimpleton for yours.</p>
                     <p>Farewell, my dear young brother; accept the aſſurances of my kind attachment to you, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to my ſiſter. You are both of ſuch an extraordinary make, that at times I cannot refrain from laughing at you. Nevertheleſs, you may be aſſured that I love you with the tendereſt affection.</p>

                     <p>YOU are ever the ſame, Murville. What need was there of ſubſcribing your letter when you are ſo eaſily diſcovered by your ſtile? Your ſatirical epiſtle was at firſt ſight ſomewhat amuſing; but the ſerious commentary upon it, given by Eleanor, moſt ſenſibly affected me. The ſentiments of my ſiſter are totally different from yours. Her powers of perſuaſion have much
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035743_0077_1006AE04C9A34518"/>
greater influence upon me than your ſatirical let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>You ſeem to take pleaſure in laughing at my ſenſibility. Are you not ſenſible, then, that from this ſource I derive my ſweeteſt enjoyments? It is this which attaches to my innocent ſtudies an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite charm. It is this which invites me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful reveries amongſt our ſmiling meadows and fields. Were I deſtitute of this I could not take delight in weeping with compaſſion in the cottage of the unfortunate. Without this I ſhould not ſo often mingle my tears with thoſe of my ſiſter, whoſe ſecret ſorrows have ſometimes been ſoothed by me. Can even the pleaſures you boaſt of be much more enlivening than theſe? You will, in the end, find them to be far leſs durable, and, depend upon it, you are making way for long and ſevere repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>My unhappy ſiſter is now conſuming with grief. M. Bovile, whom it is deſirable you might have known—M. Bovile, who, by a long ſeparation from her, has not been rendered leſs dear, has lately married the ſiſter of a man whoſe friend you cannot long remain. What is then this paſſion of love that can ſo much diſturb the pureſt and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſouls, and change the moſt excellent of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters! What is it but this fatal paſſion which, even in the heart of Eleanor, reſembles envy? Alas! my ſiſter cannot bear that another ſhould enjoy the object ſhe cannot obtain!</p>
                     <p>You conſult me in ſuch a manner reſpecting the conduct you ſhould obſerve towards Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Terville, as to acquit me from giving you the moſt indirect advice. You ſhall, however, be told, that had it been my good fortune to be in the preſence of ſuch an angel as you deſcribed, I ſhould
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035743_0078_1006AE07C1D36840"/>
then ſet a higher value on myſelf for being in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that ſenſibility which would incline me to adore the woman deſerving univerſal homage according to her merits. Then, with a timid and reſpectful deportment, I ſhould endeavour, in her company, to avoid every thing which might give her the leaſt diſpleaſure, and, by every reſpectful attention, endeavour to gain her affections. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might then ſucceed in obtaining a lover, an idolized wife—and my ſiſter a tender, compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate friend! O that this may one day be the lot of your then moſt fortunate brother—of him who would then be the happieſt of men!</p>

                     <p>MY misfortunes were not ſo ſoon to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. I was reſerved to endure, at the ſame time, the moſt grievous pains of body, and moſt dreadful anxieties of mind. Judge how great was my anguiſh, when, on coming to myſelf, I heard ſomebody near the bed where I lay diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce the name of a deteſtable perſon whoſe name was lately my own. I was apprehenſive that I had fallen into the power of my enemy. The parching fever with which I was ſeized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ardent, and in a long delirium which it occaſioned, my aſſaſſin ſeemed to threaten me with both geſtures and voice. At one time (and I ſhall long preſerve the pleaſing remembrance of it)
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035743_0079_1006AE0DA95F6E40"/>
ſome perſon, as I thought, mentioned the name of Bovile. I flattered myſelf that my deliverer was at hand, and expected an immediate relief from all my ſorrows. Alas! I learned but too ſoon that the fleet had ſailed; that the young man who had taken me into his poſſeſſion was an intimate friend of Varmont, and I was ready to die with deſpair.</p>
                     <p>What courſe to take in ſuch critical circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I knew not. To give an account of my misfortunes, and reveal my name, would have the ſame conſequences as a particular indication of Varmont's crimes. Preſumptions might lead to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute proofs, and you know what a dreadful fate awaits the guilty in inſtances of this kind. It is true that I ſhould run a great hazard in concealing theſe circumſtances from him, although I am not under any obligation to let him know them. But would it not be equally, if not more dangerous, to make myſelf known? What reaſons could I give ſufficiently plauſible, to perſuade this friend of Varmont not to inform him that his ſiſter had juſt eſcaped from ſhipwreck? Was it then adviſable to let him have a glimpſe of my fearful ſtory? The advantage of greater perſonal ſafety could never incline me to do this, for I have ſuppoſed the more heinous the crime, the more I ſhould ſtrive to cover it with an impenetrable and myſterious veil. Why ſhould I run the riſk of falling a victim hereafter to a pardon too generouſly granted? Therefore, in order to remove every ſuſpicion, I tried every means of deception. I told the young man who found me, that I was a girl; that my name was Terville; that I mourned the abſence of a dear brother who went away in the fleet. A dear brother! Juſt heaven! why didſt thou not give me one that I could forbear hating? To

conclude; I permitted this ſtranger, into whoſe power I had fallen, to believe, as he already did, that Varmont became an object of my averſion by purſuing me with a criminal paſſion.</p>

                     <p>YOU ſhall now, my dear Celina, be informed of my real ſituation, and what are my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. My huſband's character was too well known to me to give me any reaſon for believing his ſpeedy departure to be occaſioned by indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I make no doubt but Bovile has ſincerely mourned for me, whom he believes forever loſt. Yet how could he, let his grief be ever ſo great, delay his departure on an expedition which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected would greatly contribute to the ſucceſs of the French arms? He never entertained a ſingle thought of delay when the intereſt of his country required his departure. Bovile is not a man who would ſtand reaſoning with his duty. For my part, as ſoon as my health becomes leſs languiſhing, I purpoſe to go to Breſt, in order to embark there for the Weſt-Indies. M. Murville, I am ſure, will not refuſe to aſſiſt me in going thither. The fleet was to put in at Martinique, and it will not be difficult, I ſuppoſe, to rejoin my huſband at that place. There ſhall I bid defiance to the dark de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Varmont: for he doubtleſs, by this time, entertains ſuſpicions of my being alive. M. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville was too haſty in telling his friend his late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of finding a young woman dying not far from the ſhores of Breſt. But if I may give credit to what M. Murville has told me, my enemy is, at leaſt, unacquainted with the place of my retreat.</p>

                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:035743_0082_1006AE19CE5ACA18"/>There is one circumſtance of which I had forgot to inform you, which adds much to the difficulty of my ſituation, which already has become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely perplexing. This young man is a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in ſentiment, and has already made me ſome propoſals that alarmed me. I muſt confeſs that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances ſeem to be againſt me, and may be plead as a palliation of his inſulting behaviour. The myſterious circumſtances attending all the events of my misfortunes before he found me, have, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my relation of them, given a vaſt ſcope to his imagination. Nor can he be fully ſatisfied, although he knows me to be young, and may think me ſomewhat handſome, what thoſe attempts of Varmont were which have rendered him ſo odious in my ſight. But methinks this young man ſhould ſhew more regard for my misfortunes, let him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute them to any cauſe whatever. Although I might excuſe him for conceiving a favourable opinion of me, and, ſince he knows me ſo little, for entertaining an affection for me, yet never can I pardon him for attempting to take an ill advantage of an unhappy woman accidentally put into his power.</p>

which lately ſailed from Breſt. They have had an engagement with the Engliſh, and it is reported that the Pallas is loſt. Bovile, alas! Bovile is no more!</p>
                     <p>Haſten, my brother, to procure the ſpeedieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation you can, and forthwith ſend it to me; for I had rather die than much longer remain in ſuch painful uncertainty. Above all things, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, let my affection for Bovile remain a ſecret. Heaven knows the ſincerity of my heart; Heaven knows that I have done nothing diſgraceful. But oh, how unjuſt are mankind! they perpetually confound an involuntary paſſion with a premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated intrigue; inſtead of pitying the misfortune, load it with reproaches; and condemn the virtue that reſiſts its paſſions, as ſeverely as the weakneſs which yields to them. Should my circumſtances be known, the prejudiced, ungenerous world would only conſider me as harbouring a criminal paſſion. They would not liſten to the reaſons which might be pled in its juſtification; nor would they believe how much I have reſiſted it, nor what evils I have ſuffered in its conſequence. Then let them never know, let thoſe hard-hearted mortals never know the ſecret pains of my heart which threaten to deſtroy me—the ſorrow which will haſten me to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely grave.

                     <p>SCARCELY had my letter gone out of my hands, than I repented that I wrote it. Do not, my friend, attribute the ill natured ſentiments it contained to any thing but vexation for the loſs I have met with. I could not believe the young girl you ſpoke of had fallen into your hands; but ſuppoſed you had been informed of my bad luck by the indiſcretion of ſome friends, and was making yourſelf merry at my expence. This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I was in a paſſion, as I confeſs I was, and am ſorry for it.</p>

You found her, you ſay, with "<hi>her hands bloody and her face wounded!</hi>" But my friend, it was not my fault. She muſt have been benumbed with cold and wet to her very bones, and you forgot to tell me of it. And when you come to know the means ſhe uſed to make her eſcape, you will be convinced that ſhe eſcaped by a miracle, at the riſque of being drowned ten times over.

This is what I cannot give credit to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Bovile has given many proofs of his reſpect for ſubordination. But he was abuſed—he is now in the bottom of the ocean. Long ago have I
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035743_0089_1006AE37A3FA6748"/>
been heard to ſay that it was a ſilly piece of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in old M. de Varmont to put him in the navy. To put a raw, unexperienced fellow in the royal navy, is like leaving a beautiful woman in a foreſt to be protected by chance.</p>
                     <p>To complete the calamity, it happens that the ſame curſed frigate which drowned my ſiſter's lover, has alſo drowned the brother of my miſtreſs. Poor Mademoiſelle de Terville! how could I be ſo beſide myſelf as to interrogate the infernal meſſenger in her hearing? In ſuch ſort have I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated him, that one has fainted away, and is waiting for you to bear the deadly meſſage to the other.</p>
                     <p>Dolerval, 'tis a ſad commiſſion which I give you; and although you muſt perform it, you would be but little better than a murderer if you ſhould perform it abruptly. You muſt therefore exerciſe diſcretion when you go to her with this fatal meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and gradually prepare her for the completion of her miſery. But ſee now! theſe are the ſweet fruits of that thing called virtue, with which ſhe was ſo infatuated! Had your ſiſter, inſtead of ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pining away during ſeven long and tedious years with an uſeleſs flame, during only as many weeks ſet apart a few minutes in gratifying it, ſhe might either have totally extinguiſhed it, or greatly diminiſhed its force. For ſay what you will, you ſenſible folks muſt pardon me, when I tell you that the wounds of Cupid are not incurable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the patient diſdains not the neceſſary remedies to heal them, when well underſtood. Had Eleanor taken this method, Bovile might have taken leave of her, and ſhe would have taken no more than ordinary notice of it; or, if the obſtinate miſtreſs could not but lay it to heart—alas! are there no
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035743_0090_1006AE3B49499428"/>
more young men upon earth? And if they cannot be ſerviceable in running to the aſſiſtance of afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed widows, what are they good for? And if a ſcore of them will not ſuffice, perhaps a hundred will be ſufficient, and they are eaſily to be obtained. Were this method once put in practice, you would find that the ſorrows of a woman are not ſo inconſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as you have been pleaſed to imagine; and that none of them are ſo laſting and ſevere as not to be overcome by a reaſonable number of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But the ſituation of our Eleanor has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo deſperate, that I am reduced to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of giving her no comforter but you. O wretched alternative!</p>
                     <p>But I have heard a piece of intelligence which puts me more out of humour than all other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities ſaddled upon me at once. You doubtleſs remember that pretty girl, Dolerval—that little angel, as you called her—that little angel of ſuch modeſt deportment, ſuch timid looks and chaſte mien, that I really believed ſhe was a maid? No ſuch thing, Dolerval! the agreeable news has juſt arrived by the poſt. Now tell me, credulous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, what female countenance we may henceforth believe in. How it vexes me! How it enrages me! Ah, M. de Varmont is the only one who can feel well!</p>

                     <p>AT length I am left alone—at length I am at liberty freely to weep and complain. To this paper do I commit the relation of my new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which I hope, at ſome future time, may reveal to you every ſevere incident of my fate.</p>
                     <p>There was but one ſupport reſerved for me on earth. That ſupport, O Celina, which was a hope of Bovile's protection, is, by his death, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably loſt! Perhaps the conſideration alone of the circumſtances in which I am left by his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, might excuſe me for being moſt ſenſibly affected with my own. Perhaps it might be thought, that becauſe I had been with him but ſo ſhort a ſpace, and was, by his untimely death, delivered into the power of my enemies, I had therefore leſs reaſon to lament the loſs of him as my huſband, than as my protector. But the benevolent and nobly generous Bovile required but a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to affect my heart with the warmeſt gratitude and moſt tender eſteem. And how readily adverſity enables us to form an opinion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! The ſiſter of Varmont, and priſoner of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, has little reaſon to believe that there are many who poſſeſs amiable qualities, and much reaſon to believe that ſhe will forever deplore her recent loſs. But ſo great are my preſent embarraſſments, that
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035743_0092_1006AE4423FB0770"/>
they affect me almoſt as ſenſibly as my regret for the loſs of Bovile. What, O Celina, will become of thy ſiſter? Perſecuted by the hatred of Madame de Varmont, and narrowly eſcaped from the fury of her ſon; a widow almoſt as ſoon as married; doomed by hard fortune to conceal from all ſhe is connected with, the name of her family and that of her huſband; without any reſource, without ſtrength or experience—What then can ſhe do with the fatal liberty which remains? Alas! would it not have been better to have remained with thee in perpetual confinement?</p>
                     <p>But I was ſpeaking of remaining liberty, whilſt I do not enjoy any! This M. de Murville ſo far abuſes the weakneſs of my ſex, and takes ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my unfortunate ſituation, as to keep me in confinement. Nevertheleſs, I entertain hopes that the omnipotent Preſerver of men, who pities the oppreſſed, has not wreſted me from the hands of a parricide to abandon me to the deſigns of an impious man. Let my ſtrength be reſtored, and I ſhall elude the vigilance of my tyrant. I ſhall make all ſuitable inquiries and obtain all poſſible information neceſſary to my eſcape. Alas! was there but one virtuous man upon earth? Muſt I never meet with another Bovile? Although I would not ſolicit the diſgraceful pity of any perſon, I ought not aſſuredly to bluſh when imploring relief from the truly benevolent. Is it not probable that I might find means of ſupporting myſelf by hand labour as many others have done before me? The meaneſt employment in hand labour, I am confident, would not diſcourage me. My courage would enable me to undertake it, and habit would render it ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: ſo that, at length, I ſhould be capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during every thing, except the diſgrace of leaving
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035743_0093_1006AE4CE3B87090"/>
the paths of virtue. Be calm, my ſiſter; a ray of hope has again enlightened and cheered my ſoul, and whatever event may take place, my fortitude ſhall not forſake me.</p>

                     <p>OH, Varmont! have you really had the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of profaning ſo many charms? Alas! could not her timid modeſty, native reſerve, nor
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035743_0094_1006AE4FF5DC5480"/>
guarded innocence reſtrain your inſulting paſſions? Could neither her ardent prayers nor tender tears affect you? This was no time for prayers and tears, young woman! you ſhould pinch, ſcratch, bite, cry, and even ſwear! you ſhould have raved and torn like a little fury! you ſhould—you ſhould have rather died than endure all this!—But, Mademoiſelle, you proceed no further than crying and beſeeching! you are then but a little fool with your large cunning eyes. But what do I ſay? I ought to blame none but the ſavage Varmont. You only are to blame. What feeble reſiſtance muſt the frail creature make againſt ſuch a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemy! You have overpowered, cruſhed, aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated her, in the true ſenſe of the word aſſaſſinate! This was downright wilful murder. Poor girl! charming creature!—When I view her more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and figure to myſelf your contemptible perſon in her arms, it ſets me in a rage! At ſuch a time I would reſtore her to you for nothing. But, at the ſame time, I would willingly fall on my own ſword for the opportunity of plunging it into your heart.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch men as you there is nothing to be expected but violence and dark deeds. You com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when you ought to ſolicit: inſtead of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by perſuaſion, you wreſt by violence: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious behaviour with a witneſs! The loweſt bred fellow in the kingdom can do it as well as you.</p>
                     <p>But to ſoften the ſorrow of a ſweet girl in order to lull it to ſleep; to flatter her ſelf-love in order to lead it aſtray—her prejudices for the purpoſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them; to praiſe her virtue with a deſign of rendering it leſs rigid; to excite her gratitude by pretended benefits—her love by a feigned ſenſibility— her confidence by a well ſupported, reſpectful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour

This is what I now undertake, and what I call the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-piece of the art.</p>
                     <p>This I am ſenſible will not ſoon be effected; but, upon reflection, I find that I ſhall have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient leiſure for that purpoſe. I have already too much worn out my youth with ordinary intrigues. At preſent I am willing to repoſe in the languors of an engagement half ſerious. I ſhall attempt to feel a ſort of paſſion. What a glorious reward ſhall I receive for my labours! Never was there a more commendable attempt, nor any attempt ever made upon a more excellent object!</p>
                     <p>You may therefore be convinced, that if you ſhould ſend your truſty foot-boy again, he will take a moſt fruitleſs journey. I cannot give up my precious treaſure. Methinks I hear you cry out, What, what are your reaſons for detaining her? You ſay, that you ſtand in need of her. Ah! your neceſſities are the neceſſities of nature! Fie upon you! it is morally impoſſible for me to forego the privilege. You are much taken with her, you ſay. What of that? I am an hundred times more ſo than yourſelf. I am inflamed by the paſſion with which ſhe inſpires me, and which ſhe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to inſpire. You have, in the end of your extraordinary epiſtle, endeavoured to claim her as your property. I tell you it is falſe. Is it ever

                     <p>No, no, M. de Varmont! you pray in vain; conjure, aſk pardon, and exerciſe every mean art as much as you pleaſe, it is a ſettled point that you will not have her again.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; expecting I ſhall be at leiſure to anſwer all the inſignificant queſtions with which you may pleaſe to vex me, I conſent to receive your apologies, and will ſtoop to hear your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of reverence for Murville. However, when you deign to acknowledge him ſuperior to Varmont, I cannot tell whether you mean it for a compliment or not.

At firſt I received your manifeſto with becoming reſpect; but your meſſenger growing rather too inſolent. I threatened to commence hoſtilities, and intended to put the diplomatic ſpectre gently out of the window. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately for him, a word from the girl was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to put him to flight.

                     <p>After he was gone, and I had a little recovered from my fright, I read your billet over and over again. Your billet tells me, Varmont, that you have become very crazy or very crafty. Crazy, if you are willing to expoſe yourſelf ſo far for the little girl as to loſe your ears in a quarrel with your beſt friend: crafty, indeed, if you propoſe our meeting on the frontiers of the country, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of removing me from the object of my deſires. However it may be, I hold myſelf in readineſs to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward off every danger. I ſhall obſtinately defend at home the treaſure with which I ſhould part more reluctantly than ever. If, on your part, you perſiſt in your deſign of getting her away, come yourſelf, my friend, come to me. You will find Murville waiting for you, and that with firmneſs.

                        <pb n="103" facs="unknown:035743_0099_1006AE671E3F5CC8"/>We muſt, therefore, allow it to be, for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, an excellent invention, that what places prejudices in oppoſition to laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and allows force to ſuperſede authority, allows us, at the ſame time, to diſpenſe with having virtue and politeneſs, provided we are furniſhed with a ſword. You, therefore, do very well to ſtrut about with yours; and if you follow my arguments to the extent of their rigour, I am willing to confeſs that you may eſteem it more formidable than that of Murville. But I would adviſe you to keep a good look out. When, by your perſuaſions, I firſt ventured into the high road of libertiniſm, I thought within myſelf that I might, one day perhaps, enter alſo into that of vice, by your example; and, ſhould the devil tempt me to do it, I might, in the end, ſurpaſs even you in wickedneſs. In conſequence of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, I took my meaſures accordingly. Believe me, Varmont, you had better reſerve your intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity for a leſs doubtful occaſion. Amongſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates there is nothing to be gained but hard ſtrokes.</p>
                     <p>Above all things, don't ſend Lafleur again. On his own account, he has little reaſon for caring to return; and for my own part, I ſhall be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſee him no more. The young girl had, before this time, frequently demanded her liberty; and ſince the journey of your lackey has threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with a journey to her maſter, ſhe has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled her importunity. Surpriſing! could you have believed ſhe would try to get out, and at the ſame way your ambaſſador had like to have gone yeſterday? This I thought fit to oppoſe. The leap from the window, which, had it been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the groſs fellow, would have amuſed me, appeared too dangerous for the little girl. For this reaſon I ordered all the windows of her apartment
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035743_0100_1006AE6D46076178"/>
to be faſtened with grates: and, in return for this kindneſs, ſhe calls me a tyrant. So that my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſtead of being advanced, is likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded. Varmont, let me alone; as you cannot prevent my happineſs, do not ſtrive to procure the malicious conſolation of delaying it. This would be miſerable! O! I beſeech you, leave me in peace, and do not ſend any more that deſpicable Lafleur!</p>
                     <p>If he dares to make his appearance again, I tell you beforehand, he ſhall not leave my caſtle until he has confeſſed all that the young girl, when out of her ſenſes, was going to diſcover: and unleſs your wiſe confident prevents it by his flight, you may depend upon it he will be forced to make the confeſſion which he was ſo much afraid of making yeſterday.</p>
                     <p>To be ſure, Varmont, it is of itſelf ſomething of an exploit to do violence to a girl; but it often happens, that an action, though commendable in itſelf, is attended with an infinity of circumſtances which conſpire to render it meritorious in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. Every thing combines to perſuade me that, in your affair with Mademoiſelle de Terville, the manner of the tranſaction was worthy of its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It ſeems that you have even outdone your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for in your laſt letter, a letter ſo poorly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to enlighten me, with a world of incloſures equally inſignificant, wherein the art which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſeem like nature, is diſcoverable in every line; there was not, I ſay, in all this confuſed maſs of waſte-paper, a ſingle word to convince me of the ſincerity of your declaration, that you would make me acquainted with this new myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

                     <p>O BENEFICENT apoplexy! Why didſt thou not carry off the old man ſeveral years ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Or why, O barbarous ocean! didſt thou not ſwallow up the young man ſeveral years later? What ſurpriſes me moſt of all is, to think how Bovile could ſo unſeaſonably take leave of his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eanor, preciſely at the time her long-lived Florival concluded to bid us a long and pleaſing farewell. Cupid ſeldom does his work ſo miſerably as in the preſent inſtance. But now, my dear Dolerval, our ſiſter is a two-fold widow! Shall we pity her? In fact I cannot tell. If on one hand we ought to mourn, we ought on the other to rejoice. She is indeed bereſt of a lover; but ſhe is alſo diſengaged from her old huſband. I begin to be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that, taking events together, the lucky and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky form a complete balance in life. There is, I plainly perceive, a providence.</p>
                     <p>Give then, to my dear Eleanor, if you think proper, two compliments in my behalf: the one of condolence, and the other of congratulation. You may, my dear brother, without offending me, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035743_0102_1006AE75591130C8"/>
me in ſimilar language. I cannot tell, for my part, whether I ought to be congratulated or pitied. Pray tell me, Dolerval, whether this ſenſibility you boaſt of is not a fault in our blood, an hereditary diſeaſe, which I have, perhaps, only ſoftened by palliatives, whilſt the cauſe of the diſorder is not removed. In truth, I find it to be coming on me again in earneſt. It incommodes me greatly, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I am near the handſome girl I told you of. In her preſence, to my aſtoniſhment, ſeveral ſighs have eſcaped me. In her preſence my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance loſes its wonted gaiety, and has every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a man attacked with your malady. The cunning girl obſerves my hard taſk, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to take the advantage of me. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves this opportunity of praying me to ſet her at liberty. I do not know whether I told you of it, but I keep the little enchantreſs under lock and key. Methinks I now hear you exclaiming againſt me! Well, what ſurer method could you propoſe for keeping an angel againſt her will? To return to my ſubject: ſhe aſks, and I refuſe. Then, with a tone ſtill ſofter and milder, ſhe ſupplicates me ſo feelingly, that your tender-hearted brother is almoſt overcome. Let a ſingle tear fall from her eye, and my own are ready to be moiſtened alſo! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cannot but confeſs that I ſometimes derive ſome pleaſure from this condition, yet, upon a little reflection, it diſquiets me and makes me angry with myſelf.</p>
                     <p>However, if the girl continues to make me ſo diſtracted, it is a wonder if I do not, on ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable occaſion, aſſume courage enough to ſhorten the adventure and finiſh the romance.</p>

                     <p>I WAS certain of it. Nor was there any room for doubt. But why was you ſo wavering, when you had juſt ſeen and heard for yourſelf? What good effect could it have for you to conceal yourſelf in the neighbourhood, and there remain idle? You aſk for new inſtructions! Did I not give you every needful inſtruction before your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Did I not foreſee the embarraſſment in which you now find yourſelf? The challenge, you may be certain, was ſerious; with a deſign of intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the man, as the laſt reſort for bringing him to terms. Why did you, ſeemingly, wait till I ſhould go and expoſe myſelf by fighting with him? This would not be a good meaſure till every other had proved ineffectual. We ſhall, doubtleſs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain revenge for the ill treatment you received from him; but it is neceſſary that the moſt important part ſhould be accompliſhed in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p>If there were yet any reaſons for heſitating about making the firſt attempt, whilſt I am warned to make it by the anxiety which almoſt diſtracts me, perhaps I ſhould heſitate myſelf. But can I at preſent neglect doing that for the more important concern of our common ſefety, which, at firſt, I attempted to do only to increaſe my fortune? Are you not ſenſible how frightful are thoſe words: "If you are not gone in an inſtant I will diſcover all?" O, ſtupid fellow! how can they diſcover any thing
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035743_0104_1006AE8379160380"/>
when they know nothing? What does it concern us if they have diſcovered every thing? What moſt concerns us is to order matters ſo that they can never diſcover any thing again.</p>
                     <p>Proceed then—You are furniſhed with money and with arms. You ſuppoſed it an eaſy matter to effect the deſign. Make haſte; there is not a moment to loſe. It is abſolutely neceſſary that what you failed of doing, muſt ſooner or later be done. Aſſume a little courage. Give to the earth what the ſea has ſo unfortunately rejected.</p>

                     <p>PITY me, Dolerval. What could even a man of ſenſe do towards withſtanding the ſnares and ambuſhes of a villain, or the tricks of an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful girl? There is nothing ſo crafty as the former, nor any thing ſo lucky as the latter. Which of them has corrupted my valet, I know not; but I know, to my ſorrow, that the knave of a Marcel went away laſt night with my fair priſoner, and ſet her at liberty. From whence I conclude in my wiſdom, that either the ungrateful Mademoiſelle de Terville has intentionally fled, or the intriguing Varmont has found means to carry her off. In ſuch a forlorn condition I ſtand in need of all my gaiety. Cruel creature! How could ſhe thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me? Never was there any event ſo little cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035743_0105_1006AE86EED5E9F8"/>
to amuſe me. Never did I meet with any misfortune ſo intolerable. I feel ſomething within me which makes me ready to ſigh. Is it ſelf-love? Or, is it love? Tell me, Dolerval, for, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, I am quite as willing to confeſs it to you as to myſelf.</p>
                     <p>There is one circumſtance which hurts me. I have received orders from Breſt to go thither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and muſt not fail. This makes me afraid I ſhall be ſent away during the whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. If ſo, it will be out of my power to purſue either the handſome fugitive or deteſtable robber. But I ſhall ſend a man to Paris, who I intend ſhall ramain in that part of the city where M. de Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont reſides, in order to find out whether the poor creature has fallen into the hands of him ſhe deteſts. Should this prove to be the caſe, I ſhould try to be better able to recover my property than I was to retain it.</p>
                     <p>Adieu, my dear young brother. Sympathize with Eleanor in behalf of Murville. Since our deſtinies have ſuch a reſemblance to each other, I love her more than ever. Like me, ſhe has loſt the object of her tender deſires; like her, I tremble leſt I ſhould be inconſolable. All theſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes have befallen her and me, in conſequence of our being too virtuous and too tender-hearted. Take care of yourſelf, Dolerval. Take warning by me.</p>

                     <p>LET M. de Varmont feel contented, for nobody can diſcover any thing more. The buſineſs is done. Marcel would do nothing without I gave him a large ſum, and I gave him all he aſked for. I was ſure that M. de Varmont would not refuſe to give him his price. As ſoon as the cage was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the bird went out of herſelf. For ſome time I was in a difficult ſituation, becauſe Marcel came away with us: but he left us a few leagues from Saumur. About break of day, in a ſmall wood near Tours, the bird ſung her laſt ſong. I left her there dead, and covered with leaves.</p>
                     <p>I write to M. de Varmont from Blois, becauſe I am ſick at that place. The commiſſion was ſo dreadful to perform, that I am frightened at the thoughts of it. I had ſcarcely courage enough to perform it. I am ſure that M. de Varmont himſelf, though much more experienced than me, could not have done it without trembling. The bird had ſuch a handſome plumage, and ſuch a ſweet voice, that I tremble to think of her, and feel very ill. M. de Varmont ought, in conſcience, to give me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand louis d'ors, inſtead of the five hundred he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me; for I declare to you, that I would not do the like again for four times that ſum.</p>

                     <p>NO longer, my dear Celina, can I heſitate to declare the unnatural cruelty of Varmont. He has endeavoured again to fill up the meaſure of his crimes.</p>
                     <p>Having, for ſeveral days paſt, been perſecuted more than ever with the inſulting propoſals of Murville, I tried in vain to gain over Marcel to my intereſt. This Marcel was a ſervant of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, who was entruſted with the keys of my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Judge whether I did not redouble my efforts to eſcape, when a meſſage brought from Varmont by Lafleur, gave me to underſtand that my enemy would do every thing in his power to complete my deſtruction. My entreaties became ſo frequent and ſo pathetic, that at length Marcel ſeemed to be affected by them. The day before yeſterday we agreed on the manner of my eſcape. About twelve o'clock on the night following, I was to be ready to go away with him. He came according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, opened the doors of my apartment, and it ſeemed perfectly ſuitable to the occaſion that he came without light. We went ſoftly down ſtairs, and haſtened acroſs the garden, where I was at firſt ſurpriſed to ſee a chaiſe and horſes ready to carry me away. Marcel obſerving my ſurpriſe at this circumſtance, ſaid, in a low voice, "You muſt leave the neighbourhood of the caſtle as ſoon as
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035743_0108_1006AE9E3019CFF0"/>
poſſible; for at this time of night, if you ſhould go on foot upon the public road, you could not get far enough to anſwer the deſign of your eſcape. My intention is to conduct you many leagues from this place, where I muſt leave you as ſoon as day-light appears. You ſhall then be at liberty to go where you pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>Satisfied with this artful ſpeech, I ſtept into the carriage. Marcel fixed himſelf upon the back part of it; and ſo great was my joy at the idea of being once more at liberty, that I never thought of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring who the poſtilion was. Alas! as ſoon as day-light appeared, I knew him but too well!</p>
                     <p>Juſt after Marcel left us, I began to be terrified at finding myſelf in the power of a ſtranger. The poſtilion left the public road and went a great diſtance in a croſs road farther into the wood. Then I was chilled with fear, and cried aloud. He turned his face towards me, and ſaid, "<hi>If you don't keep a profound ſilence, I will kill you!</hi>" Ah, Celina! conceive, if you can, the horror of my thoughts at that time! When he looked at me I beheld in his features and voice, that of the cruel domeſtic whoſe appearance at Murville's caſtle, a few days before, had ſo much affrighted me. My eyes grew dim, a cold ſweat ran down my face, and I remained in the carriage as motionleſs as a ſtatue, expecting every moment would be my laſt; for I was confident he conducted me into the wood in order to take my life.</p>
                     <p>We had not gone much farther before we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to a dark receſs of the wood, more gloomy than we had entered before. Lafleur here ſtopped his horſes, when I ſcreamed aloud, but he looked upon me with ſuch a menacing aſpect that fear chilled my voice. There was, however, I believe,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035743_0109_1006AEA2BA7FCCB0"/>
ſomething in my countenance and attitude which ſoftened his barbarity. He then turned his face another way. Alas! he looked away only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his wonted fierceneſs, and ſoon reſumed his cruel reſolutions. Several times did he turn his face from me, and again towards me, in the ſpace of a few minutes, which gave me alternate glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of hope and returns of abſolute deſpair. He often ſlackened the pace of his horſes, and, as I mentioned before, looked again upon his victim with an aſpect full of ferocity. There being no hope left but in gaining his compaſſion, I fell on my knees in the fatal carriage, and preſented to the aſſaſſin my face bedewed with tears, and ſtretched out towards him my hands claſped together. This ſpectacle ſeemed to affect him, but the impreſſion of pity was of ſuch ſhort duration, that I expected every moment that his work would be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So great was my confuſion, that I died as it were a thouſand times before receiving the fatal ſtroke.</p>
                     <p>Lafleur then armed himſelf with more courage, ſtepped out of the carriage, and, leſt my looks ſhould again diſhearten him, he turned aſide his eyes when coming cowards me: but I ſprung out of the carriage and looked him full in the face, by which means he was again ſo diſheartened that he could not ſtrike me. Encouraged by an attempt ſo ſucceſsful, I fell at his feet, caught him by the knees, and cried out, "No, no, friend! you will not do it: you are not ſo unmerciful as the cruel man who employed you. Can you, who merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reached forth your hands to aſſiſt me when I was ready to periſh in the waters, have a heart to perpetrate the atrocious crime he commands you? Leave, Oh, leave the execution of this crime to
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035743_0110_1006AEA6BABE0A48"/>
him who was about to plunge me again into the waves! Can you fear that I, who kept my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and real name as a ſecret when I was with Murville, in order to ſcreen Varmont from the puniſhment his villainy deſerved, would not promiſe never to betray you, for the preſervation of my life? This I ſtill promiſe to do. I will go into ſome obſcure village, and bury my miſery and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes together. Nobody ſhall ever hear any more of Emilia de Varmont. This I ſwear to do by all that is ſacred. Go, then, to the unmerciful man who ſent you, and tell him the work is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. Let him rejoice at my unhappy end. Let him enrich himſelf with my ſpoils: and I ſhall always remember, that, when he cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take my life, you had the goodneſs to preſerve it."</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I thus ſtrove to awaken in his heart the ſentiments of humanity, he ſeemed to be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with contrary paſſions. I obſerved him with the haſty, though ſtrict attention, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exerciſe in imminent danger. On his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which at firſt was an emblem of audacious deſpair, was now painted the irreſolutions of anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſuſpenſe. Happily for me, pity almoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceeded, and with pity, repentance ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded alſo. At laſt the happy moment arrived, when my aſſaſſin, if he had been able to ſpeak, would have deſired my pardon. His lifted arm now fell, and the ſword dropped from his hand. Then I aroſe, ready to improve the moment as that of my ſalvation, and ran into the thickeſt part of the woods—and running directly from him, hoping to find ſome ſecure hiding-place. Soon put to the neceſſity of ſtopping to take breath, I looked back, and could not refrain from ſo doing, to ſee what
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035743_0111_1006AEA8883B50A8"/>
had become of Lafleur. He was yet ſtanding in the place where I left him. But why had he changed his attitude? Why did he view me ſo earneſtly whilſt I was retreating? The idea of my not being out of danger, inclined me to continue my flight. Fear gave me new ſtrength, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued this time retreating, until I had the ſupreme ſatisfaction of hearing the carriage going away with full ſpeed. Then finding my ſtrength ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fail me, I fell voluntarily upon the ground, and wept with exceſſive joy. Then, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the throne of mercy, imploring pardon for the impious wretch who thirſted for my blood, I gave a thouſand thanks to the Almighty Preſerver of men, who reſcues the feeble from the cruel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor. My whole ſoul was penetrated with that joy which ſucceeds terror at the moment when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending danger is ſuddenly removed. I congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated myſelf on the painful trial I had juſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, ſince I hoped this might be the laſt; ſince I hoped, by this price, to purchaſe complete liberty; ſince I, at the ſame time, eſcaped, and that forever, the rage of a deteſtable brother, and the perſecutions of a libertine.</p>
                     <p>But whither, thought I, ſhall I direct my ſteps? By what means can I find ſubſiſtence? Alas! of whom can I aſk it? But why ſhould I fear? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that an unfortunate woman, who has not merited her diſtreſſes, can look for an aſylum in vain. Have I not reaſon to believe that the ever juſt Providence, which watches over the wretched, has ſafely conducted me through a long and dreadful ſtorm, in order to conduct me to a harbour of ſafety? Will it permit all the evils which can befal human nature, to fall on my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent youth? It is not an unreaſonable hope, that
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035743_0112_1006AEB2B1C9DD68"/>
after ſo many ſufferings, I may find ſome ſecure and honourable retreat, in the obſcurity of a life ever laborious, in which, although I could not enjoy happineſs, I might find ſome tranquility.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections renewed my courage and hope. Then I aroſe and walked on with new reſolution, to look out for ſome part of the country where a leſs deplorable fate awaited me. Soon did I traverſe the wood in its full extent; ſoon did I find myſelf upon a public road, and diſcovered, not far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſeveral ſteeples, which convinced me they, were accompanied with a large number of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and a little while afterwards the maſs of buildings appeared to be divided in ſuch a manner, as made me ſuppoſe there was a large city near me with an adjacent village. The latter appeared more ſuitable for my ſituation than the former. I ſuppoſed that, in a village, I ſhould have the beſt chance for concealment. In a village, where reigns a ſimplicity of manners, we are more likely to find the virtues of hoſpitality. Reſolved by theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I left the city of Tours on my right hand, entered the hamlet of St. Cyr, and knocked at the door of the parſonage. A young man opened the door, when I queſtioned him as follows:</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh," ſaid I, "to ſpeak to the Curate."</p>
                     <p>"Speak to me then," anſwered he, "for I am the perſon you aſk for."</p>
                     <p>"Do you ſtand in need, Monſieur, of a ſervant maid?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Mademoiſelle, I have no occaſion for a ſervant; what I moſt ſtand in need of are the means of employing and ſupporting one: thoſe perſons, therefore, who directed you to me, do not know what a poor, ſcanty portioned fellow I am."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="unknown:035743_0113_1006AEBBE8177938"/>"What!" replied I, "do you refuſe to ſhelter me under your roof? Is there no room for me in your houſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Room, yes, as much as you pleaſe; but of proviſions very little, and of money none at all."</p>
                     <p>"For my part, I want only to labour for a little bread."</p>
                     <p>"As to bread, Mademoiſelle," replied he, "I have not an abundance of it; but I will not refuſe to divide it between you and me. We can gather here and there a few herbs to eat with it; ſometimes a little milk, and ſometimes a few eggs; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in bread conſiſts the principal part of my cookery. You deſire," continued he (looking upon me with more attention) "to be my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but if your genteel appearance does not belie you, you were not made to labour for your bread." I interrupted him—</p>
                     <p>"The moſt ſimple employment, Monſieur, is what I moſt deſire."</p>
                     <p>"Believe me," replied he with as much mildneſs as gaiety, "although you ſeem to have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition, I cannot but think, after all you can ſay, that you are as delicate as you are handſome. The rude buſtle of houſehold affairs would incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode you. I take the charge of that myſelf, and am accuſtomed to it. You ſhall aſſiſt me in ſome ſmall matters of gardening; you ſhall take charge of my linen, which, by the by, is not very good, and waſh my two ſurplices, one at a time. Will you?"</p>
                     <p>"Very willingly," anſwered I.</p>
                     <p>"You ſurpriſe me, my charming girl! Why I tell you again that with me you will want every thing." Whilſt he was ſpeaking, I obſerved him with much attention. His appearance, like his

converſation, inſpired me with complete confidence. "Pray, Monſieur," reſumed I, "let me know my fate—put an end to my perplexity—receive me into your houſe."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, young woman, I wanted no urging in this matter; I only told you theſe circumſtances beforehand, that you might know what you had to expect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One word more, if you pleaſe: Will you never leave the houſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Do not doubt it, Monſieur, I never will."</p>
                     <p>"And will you become my niece?"</p>
                     <p>"Your niece! yes, that is all I can deſire."</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid he, "you are in the right. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the rich are ſometimes the moſt lovely, they are ſeldom the moſt happy, and are rarely the beſt people." (Reaching forth his hand in as inviting manner) "Come in" continued he, "you are a welcome gueſt. I expect you will remain with me for ſeveral years. With me you will be poor and temperate; but if your diſpoſition is like mine, you will, in return, have a good appetite, cheerful temper, and contented mind," Upon this I went into the houſe. I truſt, my ſiſter, that your mind is now relieved from the anxiety yon felt on beginning to read this letter. And as I am weary of writing, I will lay down my pen till to-morrow. To-morrow I purpoſe to give you an account of my converſation with the good Curate whom I have choſen for my maſter.</p>

                     <p>HE invited me to a breakfaſt, which conſiſted of cherries and brown bread, and gave me ſome water to drink. Inſtead of my ſerving him, he waited on me, his ſervant maid, with much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Alas! if he had not diſcovered a moſt ſenſible intereſt in my happineſs, I could have ſaid nothing to him. Nothing but the repeated teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his goodneſs could have given me courage enough for revealing to him that part of my misfortunes which it was neceſſary he ſhould know. "Monſieur," ſaid I, "if you do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal in your breaſt the half-confidences I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make you,"—</p>
                     <p>"Wherefore half-confidences?" ſaid he, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me.</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe my deſtinies are frightful," replied I. "Ah! how much leſs ſhould I have reaſon to complain on account of my misfortunes, if they were ſuch that I could reveal them all! But I can aſſure you, that the diſgrace of thoſe misfortunes which I cannot reveal, does not fall upon me. No, it does not fall upon me, I can ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035743_0117_1006AECDC3DC6358"/>
Do not, I beſeech you, refuſe to believe me, for I am not inſenſible of the truth, that though diſſimulation may ſometimes be permitted, perjury can never be pardonable. You ſhall be informed of every part of my adverſities which I can poſſibly reveal; but deign to remember that the limited confidence I repoſe in you, requires an inviolable ſecrecy. One unguarded word might prove my ruin; one word might diſcover to my enemies the place of my retreat; and I know them to be ſo inveterate as to come even to this obſcure and (as you made me believe) peaceable retreat, to ſnatch me from hence. The unjuſt hatred and perſecution of my relations have been the cauſes of all my ill fortune."</p>
                     <p>"It was the ill judged tenderneſs of mine," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, "which proved my ruin."</p>
                     <p>"They determined to make me a nun," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I.</p>
                     <p>"And mine ſucceeded in making me a prieſt."</p>
                     <p>"Pray let me inform you, Monſieur, how I eſcaped the cloiſter, where their avaricious cruelty was about to confine me."</p>
                     <p>"Worſe than that!" ſaid he, "I could not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the ſeminary where their ambitious kindneſs impriſoned me."</p>
                     <p>"A man into whoſe power I was placed by my perſecutions took an ill advantage of my ſituation, and attempted to ſeduce me."</p>
                     <p>This laſt declaration moſt ſenſibly affected his benevolent heart. As my misfortunes appeared to him in a ſtronger light, he became ſo much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in them, that his gaiety was ſuddenly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by ſeriouſneſs. He ſighed, my ſiſter, and then in a ſerious tone replied:</p>
                     <p>"That upon the firſt view of your charms, a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035743_0118_1006AED7EB86D668"/>
man might be ſo tranſported as to be unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a ſudden paſſion; that this paſſion might at firſt inſpire him with hopes of ſucceſs, I can eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but after having heard you, after approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to thoſe innocent features, and that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous charm which your modeſt diſcourſe, your decent aſpect, and every trait of your angelic figure, equally inſpire—after having admired the winning graces of your ingenuous candour, if he is not then captivated with becoming reſpect for your mild at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions; or if he ſhould ſtill indulge a criminal deſire, I ſhould deem it a prodigy. But go on with your relation."</p>
                     <p>"He attempted to ſeduce me. A new crime wreſted me from his hands to place them in yours, which I hope may prove innocent and pure."</p>
                     <p>"Which always have been," cried he, "and which always ſhall be."</p>
                     <p>"But now," continued I, "of all the numerous gifts of fortune which I but lately enjoyed, not one remains. I am bereſt of all my relations, and have even loſt my name."</p>
                     <p>"Here," replied he with his former gaiety, "you may find as many names as you pleaſe. I know the calendar by heart. Come, we will look out the handſomeſt and worthieſt that can be found. Julia, for example. No, this would be unſuitable; Julia would be too noble for the niece of a poor Curate. The Grand Vicar would complain of it. We cannot do better than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh it: you ſhall be called Juliette: and do not be diſſatisfied with it, for you will feel none the worſe for being called by that name. At preſent," continued he, "you ſhall have nothing to do with houſehold affairs. The day of your arrival ſhall be a ſacred day; I invite you to conſecrate it to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035743_0119_1006AEDF43C247C0"/>
repoſe. If, however, you prefer amuſing your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by examining every apartment of your new dwelling, I would have you do ſo. For my part, I muſt leave you, although with regret, to go and finiſh ſome urgent buſineſs in the garden."</p>
                     <p>The good behaviour and good diſpoſition of this young man inſpired me with complete confidence. Yet I cannot but confeſs, after all, that I feel ſomewhat uneaſy. If my ears have not greatly deceived me, my uncle repeated ſeveral times, laſt evening, in a low voice, an extraordinary phraſe: "<hi>They ought even to marry the prieſts.</hi>" After we had done ſupper he pronounced it more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, immediately left the room, and ran into the next apartment, from whence he brought a baſe-viol, on which he played with a penſive and melancholy air. After it was late enough to bid him good night, and I wiſhed to do ſo, he ſtill continued playing. Too much occupied to anſwer me, he roſe mechanically, and, without ſaying a word, ſtill playing on his baſe-viol, he conducted me to the door of the ſmall chamber he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for me.</p>
                     <p>Now, my dear Celina, I will confeſs to you my great weakneſs. On finding myſelf ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four walls, ſcarcely whitened, in a ſort of garret, where a matraſs, three chairs, almoſt ſtript of their ſtraw ſeats, a worm-eaten table, a bit of a looking glaſs, and ſome fragments of a praying deſk compoſed the whole furniture, I could not forbear weeping. Child that I was! Is not peace of mind the firſt of bleſſings? And does it conſiſt in the vain decorations of our dwellings? Is not the meaneſt cottage, where the vices of the rich and noble cannot reach you, vaſtly preferable to the ſtately palaces of the great, which are ſo many
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035743_0120_1006AEE3736DB5E0"/>
nurſeries of cruel and effeminate paſſions? As for me, I have lately had a melancholy proof of the latter, but at preſent feel the favourable ſituation of the former. For ſeveral weeks of late, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a thouſand diſquietudes whilſt ſleeping under gilded canopies, I never cloſed my eyes but with trembling; now, in a garret, I have ſlept in peace; early in the morning awoke with a mind free from diſtreſs, a clear memory, and compoſed imagination; with ſo much compoſure as to give you a long detail of the events and converſation of laſt evening, without fearing the malignity of my enemies. This I do from a conviction that there is nothing in my new ſituation which can fail of exciting the tender intereſt of my ſiſter, or her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient curioſity.</p>
                     <p>But tell me, my dear Celina, what you think of this frequent exclamation of my uncle, which, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I could not miſunderſtand, and which gives me ſo much uneaſineſs? What, my ſiſter! can a prieſt have paſſions like other men? Will not my honour, in the houſe of a prieſt, be as ſecure as my life? Perhaps I am blinded too eaſily with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive hopes. It would be erroneous in me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my ſorrows at an end. Oh, Bovile! whoſe compaſſionate tenderneſs may yet ſtoop with ſome pleaſure towards her who ſtill cheriſhes the fond remembrance of thy virtues, from the regions of eternal peace, whence thou can'ſt deſcend to watch over her, deign to come, O exalted and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit! to pity, protect, and enlighten thy once loved Emilia! Through what dreadful ſtorms has ſhe, by her cruel enemies, been driven into this port; where, perhaps, ſhe rejoices with too much ſecurity in a calm which may yet prove deceitful!</p>

                     <p>I AM much encouraged, my ſiſter. As ſoon as I made my appearance this morning, my uncle came haſtily to me and ſaid:—</p>
                     <p>"As many impertinent perſons may ſoon trouble you with embarraſſing queſtions concerning our relation to each other, it will be neceſſary, my niece, that you become acquainted with the family of your uncle. M. Jerome Sevin, the father of your uncle, is, in fact, the only phyſician of the animals in his village. His forefathers have, for a century, inherited the privilege of bequeathing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers to Nanterre. And I alſo, in all probability, was made by heaven to give ſhoes and phyſic in my turn to the <note n="*" place="bottom">Les roſſes du canton.</note>jades of the canton. Oh, why did the authors of my being permit the rage of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizement to ferment in their brains! It is true, that they hoped, by means of this black coat, to make my fortune and their ſalvation. O that their prayers may be heard! and may they hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive in the next world, as happy as I remain poor in the preſent! In the preſent, my niece, whoever will not condeſcend to cringe to his betters and flatter them, will never arrive to preferment: and one who is quite incapable of flattering the paſſions of men, might practiſe the art of curing diſeaſed horſes with great ſucceſs. I was, however, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035743_0122_1006AEF0E33820E8"/>
dear vicar of a Norman Curate—that is to ſay, his proud tithing man. But in order to render his friendſhip profitable to me, it was neceſſary to court, with aſſiduity, the maid of the grand vicar, the principal lacquies of my biſhop, his ſecretary, a man of no leſs influence, his little favourite dog, his quarterly man-ſervant, and his weekly miſtreſs. Never could I condeſcend to ſo much cringing. For which reaſon, my benefactor, with all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, ſucceeded no farther than caſting me into this ruined parſonage, a mere <note n="*" place="bottom">This, in French, was Cul de ſac apoſtolique.

My poor relations, notwithſtanding, were all overjoyed at the news of my promotion. My mother, ſtrong in the faith of my ſacred meditation, believed herſelf thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſure of paradiſe. By theſe means ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the vaſt doors of heaven were already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, and perſuaded herſelf that nothing was wanting in order to gain admittance, but a change of my name. My father, more ſenſibly affected with the good things of this life, did not derive his higheſt ſatisfaction from conſidering that the moſt topping folks in the village pulled off their hats to his ſon. Both of them, however, ſpoke with pride, reſpect, and admiration of their ſon, the Rev. Curate! How would the good people be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed, if I ſhould try to convince them, that Sevin would have lived more contentedly in the laborious and obſcure profeſſion of his forefathers! There is nothing, I confeſs, very laborious in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035743_0123_1006AEF85439CF88"/>
office of a prieſt. It chiefly conſiſts in humming over a few phraſes in an unknown tongue; and ſince nobody underſtands them, no matter how awkwardly. Nor is it very difficult to harrangue in that convenient tribune, where we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the privilege of being always in the right. And I cannot but think, that my equals, who, like me, were born ſimple peaſants, muſt feel their vanity wonderfully raiſed, when they conſider what reſpect is devolved on one of their equals, and are not leſs ſenſible of the more profitable honor he attains to, of picking, periodically, at the table of the lady of the village. But are not theſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we may even call imaginary, theſe unfrequent entertainments of my condition, too cruelly purchaſed by the ſacrifice of thoſe real pleaſures to which nature ſometimes invites us, the deſire and opportunity of which we muſt never improve? And where can the paſtor be found, who can often publiſh the bands of matrimony without a ſecret diſquietude, and receive without emotion the confeſſion of a handſome girl, after ſhe has gone aſtray, and be always ready, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever required, by the charm of ſacramental words, to make man and wife of two lovers? Can he cheerfully accord thus to others that ſweeteſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, which he, poor bachelor, has not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? I acknowledge," continued he with warmth, "that you may at firſt be ſurpriſed at this diſcourſe; but it would wound me to the heart, if it ſhould much longer give you any alarm. At the firſt ſight of your beauty, I was ſurpriſed, and found my reſolution ready to forſake me. But if I am not deceived, my weakneſs was momentary. Could I even ſuppoſe, young woman, that you were not innocent, or could I become leſs ſenſible of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

towards you which hoſpitality enjoins upon me, I flatter myſelf, notwithſtanding, that I ſhould have fortitude enough to remember my vows. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious vows ſhould be kept inviolably. As for mine, whatever trials and ſtruggles they may coſt me, they ſhall be held ſacred until the happy day, which I cannot but hope for, when the moſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane of laws ſhall relieve me from them. Whilſt waiting for that happy period, forgive my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining. Permit me, my niece, to offer you alſo the confidence with which I ſalute every viſitant. Prepare yourſelf to hear me often ſtun your ears with my favourite phraſe: "They ought to marry the prieſts."</p>
                     <p>"Do not fear that I ſhall be very troubleſome on the occaſion of theſe repetitions: for, by an effect of my temper, which is naturally ſubmiſſive, I compoſe myſelf under the evils I experience, ſo as to view them in the moſt favourable light. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have not ſucceeeded in feeling ſatisfied with my lot, I have acquired, without much difficulty, the habit of ſupporting it with gaiety. Perhaps I might ſoon conſider my ſituation almoſt enviable, if I could ſometimes alleviate the miſeries of my poor pariſhioners without the generous aſſiſtance of my friends."</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections of my adopted uncle charmed me. But I derived the higheſt opinion of his goodneſs, from the certain proof he gave me, that his deſire of benevolence was not alone, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with real acts of generoſity. After we had ſpent ſeveral hours in the garden, myſelf em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in propping the plants, and he, by turns, handling the rake and the ſpade; the good air, his exerciſe, and the heat of the day, had equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his ardent thirſt and keen appetite.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035743_0125_1006AF0029E17B38"/>
When we came to ſit at the table, one would have thought that he alone would have devoured the plate of greens prepared for us both; that he alone would have emptied the bottle already unſtopped. Then, inſtead of filling his glaſs, he aſked me "if I had a reliſh for wine?" Almoſt chagrined at my refuſal, he proteſted I was wrong in never drinking any, and that he was right in loving it. "But I tremble," cried he, "in being unable to this day to ſwallow any thing except pure water. At the ſlighteſt indiſpoſition of the people in the village, they are ordered to diet, and they are well adviſed; but wine and broth are moſt needful for my peaſants, who are never ſick but with hunger and fatigue: and as there is in this village," continued he, "a poor infirm man, for whom this is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it is clear that I ought to deny it to myſelf, for whom it would be a ſuperfluity; ſince, thank God, I am always in good health. Go then, Juliette, (giving me the bottle,) pray ſomebody to ſhow you the way to the houſe of Lucas the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Go, let them receive the ſalutary preſent from your hands. When they ſee your behaviour, hear your language, and obſerve the magnificence of your preſent, his wretched family will believe you are nothing leſs than an angel ſent from heaven. Deny yourſelf, my girl, the honors of deification; modeſtly confeſs yourſelf to be a mortal, and what is ſtill worſe, the niece of the poor Curate who ſent you."</p>
                     <p>You cannot imagine, my ſiſter, with what tranſports the good people received me; with how many thanks my preſent was received, nor what a high character they gave their excellent paſtor. I believe, that next to the uncommon generoſity of the benefactor, there cannot be any thing more
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035743_0126_1006AF05E7A8F440"/>
humorouſly affecting, than the extreme gratitude of the obliged. When I returned to the parſonage I went in ſmiling, but with tears in my eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Very well, very well!" ſaid my uncle, "you ſeem to be affected; you have then a generous heart." Then taking me by the hand, he added: "Juliette, I ſhould have been well pleaſed with the commiſſion myſelf; but I rather choſe to give that pleaſure to you."</p>
                     <p>Indeed, my dear Celina, I ſhall never forget this affecting interview. I begin to hope that peaceful days, and even days of real enjoyment, are reſerved for me in this obſcure retreat.</p>

This evening, in a ſort of hall, I obſerved ſeveral inſtruments of muſic: my ſtate of mind was ſuch as to leave me no inclination for exerting my feeble talents, and had it even been otherwiſe, I ſhould have thought it moſt adviſable not to diſcover them. "As little as you like muſic," ſaid my uncle, "I purpoſe to learn you what little I know of it. Do not deny yourſelf this amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is of great advantage in adverſity. I'll maintain that there is no grief nor misfortune ſo great, that a fine piece of Gluck or Piccini<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe were two eminent maſters of muſic.</note> will

not charm it away. Oh it cannot be diſputed! I am the friend of all mankind. And believe me, when I am caſt down by the languors of my ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary condition, there is my baſe-viol! I lay hold of it, and ſaw upon it with all my might. My moſt violent fits of melancholy cannot reſiſt its power during one morning. It is quite otherwiſe when we form a concert, for then I believe myſelf in heaven! Yes, my niece, as poor as you find me, we ſometimes form a concert! I will tell you how it is. It is clear that this inſtrument cannot be mine, for it is worth three years of my ſalary; it is the piano of a lady who entruſted me with it at the requeſt of her brother. Her brother is the moſt intimate of my friends, and I cannot but boaſt of it; for the excellent youth is without an equal. When his ſiſter comes with him, ſhe plays on the piano; he ſeizes his violin; their maſter draws from its caſe the divine clarinet, and the trio en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants me. But I have ſuch ſtrong reaſons for preferring the quatuor, that I wiſh to become one of the party. It is true, that I ſometimes diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode it, by keeping my part behind the reſt. What then? Suppoſe I do not keep perfect time? Theſe are the ſmall inconveniences of meaſure. Where can we find the roſe which is deſtitute of thorns? The maſter gives me the moſt uneaſineſs of any in the company. I always tremble when he takes notice of my part, leſt he become affronted and take to his heels. Worthleſs man! how trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome he is! As good luck would have it, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are not ſo impatient, and accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, dear inſtrument! to thy frequent inſults, And in the action of playing, my dear companion, ſuch as it is, gives me ſuch pleaſing ecſtacies, that it would be cruel to forbid it me. You ſhall ſee,

Juliette, you ſhall ſee! there is nothing in the world ſo charming. Nothing ſo charming! I miſtake. Ah, my niece, I have often wiſhed to marry another muſician! yes, my niece, "<hi>they ought to marry the prieſts.</hi>" On ſaying theſe words, he became penſive and ſad: then ſeizing his conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory inſtrument, "Come," ſaid he, "let us divert ourſelves." As he did the day before yeſterday, he now played more than an hour; and, as I did at that time, I now went away without his ſeeming to perceive it.</p>

                     <p>O CELINA! in what amazement do I ſtill remain! What young man is this, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to my ſight the living image of an individual of his ſex whom I have reaſon to dread, and whom I may juſtly deſpiſe; yet has only given me a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe deſtitute of terror? Who, nevertheleſs, has power to diſturb my repoſe; to give me ſuch lively emotions as I never felt before; and a ſecret agitation which gives me no pain? And, to continue; Whence proceeds this ſtrange emotion of inward ſatisfaction, the cauſe of which I cannot divine? Alas! it is only a conſequence of that condition to which I am reduced; a condition ſo wretched that I may eſteem myſelf happy when any incidents affect me which are not extremely diſtreſſing!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:035743_0129_1006AF195FB7BC58"/>This evening I was employed in a piece of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily buſineſs which is needleſs—Ah, wherefore? Why ſhould I wiſh to conceal it? How could I ſo ſoon forget what my uncle told me for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation? It is not an hour ſince he told it me. Does that ſort of objection which mankind annex to every ſervile profeſſion, extend to an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate woman who knows how to yield to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited abaſement? Or is it true, that any laborious profeſſions are diſgraceful in themſelves? It is an abſurd prejudice which diſgraces thoſe profeſſions which are allowed both by our manners and laws; ſuch as cannot be deſpiſed but on account of their unnoticed utility, or their unrewarded painful labours. There are none of theſe deſpiſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may juſtly be called mean, however low they may appear in the eyes of thoſe men who are ſo ridiculouſly proud, as to ſuppoſe that nature has formed them for managing ſervants and being maſters. Is there any low rank amongſt mankind which may not be honored for its peculiar virtues, and thoſe virtues united to ſentiments worthy of a better condition?</p>
                     <p>No, my ſiſter, moſt certainly there is not. My uncle's opinion was juſt. I bear witneſs to it with a conſcience at perfect eaſe. I feel the truth of it by that noble pride which accompanies the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude we ſtand in need of, in order to endure miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. But pardon the emotion of falſe ſhame which affected me; for I am more aſhamed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to hide from you ſuch an inſignificant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any thing elſe. The buſineſs I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in was that of ironing (not the worſt) ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice of the poor Curate.</p>
                     <p>Juſt at that time I heard a noiſe near the houſe that did not excite my attention, but my uncle
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035743_0130_1006AF1B39310D60"/>
ſtarted ſuddenly and cried out with joy, "My young friend has returned." He ran haſtily out and came back in a moment, attended by a young man.—O my ſiſter! conceive my amazement when I ſaw Murville before me!</p>
                     <p>But no, no, thought I, this cannot be Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. However perfect the reſemblance may at firſt appear to others, the difference is now very ſtriking to me. At the firſt glance I could not quite determine; but immediately afterwards I was convinced of my miſtake. I plainly ſaw in this ſtranger the ſtature and external form of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor; but his features and behaviour were very different. The deportment of Murville is ſo full of aſſurance, that he appears more commanding: this ſtranger, however, is not deſtitute of engaging manners, and poſſeſſes natural graces not to be found in the other. The handſome figure of my perſecutor diſcovers all the vivacity which uſually accompanies a perſon of lively wit; but he is greatly deficient in the mildneſs of aſpect which appears in the other; in that impreſſion of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which gives him the greateſt charm. Had this been Murville, he would have accoſted me before now, with ſo much gallantry that I could hardly have endured his preſence. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, this ſtranger ſtopped as ſoon as he ſaw me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtood on the threſhold of the door ſupriſed and out of countenance, as if he thought it dangerous to come in: and whilſt he looked at me ſeveral times, as it were by ſtealth, his face was covered with bluſhes; and Murville, perhaps, never bluſhed in his life: and if he ſhould by chance appear to be diſconcerted in the preſence of a woman, he would probably conſider it a diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>No, my ſiſter, this young man is not my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035743_0131_1006AF2019BA51A8"/>
and though he preſents to my eyes the image of him, he does not affrighten me. I could not have thought it poſſible ever to find in two perſons ſuch ſimilar figures and ſuch a different carriage.</p>
                     <p>To continue; he remained motionleſs, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily gave him all my attention, till at length my unfortunate uncle, with cries of grief, called my attention to another object—"O my ſurplice! my beſt ſurplice, my niece! you burn my beſt ſurplice!"</p>
                     <p>In fact, when the young man firſt made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, my hand was raiſed up, and afterwards, by a motion perfectly mechanical, gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with the hot iron, which, being held ſtill in the midſt of my work, had made a conſiderable breach in it.</p>
                     <p>M. Sevin, much hurt, ſcolded Juliette. Then the ſtranger approached to ſtammer ſomething in my behalf, and could not fail of ſucceeding: for my uncle is incapable of holding reſentment for a long time againſt any perſon. At this time his good nature returned ſooner than I deſired, and he exerciſed it at the expence of his niece and his friend. M. Sevin, in his pleaſantry, firſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the young man on his eagerneſs in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blunders of a pretty girl. Then turning to Juliette, he aſked her laughingly, why ſhe was ſo eaſily diſtracted at the light of a handſome young man? What the reaſon is I cannot tell; but the gaiety of the good Curate, which, on a thouſand other occaſions has never diſpleaſed me, has now become ſo troubleſome that I cannot bear it.</p>
                     <p>How I wiſh he was ſtill offended! What would I not give that he would begin to quarrel with me again! In haſte to get rid of his pleaſantry I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035743_0132_1006AF21B3BC79F0"/>
the firſt pretence that came in my head, ran to my chamber and ſhut myſelf in. Here, to find ſome diverſion to my reveries, I am haſtily writing to my ſiſter what has juſt paſſed amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>Yet I cannot but have ſome curioſity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to learn the name and family of this young man. To know—But he is now going away, and my uncle calls me. Adieu, my ſiſter.</p>

                     <p>O MY brother! rejoice with me—I have juſt ſeen her! and ſhe is quite well—Better, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than ſhe has ever appeared to you in her happieſt days! My arrival, which ſhe expected was not ſo near<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has not a little contributed to her contentment. Did I write to you that I had been a journey? I have indeed been a very fortunate one, and more fortunate than I dared to expect. For it ſeparated me from her but a ſhort time, and my ſudden, unexpected return has given her the greateſt joy. And if you knew how near death has appeared to her ſight, you would believe that her joy was not unnatural to her circumſtances! But her dangers, I hope, are all at an end. O happy circumſtance! ſhe is ſaved! She has eſcaped the impending danger that awaited her. The loſs of Bovile will not bring her to an untimely grave!</p>
                     <p>Not that ſhe has ceaſed to love him—Ah! if the heart of Eleanor was capable of changing, I ſhould
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035743_0133_1006AF2730879198"/>
deſpair of finding conſtancy in women. This is too unnatural to think of—No, my ſiſter has not ceaſed to cheriſh the memory of her lover. But, my brother, as you mentioned in your letter, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cannot laſt forever. Sooner or later a day propitious to the unfortunate will arrive, that will wipe away their tears. Whilſt I am ſpeaking of the misfortunes of Eleanor, you will doubtleſs be of the opinion that ſhe would be deſirous of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the details of Bovile's laſt moments. I ſay his laſt moments, and perhaps I am wrong; until we have more ample ecclairciſſements, we ſhould ſay his laſt exploits: for Bovile's fate is not well known. Although we have ſtrong reaſons for preſuming his death, it is not abſolutely declared. It appears but too certain, that the enemies of this brave man have ſhamefully deſtroyed him. Is it equally true that they have received the reward of their crimes? Can any man poſitively determine whether he is ſtill in being? Have patience with me, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whilſt I expreſs theſe doubts. O that they might appear leſs unreaſonable to me! I do but repeat them after my ſiſter. Her tenderneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in them, whilſt her reaſon rejects them. Where are the unfortunate perſons who do not eagerly court the ſhadow of hope? If, however, ſhe muſt renounce this ſhadow; if it becomes a known fact that Bovile is loſt, do you believe that his enemies, in order to finiſh their iniquity, will ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the confiſcation of his goods, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, except by diſgracing his memory?</p>
                     <p>Be kind enough, Murville, to anſwer theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries. In the city where you reſide, it will not be difficult to obtain information.

                     <p>HOW ſtrange is my deſtiny! Whilſt I am not tormented by fatal events, my mind is perpetually haraſſed with alarming accidents. At the hazard of my life was I reſcued from the caſtle where the moſt indelicate of lovers confined me, to ſeek an inſecure aſylum, where I am, as it were, in the power and in the hands of my perſecutor. At the ſight of that young man whom I ſaw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, I ought indeed to have trembled! Not that he may have any intention of doing me the leaſt injury; but as he is the brother of Murville, he may ruin me without deſigning it. Therefore the agitation of mind I felt yeſterday was but a forewarning of my critical ſituation: and the preſent agitation and anxiety I feel, is only a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence of my new poſition. Although I may be allowed to hope that there will not be any circumſtances calculated to diſcover the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emilia de Varmont; yet, there is abundant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that Mademoiſelle de Terville may be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035743_0135_1006AF37F89DAAE8"/>
diſcovered by a thouſand accidents. For inſtance, is it not probable that this young man, when writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his brother, may mention ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances—Ah, why? Why ſhould he? What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can he have for mentioning me in his correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with Murville? What probability can there be of his ſpeaking to his brother about Juliette, an obſcure country girl? I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he will. This is nothing but a groundleſs fear. Ah, my ſiſter, how we cheriſh the unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intruder when our imaginations are tortured with gloomy apprehenſions! There is not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, an abſolute improbability in it; he may, by chance, make ſome mention of me in his letters. In fact, I may well think ſo, when I have entirely devoted the preſent one to him. A fine compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon truly! Yet how extreme is the difference! My own ſecurity will often call my attention to this young man; but what is there in me ſufficiently intereſting to excite his attention? But my ſelf-love leads me aſtray and ſhews me an imaginary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>Yet, after all, I have other reaſons for indulging my fears, which are not ſo imaginary, and which are too well founded. What can prevent Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, in an unexpected moment, from coming to ſpend ſeveral days with his brother and ſiſter in the city of Tours, ſo near the hamlet in which I am concealed? And how can I prevent a meeting which I tremble to think of? There is but one way to prevent it and that is by flight. But I am called, and muſt leave you ſuddenly. Farewell.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE now taken that part which ſeems moſt ſuitable for my condition—that of bringing my benefactor to a recollection of the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he contracted with me, of not informing any perſon what little I told him concerning my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. The good Curate renewed his promiſes, and proteſted that every body ſhould remain in the perſuaſion of my being his niece, and that his friend already believed it. Beſides this, I entertain hopes of another expedient. It ſeems impoſſible that this young man can have manners and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples like thoſe of his brother. Every thing in him conſpires to convince the beholder of the real good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart. His outward appearance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and courteous; his countenance full of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with an air of goodneſs and candour. But it ſeems to me I have already told you—What mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it if I do make a few repetitions? I truſt you will forgive them. He has an excellent heart, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, if I may believe my uncle, an excellent heart indeed. He is my uncle's intimate friend. Does not this circumſtance add ſtill to his praiſe? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine alſo to gain his eſteem, his attention, and even excite his curioſity. Before he becomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my misfortunes, I would wiſh to have him feel intereſted in my happineſs. And hereafter, if occaſion ſhould require it, I ſhould wiſh, with complete aſſurance of his friendſhip, to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035743_0137_1006AF410C0D3C50"/>
tell him a part of my ſorrows and apprehenſions, ſo as to acquire another protector who will warn me of Murville's approach, and turn him away from the place of my retreat, and who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually watch over my ſafety. In ſuch a critical ſituation I cannot provide too many reſources, nor conduct beforehand with too much caution. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear a noiſe at the door—I run to it—but I am miſtaken, nobody knocked. It is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeven o'clock, and my uncle tells me the young man generally come by ſix at lateſt. What is the reaſon he is not here? Surely the preſence of a third perſon would not render the ſociety of his friend leſs agreeable. But perhaps my preſence would diſcommode them. Yet I ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb their converſation, nor meddle with it. Yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, for inſtance, I did not ſay one word during his ſtay. This might have given him ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Perhaps he thought me ſovereignly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful. Scarcely had he taken his ſeat before I went away and left him: and when I retired it was with ſo much eagerneſs, that he muſt have believed I deſignedly treated him with unpoliteneſs. If ſo, he is much miſtaken. I am afraid he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, although he knew not the cauſe of my plight. To-day, therefore, it will be neceſſary to take away that impreſſion, by giving him a more favourable reception, and, above all things, not to leave him. I determine, by all means, to keep him company, and not leave him till he goes away. How now! the pariſh clock ſtrikes, and I can count but ſix ſtrokes! Then I look at the index, and that points to ſix alſo! It muſt then have been but five o'clock when my ears—Indeed I cannot tell what is the matter with me, for to-day I have heard and done every thing upſide down, and in

ſuch a manner as makes me feel impatient with myſelf. But I feel well contented to think it is no later. I begin to be afraid he will not come at all. I cannot but feel deſirous of ſeeing him again, and it is perfectly natural that I ſhould; for I am not yet acquainted with him. It is alſo true that I feel deſirous of anticipating a favourable opinion of him, but—Somebody knocks! now, certainly, I am not miſtaken. Adieu for the preſent.</p>

                     <p>With regard to what I wrote you concerning the young man, I was not miſtaken. He was certainly offended: I am ſure of it. His addreſs was graceful and reſpectful; but there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his behaviour ſo polite and reſerved, as to make it appear cold and forbidding. There was one obſervation I made, much to his advantage, which I cannot forbear mentioning. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his countenance a ſort of timid anxiety, which diſcovers an inward fear of offending; ſuch a mixture of noble pride and exalted goodneſs in his heart, as inclines me to admire him. I was preparing to give him a kind reception. Soon did
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035743_0139_1006AF4595A80588"/>
I perceive that he conſidered me in the light of a perſon deſirous of retrieving my errors; ſoon did his features reſume a look of ſatisfaction, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of benevolence unſpeakably charming. And, at the ſame inſtant, I experienced an inward emotion of ſatisfaction difficult to expreſs. Thus far all was well. But, unfortunately for me, my uncle took it into his head to aſk his friend, "whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the object of his late journey would remain a ſecret much longer?"</p>
                     <p>"This journey," anſwered his excellent friend, "is peculiarly intereſting to my ſiſter, and this is all I am permitted to tell you.

This is a ſecret of Madame Florival: as for my own ſecrets, they ſhall ever be yours, but thoſe of my ſiſter I have no right to reveal."</p>
                     <p>You will, I believe, be well ſatisfied with his anſwer. As for me, I was delighted with it; and, as for my uncle, he ſeemed well ſatisfied with it himſelf. In the mean time M. Dolerval continued to entertain us with his ſiſter, and ſeemed as if he would never ceaſe praiſing her. It is ſaid that lovers are enthuſiaſts. As for myſelf, I am not acquainted with their language; but if they uſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in praiſe of the perſons they admire, ſimilar to thoſe which the tendereſt of brothers employed in praiſing his ſiſter, their language muſt indeed be captivating. Whilſt I liſtened to his converſation, it inſpired me with unſpeakable ſatisfaction. Ah! why ſhould a ſudden return to myſelf ſo cruelly diſpel my infatuation! How happy, thought I, muſt be this Madame Florival, whom heaven has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with ſuch a brother! And what is my crime that I ſhould be ſiſter to the inhuman Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont? However it may be with you, my dear
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035743_0140_1006AF49EE7320E8"/>
Celina, this painful compariſon, this dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt, wounded me to the very ſoul. In vain did I ſtruggle to calm the fatal agitations of my mind. Oppreſſed with the weight of my ſorrows, I was ready to ſink under them: ſo that I was obliged to quit my place and retire to my chamber, where I ſhed a torrent of tears. After indulging my grief for a conſiderable time, I reflected on my abſence, and fearing it would appear to M. Dolerval as another unpolite retreat, I wiped away my tears and returned. At my return, he ſeemed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in my ſorrow, and earneſtly deſired to know whether I was indiſpoſed. He queſtioned me with a tone of ſympathy ſuitable to my wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, had he even been acquainted with it. His countenance changed, and he did violence to his feelings in order to conceal the intereſt he had in mine: and it was but a few minutes after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn before he went away.</p>
                     <p>And what ſleeping fury took poſſeſſion of my uncle! he now declared it was time to go to bed. True, the clock had ſtruck eleven, but I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſomething had deranged it. How can it be poſſible that five long hours have glided away ſince the young man's arrival? The clock ſurely goes too faſt. Yeſterday I was of the ſame opinion, and that opinion is now confirmed; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the night has ſeemed of an extraordinary length. Twenty times did I awake thinking it was day; but it was nothing but the eternal moon, whoſe never ending light deceived me. I was ready to think the ſun would never riſe. What folly is it in my uncle to be ſo particular about the hour of riſing! I pity thoſe people who cannot meaſure time without the aſſiſtance of a clock.</p>
                     <p>I will, however, except my uncle and M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035743_0141_1006AF4D35B4E6C0"/>
M. Dolerval went away as ſoon as I came back from my chamber. What urgent matter called him away ſo ſoon? He muſt have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me. Thus it happens: one apparent breach of politeneſs after another have I ſeemed guilty of towards this young man. Why did I not repreſs my grief and ſtay with him? How can I ever obtain any friends while I conduct ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely? And if my cruel enemies ſhould chance to come and aſſault me, I ſhould find no perſon who would care to engage in my defence, and look around me in vain for aſſiſtance. Perhaps I ſhall be forced to fly from my enemies before they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Perhaps I ſhall be driven from one place to another, and I know not whither to hide my ſhame, confuſion and deſpair.</p>

                     <p>WHAT deteſtable writing is this! Full of deceitful and equivocal phraſes! "I have juſt ſeen her; ſhe is well; her dangers are at an end!" At firſt I imagined ſome caſualty had brought you in the way of my ingrate Terville, and you was going to cheer my heart with a relation of that happy adventure. No ſuch thing! Your honor deigned not to mention it! Nor do you ſo much as think of offering me a ſingle word of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You was only ſpeaking of a ſiſter and brother, as if you ought not to know that the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035743_0142_1006AF541FAC94E0"/>
deareſt, and, perhaps, the only object with which you can entertain a lover, eſpecially an unfortunate one, is his miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Yet I cannot but thank you, Dolerval, for the good news you ſent me. I am overjoyed to learn that my ſiſter has recovered, but am not at all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at it. Although I knew her ſenſibility was extreme, I never thought ſhe would die of it. As for the ſweetneſs of thoſe charming paſſions which inclines an afflicted woman to follow her deceaſed lover to the grave, I do not believe in it. But I am aſtoniſhed beyond all expreſſion, to learn that the happy Eleanor is well, and, at preſent, better than I have ever ſeen her in her happieſt days! What, ſuch a ſpeedy and complete return of health and happineſs already? Whence comes this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy? You, however, affirm it to be true, and I am bound to believe it. But after all, I muſt perſiſt in believing that my ſiſter has had good ſenſe enough to take my preſcription, and Bovile, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been entirely forgotten, has, at laſt, obtained a ſucceſſor.</p>
                     <p>Why do you exclaim with ſo much vehemence? Not one circumſtance in your letter has eſcaped my notice. You awkwardly endeavour to make it appear that "<hi>the unfortunate delight in careſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhadows.</hi>" Very well; I congratulate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in having ſuch a pleaſant amuſement, but ſtill inſiſt upon it, that it is high time for our ſiſter to careſs realities. And notwithſtanding your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete writing, and her long-tried virtue, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded this is the part ſhe has taken. How much better for ſociety! To its great advantage I ſee a good effect, which being caſt into commerce, will infallibly increaſe its funds. How much better for the amiable widow! By this means, perhaps, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035743_0143_1006AF5CCF21EE90"/>
may be agreeable at twenty-two years of age. Give her my ſincere congratulations, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval; and, in the ſucceſsful career which attends her, may ſhe never forget what great acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments are due to my counſels, too lately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                     <p>The reaſonings which your foreknowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafts on Bovile's future reſurrection, are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. But read the following, and the lateſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which was given me by an eye-witneſs of the fact, and if you cannot give as much credit to his teſtimony as I do, then do not divulge it. "We were," ſays he, "off againſt the Azores when the Engliſh fleet hove in ſight. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our inferiority, it was the duty of our Admiral to protect the convoy, and he has done it. But when the ſignal of retreat was given, it was evident that the Pallas was not in a ſituation of obeying it. It was likewiſe true, that if they had continued the engagement half an hour longer, they might have gained the important advantage of diſengaging her from the Engliſh fleet, and entirely ſaving the convoy. But inſtead of this, they left her expoſed to the croſs-fire of three frigates and a ſhip of the line. Then the brave commander of the Pallas, zealous of waſhing off the ſtain which cowardice had imprinted on the French flag, with the enemy's blood, ſuſtained, for a long time, a moſt unequal combat. At the cloſe of the day his frigate was cut down to the water's edge, by the inceſſant fire of the enemy, and ready to ſink. A few ſailors were ſaved in the boat. But bound by the oath which obliges every Captain to remain in his ſhip till the laſt extremity, the intrepid Bovile determined to bury himſelf and his ſhip together in the waves. O curſed thirſt of gold! the avaricious
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035743_0144_1006AF64961B60C8"/>
conquerors, in their greedineſs for plunder, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued our merchant fleet, and left a number of men to periſh for want of aſſiſtance. There were not ſaved from the wreck of the Pallas more than ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty men: and, to complete our misfortunes, the Captain was not in the number of priſoners. The vile enemies of this brave man have completely ſucceeded in their deteſtable plots, and the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Bovile has periſhed.</p>
                     <p>"But this dreadful ſucceſs has not aſſuaged their revengeful ſpirits. They have put in at Terceira to repair the French ſquadron, where they have held a council of war, diſgraced the memory of Bovile, and, horrible to relate, have confiſcated his property."</p>
                     <p>I do not tranſcribe the reflections of my correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent, becauſe they might ſully my imagination. But here, Dolerval, are facts which ſpeak for themſelves. Let us now leave theſe gloomy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and refreſh our weary attention by viewing cheerful pictures.</p>
                     <p>To take it all in all, your late letter was void of common ſenſe. It muſt have been that when you wrote, you was a little crazy. It muſt be ſo. You have either become a fool, or you are in love. What can it be but ſomething in your late jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, of which you did not acquaint me? What can it be but that extraordinary adventure which gave you ſuch a mixture of anxiety and ſurpriſe? Come then, Dolerval, acknowledge the fact—ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there is ſome laſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Fillete. This is uſed ſometimes in a bad ſenſe.</note> on the carpet. Do not endeavour to be too diſcrete: if you do, you will have reaſon to repent of it. It will not be ſufficient that fortune ſhould throw you into the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035743_0145_1006AF66529C1190"/>
way, unleſs you have ſuch a guide as your inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience requires. Conſider what advantage El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eanor has derived from my counſels. Depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, my brother, that I have an equal friendſhip for you. Be not then ſo unkind as to hide any of her affairs from me, nor any of yours. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of your hearts I ſhall govern with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt care. As circumſtances require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct both of you in the beſt and readieſt means of arriving to the end propoſed. Provided your ſiſter will not diſcourage the aſſailants, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to her all the wiles of attack: and, as for you, I will enlighten you in all the little mimicries of defence. Thus will both of you, retrieving the time you have loſt, attain to my experience in the career of happineſs, and the hopes of your ſucceſs already ſoftens my misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>Yes, my brother, I alſo am in misfortune! I cannot hear any thing from Mademoiſelle de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. A ſpy whom I keep in the neighbourhood of M. de Varmont, aſſures me ſhe is not at Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My good friend, therefore, did not run away with her. The little gipſy wanted no aſſiſtance in order to eſcape me. This matter acquires a good deal of probability, and it vexes me extremely. More than once have I ſurpriſed myſelf regretting the perfidious maid. Then, in milder mood, I tell myſelf that it is nothing leſs than a ſerious attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This idea torments me. Oh! if ever I ſhould find her again—if I ſhould find her, I would hold her ſo cloſely that ſhe could not ſtray from her happineſs!</p>
                     <p>In hopes of finding her, I have made an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with one in this city, who occupies ſome of my leiſure hours. This affords me a little amuſement, and that is all. I feel a void in the

company of the handſomeſt women. O! let Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Terville but make her appearance again, and for her ſake I would ſuddenly quit every other!</p>

                     <p>DEAR Emilia! what a mixture of horrible and conſoling narratives do I together re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive! What matter of extreme affliction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible joy are united in this long ſeries of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which I receive as the book of your deſtiny! Thoſe fearful ſuſpicions which appeared ſo full of horror, that I ſometimes reproached myſelf for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining them, were but too well founded. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous monſter! when he boaſted to me of the great riches your death would leave him, he pronounced your ſentence! He departed, O bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous man! to take your life! When he bade me adieu, he departed to deſtroy the moſt amiable, the ſweeteſt, and moſt excellent of women—his ſiſter and mine! O God! a God terrible to the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035743_0147_1006AF749F032DB0"/>
wicked, where are the puniſhments inflicted on the murderer who imbrued his hands in the blood of Abel? When will the bottomleſs pit be opened to ſwallow the monſter which nature groans to bear? Where is thy lingering juſtice? What withholds thine avenging hand? But my Emilia ſtill lives! To her, whilſt in the abyſs of ſorrows and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Moſt High extended his arm, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly drew her from thence. To his wonderful goodneſs do I owe the warmeſt praiſes.</p>
                     <p>Yes, my ſiſter is yet in exiſtence. Happily for me, my eyes were aſſured of it; happily for me, the characters of your dear hand—thoſe well known characters, had given me a certain proof that you was ſtill in being, before the perfidious monſter had come to rejoice at your death. On this very morning the wretch preſumed to trouble my parlour with his preſence. Being deſirous of knowing what new enormities he could have in contemplation. I did myſelf ſo much violence as to affront his aſpect. Ferocious tiger! what joy brightened in his ſanguinary eye! He had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Breſt, and immediately brought to me, the verbal proceſs which proved the deſtruction of the Centaure, and conſequently your tragical end. "Her huſband," ſaid he, "ſoon followed her; the hero, of whom your father had ſuch a high opinion, is dead. Yes, he is dead; and what may ſeem worthy of remark, before dying he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored. Juſtice has taken hold of his property; but that of his wife is ſeized by diſtreſs. Thanks to the perſecutions I have begun, her dowry will be given up, to remain ſafely in my hands; ſo that if ſhe ſhould happen to be alive, and ſhould ever return, ſhe may have it again." At this laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I could not reſtrain the indignation I felt,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035743_0148_1006AF77E54EEB28"/>
and cried out, "If ever ſhe returns—O barbarous man!"</p>
                     <p>At this moment I had well nigh betrayed both you and myſelf. But in a moment I became ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our danger, and, in a lower voice, repeated, "If ever ſhe returns! O barbarous wretch!—then be ſatisfied."</p>
                     <p>He mildly anſwered me, "that it would be agreeable enough to ſee you again; but it would always be diſagreeable to return ſo much money." And then, to diſencumber himſelf of a multitude of papers, he called in his domeſtic, who was no other than Lafleur! At the ſudden approach of this man, who had, as it were, held a ſword to the breaſt of Emilia, I was ſeized with horror; but ſoon conſidering the miſerable wretch as your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, I was overcome with ſentiments of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and had not the grates prevented me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould have fallen at his feet, and in exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive gratitude have thanked him for not ſhutting his ears againſt the voice of humanity. In the mean time, whether he perceived the impreſſion that the ſight of him made upon me, or whether a view of Emilia's ſiſter affected him deeply, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay; but Lafleur loſt all countenance. With a pale viſage he leaned againſt the wall, and at length ſat down ready to faint. His maſter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it without emotion, and aſked him "whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was ſubject to ſuch fits of weakneſs?" The unfortunate domeſtic anſwered ſeveral times, but with a faltering voice, "that he was not."</p>
                     <p>"So much the better," cried the inhuman Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, "for if the fits of your diſorder ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more frequent, it would be neceſſary that we ſhould part."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:035743_0149_1006AF79AFCB4A60"/>Upon hearing this, fearing I could not reſtrain my indignation, I left him.</p>
                     <p>Thus your aſſaſſin is about to receive the fruits of his iniquity. In a little time he will enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with your ſpoils: and, as I cannot prevent it, I muſt calmly endure it. Alas! of all the bleſſings the preſent life can beſtow, there is none reſerved but your life. And if I ſhould indiſcretely betray you, I ſhould die with deſpair. Be tranquil, my charming ſiſter, for I would ſooner loſe my life than reveal the ſecret of your exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>With regard to your real ſituation, I know not what advice to give you. What information can you expect from my inexperience? I could not, on this occaſion, forbear conſulting a lady in the chamber, who is my friend. She is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your letters, and hand them to me. Tell me whether you think this a dangerous expedient.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; neglect no precaution for preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſecurity; redouble your vigilance; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conceal your exiſtence from every eye. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all your courage to reſiſt your misfortunes. And who does not ſtand in need of fortitude? This life is one continued ſcene of trials and ſorrow. Ah! if I ſhould preſent you with a picture of thoſe which aſſault me in my confinement, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would find that Juliette, all wretched as ſhe is, cannot be more ſo than the unhappy Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina!</p>

                     <p>OH let him take my riches! nobody will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him. I ſhall beware of expoſing him to the alternative of reſtoring them, or again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to deſtroy me. Oh, let him take them! But may he, and it is the laſt wiſh which the cries of nature ſhall extort from me, thoſe cries which he has refuſed to hear; may he never find any pleaſure in enjoying them; may he always be tormented with the inſupportable remembrance of the crime by which he obtained them; may keen remorſe take poſſeſſion of his heart, and prey upon it; may he, in a frightful diſorder of mind, often hear my plaintive voice; in the gloom of night, may he ſee my bloody ſhade ſtanding cloſe at his ſide; and may he, in fine, become the moſt wretched of mortals in this life, and, at laſt, obtain pardon of God!</p>
                     <p>Never let me hear from him again, except to inform me of his repentance.</p>
                     <p>Beware alſo of conſulting that lady whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and aſſiſtance you propoſed. It would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perilous, without a known neceſſity, to admit any perſon to ſhare in our confidence. Adverſity is a ſevere maſter. It ſeems to have undertaken the taſk of inſtructing my ſad and inexperienced youth. By rude leſſons, and in a ſhort time, has it enlightened my ignorance, improved my reaſon, and formed my judgment. By reaſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035743_0151_1006AF8199E42898"/>
with which it inſpires me, on difficult occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I conſult myſelf alone.</p>
                     <p>And even at the preſent time, I begin to perceive the error of deſpairing in myſelf. I perceive there is no impoſſibility of finding perſons whom I can inſpire with ſentiments of humanity. M. Dolerval has been with us almoſt every evening ſince I firſt ſaw him. And when I ſuppoſed my company would incommode him, or prove diſagreeable, I was greatly deceived. Quite the contrary—he conſiders it a fortunate circumſtance that I abide with my uncle. Sometimes I hear him compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Curate on the happineſs of having his niece at his houſe—"A niece," ſaid he, "ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and engaging." Another circumſtance which gives me equal encouragement, is to obſerve my uncle's kindneſs towards me daily increaſing. If I ſhould undertake to inform you the many ways he has of ſhowing his regard for me, and the kind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions he pays me, I ſhould never end. There is no kind of labour but which he fears will fatigue Juliette, nor is there any proviſion which he thinks good enough for her. If I would ſuffer it, he would ruin himſelf for my ſake! I really believe, if I would conſent to it, that he would ſo far take the charge of houſehold affairs, that I ſhould have nothing to do but walk, eat my uſual meals, and ſleep from morning till night.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you would be willing to learn how we ſpend our days. Of the mornings I have not much to ſay; they are chiefly ſpent in domeſtic affairs, and, conſequently, are not very intereſting; but after dinner, M. Dolerval comes, and finds us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the garden. My uncle works there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but how can his niece do any thing? If I take the rake or the ſpade, M. Sevin is offended,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035743_0152_1006AF83688B3DF0"/>
and tells me I am not ſtrong enough; if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prop the plants, M. Dolerval prevents me, and pretends it will hurt my hands: and, if you will believe me, he will not even allow me to water the flowers. Now I think of it, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gather flowers for me. M. Dolerval collects a <note n="*" place="bottom">Bouquet.</note>bunch of them every evening. And it muſt be acknowledged the one he collects and binds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for me, is better compoſed, interwoven more agreeably, and with more grace, than the one M. Sevin obliges me to wear every morning.</p>
                     <p>When the day declines, the dew incommodes us and we return to the houſe. The good Curate then ſups, or prates in his uſual manner. But M. Dolerval, more than any of us, ſupports and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens the converſation. He relates the pleaſures and incidents of his childhood, the recreations and employments of his youth, with much ingenuity. The details he enters upon derive their chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt from the manner in which they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. You cannot form an idea of the luſtre which his converſation gives to the minuteſt reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. And I cannot but think he conſiders my opinion to be of ſome conſequence. Whenever he enters into converſation, though he always ſpeaks in an engaging manner, he never ſeems to be ſatisfied with himſelf until he ſees in my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance an air of approbation. At length he directs his diſcourſe to me. He queſtions me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the place of my birth, my parentage, and the firſt objects of my attachment. But do not think it vain curioſity on his part, or done merely to paſs an idle hour. O far from it! there is no room for ſuch an opinion. You can evidently ſee
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035743_0153_1006AF86E81D8418"/>
that it is out of pure intereſt for yourſelf that he thus queſtions you. And now obſerve, my ſiſter; when his inquiries become too embarraſſing, my uncle comes to my aſſiſtance. But M. Dolerval ſeems always to regret that the anſwer comes not from me.</p>
                     <p>Thus our evenings glide away with inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſwiftneſs. Surpriſing as it may ſeem, the clock always ſtrikes twelve at night ſoon after M. Dolerval goes away. I have reaſon to think, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, from my preſent experience, that there is no ſituation in life, however unhappy it may at firſt ſight appear, which does not, in itſelf, afford ſome compenſation. To take it all in all, I can aſſure you that my own begins to ſeem quite ſupportable.</p>

                     <p>I COULD not, my brother, conſiſtently ſhew your laſt letter to Madame Florival. For in that letter you treated our worthy ſiſter with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme irreverence and indecency. This ſurpriſes me the more, becauſe I have often heard it affirmed of the greateſt libertines, that even in the midſt of their mad career, they would always preſerve ſome reſpect for a virtuous character. Pardon me, Murville, for it would really give me pain to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you; but to read the inſulting expreſſions you wrote concerning Eleanor, is more than I can bear. Has ſhe not, by long and painful trials,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035743_0154_1006AF93C915F168"/>
merited a better treatment? Rather than thus raſhly condemn her, you ought, at leaſt, to ſuſpend your judgment. But ſince you ſeem to require new teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies of the merit ſhe ſtill deſerves, you may be aſſured it will one day be in my power to produce them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then, my brother, you will be forced to acknowledge the reality of faithful love.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the time may alſo come when you will not ſuſpect me of delighting in baſe inclinations, nor hope to inſpire me with ſuch ſentiments as you have recommended. It is true, that if I ſhould hereafter find an object on whom I ſhould place my affections, it may be one of that claſs which the men of the world call inferior, an object of their eternal diſdain. It may be a girl whom blind fate has placed in a humble condition; but who, between the low ſituation in which ſhe is placed, and the exalted qualities of her mind, would form ſuch a perfect contraſt, that even in this humble ſtate, ſhe would appear to be as much diſplaced as many others would, though removed from the midſt of their grandeur. A brilliant education ſhould not have nurtured her in the ſentiments of ſuperior ſelf-excellence, which are, in early life, inſtilled into the minds of people in an elevated rank; but ſhe ſhould have the inward conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every thing praiſe-worthy or blameable; ſhe ſhould have that true ſenſe of an exquiſite delicacy, which, without ſtudy, would direct her mind to every noble truth; ſimple nature ſhould have given her without labour or expence, thoſe rare accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, which your ladies of high rank ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom obtain by all the efforts of art. She ſhould not only poſſeſs a taſte for uſeful employments, a love of ſubſtantial virtues, and an aptneſs for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving every amiable talent, but ſhould, in reality,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035743_0155_1006AF9ECDB31098"/>
have more true nobility in her ſoul, than nature often beſtows on the daughters of Kings. In fine, ſhe ſhould not atract attention by the vain ſhew of her outward appearance, nor the extravagance of her demands; but ſhould appear, when dreſſed in white linen, and a ruſe on her breaſt, more beautiful than the richeſt ladies decked with dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and purple. The beginning of her adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence ſhould not only ſhine with the winning at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of that age, but the brighter charms of the age which ſucceeds. She ſhould, in a ſupreme degree, combine in her perſon, not only the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dignity and graces of beauty, but even poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs its treaſures. It there is, in reality, ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the one I have here painted with a thouſand attractions, or, what is ſtill more ſurpriſing, the one you would give the mean epithet of a laſs, while I ſhould eſteem her the queen of the world, and would fain make her the idol of my heart; do you think, Murville, that in order to gain her, I ſhould have recourſe to your deluſive inſtructions, at the riſk of your fatal experience? Ah, Murville! what inſtructions can I receive from you that are worth the pains of learning them? After contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating your leſſons ſo repeatedly, I am ſtill inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable or pleaſing any ladies but ſuch as would deſpiſe them.</p>
                     <p>No, if I ſhould ere long feel the power of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment ſufficient to bind me for life, you are not the perſon I would chooſe for a confident. Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor alone ſeems worthy of ſuch a confidence, and to her alone do I owe it. Nevertheleſs, before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting her confidence with confeſſions ſimilar to thoſe with which ſhe honors me, I ſhould wiſh to be certain that I could, like her, preſerve a paſſion pure and unalterable, through the trials of abſence
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035743_0156_1006AFA05E6641D0"/>
and time, though diſcouraged by unſuitable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and counteracted by unfavourable events; I ſhould wiſh to be certain, not that the object of my affections merited them (for we cannot, I think, truly love a perſon whom we do not eſteem); but to be certain of being capable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of always admiring even that perſon whom I could never obtain. What a reproach it would be if I ſhould fail in receiving leſſons of delicacy and fidelity from any perſon with whom I am conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant! Above all, what a reproach it would be, if afterwards I ſhould conceive a paſſion which might be diſcouraged by common difficulties! How could I, in ſuch caſe, endure the reproaches of Eleanor, who ſo conſtantly preſerves her affections, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her regret and privation? How could I bear to hear her accuſe me of having, even in her preſence, diſgraced the name of faithful love?</p>
                     <p>But let us proceed to the only article in your letter, in which I feel intereſted. This, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, is the only one in which we are agreed. I could not aſſent to it but with reluctance. It ſeems that my hopes reſpecting the lover of my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were too viſionary. The melancholy details you have given me, ſeem to prove, with great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that Bovile is no more.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, my brother, I have to deſire your pardon for the freedom which has dictated my anſwer. I am ſenſible that a difference of opinions, when it reſpects real ſentiments, may, in time, break friendſhip. But my friendſhip for you ſhall never be deſtroyed; becauſe I perſiſt in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with Madame Florival, that there remains ſo much natural goodneſs in your heart, that at ſome future time you may be inclined to acknowledge your errors. This we both hope and believe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

the contagious principles of the world which have given ſuch a wrong bias to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Adieu, my dear brother—I ſhall wait with impatience for the return of the courier.</p>

                     <opener>
                        <dateline>St. Cyr,
<date>July 24, 1782.</date>

                     <p>YES, my dear Celina, my uncle is in truth an excellent man; and I have become more reconciled to my new ſituation. There has been ſomething in him which greatly diſguſted me: It was that almoſt childiſh gaiety which every trifle excited in him. His petulant cheerfulneſs and my ſilent ſadneſs, formed an unlucky contraſt. Often have I perceived that my ſorrow was increaſed with his joy. Whether M. Sevin has perceived the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſituation of his niece, I cannot affirm; but certain I am, that he has changed the tone of his voice and his behaviour. I would not ſay that he was either fretful, or, in any wiſe, ill natured. But his good humour was only moderated; at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it is leſs boiſterous, more reſerved, more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and attractive; in fine, almoſt as engaging as that of M. Dolerval. Perhaps it proceeds from this cauſe: that M. Sevin takes, by degrees, a tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the happy diſpoſition of his friend, without being inſenſible of it himſelf. There is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark which I have made concerning my uncle, which ſeems no leſs flattering than the former. You doubtleſs remember M. Sevin's favourite
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035743_0158_1006AFA6A9D820B0"/>
phraſe—that expreſſion, which, on the day I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his houſe, ſo much ſurpriſed me, and with reſpect to the equivocal ſenſe of which I was well ſatisfied, when he, with unparalleled candour, in a reſpectful manner, made known the pains of his condition. Proteſting, at the ſame time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the expreſſions of his uneaſineſs had nothing in them which reſpected me in particular, ſince (to uſe his own expreſſion) he ſaluted every viſitant with the ſame words. He ſeemed to repeat them to no purpoſe, without intermiſſion or diſcretion; and, notwithſtanding what he ſaid to diminiſh my fears, thoſe tireſome exclamations gave me a ſecret diſpleaſure. You will, therefore, learn with ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that my uncle corrects himſelf of this fault. At preſent, his complaints do not eſcape him but when his heart is too full to contain them. Still does he endeavour to ſpare me the pain of hearing it. Nevertheleſs, I can diſcover by his melancholy aſpect, deeply penſive, when the ſentiment of his evils, becoming more lively, is ready to force his complaints from him. Then, as he is ſenſible of its approach, he riſes abruptly and leaves me, leſt I ſhould hear him; for fear of afflicting me, he goes away to groan this phraſe: "They ought to marry the prieſts." I ſay groan, bacauſe no other expreſſion ſo well ſuits the moving inflexion of his voice when he articulates theſe words. Then, and then only, do I perceive in his voice that tone of tenderneſs and ſorrow, the accents of a paſſionate heart, ſo well imitated by M. Dolerval, when he ſings a plaintive ſong.</p>
                     <p>Now I think of it, the two friends, yeſterday, ſpent ſome time at muſic. I do not ſpeak of the Curate, and his favourite inſtrument, but of M. Dolerval, who played ſeveral ſonata in a very
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035743_0159_1006AFAEBB441A98"/>
agreeable manner. My uncle afterwards attempted to ſing; but his ſongs afforded me no amuſement. They conſiſted of ariettas and roundos, entirely gay, or diſguſtingly merry. If the words had not been, for the moſt part, vulgar and inſignificant, the airs would have pleaſed me tolerably well. You know how much I prefer romances. They have ſomething in them tender and plaintive, that at once affect and captivate the heart. It ſeems ſtrange that M. Dolerval always ſuits his airs ſo well to my fancy. He has ſung one moſt capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating! and how delightfully did he ſing it! what expreſſion in his features and voice! His voice is indeed moſt charming! It charmed my heart and melted it to tenderneſs, to ſuch a degree that I could never be weary of hearing it. He ended, however, ſooner than I could wiſh, by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing couplets, to the <note n="*" place="bottom">This air is ſaid to be loſt.</note>air which I herewith ſend you.</p>

                     <p>WHETHER the ſong of M. Dolerval will affect you as it does me, I cannot tell; But, for my part, it pleaſed me exceedingly. His ſong I call it, becauſe I believe him to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. You may be ready to aſk me why I attribute it to him? It is becauſe—becauſe there is ſomething in the words—Ah! it is becauſe he was embarraſſed when I told him I did not remember to have ever ſeen any part of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>My imprudence had well-nigh betrayed me. For ſeveral minutes I could ſcarcely reſiſt the deſire of ſinging in my turn, and ſitting down at the piano. This fantaſy, ſuppoſing it was one, had nothing in it which might be called blameable: for if it is good not to derive vanity from its advantages, we ſhould not any longer affect to diſdain it. You know that in the number of talents we poſſeſſed, and for which our father doated on us in ſpite of Madame de Varmont, muſic was one which was highly eſteemed, and one in which I had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſucceſs. M. Dolerval plays tolerably well, and ſings delightfully. However, I have the vanity to think my voice as good as his; and ſurely he is not my equal at the piano. This, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſelf-conceit, I can ſafely boaſt of to you, and this is what I ſaid to myſelf in a low voice. Greatly tempted to meddle with the concert, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated, with pleaſure, the ſurpriſe of M.— I would ſay the ſurpriſe of the two friends. Yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reflections inclined me to deſiſt. Is it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable, thought I, to diſcover my knowledge of muſic to the good Curate, and have the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of having intended to deceive him five days ago, when I thought beſt to hide my talents from him? Would there not, in all this, be ſomething very diſobliging to M. Sevin? Theſe conſiderations determined me, though reluctantly, to take the paſſive part, and prudently did ſo, until a ſtrange propenſity led me, without thinking of it, to trill the laſt lines of the new ſong.</p>
                     <p>But the ſurpriſe of the two friends ſoon warned me of my error, and it was a fortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that I only found ſounds almoſt inarticulate,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035743_0163_1006AFBF71B6D650"/>
ſo that I could ſtill deny my being a muſician. M. Dolerval urged me earneſtly to try to ſing thoſe words to the tune, and ſeemed as if he was determined not to diſpenſe with my refuſal; ſo that, at laſt, I was obliged to make the attempt. But I took care to ſing without method, and much like a ſcholar who is juſt beginning in the gamut. This, in the end, proved to be an unneceſſary caution; for, at the inſtant I began to ſing, my voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came trembling and diſguiſed. Yet the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they paid me on the occaſion were as great as if I had ſung diſtinctly, and without faltering. They aſſured me I ought not to neglect cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a commendable talent. M. Sevin renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his offers of inſtructing me; but M. Dolerval aſked the preference with that perſuaſive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging tone of voice which is ſo natural to him; ſo that I found myſelf in perplexity as to determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which of the two friends ſhould have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in teaching me what neither of them knew ſo well as myſelf. O fie! I ſhall—I ſhall ſtay too long—I—but it ſeems to me a long time ſince we took dinner. This is the moment when—when I cannot diſpenſe with being preſent. Farewell, my ſiſter.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE this day received your letter. I ſee, with ſenſibility, my ſiſter, that from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have given my uncle, you conceive a great eſteem for him. There are, as you have juſtly remarked, but few men in his condition of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter at once ſo good and amiable. In the mean time it ſeems a little ſtrange, that, when ſpeaking of his friend, you praiſe him no farther than ſaying, that I ſeem to have a peculiar friendſhip for him. Indeed I have, my ſiſter; becauſe he merits it! becauſe there is no other perſon ſo worthy of it as he! And were you in my place, Celina, tell me I pray you, could you forbear having a great attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035743_0165_1006AFCC0334A208"/>
for him? What! have I not done him juſtice in my letters? Have I neglected to deſcribe him to you ſuch as he is? If ſo, I have been guilty of an unpardonable omiſſion!</p>
                     <p>I have not, I ſuppoſe, told you any thing of his talents or his beauty, nor the many external quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which render him ſo ſhining. For none of theſe qualities can be very intereſting to you nor me. But for me to neglect preſenting you with the enchanting picture of his innocent manners, or his ſweet diſpoſition; to forbear from extolling, according to their merits, every quality of his heart, or every virtue of his noble mind, would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. This would be a piece of injuſtice of which I never expected to be guilty.</p>
                     <p>And is it not ſurpriſing that this young man, who would loſe nothing by the moſt rigid examination, has ſo much indulgence for the failings of others, that one would ſometimes term it weakneſs? So extraordinary is his mildneſs, that he will neither give any cauſe of offence to his greateſt enemy, nor hold reſentment againſt the injuries of a friend. And is it not an uncommon circumſtance, that the extreme ſenſibility of his heart adds to the unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſweetneſs of his temper? I will now give you a trait of his character entirely new.</p>
                     <p>My uncle, I muſt confeſs, is entirely another man; ſo that I was too haſty in felicitating myſelf on account of the change in his conduct. This revolution in his behaviour has not ſtopped at the degree which I could have deſired. A melancholy, at firſt very mild, took place of the gaiety which was quite extinct; but now a profound ſadneſs and gloomy vexation have ſucceeded. M. Doler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>val has never ſeen him in ſuch a deplorable ſtate as the preſent. And if the inconvenience of this
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035743_0166_1006AFCF209B55F8"/>
ſtrange alteration affected none but me, I could not but pity my unfortunate uncle, and do every thing in my power to comfort him. Why does he, in the ſevereſt turns of his melancholy diſorder, never become vexed with his niece, with whom, perhaps, he has a right to be offended? On the contrary, why does he lay the whole burden of his ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour upon his generous friend, who ſo tenderly compaſſionates his inward ſorrow, and who, alas! vainly endeavours, like me, to diſcover its cauſe?</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday, almoſt twelve o'clock at night, they had not opened the collection of ſongs which M. Dolerval intended to make uſe of in the evening. My uncle ſtrange to tell, ſeemed quite indifferent about this amuſement. M. Dolerval ſuppoſed he might, once only ſing my favourite ſong (I would ſay his), and ſung it: and although it is very ſhort, my uncle ſeemed to wait with impatience till it was ended. But this was not all! Obſerve now his aſtoniſhing caprice! When the young man bid us good night, M. Sevin, who, during the whole evening, ſcarcely obſerved any part of the muſic, queſtioned his friend with a tone of bitterneſs, and ſaid, "Will Madame Florival never honor us any more with her viſits? Has ſhe ſworn never to come again to my houſe to favour us with her muſic?"</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe my ſiſter," anſwered he, "ſhe is at preſent much occupied and embarraſſed."—M. Dolerval was going to continue, but he was briſkly interrupted. "She is not occupied with her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grins," ſaid M. Sevin.—"Muſt we not ſuppoſe," replied her brother with emotion, "by the tone with which you expreſs your ſentiments, that you are offended with her?"</p>
                     <p>"In fact," cried he, "I am at leaſt ſurpriſed with her conduct! I may well be ſurpriſed, when
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035743_0167_1006AFD440D77FF8"/>
I have ſeen a woman, not above ſix weeks ago, ready to die with grief for the loſs of her huſband, appear ſo ſoon to be perfectly comforted. What then ſhall we think of a woman's attachment, if it cannot for more than a month ſurvive its object? What would you have us think of ſorrows which ſhe does not care to preſerve any longer? When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I think of this, I have leſs reaſon to lament that they do not marry the prieſts."</p>
                     <p>On hearing ſuch uncivil expreſſions, you would expect to ſee M. Dolerval overcome with vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But inſtead of being offended, in an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner he ſaid: "O my friend! what do I hear? what injury have I done you?" And, at the ſame time, offered M. Sevin his hand. But, ſtrange to relate, M. Sevin, inſtead of flying into his arms for reconciliation, only ſtepped backwards. For my part, I could not patiently endure it! But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can alter the mild diſpoſition of this young man. He then retired deeply afflicted. Yet I muſt ſay, whilſt I think of it again, that I am certain there was not in his conduct the leaſt ſign of anger.</p>
                     <p>"Good night Juliette," ſaid the Curate after the young man went away.—"My uncle, he's gone away very ſorrowful."</p>
                     <p>"Well, the words are gone from me, and what would you have me do?"</p>
                     <p>"But he will never return," replied I.</p>
                     <p>"Never return!" repeated he with uneaſineſs. And then, in a mild voice, he continued: "You are too eaſily alarmed. Be comforted, Juliette, be comforted: he will return. I do not often treat him ſo ill. But have you not, my niece, given him a kind and diſtinguiſhed reception? Why did you cauſe him to endure the pains of my erroneous conduct? Yet I know him too well to ſuppoſe he
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035743_0168_1006902F69881098"/>
will long hold his reſentment on account of my ſudden paſſion. Take courage, he will come again, I promiſe you. 'Tis I, my dear girl, who promiſe you this. Good night—I know, my girl, that I am ſad, peeviſh and inſupportable! Be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling—O be willing to make me otherwiſe! Pity me, and let Dolerval alſo both pity and pardon me! Do you underſtand me, Juliette? Let him pardon me, I pray you!"</p>
                     <p>Then he left me in tears, much affected with his ſudden and unexpected repentance. Now, let him ſay what he will, I ſhall be in perpetual anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety. I am afraid M. Dolerval will never come again. There was not, in all that was ſaid on that occaſion, any thing which hurt him ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly as the abuſive expreſſions ſpoken againſt his ſiſter. But now all is well; he has returned, and much ſooner than uſual: And from the greateſt diſtance he could ſee my uncle, he ran to him. My uncle tried to ſpeak and make ſome apologies; but he tenderly embraced him, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to do it.</p>
                     <p>What think you! What can you think of all this, Celina? I wiſh you would anſwer me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay.</p>

                     <p>EMILIA, you did not at all underſtand the meaning of my laſt letter; but I well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the import of yours. In your expreſſions I perceive ſymptoms of that ſtrange paſſion which obſcures the better judgment; whilſt friendſhip, that coolly reflects, and conſiders at a diſtance, is capable of enlightening the moſt timid inexperience. Who could have thought that it would ever have appertained to Celina, abandoned to the ignorance of the cloiſter, to remove the thick veil from the eyes of Emilia, which ſhe, while ſurrounded with the light and experience of the world, had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cover them?</p>
                     <p>Poor deluded ſiſter! thou art going blindly along in a way overſpread with innumerable ſnares, and each ſucceeding ſtep expoſes thee more than the former! Forbear, forbear, I conjure you! Give yourſelf a moment's recollection. Examine your heart with impartiality. Strive, without prejudice, to anſwer the queſtions I ſhall propoſe for your conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Whatever events may take place, you will never, never forget your generous huſband. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his generoſity can never be effaced from your memory. You had conceived for your huſband much eſteem, a lively gratitude, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful friendſhip; but, at preſent, what do you think, or what do you ſay concerning Bovile?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="unknown:035743_0170_1006AFE119BC9B98"/>At preſent, for it will be more eaſy for you to judge by compariſon—what do you at preſent think, or what do you ſay of young Dolerval? Whence proceed thoſe enthuſiaſtic eulogies you laviſh upon him? What name ſhall we give to that ſpecies of enthuſiaſm with which he inſpires you? In ſhort, what elſe could you think, or what could you ſay more, if he had inſpired you with what is called love? With love, my ſiſter! the very word ſhould make you tremble. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, you muſt not be too much diſcouraged at your ſituation. Methinks it is ſtill in your power to return to your duty.</p>
                     <p>O Emilia! the deareſt of ſiſters! methinks I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the precipice before thee, and would fain turn thee from it! When, for the purpoſe of eſcaping it, I have recourſe to thy wiſdom and prudence, to that love of virtue which will inſpire thee, I doubt not but thou wilt form the beſt reſolutions. Provided the danger is not hidden, I ſhall feel eaſy. Feel eaſy! O, no! do not think ſo—I cannot feel ſo whilſt I behold ſo many new ſorrows added to thoſe which already oppreſs my ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall I ſay of this fatal paſſion of love? Was it deſigned to make wretched the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race? Why ſhould it delight in tormenting thoſe hearts which ſhould never feel its fatal power with a reſtleſs and anxious deſire? As for you, my dear Emilia, you have probably known its effects too ſoon for your happineſs; but it is, perhaps, for my eternal languor, that I have ſworn never to know them. How ſtrange is our deſtiny!</p>

                     <p>MERCIFUL God! what a ſudden ray of light thou haſt thrown into the dark delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive road in which I walked with full confidence! Have not the cruel paſſions of others rendered my lot ſufficiently deplorable? Muſt I be doomed to ſtruggle with a criminal paſſion that has taken poſſeſſion of my heart? Was it not enough for me to become an object of pity? And to complete my wretchedneſs, muſt I become an object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? Oh, Bovile! moſt generous of huſbands! my gratitude for thy benevolent deeds has ſo ſoon periſhed in my memory! The ſentiment which thy virtues merited, and which was due from me, they did not obtain; but ſoon, ah, how ſoon was it given to a ſtranger!

addreſſed you with one word of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How great then muſt be the power of that attachment, which, even in its commencement, has made me neglect my duty, offend my benefactors, and transfer to a ſingle object, and an object till then a ſtranger, my entire affection!

                     <p>YOU will doubtleſs obſerve, Celina, by the date of this letter, that I retired to my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this evening ſooner than uſual. The reaſon is, becauſe M. Dolerval has already gone, and my uncle ſent me hither. I take advantage of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to tell you ſome happy news. It ſeems to me that this morning I partook too much of your apprehenſions. I am well convinced that I am far from loving the young man as much as we feared. The more I reflect upon it, the better I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that, as yet, I have only yielded, in ſome meaſure, to the impreſſion he ſtrove to make upon my heart. I have rewarded his civility, his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſolicitude, with a grateful return, and this is all. But even in ſuch a proceeding, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible there might be ſome danger, and promiſe to be more cautious in future.</p>
                     <p>Lend an ear, my ſiſter; you will, I hope, be
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035743_0173_1006AFF84569B630"/>
ſatisfied with the motives which have enabled me to change my opinion, and give me more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in myſelf. For two days paſt, theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have had very lengthy, myſterious, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated conferences together. They ſpeak in a low voice, move at a diſtance, and avoid me. This piece of unpoliteneſs at firſt ſeemed quite intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but ſoon afterwards I was ſtill more ſurpriſed by their endleſs whiſpering. I perceived that they feared more and more to admit me into the ſecret of their conferences. They alſo afflicted me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly with a diſtruſt that ſeemed quite uncivil. However, they at length returned, but were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a joy which they could not well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. Theſe marks of indifference for my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances have not eſcaped my notice. They have done ſinging my favourite ſong, and now ſing the following one, with which you are well acquainted:
<q>
                           <l>"Il faut attendre avec patience,</l>
                           <l>"Le jour de demain eſt an biau jour:</l>
                           <l>"Grande eſt, dit-on, la différence</l>
                           <l>"Entre le mariage &amp; l'amour," &amp;c.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe proceedings were really impertinent; to ſubſtitute ſuch a vulgar and, inſignificant piece for my favourite one, which is ſo excellent, was not to be borne with. I cannot but be ſenſibly affronted at them; inſomuch that if M. Dolerval ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſing it now, I would oppoſe it with ſpirit. By this you can ſee, that none of his unpolite proceedings eſcape my notice; that I remark all his faults, and pardon none of his failings. But do you ſuppoſe any perſon could be ſo greatly affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one they love, and even for ſuch trifles? Certainly not, and to convince you of it, I can
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035743_0174_1006AFFDA4364380"/>
ſincerely declare that I am not in the leaſt offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my uncle.</p>
                     <p>From this, my ſiſter, is it not clear, that your anxiety miſled us? I cannot, nor do I wiſh to deny that I have ſome friendſhip for him; but as for lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I am certain that I do not. We were, indeed, like a couple of children. Can it ſeem even probable, that I was ſo ſuddenly infatuated? I hear a noiſe—in the parſonage! What, is my uncle not aſleep? But, methinks, I hear—his voice. Why ſhould he return at the hour which he—? Yes, 'tis his voice—Wait awhile, my ſiſter, till I go and liſten.</p>
                     <p>Yes, Celina, it is M. Dolerval. He ſaid, "well, very well, I always go to the church."</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall not have to wait for me there," anſwered my uncle. But what is the meaning of all this? What are they going to do at church? I cannot tell, my ſiſter, but I have a foreſight of it that alarms me. What can I make of this ſtrange combination of circumſtances; thoſe myſterious converſations, and the apparent ſatisfaction of M. Dolerval? And can I be at a loſs when I recollect the ſong of this evening? How can it be poſſible! Wait, my ſiſter, I will endeavour to go down without any noiſe—to liſten. I wiſh to know— Heavens! how I tremble! I will return to my dear Celina in a moment.</p>
                     <p>O, what have I ſeen? What have I heard? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious man! O, wretched me! Ah, Celina, my hand trembles ſo that I cannot write—at preſent. To-morrow I will tell you all.</p>

                     <p>NO—I cannot. I am as feeble and dejected as I was yeſterday—out of a condition to undertake that cruel relation. During the whole night I never cloſed my eyes. Indeed, I do not love him; you may be aſſured that I do not. Cruel man! how he has deceived me! O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful —. Pardon me, generous Bovile. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is too true that I might have loved him— but it is a ſettled point that I never ſhall.—Be calm, my ſiſter, for I determine, from henceforth, that I will only hate him.

                     <p>BE comforted, my brother, I am not offended with you. The idle apoſtrophes with which you diſhonor my juſt ſentiments do no offend, though their greatly diſtreſs me. However ſhort the time of my concern for you may be, I muſt pronounce you incurable. And how diſtreſſing it would be, if, at laſt, I ſhould be obliged to ſign

an advertiſement of friends, to confine you in the Petites Maiſons!<note n="*" place="bottom">This is the name given to the Bedlam in Paris.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>How? Dolerval is more anxious of knowing whether he is worthy of his miſtreſs than any thing elſe! He wiſhes to feel an eternal flame in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual privation! O what a misfortune! Where the deuce did you get all this? It muſt be that you know Amadis and Aſtree by heart, and took it from that. That is the miſchief of it! They ought never to put romances into the hands of ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as you; for, ſooner or later, the reading of them will turn your brain. Thus it once fared with me. Being but a ſmall boy, a devout pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor had made me, for ſome time, at morning and evening, meditate upon the life of the ſaints, and it had ſuch an effect upon me, that I ran out into the fields with an intention of becoming a hermit.</p>
                     <p>To continue; the humble perſon is of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior claſs. Have I not gueſſed right? Let it be ſo. Do not fear I ſhall reprimand you; I know it has always been the cuſtom. At Paris you will find the dowager coquettes, who lie in wait to procure the conſolation of a young man freſh from the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. And as ſoon as the novice appears, they fall upon him, and willing or unwilling, introduce him into the world. As for our provincial beauties of forty or fifty, they do not all of them have that happy inſtinct. They generally beſtow on their chamber-maids the profits and privileges of ſuch educations. You ought, therefore, in your firſt attempt, like adoleſcent Tourangeau, to try none but a ſubaltern. And you did very wrong, indeed, to accuſe us, <hi>men of the world,</hi> of diſdaining the little creatures. We never diſdain them, provided
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035743_0177_1006AFFF9FB09838"/>
they are ſweet and handſome. Come then, don't be offended, I am willing to believe yours to be tolerably genteel. But where could you pick up this Phoenix of poor girls? Amongſt the attendants of your ſiſter? No, it cannot be; your female inſtructor is very cautious about having any around her but ſuch as are ugly and old. It may be then a chamber-maid of the ſub-delegate's wife, or one belonging to the lady of our grand counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of election; or rather, the one belonging to the large wife of the preſident of the ſalt granary: for the city of Tours ſwarms with women of every rank. You ſeemed to think your behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the women was becoming. I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to you in that point. You ſeem to be quite deſtitute of humanity; what will become of them when you ſlander them at ſuch a rate? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body will any longer take notice of them; and yet they may ſometimes be as real objects of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the young and handſome.</p>
                     <p>It would ſuit me better, if this dear creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to my ſiſter. You might then admire her with more convenience, and it would be eaſy for you to watch her more narrowly. For you muſt watch her, Dolerval, whatever you may think of it! Do every thing in your power to prevent the entrance of any ſparkiſh fellow. Shut the door againſt thoſe blades like the Engliſh Jockies, ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with youth and beauty. Since they reſemble Cupid as well as yourſelf, you have reaſon to be mightily afraid they will agree with you in making no account of birth and education: nor would I adviſe you to be leſs jealous of thoſe large gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, well built and alert, who, with one leap, can ſcale the higheſt walls: ſuch would be able to rival you in natural advantages. Keep an equal

diſtruſt of thoſe large gentlemen of the hotel, with plump round faces, continually fattened with chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens which they do not give gratis to their maſters. However little ſervice your miſtreſs might have, Dolerval, a fellow man-ſervant, ſo highly fed as the one I have here given you a ſketch of, would, with her, have great means of ſeduction. What enemies! what great and powerful enemies! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I behold them in your abſence ſurround this queen of the world, as ſhe comes from turning her lady's buckle. They flatter this idol of your heart, and make her ſome pretty propoſals of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber. They idolize her, flatter and purſue her, with their worſhip, from the office even to the houſe-top. Take care of yourſelf, my brother, for in the rank you have ſo philoſophically choſen the object of your tenderneſs, we cannot tell what rival you have moſt reaſon to fear: whether a Valmont of the kitchen, or a Lovelace of the ſtable.</p>
                     <p>Above all things, do not go and verbally ſtun the ears of your miſtreſs with ſuch a fine ſermon as the one you ſent me in manuſcript. Did you ſhow that compoſition of nonſenſe, love and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, to our ſiſter? How muſt ſhe, who is ſo proud of her innocence and your nullity, be charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it! But, patience! I cannot but hope you are going to eſcape her. Only be ready to get out of your leading ſtrings, and you ſhall have a new preceptor, who ſhall give you leſſons ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. You ſhall ſee what length of time your queen will be contented with your reſpectful exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; whether ſhe will always be pleaſed with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an idol; whether ſhe will always accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date herſelf with a lover who is willing to adore her, but has no deſire of obtaining her. O truly! you pity me, do you? I ſhall keep your letter
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035743_0179_1006B006A2053E68"/>
with care. I ſhall preſerve it as a monument of human miſery. Alas! Dolerval, what poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are!</p>
                     <p>Yet M. Dolerval terminates his letter by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me pardon, and on condition that I will be of his opinion! Ah, it is too plainly to be ſeen that you are captivated with ſome woman! Adieu, my brother.</p>

                     <p>YOU will remember that I recogniſed the voice which I never heard without alarm. At the ſame inſtant, urged by an anxious deſire of ſatisfying thoſe ſad ſuſpicions which I feared to ſee confirmed, I left the letter which I had begun for you, and went ſoftly out of my chamber, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light. I ſoon came to that part of the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe from whence they proceed to go into the church, and ſtood upon the landing place. It was not the door of communication where I ſtood, for M. Sevin, in his precipitation, had neglected to ſhut it. But he was then ſcarcely in the church, and I believe he was upon the laſt ſtep at the church door; I, therefore, ſtayed where I was, attentive and trembling. An ungrateful man endeavoured to let his voice be heard: "Come," ſaid M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval, "unite two lovers." And how could I, at that time, avoid having my curioſity moſt feelingly excited? The door which hid every object from
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035743_0180_1006B008342D0A58"/>
me, yielded to the firſt motion I made to open it; and, through a narrow ſpace which permitted me to perceive, and apparently without being perceived, I caſt my eager looks into the encloſure of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There my eyes too plainly beheld the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious young man who ſo earneſtly urged my uncle to the chapel, which was ornamented for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, where they waited for nothing but the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. The flambeaus of Hymen were lighted, and I ſaw a woman at the foot of the altar. Cruel woman! In the mean time I could not refrain from giving her a minute attention. And, ſhall I tell you, my ſiſter; ſhall I tell you this new dream of a diſordered imagination? Yes, Celina, you ſhall know all my weakneſs! Learn, then, another won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effect of that ſentiment which holds domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me—of that allurement which, blinding me with perpetual illuſions, fixes in my mind, wherever I am, the image of a man, whom it is deſirable for my repoſe I might never have ſeen. This woman, in her happy impatience, turned her eyes towards her lover, who continued to haſten the miniſter, who ſeemed too ſlow for his wiſhes. Then it was, that a violent deſire aroſe in my mind of learning the numerous advantages of her who was preferred to me. And I was led to believe, notwithſtanding the conſiderable diſtance between us, that it was poſſible to diſtinguiſh the features of this ſtranger, which muſt be ſo captivating. And could you have believed it, Celina? Yes, I did in fact diſtinguiſh them! Lo! to my extreme confuſion, I diſcovered, in the features of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thoſe of her lover! Yes, the more I fixed my afflicted eyes upon her, the more I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that in her I beheld the lively reſemblance
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035743_0181_1006B01237906168"/>
of the unkind man, whom her beauty had ſtolen from me. I cannot tell why this ſeeming reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance augmented my diſtreſs. But true it was, that my ſorrow increaſed with the idea of thoſe charms poſſeſſed by my fortunate rival; true it was, that I ſhould have felt leſs afflicted if I could have ſuppoſed her to be leſs beautiful.</p>
                     <p>At this time I ſtood ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, and attacked with gloomy reflections: M. Doler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſpoke again, and ſeemingly to give me a fatal ſtroke, ſaid, "Why do you delay? Come, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete her happineſs and mine." "I only aſk for a moment," anſwered my uncle: "you are ready to find fault with me; but when we are ſo haſty, ſomething may be forgotten."</p>
                     <p>Saying this, he turned about to come back; ſo that I was obliged to fly to my apartment for fear of being diſcovered. But the more I hurried on the ſtairs in my embarraſſing ſituation, the more I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the difficulties of my ſpeedy retreat. I was really on the ſecond ſtory, out of M. Sevin's view, when he came to the landing place I had juſt left. But I ſtood perfectly ſtill at the door of my chamber, not daring to go in, leſt, by making the leaſt noiſe, I ſhould be betrayed.</p>
                     <p>"Vain precaution!" ſaid my uncle; "no, no; I was not deceived," (ſpeaking in a manner as if he did not wiſh to be heard in the church), "ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body was there to diſturb and eſpy us. Juliette, Juliette! What is the matter with you, that you are awake at this time of night? Go to ſleep, my girl; go to ſleep; and be careful never to mention what you have ſeen to-night. This marriage muſt remain a ſecret."</p>
                     <p>After ſaying this, he returned to the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:035743_0182_1006B01B63334E88"/>
pulled the door after him, which, at this time, he endeavoured to have faſt ſhut, and left me in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable confuſion.</p>
                     <p>It is my duty, however, to confeſs that the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I feel on account of being diſcovered, is the leaſt of all my afflictions. Given up to the moſt painful reflections, I examine, with more faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the deep wounds of my heart. There do I find that cruelly deluſive paſſion in its full extent, which at preſent I could ſcarcely deſire to diſown, and, alas! too late deplore its fatal influence.</p>
                     <p>Although I cannot deny, Celina, that this cruel paſſion poſſeſſed my heart, you may be aſſured that its exiſtence is at an end. Nor would I have you fear that it will ever revive. What! could I ſtill love a perfidious man who transfers his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to another object? A ſeducer, who came to deceive me by the external appearance of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, which ſeemed to be as animated as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful? A traitor, who, in the gloom of night, goes to the foot of the altar, and takes upon him the irrevocable engagement of loving none but my rival? My rival! Ah, no! ſhe is already the wife of M. Dolerval! Can the huſband of another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be any thing to me?—the huſband of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—O my ſiſter!—Can it be poſſible?</p>
                     <p>It ought, in ſome meaſure, to calm my ſorrows, to conſider how much my uncle ſeems intereſted in conſoling me. Excellent man! this morning he took every poſſible meaſure to prevent me from recollecting the error of laſt night. But at dinner, in ſpite or every ſtruggle to diſguiſe my heavineſs of mind, it appeared again to ſuch a degree, that he could not but remark it.</p>
                     <p>"What is the matter with you, Juliette?" ſaid he, "you diſtreſs me. As for my own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035743_0183_1006B0215778B678"/>
I ſhall always endeavour to bear them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out complaining; but as for yours. I know they will be more than I can endure. Can the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate you are in be attributed to me? If ſo, I have undeſignedly become very guilty. Whatever I can do to promote your welfare ſhall be done, and certainly you are not ſenſible how much it has coſt me."—</p>
                     <p>Here I interrupted M. Sevin, for this was more than I could bear: "Diſpenſe, I pray you, with the trouble of making me remember your kindneſs, for I am ſenſible of it in its full extent: I know that many others who might have ſpent much more of their money for me, would not have brought me under ſo great an obligation as you have."</p>
                     <p>"Why do you ſpeak of money?" cried he. "Has that any reference to my meaning?" Seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſenſible he ought to proceed no farther, he moderated his voice, and ſaid, "Well, if it contributes to your peace of mind, believe ſo. And ſince, in an unguarded moment, I was wanting in politeneſs, be kind enough to pardon me."</p>
                     <p>A little afterwards, whilſt thinking on the events of laſt evening, I could not but weep. M. Sevin obſerving me, could not refrain from doing ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. "In the name of friendſhip, my dear girl, what is it that ſo troubles you?"</p>
                     <p>"Did you not," anſwered I, "unite to lovers laſt evening?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my niece, and I aſſure you it was not a pleaſant office."</p>
                     <p>"O, it is all over then, he is married indeed!"</p>
                     <p>"What then; what if he was married?"</p>
                     <p>"If he was," cried I in deſpair, (covering my face with my hands) "it would be better for me never to ſee him again!" My uncle kept ſilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

but I urged him to explain himſelf with as much earneſtneſs as if I needed to be better certified of my misfortune. The good Curate did not ſoon yield to my intreaties. As he walked about the room, I obſerved him to be in great agitation of mind. My good friend, for he well deſerves that title, my generous friend and benefactor ſeemed to ſtruggle in his mind with great irreſolution. He doubtleſs feared the conſequence of confirming me in the belief of what I ſo ſtrongly ſuſpected. At length, for a complete anſwer to my inquiries, he ſaid, with a deep ſigh, and an inflexion of voice, which was completely convincing, "Poor girl! poor girl!"</p>
                     <p>Then I conſidered that the time drew near when M. Dolerval was accuſtomed to viſit us. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his audacious perfidy, I expected he would preſume to viſit us again. The pity which M. Sevin apparently felt for me, greatly renewed my courage.</p>
                     <p>"My uncle," ſaid I, "permit me to retire to my chamber, and ſtay there during the whole evening."</p>
                     <p>"What, my niece, muſt I be ſo long deprived—?"</p>
                     <p>"Do not, I pray you, deny me that favour."</p>
                     <p>"That favour!" repeated he. "Why, I have told you before, and now tell you again, that your deſires, whatever they may coſt me, ſhall always be laws. Go then, my girl, and do not forget, that in my houſe you are abſolute miſtreſs of your time and actions."</p>
                     <p>After having thanked him, and being ready to retire, he bid me adieu, in a tone of tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion which greatly affected me. I cannot but think, Celina, that my uncle alſo is tormented with ſome ſecret affliction; for I cannot believe that any
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035743_0185_1006B025F03965E0"/>
except the unfortunate, can ſo well ſympathize with ſuch as themſelves. However, as I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of being alone, I ran to my apartment, and ſhut myſelf in. Here I am weeping and writing to my ſiſter.</p>

                     <p>WITH what gaiety, my brother, do you vindicate your errors! and you can do it with impunity. For thoſe pleaſantries of yours, which have a reference to me alone, you may be aſſured, will leave on my mind no laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of reſentment. But as to the indecent ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms with which you reproach a young woman ſo virtuous and engaging, I conſider them as a ſpecies of impiety. Nevertheleſs, I feel, in ſome meaſure, diſpoſed to pardon you; becauſe I am certain that if you were better acquainted with the adorable niece of M.

What a train of rare accompliſhments! But I muſt leave you, to go and inquire whether ſhe is well. Yeſterday I had not the pleaſure of ſeeing her. She was indiſpoſed. Her uncle told me it was but a ſlight indiſpoſition. But the anxiety I felt laſt night, deprived me of ſleep. I ſhall feel reſtleſs till

                     <p>O my brother, what a ſevere reverſe of fortune! What have I done? By what crime towards her have I rendered myſelf ſo guilty? I went to M. Sevin's, and at a time when ſhe did not expect me. Yet ſhe did not diſcover that agreeable ſurpriſe which ſhe has ſo often and ſo frankly manifeſted, when in my evening viſits, I have frequently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there before the accuſtomed hour. Anxious of knowing how ſhe did, I accoſted her, and with earneſtneſs inquired whether ſhe had recovered?</p>
                     <p>"Recovered of what, Monſieur?" ſaid ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me.</p>

I ſtopped a moment and informed him, that if my friendſhip had not become leſs deſirable to him than formerly, and as the entrance of his houſe was forbidden me in future, I deſired him to come and cultivate it at my own.</p>

                     <p>I THANK you, my deareſt Celina, for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of your letter; but I do not at preſent ſtand in need of them. I am much better—Learn then—M. Dolerval—I was deceived!—Attend, my ſiſter. Yeſterday I did myſelf ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as to tell him I wiſhed never to ſee him again; but ſo great an effort exhauſted all my ſtrength and reſolution: ſo that I ſpent the reſt of the day, and all the ſucceeding night, in tears. In the evening my uncle ſeemed to be much afflicted to ſee me ſo ſorrowful, and much more ſo the morning after. "Poor creature!" ſaid he, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly, and at length fell into one of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reveries. He walked about in a haſty man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with irreſolution in his countenance, and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035743_0188_1006B038A64516B0"/>
ſeemed to be much diſſatisfied with himſelf. And I thought I heard him, though indiſtinctly, ſay as follows: "My error has laſted too long already. This was a great cruelty! and to continue in it, would be a ſtill greater perfidy!"</p>
                     <p>Then he inſtantly turned round, came to me precipitately, and with much force of expreſſion he ſaid, "Your ſorrow is too cruel, it wounds me to the ſoul. Comfort yourſelf, my girl; wipe off your tears: he is not married."</p>
                     <p>Who? He? My uncle—Himſelf—Do you ſay that he is not?—repeat it, I pray you, repeat it. "I ſay he is not married, Juliette. You did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my anſwer, yeſterday. My anſwer, it is true, was equivocal, and I was to blame. My error was great indeed; but what can you expect from me, my niece? I am but a man, and as liable as any other to be ſubjected to the reign—Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, and I beſeech you take pity—"</p>
                     <p>Here my uncle inturrupted himſelf, and ſeemingly becauſe he ſaw me turn pale, and ready to fall. At firſt I aroſe ſuddenly, and in my ſpeech and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſcovered ſome violence; but as I was ſoon ſenſible of great weakneſs, I was again forced to take my ſeat.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be, however, that M. Sevin ſuppoſed there was nothing alarming in my ſituation at that time, for inſtead of offering me any aſſiſtance, he left me precipitately; and, in fact, my weakneſs was not very grievous, and ſoon left me.</p>
                     <p>Here I waited awhile for my uncle, who did not return; and fearing he was offended, I went down into the garden to look for him. He was almoſt concealed in the moſt obſcure part of the garden. There I ſaw him ſtanding up, reclining his
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035743_0189_1006B041E2528B78"/>
head upon his hands againſt a tree. His poſture ſeemed to be that of a man deeply thoughtful; and he muſt have been extremely ſo; for without his either hearing or perceiving me, I came and ſtood very near him.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid he, "it was joy in the extreme."</p>
                     <p>"No, my uncle, it was the extreme of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
                     <p>On hearing my voice he ſtarted in great ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"Why do you not reſpect my ſolitude," ſaid he. "Why do you follow me here to ſurpriſe—?"</p>
                     <p>I could not wait until he had finiſhed, for I ſaw him in tears.</p>
                     <p>"But I ſhould be unhappy, my uncle, if my joy proves a cauſe of ſorrow to you!"</p>
                     <p>"No, no," anſwered he; (taking hold of my hand) "no, my girl: but, on the contrary, I ſhall be happy no longer than whilſt you are ſo. As for my tears—do not regard them. And how can you determine the cauſe? Perhaps the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing your grief at an end—and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of comforting my young friend, who muſt be greatly afflicted."—</p>
                     <p>"Greatly afflicted, do you believe?"</p>
                     <p>"Come," continued he, "I muſt completely atone for my errors."</p>
                     <p>"And for mine alſo, my uncle."</p>
                     <p>"I will go to find him."—</p>
                     <p>"Will you go in a ſhort time?"</p>
                     <p>"This morning."</p>
                     <p>"Preſently?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I will go immediately, and tell him, on my part and yours."</p>
                     <p>"Wherefore on my part? Can you not have goodneſs enough to inform him that your niece is,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035743_0190_1006B0474AD85630"/>
at times, ſomewhat ill tempered; but that you would not, on account of her caprice, ſacrifice a friendſhip?"—</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand you," interrupted he; "it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me to make reconciliation with Dolerval, not to Juliette. Do not, my girl, ever mention a word to him of what you ſaw on the night of day before yeſterday. I muſt not, and cannot unveil the myſtery of this clandeſtine marriage. Let it ſuffice you to know, that Dolerval was preſent at that time only as a witneſs. Believe me, when I now renew the aſſurances of its being true."</p>
                     <p>This converſation, the details of which I have almoſt minutely given you, has relieved my mind from a grievous oppreſſion. It is incumbent upon me, at preſent, to go down, for my uncle is going away. I will not bid you adieu, my ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>Noon.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen him again, Celina, ſooner than I could have deſired, and at a moment when I leaſt expected him. My uncle, it ſeemed to me, had been gone a long time, and I greatly wiſhed for his return. Several times in my impatience, did I go from the yard into the garden, and back again into the yard, accuſing M. Sevin of being extremely ſlow. After I had ſpent ſome time in this manner, not knowing any better method of ſhortening the time, I went into the houſe, and ſat down at the piano. There were ſeveral pieces of muſic lying on the deſk, and I endeavoured to play them: but as they were more lengthy than I wiſhed, I quitted them, and returned very naturally to my favourite ſong, which I ſung and accompanied my voice with the muſic. After I had finiſhed it, "What a voice! what talents!" cried ſomebody.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:035743_0191_1006B04D9FBA8F00"/>Looking around, I ſaw, to my aſtoniſhment, that he ſtood liſtening at the door of the apartment, where, believing myſelf alone, I had given my voice its full ſcope. M. Sevin had made uſe of his key<note n="*" place="bottom">Paſſe-par-tout, a key that unlocks many doors.</note> without my hearing him. He brought M. Dolerval with him, who ſtood liſtening at the ſame time, ſtruck with ſurpriſe, and, perhaps, I may ſay, with admiration. It ſeems ſtrange, that, at this juncture, and conſidering the ſtate of my mind, that I ſhould have conducted ſo imprudently. No longer knowing where I was, or what I did, I roſe up, went towards him, and obſerved that his countenance was changed. M. Sevin perceiving my over-ſight, attempted to atone for it; but being too haſty, he ſucceeded no better than myſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Changed," cried he, "we are all changed, and let us caſt off our reſentment; let us ſpeak of the brilliant wit of the diſcrete Juliette."</p>
                     <p>Here compliments were renewed. M. Sevin diſcovered much ſurpriſe, and reproached me, though in a gentle and courteous manner. But M. Dolerval was more ſurpriſed than he, and it ſeemed difficult for him to believe that the uncle was unacquainted with the talents of the niece. Both of them, however, urged me to begin again, and with as much earneſtneſs as if they feared what they had ſeen to be only a dream. In this attempt I did not ſucceed ſo well as the former: perhaps by reaſon of my efforts to exceed it: be it as it may, there was a trembling in my hands and voice. My uncle remarked it with ſome uneaſineſs, and I can excuſe him for it. But methinks M. Doler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ought to be better ſatisfied. However, they mutually congratulated each other on the acquiſition
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035743_0192_1006B053C55A2DA0"/>
of a new aſſiſtant in muſic, by which means the happy moment would ſoon arrive when we ſhould have frequent concerts. They even propoſed making a party after dinner. M. Dolerval pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to bring his maſter: and as to his ſiſter, he ſaid, in a few days he hoped it would be in her power to attend alſo: and then, without doubt, ſhe would come, and without delay, to admire the talents, and, perhaps, participate in the ſucceſs of a rival, well worthy of her attention.</p>
                     <p>I do not wiſh, my ſiſter, to diſſemble in any thing. The appearance of M. Dolerval, this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was not according to my wiſhes. In his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, he ſeemed to ſhow more indifference than reſerve; and, in his air, more coldneſs than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. He ſeemed leſs pleaſed on diſcovering ſuch a deſirable talent in me, than vexed with the idea of our having ſo long concealed it from him. And as he went away, I was convinced, by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions he made in his parting compliments, that he ſtill ſuppoſed my uncle combined with me in a deſign of deceiving him. What exceſſive injuſtice! I can hardly forgive him! We ſhall ſee this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether he will then preſume to entertain ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions which ſo much afflict me. Of this, I ſhall not fail to inform you, my ſiſter. But of what conſequence is it to you? And why ſhould I be ſo ſtupid as to indulge my thoughts, and employ my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this manner? Ah! my dear Celina, once more vouchſafe to pardon Emilia. Perhaps you will be better pleaſed with the firſt letter ſhe ſhall ſend you hereafter.</p>

                     <p>WHAT a ſtupid creature I am! In my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of day before yeſterday, I paſſed over in ſilence that article of your letter, which, more than any other, required explanation. I am of the ſame opinion as yourſelf. M. Sevin, I make no doubt, has conceived a fatal paſſion for your unfortunate ſiſter. It ſeems alſo beyond a doubt, that jealouſy, the moſt wretched of paſſions, has entered the heart of this man, which was equally inſpired with benevolence and ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday we had a concert for the ſecond time. And I muſt declare, that if it were poſſible for any thing to give me a diſtaſte for muſic, it would have been the manner in which we performed our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert. As ſoon as M. Dolerval appeared, my uncle ran to him, and, to do him juſtice, gave him a favourable reception. But why does he not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to treat the young man even with ordinary civility? Why does he ſcarcely give me time to addreſs M. Dolerval with ſome of thoſe queſtions of politeneſs which cuſtom authoriſes, even amongſt ordinary acquaintances? May we not, in fact, ſay, that every kind of converſation fatigues him when we have the company of a third perſon who can render it more agreeable? M. Sevin urges and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments us. We are forced, in order to pleaſe him, to enter into the tedious quatuors. If the pieces are of that ſort which he calls lively, and which I
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035743_0194_1006B0623A2F6E78"/>
ſhould call very tedious, the Curate performs his part not ſo ill. But it is far otherwiſe when we chance to light upon any of thoſe pieces which are really intereſting; full of ſoft, tender and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate expreſſions. Then I enter perfectly into the ſpirit and meaſure of the piece, play it with more warmth, taſte and preciſion! M. Dolerval, on his part, is animated and impaſſioned: for he is full of ſpirit and animation. But my uncle at once ſpoils the whole. And how can he follow the meaſure of the muſic, when his eyes are conſtantly fixed on his niece and his friend? In vain do we endeavour to continue; in vain does the attentive maſter call back the wanderer; M. Sevin will not underſtand any thing. The laſt evening, his mind was ſo greatly diſturbed, that he haſtily threw down his inſtrument at the riſk of breaking it, ran into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apartment, and ſhut the door after him. He returned, indeed, but it was then too late: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body could prevail with him to take up the piece again which had been ſo cruelly interrupted. At ſuch a time I could not but complain. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſmiles he affected, he ſeemed to be much confuſed and vexed at his miſconduct. In this place, I will remark one circumſtance which much afflicted me: both times, when he retired to his room, his eyes, on his return, were red and heavy. When he fled to his apartment, I make no doubt but he went there to weep alone.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems equally ſtrange, and I declare it with ſtill greater diſpleaſure, that M. Dolerval no longer ſeems to have that tender intereſt he formerly had in the feelings of his friend, and which the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſituation of M. Sevin ſeems always to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. M. Dolerval, except in thoſe rare and fleeting moments when muſic warms and enlivens
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035743_0195_1006B069E6A0C370"/>
him, and when (if I may be allowed the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) it carries him away from himſelf, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to continue the ſame indifferent and almoſt diſdainful behaviour towards me, which the other day ſo much offended me. Why ſhould the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of my uncle ſo ſoon weary the patience of his friend? And, though I might have done wrong in ſome inſtances, why ſhould he yet feel indiſpoſed to overlook any thing? Shall I tell you my opinion, Celina? Such a ſudden change in his conduct has given me a variety of thoughts. That M. Sevin has become jealous and in love, every thing combines to prove; nor do I wiſh to doubt it any longer: but his own unhappineſs, I believe, is not his only affliction. Is he not alſo afflicted as ſeverely with ſome great anxiety on account of Juliette? Was it occaſioned by a pity ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by me, on the day after that fatal night when I was ſo greatly oppreſſed with the weight of my ſorrows, that my too generous uncle conceived it his duty to tell me a falſehood, cruelly officious, the fault of which he at preſent conceives to be dangerous for me? What can I think? Is the ſo much altered Dolerval married, or is he not? You will ſee that my ſuſpicions are horrible. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from my ſight, Celina, if poſſible, all thoſe objects of my jealouſy which are every moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in my imagination. O, that temple! that altar! that woman who is ever in my memory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whom I ſhould know amidſt a thouſand others! Let me never ſee any more, the place which every day, and often ſeveral times in a day, I ſee, where the moſt deceitful of men haſtened the ſteps of the miniſter! Above all things, let me never hear again thoſe words of a ſenſe ſo clear and terrible: "Why do you delay? Come, complete her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035743_0196_1006B06BA7394E38"/>
and mine." Does a mere witneſs of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage go to the altar with ſo much eagerneſs? Would one who was only a witneſs, haſten the prieſt with ſuch urgent language? O what have I written! With what ſtrange thoughts does my pleaſing deluſion inveſt me! Unhappy Emilia! Does it appertain to me, to inquire whether he is bound to another by indiſſoluble ties, or whether I have made any impreſſion on his heart? Alas! I ought only to inquire what meaſures are moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſhunning the miſeries preparing for me by a dangerous paſſion, and in what manner I ought to reſiſt it.</p>
                     <p>But, O Celina! do you think it practicable for me to execute that project which I ſometimes thought of in deſpair, and which you could not propoſe but with trembling? Can I forthwith quit this retirement which protected me in my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; renounce this country life, for whoſe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures I have conceived a ſtrong attachment; abandon the worthy M. Sevin, who regarded not the increaſe of his indigence by ſupporting me; and, for the reward of his hoſpitality, leave him nothing but the remembrance of my ungrateful diſtruſt? Would it be adviſeable to fly a dear and dangerous enemy to my peace of mind, and run the riſk again of falling by the ſword of an aſſaſſin? Again commit my deſtiny to the chance of unhappy events; go from door to door, begging a ſhelter, and in the terror of a danger almoſt imaginary, ſince it is known, expoſe myſelf to a thouſand dangers, perhaps inevitable, becauſe it would be impoſſible to foreſee them? No; ah, no! I cannot have courage to liſten to the counſels of a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight that would leave me to myſelf ſo wretched.</p>

                     <p>COME, M. Dolerval, I am forced to give you a great deal of pain! Muſt I be put to the neceſſity of ſurpriſing you with thoſe confeſſions which it would be ſo deſirable to obtain from you? Having ſo nearly gained my point, I owe you enormous thanks. How I rejoice to think you are likely to ſupport the honor of the family! How then! You aſpire to nothing leſs than meddling in the firſt place, with the dainty morſels of the church! Sweetly bewitched with your own hands! And at the expence of a dear friend! Is not this a glorious beginning? Now I acknowledge you to be of my own blood—Lo! this is the race of Murvilles!</p>
                     <p>But you have been ſo long poſſeſſed of a taſte like a mere countryman, that I dare not flatter myſelf with being ſoon ſucceſsful in giving you more noble inclinations. And have I not, my dear Dolerval, for once only, unfortunately expected too much from you? Is not this M. Sevin the late Curate of St. Cyr? This young man, whom you value ſo highly, and who loves you ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely, that he is to you a ſort of Pylades.<note n="*" place="bottom">A man remarkable for his faithful friendſhip to Oreſtes. They were two Greeks of ancient times.</note> A good-hearted fellow beſides, who ſighs unceaſingly after the marriage of the prieſts. Ah, the cunning
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035743_0198_1006B0789D2190B8"/>
blade! I foretold him this, and very truly, that at ſome time or other, notwithſtanding his ſcruples, he would end in having a niece!</p>
                     <p>But I will venture as much as you dare, that you do not know the greatneſs of the enterpriſe you are going to undertake. I will bet any thing you don't know what it is to be the niece of a Curate. And ſince I think you do not, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to inform you, and that very minutely. I will not let ſlip this opportunity of ſhowing you a little erudition, for I am deſirous of gaining your eſteem.</p>
                     <p>In former times, my brother, a long while ago, at a time when neither you, nor I, nor Curate Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, were in the world, the primitive church did prieſts the honor of believing them to be men, and rendered them the juſtice of acknowledging them to be ſo; and, in conſequence of this opinion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any one of them who deſired it, to chooſe a companion, whom he might, with all ſafety, call his wife; and permitted him, inſtead of pocket money, to bequeath to her annually an innocent creature, whom they could not call radically ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. To their great misfortune, a council, and it was, if I miſtake not, the council of Trent,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>He is miſtaken indeed: his erudition is as ſuperficial as that of young men at the time he mentions. The fact is this: No divine precept forbids, nor can forbid, the marriage of the prieſts. No divine law counteracts the ſacred laws of nature. The Old Teſtament leaves to the miniſters of the altar, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all their faculties: and, in the new, Jeſus Chriſt ſays nothing which has a tendency to diminiſh the rights of man. St. Paul alſo, one of his moſt zealous apoſtles, in his epiſtles to Titus and Timothy, orders the biſhops to be chaſte and continent, not only in celibacy, but even in marriage. Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet epiſcopum eſſe unius uxoris verum, ſays he. A biſhop muſt be the huſband of one wife. Obſerve what he ſays: only one! In the three firſt centuries of the church, the biſhops, who doubtleſs underſtood St. Paul, married alſo. Of this, I am willing to give you ſeveral inſtances. According to St. Jerome, whom we ought to believe, becauſe a ſaint would not lie, Tertullian, when ready to give up the ghoſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his wife to continency. Some readers may ſuppoſe Tertullian to have been too much of an egotiſt: this is nothing to the purpoſe; all I wiſh you to remark is, that this great perſonage, jealous of his moiety even beyond the grave, had a moiety. You may alſo find he was not the only one. St. Cyprian ſeverely reproves a married prieſt by the name of Novatus. Stay a little; he does not ſcold him for having a wife, for loving her exceedingly, nor for having too much careſſed her; but quite the contrary, for having abuſed her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, and in very critical circumſtances. This Novatus, I am ſorry to ſay, was a brutal man. But I am glad to find a ſaint, at that day, eſpouſing the cauſe of a prieſt's wife, and that of his progeny.</p>
                           <p>Let us now proceed to the dreadful councils. Unfortunate prieſts! it was that of Neoſarea, held in 314, who firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, in ſome meaſure, to reſtrain your matrimonial facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They declared, in their tenth canon, that every deacon who ſhould not, at the time of his ordination, have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his intentions as to providing himſelf with a companion, ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at any time thereafter, renounce the functions of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip whenever he pretended to thoſe of marriage. Eleven years afterwards, the too famous council of Nice ordered ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy to every prieſt, without exception. In the following age came the infamous council of Orange, whoſe anti-natural wiſdom depoſed all men in orders who did not abſtain from women. At length the excellent and righteous Pope Gregory VII. completed the work, and withdrew the ſacred miniſters from ſociety and the human race.</p>
                           <p>Towards the middle of the 12th century, Pope Celeſtin was, notwithſtanding, obliged to ſend legates into Bohemia, to ſubject the eccleſiaſtics of that country to celibacy. Being ſtaunch friends to matrimony, theſe eccleſiaſtics proteſted they could not endure a yoke which neither themſelves nor their forefathers had ever been able to bear. They were, however, conſtrained to it; and I leave you to judge whether the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the laical huſbands has not been injured in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this conſtraint. I am for judging by compariſon, and, for inſtance, would refer you to the good natured huſbands of this country.</p>
                           <p>After thirteen hundred years of barbarity, the voice of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon again endeavoured to be heard. Charles V. deſired the council of Trent to reſtore the right of marrying to all the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtics; but Pope Paul III. refuſed to conſent to it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was this Paul III. I cannot affirm, who being urged to declare the reaſons of his averſion for the marriage of the prieſts, anſwered, the greateſt reaſons he had againſt it were, that the wives and children of the prieſts brought the riches of the church into danger. Excellent reaſon! But two years ago, it would have done tolerably well in this country. But at this day, when the church has no longer any temporal riches to preſerve, why ſhould they deny to its miniſters the happineſs of a lawful union? Humane and prudent legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! reſtore to the prieſts the privilege of marrying our daughters, if you deſire in earneſt that they may leave us the excluſive enjoyment of our wives.</p>
                        </note>
                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:035743_0199_1006B083AEABEBF8"/>
who, having in their own conceit, more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than any other, diſcovered that the prieſts were no part of the human race, and decided that they ſhould abſtain from mingling their ſacred blood with the impure blood of a chriſtian woman.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035743_0200_1006B085964DC338"/>
Thus determined the ſacred decree of the council; but nature, not being in every inſtance catholic, apoſtolical and Roman, has never inclined to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this epiſcopal canon. Since that time, in order to avenge herſelf for this inſult, ſhe has forced many a biſhop publicly to maintain a number of fine girls. And the poor curates, who dared not, like their ſuperiors, to incur public cenſure, inſtead of having a wife, have, ſince the time juſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had a niece. About the ſame time, I ſuppoſe, in order to provide more conveniently for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of illegitimate children which continually proceeded from the boſom of the church, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented friars, nuns and monaſteries.</p>
                     <p>But you, my poor fellow, are going to interfere with an elect! Don't you know, hapleſs man,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035743_0201_1006B08B0442CA30"/>
that the God of prieſts is a God of vengeance? Beware, beware that the good Curate does not excommunicate you, and in an inſtant order ſome officious demon to carry you away into the midſt of his companions!</p>
                     <p>Don't ſay I have not warned you, my brother. Nevertheleſs, if you perſiſt in your intention, learn of me the readieſt means of finiſhing that adventure which may, perhaps, bring your condemnation with it. The well beloved of an eccleſiaſtic muſt have a devout ſoul: it will, therefore, be neceſſary to try the tempting things of Lombard-ſtreet.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lombard-ſtreet, in Paris, is famous for the plenty and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of cakes, ſweetmeats, &amp;c. ſold there.</note> Tempt her with dry ſweetmeats, paſtils, dainties, and little cakes. Be careful of adding to theſe, from time to time, the ſugar-image of a Madona, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſome well conditioned St. Chriſtopher. As ſoon as you ſhall have prepared the way, by theſe acts of kindneſs, you muſt boldly endeavour to gain a private conference. She will not be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I'll aſſure you. Only be careful to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the different ſounds of the church bell. Do you hear that mournful tingling? It is for a poor chriſtian, an hour of ſupreme importance; but for my lucky brother, the hour of a ſhepherd. This bell calls the dear uncle to the bed of a dying man; run, Dolerval, to the pillow of the niece. The Rev. Curate terrifies the poor dying perſon with the words of peace; but you, my brother, muſt ſtrive, by leſs awkward addreſſes, not to affrighten the well and living perſon, whom it is deſirable, at this urgent moment, ſhould be converted by you. In ſhort, while the unlucky prieſt uſes, perhaps, fruitleſs endeavours to ſave a man from purgatory,

make haſte, my brother, to ſend a woman to para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Thus, therefore, inaſmuch as a paternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion of the paſtor will ſend a poor creature into the other world, an amorous incurſion of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will bring another into this. Wonder, in the mean time, at the great effects ſometimes produced by the leaſt cauſes. By means of theſe dainty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, you will repair all the ravages made in the pariſh, by the frightful garments of M. Sevin. In ſpite of his murderous gown, you will hinder the hamlet from being depopulated. And, in a little time, it will be acknowledged, on all hands, by the difference of your works, to be the very <note n="*" place="bottom">Murville, beſides giving unbecoming advice to Dolerval, is, in ſeveral inſtances, quite profane. But it will be eaſily ſeen that he is not an example for imitation. The conduct of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval, in ſpurning the baſe counſels of his brother, and refuſing to reply to this letter, is worthy of the higheſt praiſe.

I could eaſily excuſe you, my brother, for adoring ſuch a beautiful girl as ſhe.

                     <p>You may be aſſured, Dolerval, that I ſhall not

come near Tours, without ſtopping at the houſe of Madame Florival for at leaſt twenty-four hours. And we will go to the parſonage together, ſhall we not? I have a great curioſity for becoming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his pretty niece. Heavens! how ſurpriſed I ſhall be to behold in that place the Dulcinea of Don Quixotte!

                     <p>IT is done! my fate is determined! never—never muſt I expect any more to find happineſs upon earth. No, it would be in vain, in this tranſitory ſtate, to ſeek for repoſe. In whatever tranquil abode peace chooſes her reſidence, I need but make my appearance to expel her from thence. The ill fate which conſtantly purſues me, is attached to all perſons who can, in any reſpect, be called my connections! Misfortune upon misfortune is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon all perſons having a regard for me, who dare, in any manner, to connect their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies with mine! Such a perſon ſoon becomes the object of univerſal pity; by which means, my own lot becomes more deplorable.</p>
                     <p>Before I came hither to diſturb M. Sevin's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, it afforded him many enjoyments. But ſince my entrance into this once peaceful dwelling, its wretched maſter has ceaſed to be happy. From my aſpect, tranquil pleaſure has fled, and, perhaps, fled forever. My uncle can no longer attend to thoſe domeſtic affairs, which formerly to him, were rather a recreation than labour. His garden
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035743_0206_1006B0AA144F10F0"/>
is no longer cultivated; his favourite birds languiſh whilſt expecting their uſual nouriſhment. He ſeems to languiſh himſelf; he conſumes—his youth, waſted by corroding cares; advances with rapidity to its end. His ſacred duties, the moſt important offices of his miniſtry, have become inſupportable. Even to the altar have I ſeen him bear his ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, his profound anxiety, his tears and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>And can you imagine, Celina, that I, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſo many evils, can remain an indifferent ſpectator of them? No; my heart, wounded with ſorrow, is bereft of every conſolation.</p>
                     <p>And, on the other hand, what have become of thoſe greateſt conſolations which I once enjoyed? M. Dolerval, of late, has ſeemed quite as unhappy as my uncle: like him, he has an air of perpetual inquietude, and appears, at all times, to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully agitated. His countenance is greatly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; his pale, diſcoloured figure, has loſt much of that native ſweetneſs from which it derived its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal beauty, and has become the reſidence of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding care. His eyes alſo, red and heavy, rarely diſcover their wonted vivacity; his voice is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and faltering. Sometimes, in extreme confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he appears deſirous of entruſting us with a painful ſecret; but a certain ſtrange and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable diſtruſt obliges him to deſiſt. His only explanations conſiſt of ſighs, which he in vain endeavours to ſuppreſs.</p>
                     <p>And if M. Sevin is not afraid of this confidence, by what ſtrange and incredible fatality does it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that he endeavours, by all poſſible means, to prevent M. Dolerval from divulging it. I have already told you, I believe, that my uncle ſcarcely gives me time to perform the uſual ceremonies of politeneſs to his friend. Muſic is not, at preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035743_0207_1006B0AFB124EAD8"/>
the ſubject which oppoſes our converſation: it is a book, which the Curate puts into M. Dolerval's hands as ſoon as he enters the houſe. And, O what a book! The author endeavours to prove, vile, perſonal intereſts to be the only motive of our actions; that, conſequently, there are but few virtues on earth. For inſtance, no filial tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; no brotherly affection; no faithful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted love; nor even ſo much as true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And what if all this could be inconteſtably proved? Would it, even then, be attended with any good conſequences to preſent before mankind this hideous picture of their deformity? For my part, I muſt declare that this deteſtable compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tarniſhes my ſoul, confounds and diſguſts me, and leaves me in abſolute deſpondency. And the chagrin of my uncle, muſt have wonderfully changed the natural goodneſs of his character, or he would not, at this time, be pleaſed with ſuch a book, and perſiſt in afflicting us with it every day. Do you not believe, Celina, that, were this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſyſtem once to be generally embraced, it would make us entirely deteſt human nature? No faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nor diſintereſted love! Is it not, my ſiſter, a moſt horrible thought?</p>
                     <p>Not even true friendſhip! If what I ſee in this place ſhould much longer remain, I ſhall be tempted to believe in that odious principle myſelf. One of the two friends often forgets the reſpect and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence due to the other: M. Sevin often ſpeaks to the young man with ill-diſguiſed impatience, and ſometimes with a voice of intolerable ſeverity. What ſurpriſes me ſtill more, M. Dolerval, at times, gets out of humour himſelf. The other evening—no, Celina, it was yeſterday—it ſeems to be ſeveral years ago—yeſterday evening M.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035743_0208_1006B0B18744E2B8"/>
Dolerval ſeemed to be as much vexed with this book as myſelf; and, I muſt confeſs, caſt it away a little abruptly; but, ſoon convinced of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming behaviour, he leaned upon the table, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his face with his hands, and remained ſeveral minutes in this humiliating poſture. His breaſt roſe and fell with ſudden and irregular motions, and, I muſt own, I felt much affected when I obſerved ſeveral tears between his fingers. My uncle, who remained a ſilent ſpectator, then aroſe, and, with a pitiful but inoffenſive tone, ſaid to his friend— "Conſider, M. Dolerval, whether the ſtrange figure we two make here muſt not be quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amuſing to my niece."</p>
                     <p>"What your modeſty permits you to advance only in a collective manner," anſwered the young man, "muſt, I am ſenſible, have reference to me alone. Ah! if I had ſo much fortitude as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at home, and hide my weakneſs there, you would, doubtleſs, be better pleaſed. 'Tis out of diſpute, that it would be more agreeable to you, if your friend, a ſilent witneſs of your good fortune, would never come here to empoiſon it with any inquietude."</p>
                     <p>"What exceſſive irony!" anſwered my uncle with ſeverity. "Were I in your place, Dolerval, and ſhould believe what you have preſumed to ſay, I ſhould, at leaſt, endeavour to have ſo much gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity as to exerciſe the courage you ſpeak of."</p>
                     <p>"This," replied M. Dolerval in his turn, much agitated, "is the very advice I have, for a long time, expected; and, depend upon it, I ſhall, to the extent of my power, endeavour to follow it." He then roſe to go away, but, ſtopping a moment to look at me once more, he uttered ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which my uncle conſidered as an outrage
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035743_0209_1006B0B5F2FCFE68"/>
both upon Juliette and himſelf; but, to me, they appeared to have nothing in them but a ſtrange ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity in their meaning, which made me feel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, but gave me no offence. "Aſſuredly, M. Sevin," ſaid he, you cannot but be very happy in the poſſeſſion of this young woman at your houſe; but never—and you wreſt the declaration from me —never could I have thought that you alſo would have a niece."</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he ſuddenly left us. We have not ſeen him this evening; and, for twenty-four long hours, he has not been here.</p>
                     <p>He will, I perceive, preſerve his reſentment on account of this laſt quarrel; and my uncle, as much to blame as he, obſtinately perſiſts in finding an inſult in thoſe words which ſeemed purely inig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, and proteſts he will not go after him again. Alas! deſtitute even of true friendſhip! But how can my uncle be much to blame? What did the young man intend by viſiting at our houſe? How ſtrangely he has behaved here! and, if he is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, why ſhould he come to diſturb our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity? and, if he is not, with what can he be ſo much afflicted? and how can I, on his account, feel ſo much anxiety? We have not ſeen him during twenty-four long hours!</p>
                     <p>At laſt my eyes are opened—perhaps too late; but never will I cloſe them again. That reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſeemed ſo cruel as to appear impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, is the moſt adviſable one I can take. I muſt fly—I muſt go—no matter where, provided it be far, very far from this place, where my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence makes every one miſerable. A few more days as tedious and unhappy as the preſent, will give me a diſpoſition and courage to undertake it. Indeed, I muſt forſake this aſylum, ſo inſecure
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035743_0210_1006B0BFEE085CE0"/>
againſt the entrance of paſſions, and very cautious ſhall I be about fixing upon any other, however ſecure it ſhall appear. For if I ſhould, its peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inhabitants would ſoon feel the baneful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſtar which purſues me and governs my fate. Yes, I am determined in this reſolution. From village to village will I transfer my vagrant exiſtence: I will tarry no longer in one place than is neceſſary for procuring, by labour, the ſupport of one day; and the hours or my wretched idleneſs I will paſs in the ſolitude of gloomy foreſts. Then will my lot become leſs deplorable; then ſhall I enjoy the miſerable conſolation of being alone, and weeping unheard. Ah! how completely I am alone at the preſent moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have not ſeen him during twenty-four long hours!</p>

                     <p>In the morning he came again betimes—but he came not alone—he was attended by —. No, my eyes did not deceive me! No; the reſemblance between the young man and the lady I ſaw in the church was not a mere ſport of my imagination. There is ſuch a woman in reality! ſhe has the

ſame appearance which, at that time, I fancied ſhe had: for, this day, as far as I could ſee her, I knew it was ſhe. Too well do I remember at what time, at what place, and in what attitude I firſt beheld her. What! can her huſband be ſo cruel as to bring her here to torment me? Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man!—he comes in this manner to inſult my ſorrows! My heart was ready to break, and was ſmitten with the moſt violent reſentment. Imagine what joy ſucceeded this painful moment! M. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin ran with every mark of lively ſatisfaction to meet our new viſitant, and in his tranſport, he cried, "It is Madame—:" he called her by name, my ſiſter. He called the name of one whom M. Dolerval indeed hold dear, but whom he may love without offending any other; one whom he has taught me to admire, by the many praiſes he has beſtowed upon her; a mild, ſenſible and beneficent woman, in whom is united every virtue, and every grace! An accompliſhed woman! In ſhort, no other than Madame Florival!</p>
                     <p>Now, my ſiſter, all is explained. This is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Florival. "Come, without delay! Come and unite two lovers! Complete her happineſs and mine!" Truly he was impatient for the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Eleanor's vows. Excellent youth! His greateſt happineſs conſiſts in promoting that of his ſiſter. What ſatisfaction muſt ſhe take in the poſſeſſion of ſuch a brother! And I alſo ſhould feel proud if heaven had permitted—But I am bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed that ſhe enjoys that bleſſing! I am bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed! She is unſpeakably worthy of it.</p>
                     <p>Now it is out of diſpute, that chance has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the ſecret of Madame Florival to me. M. Dolerval is free, himſelf! Free to love any one

who has merit enough to pleaſe him. It was ſhe who was married. I am rejoiced at it! She has well done! Since every thing requiſite to render a brave man happy is united in her perſon, ſhe has well done!</p>
                     <p>We entered into converſation with an ardour almoſt equal to affectation; yet it ſeemed to me of ſhort continuance, and, if I may believe her, ſhe did not think it long; nor did her brother, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, think it longer than ourſelves. During this intereſting converſation, he unceaſingly gazed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and with an air—an air impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe! When I ſpoke, he obſerved me, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as much attention as if his life depends on what I was going to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs myſelf, he purſued every word as it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my lips to the countenance of his ſiſter, to ſee what impreſſion it made there. The attention of M. Dolerval was not, at firſt, free from a ſort of ſtrange anxiety; and I could not but be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with it. Could he ſuppoſe I would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gain the good opinion of a perſon whom he ſo highly eſteems, and to whoſe opinion I know he attaches the greateſt importance? What reaſon has he to fear that I am incapable of gaining her benevolence? Whatever might have been the cauſe, it was neceſſary for my happineſs that he ſhould be ſatisfied much ſooner. But you cannot form an idea of the ſatisfaction which ſhone on the countenance of M. Dolerval whenever Madame Florival honored Juliette with an obliging ſmile. When ſhe firſt addreſſed me with a highly flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compliment, he ſeemed unable to contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And I cannot tell by what ſympathetic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between the two perſons, it happens
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035743_0213_1006B0CF560E29F8"/>
that the brother fondly returns to the ſiſter the careſſes ſhe kindly beſtows on me. Twice has ſhe embraced me, and twice has he kiſſed her hands.</p>
                     <p>Before leaving me, ſhe laviſhingly beſtowed on me the warmeſt and higheſt praiſes. Then in a lower voice, and ſpeaking in confidence to her brother, ſhe ſaid, "Theſe, my brother, are the natural graces of innocence, modeſty and candour itſelf; this is the charm of civility and innocence which comes from the heart, and is void of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation." He anſwered in the ſame tone, "If ſo, I am very guilty."</p>
                     <p>Then my uncle, who ſeemed like me to give all his attention to this myſterious dialogue, ſaid, with much force of expreſſion, "Indeed you are! and an hundred times more ſo than you can imagine! Suſpect my friendſhip, my own principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as much as you pleaſe, and I can overlook it; but her virtue, her modeſty, ſo worthy of the higheſt reſpect! O young man, young man!"</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, my friend," interrupted M. Doler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, "pardon me. Be kind enough to obtain her pardon alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you, Mademoiſelle, will you not permit —" Here he was ſtopped by his ſighs, and was ready to fall at my feet; but a look of his ſiſter commanded his ſilence and forbearance.</p>
                     <p>On leaving me, Madame Florival deſired my friendſhip. Excellent woman! What was there in me to make her deſire it?</p>
                     <p>But, Celina, what is that inſult for which M. Dolerval reproached himſelf with ſo much bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Could there have been in thoſe words he ſpake the other day, a hidden meaning which was injurious to my character? Well, ſince he will have it ſo, ſince he ſeems to acknowledge it, he has offended me. However, if his ſiſter had not
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035743_0214_1006B0D9DF1D4D30"/>
checked him, he would have caſt himſelf at my feet! What diſcourſe, after ſuch a humiliation, could have been ſo criminal as to prevent my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs? Oh! whatever has been his fault, it has been effaced by his tears!</p>
                     <p>It is, I think, almoſt needleſs to tell you we had no muſic, although, at firſt, there was ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. This, on the part of M. Dolerval, was but a pretext for this viſit. But the time would have failed us if it had been otherwiſe. I forgot to tell you, that during my converſation with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Florival, my uncle appeared to have that calmneſs and ſatisfaction, which, for a long time, I have deſired to find in him again. Certain it is, that this delightful evening has been too ſhort for us all.</p>

                     <p>JUDGE, my friend, whether I am not to be pitied. Imperious neceſſity compels me to quit thoſe places which were every day endeared to me more and more. I am forced to leave Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in deſpair. Her huſband, though an upright man, cannot eſcape the perſecutions of the envious and evil minded. He did ſo much violence to his wiſhes as to leave the arms of his wife in four days after their marriage. A happy change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſeemed to require this ſudden departure for the capital, and the very night he arrived there, he was plunged into the dungeon of the baſtile. We have juſt now received this frightful intelligence. I muſt depart immediately, and, indiſpenſably, for Verſailles; there to remain long enough to take the neceſſary ſteps for relieving him, whilſt the ſucceſs of my undertaking is but too uncertain. How I am grieved for my poor unhappy ſiſter!</p>

Do not tell

her this; for I have conducted in ſuch a manner, as to juſtify your diſtruſt, your reſentment, and, perhaps, her enmity. But I deſire you, at leaſt, to aſſure her, that I ſhould be tormented for having entertained ſuch cruel ſuſpicions againſt her, even after ſhe might have goodneſs enough to forgive me. Adieu. O why muſt I depart without ſeeing her again! Adieu! Adieu!</p>

                     <p>M. SEVIN had not been gone a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he returned, and M. Dolerval with him.</p>
                     <p>"Here, my niece," ſaid M. Sevin, "I have brought him to you, ſo ſenſible of his faults, that he durſt not come without your commands, and my permiſſion."</p>
                     <p>"Mademoiſelle," ſaid the young man, "I go away in deſpair, ſince, by going, I muſt leave you. And will you, to render my miſery complete, let me go, oppreſſed with the intolerable thought of being a victim to your too juſt reſentment? Ah! I conjure you, by that tender pity we ſhould feel, and exerciſe towards a perſon who has a deep and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of his errors, to permit me to hope, that I may, one day, obtain your pardon!"—Here his ſighs ſtopped his voice. "Yes, yes, I pardon you, and return as ſoon as poſſible." The laſt words, which he did not require, eſcaped me undeſignedly,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035743_0218_1006B0F240423150"/>
and, immediately, he fell on his knees before me, and ſeizing one of my hands, he claſped it in his, and preſſed it to his breaſt. Not a word then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his mouth; but what words could be ſo expreſſive or energetic as his mild looks and eloquent ſilence? Is it not natural to ſuppoſe, that in this moment of ſurpriſe, I ſhould have revealed my ſentiments? Yet I am happy in being able to ſay that I did not; but I will diſſemble no longer, nor will I hide any thing from you. My uncle cried out at the ſame inſtant, "How could I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the guilty and cruel project of hindering their loves, ſo full of innocence and tenderneſs? O Dolerval and Juliette, rejoice in the privilege of your lawful rights! Fortunate young people! Each of you, without being criminal, can love the other!"</p>
                     <p>The manner in which M. Sevin pronounced theſe words, ſuddenly brought to my mind an idea of the bitterneſs of his ſituation in beholding us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and obſerving the ardour of our ſentiments. Then making, perhaps, a painful effort to free myſelf from the ſort of infatuation which had taken hold of me, I told the young man to go away; and I, without waiting for him to obey me, flew from him myſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>EIGHT long and painful days have glided away ſince his departure: and the unſpeakable grief of his ſiſter makes it but too evident that he will not ſoon return. If Madame Florival was not reſerved for my comforter, I know not how I could endure this painful abſence of her brother. We viſit her almoſt every day. Beautiful and excellent woman! How often in ſeeing her, do I behold the features of her brother! It is not the reſemblance of their beautiful figures alone, which ſo forcibly ſtrikes my fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no, this amiable perſon is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with graces ſtill more captivating. But they reſemble each other much more in their engaging manners; in a voice full of pleaſing ſoftneſs, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and benevolence. As ſoon as ſhe ſees me, ſhe tells me, with an air of unſpeakable ſatisfaction, that her brother makes mention of me in all his letters to her. But when, O when, will ſhe be ſo kind as to ſhow me her brother's letters? He is the continual ſubject of our converſation: for ſpeaking of him, ſeems to be the only conſolation his ſiſter can enjoy. When I converſe with her concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own ſorrows, ſhe is unable to make any reply, and her tears inſtantly flow without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; mine are mingled with hers, and M. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin—M. Sevin, alas! is the moſt unhappy of the three—he dares not complain! He cannot even weep!</p>

Every hour, the ſacrifice of which is not imperiouſly commanded by his ill performed duties, he ſpends in the garden, in the gloomy grove, to which, for ſome time, he has had a great attachment. I can ſometimes ſee him walking there until he can hardly ſtand, and, through fear of too much afflicting him, I dare not go to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him, nor take him away from his ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. Until the preſent time, I have found but one mean of bringing him back to the houſe. Muſic ſtill preſerves over him an entire dominion. Experience, however, has taught me that the ſounds of the piano alone are not ſufficient to draw him; it becomes neceſſary to unite my voice with it. As ſoon as the harmony of ſounds reach his ſolitude, he leaves it, and comes, as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctively, to the door of my apartment, where he ſtands and liſtens, in a fixed and immoveable poſture. There is, my ſiſter, as I have lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, a great alteration in him. Thoſe ariettas, ſo gay, which formerly pleaſed him more than any other airs, and which diſguſted me extremely, at preſent, have but little effect upon him. There are none but plaintive ſounds that can ſoften his grief. But as ſoon as I leave the inſtrument he returns to his ſolitary grove, and if I ſhould wiſh him to retire precipitately, I need but ſing one cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet of my favourite ſong, and the work is done.</p>
                     <p>But, in a little time, I found, to my vexation, that I could not have my accuſtomed ſucceſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of coming to the door of my apartment, my unhappy uncle had ſtopped under the window. Tired with long and fruitleſs trials, at length I went into the yard, where I found him reclining on a ſtone bench, in a ſort of lethargic drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035743_0221_1006B1015B63CF70"/>
Judge what muſt have been his condition. When he awoke, he found himſelf too feeble to viſit Madame Florival. He was but juſt able to draw himſelf from the yard to the fatal grove, where he returned to his former ſupine condition. Notwithſtanding all the anxiety I felt, and all the pains I could take, I could not get him to the houſe till ſun-ſet. When I preſented him ſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I thought proper to remind him, "that he had not taken any for almoſt twenty-four hours."</p>
                     <p>"What of that," ſaid he, "if I am not hungry?"</p>
                     <p>"O my uncle, my dear uncle! would you then wiſh to die?"</p>
                     <p>"Why not, my girl, when one lives only to ſuffer?"</p>
                     <p>After this, he retired to his chamber. Still could I ſee he had a light. And, in the morning, if I ſhould awake by break of day, I ſhould find that M. Sevin had the ſtart of me. I have every reaſon to believe that ſleep ſeldom ſhortens his nights.</p>
                     <p>To preſent this frightful picture of his miſery to you I am ſenſible is no more than my duty. There is no reaſon for heſitation; I muſt depart— without delay! How can I ſtay any longer in a houſe where I occaſion the perpetual unhappineſs of the moſt generous, moſt unfortunate of men? I muſt leave him My abſence cannot occaſion evils comparable to thoſe which my reſidence in this place brings with it. Yet, what will become of me I know not: but longer I cannot ſtay. But what will the young man do if he ſhould not find me at his return? Alas! he could not ſurvive it! And, myſelf!—Ah, my ſiſter, do I not injure my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by encouraging a groundleſs hope? Do you believe Madame Florival would—? But whether ſhe will receive or reject me, I muſt depart.</p>

                     <p>THIS morning I aroſe very early. My uncle had already gone down. "What!" ſaid he, "have you riſen ſo early? You muſt then have foreſeen that it was good to prolong this morning." Upon this, he propoſed going into the garden. We walked about in it, and in every part except the grove. After this he deſired me to water ſome flowers, and prop a honeyſuckle; then he whiſtled for his darling birds, and called them together to receive my careſſes. Not long afterwards, in compliance with his deſire, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the houſe, where I perſuaded him to take breakfaſt with me, more eaſily than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After breakfaſt he urged me to ſing: at length, when the clock ſtruck nine, with great agitation of mind, he ſaid, "It is time! Come, Juliette, it is time!

                     <p>"Very readily, my uncle." Then I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he called me back.</p>

                     <p>"What do I hear? You frighten me! You have, I fear, contrived ſome fatal project againſt yourſelf!"</p>
                     <p>"Who? me, my girl? me? You are then but little acquainted with me ſtill! I am able to be unhappy, Juliette; but never, never ſhall I be criminal. Be comforted, I ſhall live—Alas! I ſhall yet live!—You, however, dear and too amiable girl, go, carry this letter to your worthy friend, and—farewell forever!"</p>
                     <p>Then he fell into a chair. His countenance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſymptoms of great alteration, and his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling frame was ſeized with a convulſive motion.</p>
                     <p>"O my uncle! my uncle!"</p>
                     <p>"Let not my condition affrighten you," ſaid he; "my eyes have, for a long time, been tearleſs. My tears are now ready to ſtifle me; they are ſeeking a paſſage: If I could weep, I ſhould be ſaved. But, go away, my girl, go away then—I order you to do ſo, in the name of the greateſt ſacrifice of which a man can be capable; in the name of the ſacrifice I muſt impoſe on myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"My uncle, my dear uncle, adieu!"</p>
                     <p>"Go, Juliette! charming girl, go! And if you ever deign to remember me, O, I conjure you! let it not be merely a compaſſionate remembrance. Juliette, let it be alſo what I have, perhaps, merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a remembrance of benevolence and eſteem."</p>
                     <p>Theſe laſt words melted me into a tranſport of compaſſion, which reached to the bottom of my
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035743_0224_1006B1130B67C8D8"/>
ſoul, and which I could not moderate. My uncle reached forth his hand to take hold of mine; I took it in mine and preſſed it to my lips, whilſt a tear from my eyes fell upon it; then forced myſelf away from him precipitately, and, as I went acroſs the yard, I ſtill heard the ſighs of this unfortunate man; and, as I ſhut the parſonage door after me, my ears were again ſaluted with an adieu. This, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, was the laſt; but, ſhould I live an hundred years longer, it would not forſake my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                     <p>In a little time I arrived at Madame Florival's, with a confuſion of mind beyond the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. My ſpirits were not only agitated by what I had juſt ſeen and heard, but, by an anxious curioſity to know whether there were not ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcrete demands, contained in the letter of which I was the bearer, and waited with the livelieſt anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, to ſee what effect the reading of it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. She read it through, with the greateſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and moſt eager curioſity. Madame Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, whilſt reading it, diſcovered ſigns of ſurpriſe, ſadneſs and joy. Then, inſtead of giving me any explanation, ſhe took me by the hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me into a neighbouring apartment.</p>
                     <p>"My dear Juliette," then ſaid ſhe, "this is the chamber which I hope you will pleaſe to occupy. In my houſe, I would have you conſider yourſelf the abſolute miſtreſs of your time and employments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vouchſafe to become, in this place, my ſecond ſelf. Ah! if my conſolations are needful for you, they are not more ſo than yours are for me!"</p>
                     <p>"Madame —"</p>
                     <p>"No, my friend," ſaid ſhe, embracing me, "do not call me ſo; my friend is the appellation I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to make uſe of."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:035743_0225_1006B1164AC2F588"/>"O, my friend!" anſwered I, "my generous friend, I am ſtill ignorant of what he wrote you; but you—if you knew in what a dreadful condition I left him —."</p>
                     <p>"As to what he wrote me," anſwered ſhe, "giving me the letter, you ſhall ſee for yourſelf. And, reſpecting the condition in which you left him, do not be concerned. He ſhall have the conſtant attendance of one of our domeſtics, who ſhall watch over him continually, and never leave him. I promiſe you, he ſhall have the beſt attention paid him. Dolerval and I have both the means and diſpoſition for preventing his friend from ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in want. I will now leave you; you ſeem to ſtand in need of a little recollection; whenever it becomes inconvenient for you to be alone, you will know where to find me."</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, ſhe withdrew, leaving me in a deep and pleaſing contemplation of the dignity and ſimplicity of the manner in which this celeſtial woman beſtows her benefits.</p>
                     <p>I will not tell you, my dear Celina, how many tears I ſhed on reading the letter of my unfortunate uncle, but limit myſelf to ſending a copy of it to you.</p>

                     <p>AT length the fatal hour is come. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding darkneſs of the night is not ſo gloomy as that which begins to cloud my reaſon. My virtue, my too feeble virtue, begins to fail me. Perhaps in another day, I may loſe the fruit of my painful reſiſtance. Perhaps I may ſo far loſe my ſenſes, as to alarm her virtuous mind with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſhe ought never to hear. The fatal hour is come—It urges the cruel ſacrifice—Nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but ſeparation. How it wounds and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures my heart! Let a great misfortune ſpare me the pain of a ſtill greater! and, ſince I muſt loſe her forever, O that it might be without having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her!</p>
                     <p>To you, Madame, appertains the honor of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her. To your virtues is due the reward of being intruſted with the object of your brother's innocent love, and my culpable tenderneſs. Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable! Ah, wherefore! Wherefore this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the unfortunate Sevin, and the too fortunate Dolerval? From whence came thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitous inſtitutions by which I am deprived of thoſe privileges which he is permitted to enjoy? By what miracle has it happened that I am not, like him, allowed to be a human being? What power binds on earth thoſe faculties which heaven has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon me, and of which it has given the lawful exerciſe? O, barbarous men! who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035743_0227_1006B12348C8BFB0"/>
bluſhing, have declared, that on the day I ſhould become a prieſt, I muſt ceaſe to love what God, in his bounty towards men, has created moſt beautiful and deſirable; why did you not alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that on the ſame day I muſt never more have any ears capable of hearing, nor eyes of ſeeing— and, above all things, why did you not deprive me of a heart which is capable of ſenſation? But of what conſequence is it to them, to give to us in particular, laws which are unjuſt, abſurd, and impracticable? Are they not always above the law themſelves? They make them for none but us— for us who would not be worthy of their notice, if they could not derive ſome advantage from our oppreſſion—for us, vile, degenerate and deſpicable race—and, truly, deſpicable in the higheſt degree; becauſe, in our abject ſtupidity, we conceive it ſomewhat honorable to obey them.</p>
                     <p>And ſhould any of us feel a diſpoſition for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying them, by what means could we free our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the chains by which we are bound? As for me, unhappy mortal, what is reſerved me but the human ſhape? What girl—what modeſt and virtuous girl, like her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could behold my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dreſs, and ſuſpect me of belonging to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race? And if, in the extremity of an idle hope, I had preſumed to ſay, "Juliette, I muſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs you, and cannot live without you," would ſhe not have inſtantly ſaid, "Simple man, what a propoſal is this! Look upon your gloomy habits; they are to me a continual ſign of your reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; you wear your own mourning ſuit. Go, unhappy being! open the doors of Hymen's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all who requeſt it of you; but, as for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you muſt never enter therein. In ſo doing, you would go to the altar with uſeleſs vows: for
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035743_0228_1006B12F5F7D0130"/>
your God, ſince men have forbidden him, could never receive them."</p>
                     <p>Oh, how different would have been my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, had it been poſſible for me to go into ſome other profeſſion (though reputed leſs honorable), in which I might have reſumed the dignity of my being! Then, perhaps, too fortunate Dolerval, you would not have taken her from me! In ſuch caſe, I might have dared to contend with you; with even you, the moſt amiable of men! But is not the moſt amiable, at the ſame time, the moſt ſenſible? And who, however, could have loved her ſo much as I could have adored her?—O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs!—Supreme felicity! Then ſhe might have become mine!—Then it would have been in her power to love me, and mine to obtain her!—O let's abandon this idea! It is dreadful! Inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able! It enkindles in my breaſt a flame which conſumes me! My blood is all inflamed! I feel a heart-breaking! A deſpair!—What do I hear? All the ſouth winds have burſt their priſons!—The lightning cleaves the clouds!—The thunder roars! Withhold, avenging God! withhold thy dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand! I am running forth to meet thy fatal bolts, that thou mayeſt annihilate me!</p>
                     <p>Four o'clock morning.</p>
                     <p>How have I interrupted this letter? Who has tranſported me to the grove which I have juſt quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? With what gloomy, oppreſſive ſleep was I there ſurpriſed! And, O with what dreams was I ſuddenly aſſaulted! What, in ſhort, is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which I have juſt been? Let's read again— The winds, lightning, thunder!—Alas! when I awoke there was an univerſal calm throughout na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the ſtorm was only in my heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="unknown:035743_0229_1006B1339CAE8B68"/>Ah! for pity's ſake remove this lovely girl, whoſe preſence delights and diſtreſſes me; whoſe voice delights mine ears, and, at the ſame time, cruelly wounds my heart; whoſe very looks charm me, and inflame my ſoul with paſſion: this dangerous fair one, who ſpeaks not a word which I do not retain, makes not a geſture which I do not applaud, not a motion which I do not admire; and whoſe every motion, every geſture, and every word diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through all my ſenſes a mortal poiſon. Let her be removed! it is time ſhe was ſnatched away, and perhaps already too late!</p>
                     <p>To your care, Madame, do I now commit her. Protect her in your turn. Is it not neceſſary, even for her ſecurity, that you ſhould be acquainted with all the intereſt which her youth, moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly perſecuted, is calculated to inſpire? And, ſince an avowal of my own wretched condition has eſcaped me, ſhe cannot but pardon me for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the ſecrets of her misfortunes, exempt from blame. I do not doubt what ſhe has told me, and it would be criminal in me to diſbelieve it; yet it muſt appear impoſſible to you, Madame, that there are now in being ſome monſters, in human ſhape, who hate and wiſh to deſtroy this maſter-piece of nature and education. Defend Juliette, in your turn, from their fury—Comfort and ſhield her from the iniquity of thoſe who are unequalled in barbarity. Juliette, no!—ſhe is not Juliette; nor the niece of poor Sevin. According to our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, heaven muſt have beſtowed on her a noble origin; but whatever the hiſtory of her birth and parentage may prove, heaven has done her injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in not placing her upon a throne. Tranquil in my retirement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did not know there was a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated human being ſo ſuperior to all others. One
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035743_0230_1006B139EEF47A30"/>
day, at the riſing light of the morning, ſhe came hither; but the crimſon morning dawn was leſs brilliant than herſelf; her luſtre was ſuperior to the brighteſt morning. She came, attended with all her graces, captivating in her terror, powerful in her diſtreſs and forlorn circumſtances. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ſpoke, and whatever were her deſires, they were granted. Unmindful of the conſequences, I imagined myſelf ſupremely happy in receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my houſe this daughter of heaven. Ah! what preſumption! I did not perceive, that though I might have defied nature when her voice alone was heard, that ſhe was altogether irreſiſtible when her power was augmented by the all-conquering power of beauty!</p>
                     <p>How dearly have I purchaſed this error of my ſelf-confidence! And O how wonderful is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of my error! Notwithſtanding what I have ſuffered, and though I might ſuffer ſtill more, I ſhould dread no approaching misfortune ſo greatly as an expectation of falling into my former indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. All thoſe ſweet and painful ſentiments which convey to the minds of mortals that paſſion which always holds dominion over the various paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that it inſpires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ſucceſſively, and at the ſame time, nouriſhed in all their plenitude. I have become acquainted with the growing confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, modeſt embarraſſment, timid reveries, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing languors, virtuous ſacrifices, and prudent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection of love. I have experienced the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſweetneſs of thoſe inward conflicts it raiſes in the mind; the ſoothing folly of its hopes, and the lively enchantment of its dreams. Alas! I have not, at all times, vanquiſhed its powerful energy, its violent deſires, nor its culpable projects. More eſpecially have I, to my ſorrow, experienced the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035743_0231_1006B13D77C582F8"/>
effect of jealouſy, that gnawing vulture, which I have an hundred times vanquiſhed, and which has a thouſand times reigned triumphant. O Dolerval! my friend, pardon me! You can and ought to do it. The exerciſe of clemency is eaſy to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred rival. O fortunate Dolerval! whoever has merit enough to gain her affections, is moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of obtaining her. Poſſeſs her—render her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py—this is my moſt ardent and pleaſing expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The greateſt conſolation I ſhall enjoy, will be a hope and expectation of her felicity.</p>
                     <p>Tell her, Madame—no, do not tell her any thing. Put this letter—into her hands, I pray you. Alas! Juliette, when you ſhall read this letter, I ſhall be left alone in the world—abſolutely alone! This abode ſhall never more be adorned with her preſence. I ſhall loſe her, and that forever! The unhappy Sevin will be ready to die with grief for the loſs. Oh, Juliette! condeſcend to receive ſomething by which you may remember me. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this as a monument of my weakneſs, and the power of your charms. Deign to receive and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. Juliette, it will bring to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance my unfortunate paſſion, of which you ought always to have been ignorant; but it will alſo unfold to you the ſentiments of that profound reſpect, which I could not but always entertain for you; of that truly religious reſpect which your all-powerful virtues have commanded me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in reſiſting even ſuch charms as yours.</p>
                     <p>As for me, when the aſſiſting hand of time ſhall have healed the wounds of my heart, I ſhall inveſt myſelf with the ſweeteſt recollections of paſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; I ſhall often go into the garden where I have ſeen her labour and ſport, active as the graces, nimble as the zephyr. There ſhall my feet often
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035743_0232_1006B148DEF03638"/>
trace out the impreſſion of her ſteps. The flowers ſhe has cultivated I ſhall endeavour to render im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. Her favourite amongſt my birds, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the one I moſt highly value, will eaſily learn to repeat her name. Sometimes I ſhall return from the garden and ſeat myſelf by the inſtrument which was agitated by her brilliant and active hands. There, with a liſtening ear, ſhall I ſtill endeavour to hear the accents of the moſt enchanting of voices. But never, no, never ſhall I dare to profane, with a ſingle look, the ſanctuary where her nights have peacefully glided away.</p>
                     <p>Thus, in my retirement, every object around me will bring her to my remembrance, and her beauteous image will be impreſt on my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till my lateſt breath.</p>

                     <p>YOUR new troubles, my deareſt Celina, moſt ſenſibly affect me! How I wiſh I could fly to Paris and render you all the conſolation in my power! But a mother's hatred, and the barbarity of a brother, have forever ſeparated me from you. Every day convinces me more and more, that of every act of injuſtice they exerciſed towards me, that of our ſeparation was the moſt cruel. How can I forbear complaining myſelf, when every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with whom I am connected, is ſurrounded with misfortunes? This woman, who numbers her
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035743_0233_1006B14B02337618"/>
days by her works of benevolence; who appears to live for no other purpoſe than ſeeking the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and relieving their wants; whoſe chief em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment conſiſts in promoting the felicity of all around her; who improves every opportunity of giving me new teſtimonies of her friendſhip; this woman is ſtill the victim of misfortunes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all her fortitude to ſuſtain; and her brother does not return!</p>
                     <p>You will probably remember that I was at firſt ſurpriſed that Madame Florival did not interrogate me concerning my ſecrets, which were in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in M. Sevin's letter. Afterwards I reflected upon the matter, and ſuppoſed it might be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary caution on her part; a point of delicacy which her circumſtances impoſed on her. For how could ſhe require her friends to diſcloſe the ſecrets of their heart, when ſhe could not honor them with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of her own? Every one believes her to be in widowhood; ſhe continues to keep as a ſecret, the circumſtance of her ſecond marriage, believing me to be unacquainted with it. I do not attempt any meaſures calculated to make her diſcover her ſecret, nor ſhall I permit her to know that it has come to my knowledge. And ſince ſhe thinks proper to deny me ſuch a teſtimony of her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I look upon her as the obliged perſon. But I am ſtill deprived of the greateſt conſolation which my preſent ſituation could poſſibly give me, that of knowing what her brother ſays of me in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which every courier regularly brings. This, without doubt, is the reaſon why the time appears to be long, even in the ſociety of this excellent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>This is not the only occaſion of my feeling anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious and diſcontented. M. Sevin ſtill continues in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035743_0234_1006B151A3C7D5F8"/>
a diſordered ſtate of mind. His regret on account of our ſeparation has thrown him into a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, from which he will not ſoon recover. We ſend every morning to inquire after his health: my amiable friend goes thither every evening; and I, Celina, wait at home with impatience, till they return and inform me whether he is any better. You muſt be ſenſible that I cannot go thither my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Poor M. Sevin! Never muſt I viſit him again!</p>
                     <p>When I thus behold every perſon who has a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for me perſecuted with misfortunes. I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay to myſelf, with bitter reflections, though without much foundation, that perhaps the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Bovile might ſtill have been alive, if he had not too much lamented my fate. His deſtiny, I ſometimes think, has been influenced by mine. Then I tremble, leſt Madame Florival, ſo amiable and benevolent, may ſooner or later repent that ſhe ever knew me. O heavens!

                     <p>MY dear Celina, congratulate your ſiſter; he has been here during ten days: but, in fact, I at preſent ſtand in need of your pity; for, to-morrow he will leave us again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:035743_0235_1006B15908A84730"/>In what a pleaſing enchantment have glided thoſe happy hours! How powerful are the paſſions of human nature, which can ſhorten time or prolong it at pleaſure! While he was abſent, hours were, ſeemingly, augmented to ages; on the contrary, ten days in his company, have laſted, as it were, but a moment.</p>
                     <p>But who can paint the charms of our employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or recreations? Who can expreſs the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our converſation, and even of his ſilence? In his ſilence, what a pleaſing expreſſion is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable! How eager are his cares, and how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his attentions! And yet, what a reſpectful reſerve in his diſcourſe, and delicate moderation in his manners! Could you have believed, that ſince his return, he has not, in the leaſt, declared to me the paſſion with which he is ſo manifeſtly inſpired? It is true, his ſiſter — Oh how ſhe is idolized by him, and how he is beloved by her! And how tenderly, in appearance, do both of them regard me! His ſiſter is continually with me, and could ſcarcely live without me. If he is but a ſhort time from his Eleanor, he is uneaſy till he finds her again. You may perceive by this that we are almoſt inſeparable: inſomuch, that I am ſometimes ready to aſk myſelf, whether the ſiſter is not more tenderly attached to me than her brother, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the brother has not more friendſhip for her than love for me. But I am perſuaded he would not purſue his ſiſter with ſo much ardour, if he did not know there was another perſon by whom ſhe was always attended. Often have I heard him, when he has returned home warm with fatigue, inquire, as ſoon as he entered the houſe, "Picard! where is the young lady?" And, ſtopping ſhort,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035743_0236_1006B160CD132718"/>
turn to his ſiſter and ſay, "Madame Florival, do me the pleaſure of telling me where ſhe is."</p>
                     <p>This tender union, which reigns equally and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually between two perſons, alike actuated by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's chief affections, one would think, ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſeem an enchanting ſpectacle. Inſtead of this, it has often ſeized my heart with a moſt weighty affliction, by embittering, my dear Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, the regret of our eternal ſeparation. Often, by a recollection ſtill more dreadful, it penetrates my very ſoul with an inexpreſſible ſentiment of horror and dread againſt —. Alas! can I never free myſelf from that dreadful remembrance? Shall I never be ſo happy as to forget my barbarous bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                     <p>Let us turn our attention another way; let us fix our thoughts on this intereſting couple—this perfect model of fraternal love. How worthy is the young man of inſpiring all the mild ſentiments he experiences! And how greatly does Madame Florival merit his kind regard; who, much more by her examples than her precepts, has unfolded every amiable diſpoſition of her brother!</p>
                     <p>This heavenly woman muſt always be a great gainer by being known. Whoever, by accident, or only at times, falls in her way, will not fail of being captivated with her talents and attractive qualities; but in the happineſs of an intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection alone can any one know how to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the value of her ſoul. Her mind is ſtill more engaging than her perſon! And to what can we compare her genius, ſo well cultivated; and her perſon, favoured with ſo many natural graces; her perſonal dignity, and that ſweet equality of temper, which her laſting grief has not altered; ſo well as
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035743_0237_1006B16921AC8390"/>
to the excellent genius, amiable mind, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able temper of her brother and pupil?</p>
                     <p>And do you not think he is equal to her in the qualities of his heart? But to-morrow, Celina, he is going to leave us. He ſeems to be much afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the thoughts of it, and it is very evident from his behaviour, that he cannot bear to part with us. But ſtill he does ſo much violence to his inclinations as to leave me! And wherefore? For the purpoſe of terminating the ſorrows of his ſiſter; or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, merely with a deſign of ſupporting her with dreams of pleaſing hope.</p>
                     <p>If you would wiſh to know to what degree he extends his friendly conduct, I will tell you. He has brought with him a phyſician from Paris, for the purpoſe of attending my unhappy uncle. He now aſſures me that M. Sevin is out of danger. But he needs the greateſt attention; and if he is not well attended, perhaps, after a few months of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment, the melancholy ſtate he is in will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to his grave. Poor M. Sevin! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he ever know me? Or rather, why was he placed in a condition which is unſuitable for a man of ſenſibility? Poor unfortunate man!</p>
                     <p>His friend viſits him every morning and evening, and often ſtays with him an hour, and ſometimes longer. He always returns from the parſonage with a ſad countenance and heavy heart. And I cannot but greatly eſteem his commiſeration and ſolicitude for the Curate, in which I take a ſhare.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems fortunate that I can perceive him to be tormented with anxiety on another account; I ſay fortunate, becauſe the extreme reſerve which I ſo much admired in him, and which I muſt own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me to a great degree, would, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, become quite perplexing, were it not eaſy to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035743_0238_1006B16C819D6420"/>
perceive that he kept ſilence with great difficulty. Sometimes, after a few minutes of deep contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and evident irreſolution, led by an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tranſport, he ſeems ready to declare his hopes or fears. But Madame Florival, who has a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſcendency over him, by one word, one geſture, or one forbidding look, immediately repreſſes theſe violent emotions. She ſeems, in fact, like a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful divinity, who has the entire dominion of this young man's ſubmiſſive and tractable ſoul, even in its moſt lively agitations.</p>
                     <p>But to-morrow he expects to leave us. To-morrow—we ſhall have a melancholy parting.</p>

                     <p>AH, how paſſionate were his parting words! I did not imagine what it was which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them moſt intereſting.</p>
                     <p>He was going away almoſt in deſpair. And I, with a trembling voice, a heart ready to break with ſighing, and eyes overflowing with tears, ſcarcely dared to expreſs my wiſhes for his ſpeedy return. But I had no ſooner done ſo, than he ſuddenly came back, and coming precipitately towards us, he caſt himſelf at my feet. His ſiſter endeavoured to check this new and ſudden tranſport.</p>
                     <p>"No, no," cried he, "I will reſiſt my wiſhes no longer; I have ſuffered too much by my painful ſilence already." Then directing his diſcourſe to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035743_0239_1006B171F8DE8860"/>
me, he ſaid, "I am extremely unhappy! The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I have for you, this pure and lawful affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does not move you. You ſeem determined to continue a ſtranger. You obſtinately perſiſt in being known to us by no other name than Juliette. And you, my ſiſter, oblige her to make herſelf known. Leave, Eleanor, that delicacy which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys me. Begin by entruſting her with your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets—entruſt her with them out of pity towards me!"</p>
                     <p>Madame Florival was about to ſpeak, but I haſtily prevented her.</p>
                     <p>"My friend," ſaid I, "it would give me great ſatisfaction to be favoured with your confidence, and I ſhould glory in ſhowing myſelf worthy of it. But I muſt inform you beforehand, that it will not, in the leaſt, incline me to make the explanations you require. You have, for a long time, ſeemed worthy of acquiring all my confidence; but the reaſon I have not diſcloſed my ſecrets to you, is becauſe I am unfortunately doomed to retain them forever."</p>
                     <p>"My dear Juliette," anſwered ſhe, "do not wait for me to juſtify my diſcretion: I will leave you to appreciate the motives of it yourſelf. There ſeems no longer to be any neceſſity of denying myſelf the conſolation of ſuch a friend as you: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, therefore, my confeſſions." Then ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me of what ſhe ſuppoſed I was ignorant; her ſecond marriage, and the captivity of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. "This," added ſhe, "is all I am permitted to tell you. I cannot reveal the name of my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, nor the unhappy events which obliged him to live unknown, becauſe theſe are ſecrets which I think belong to his diſcretion only. Would he have intruſted you with them, Dolerval, if he had
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035743_0240_1006B177AD070210"/>
ſuppoſed you would make no ſcruple of revealing them to the perſon you ſhould love? This young lady, you ſay, is worthy of our entire confidence. Do not, I pray you, repeat ſuch a dangerous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection any more. There is no lover who would not tell you the ſame concerning the perſon of his choice. Thus the principle, however inconteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it might be in itſelf, would be deſtroyed by a multitude of exceptions; by theſe means, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip could have no ſecrets which love could not diſcover. Dolerval, I have often told you, and have lately had the ſad experience of it, that when we would wiſh to perform painful duties, we ſhould never allow ourſelves to reaſon with them."</p>
                     <p>In the mean time her brother ſeemed not to hear her, for he was, apparently, in complete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
                     <p>"Never," cried he pitifully, "never ſhall we know her hiſtory! Never ſhall I be able to obtain her! And the hope of a fortunate union, which ſupported—."</p>
                     <p>"You ſee," interrupted Madame Florival, claſping me in her arms, "the love he entertains for you. One word from you would greatly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the ſeverity of my misfortunes, becauſe you would thereby begin the happineſs of his life. It ſeems ſtrange, that you cannot, like me, reveal ſuch part of your hiſtory and misfortunes as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects you in particular! And ſince it is ſaid to be poſſible for you to have enemies, you might, as to whatever concerned them, be ſilent."</p>
                     <p>What ſhall I tell you, Celina? Whether the reflections of Madame Florival inſpired me with courage and hope, or whether the ſight of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſo much unhappineſs, was more than I could bear, I will not try to determine. Be it as
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035743_0241_1006B181956B0070"/>
it may, I could not forbear expreſſing myſelf in the following words:</p>
                     <p>"However fortunate the union you ſpeak of may now appear, I am too well acquainted with you to believe you could well enjoy it while your ſiſter remained unhappy. Go, Dolerval, labour to reſtore her the huſband ſhe adores. Make haſte to procure his releaſe from confinement. Then I ſhall ſee— you ſhall be informed of the greater part of my misfortunes—If it is poſſible I will tell you my name—and you ſhall then judge what means are ſufficient to ſurmount the numerous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles —."</p>
                     <p>The impatience of his rapture was ſo great, that he could not permit me to finiſh my ſpeech. His ſiſter was loaded with careſſes, and I with the moſt tender thanks; and then, to my ſurpriſe, he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged permiſſion to write to me.</p>
                     <p>"Directly?" ſaid I, "no—no—well, let it be only once: at the moment when your brother-in-law ſhall be ſet at liberty! Let the joyful news be directed to me: let it be me who ſhall have the unſpeakable ſatisfaction of informing my friend of this happy intelligence!—And you muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Dolerval, to arrive as ſoon as your letter."</p>
                     <p>Scarcely had I done ſpeaking when Madame Florival tenderly embraced me. And Dolerval, on receiving my hand, which his ſiſter joined to his, ſhed tears of joy. And now the preſſing time of departure had come: an hundred times did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to go, and as many times did he return. At length he is gone—now we are left alone.</p>

                     <p>I BEGIN to flatter myſelf, Murville, that my long abſence will ſoon be terminated. Soon, I truſt, will it be in my power to learn you the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent motives, and happy conſequences of a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which has given you ſo much concern. As to my ſilence during ſeveral months, of which you ſo much complain, I muſt tell you that I ſuppoſed it to be my duty not to write to you till I ſhould have nothing to fear from my indiſcretion or your dangerous counſels: for you occaſioned me to become very guilty towards the pretended niece of M. Sevin.</p>
                     <p>At length, the long wiſhed for moment has come, when I can, without danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſcloſe to you the ſecret joys of my heart. That angelic perſon, my brother, whom you treated with ſuch injuſtice in your letters, was not M. Sevin's niece, in any ſenſe of the word. During three months ſhe has reſided at the houſe of my ſiſter, and, during that time, ſhe has been the only conſolation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Florival. And, according to preſent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, I ſhall go forthwith to Tours; I am going thither—.</p>
                     <p>Tell me, Murville; you can, towards the end of next week, moſt certainly, leave the duties of your ſtation for a few days; can you not? You ſhall come to the houſe of our Eleanor, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious feaſt ſhall not be wanting, I aſſure you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

How you will glory in having for a ſiſter in-law, one of the moſt excellent amongſt women! I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſend you her portrait, which I have drawn from memory. It is, I confeſs, but an imperfect ſketch. However, imperfect as it is, I take the greateſt pleaſure in multiplying copies of it. I have no leſs than three by me at preſent! Well, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to give one of them to you, and think it a great ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Farewell, Murville. You will come to my marriage, will you not? You ſhall bear witneſs to the felicity of a brother! And, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, you will find my ſiſter as happy as myſelf. Adieu.</p>

                     <p>VARMONT, I ſuppoſed you had committed an outrage upon Mademoiſelle de Terville, for which reaſon, I was vexed at you in the higheſt degree: you ſuppoſed I was her obſtinate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting guardian, and you was, therefore, as ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len as a dunce. While the young woman thus perplexes us both, a third perſon, and an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fellow, is amuſing himſelf with her at our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Since you have not had her after ſhe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from me, I can freely pardon you; and, as I do not keep her at preſent, I hope you will pardon me.</p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:035743_0244_1006B191EB682AD8"/>Would you adviſe me to go after her again? Her ill fate has thrown her into the arms of one of thoſe modern celadons, who, whenever they find a woman of merit in their way, will make nothing of her but a wife! She would, I am ſure, find her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unſpeakably more happy in being the miſtreſs of ſuch an amiable fellow as Murville! One thing prevents me from proceeding. Her intended is a man to whom I owe a great deal of reſpect. Well, ſo much the more reaſonable would it be to hinder him from ſuch a fooliſh proceeding. But what if I ſhould play him ſome miſchievous trick, and he ſhould be grieved beyond meaſure? Poh! his grief would not be ſo romantic as to laſt him during life. But he is ſuch a good hearted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it would ſeem cruel to give him the leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs. Well and good! But how perplexing will all this be to me!—Varmont, there is a great warfare within me. Tell me, my ancient oracle, tell me what you would do were you in my place? Do you underſtand me, Varmont? I ſay in my place. Don't be miſtaken; I did not ſay in yours. To continue; as to your place, you are, I well know, capable of having leſs irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fewer ſcruples than I am; for which reaſon I have thought proper not to inform you the place of her concealment: for, if I finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to let her remain where ſhe is, I determine that you ſhall do the ſame. And if, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I ſhould go there to recover her, I promiſe, this time, to keep her ſecurely.</p>
                     <p>Farewell, Varmont. You muſt not be ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, old friend. For my part, I embrace you with frankneſs; pray be kind enough to return me the compliment.</p>

M. Dolerval himſelf will come—this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He will, as it were, reſtore his Eleanor to life! He will bring with him the huſband ſhe adores. Excellent woman! behold your ſorrows at an end! How can I deſcribe her ſenſations or my own? By what means can I acquire ſufficient ſelf-government to ſupport, as I ought, my own happineſs and that of a friend ſo dear? Adieu, my dear Celina, I muſt return to my friend, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with her about the two perſons who are ſo impatiently expected.</p>
                     <p>11 o'clock at night.</p>
                     <p>O my ſiſter, my ſiſter! what a reverſe! Now I am convinced (I can almoſt ſay), that heaven has created me for the expreſs purpoſe of exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its wrath upon me, and making me a tormentor of all my intimate acquaintances.</p>
                     <p>My friend meaſured the time by her impatience: the afternoon ſeemed endleſs. At length the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of a poſt-chaiſe ſtartled us, and prepared us for the pleaſure of their reception. This ſuppoſed ſtranger, whoſe return was probably haſtened by
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035743_0246_1006B1A38549AB10"/>
my engagements with Dolerval, entered firſt; without perceiving me, he entered, for all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was fixed upon his wife, whom he preſſed in his arms. For my part, alas! I ſaw him but too plainly; and too plainly do I behold him ſtill! But I could not command my eyes from being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably fixed upon him; not becauſe it required a long examination to recogniſe him, for the more I beheld him, the more I aſked myſelf, in deep amazement, whether I was really awake? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the object before me was not a dear but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive and perſecuting phantom which troubled my fight? Whether it was not a deluſion of my ſenſes, proceeding from a dream at once pleaſing and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? This brother-in-law ſpake to my friend; this brother-in-law, who was conducted hither by a young man who expected he ſhould be able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me: I liſtened attentively to all he ſaid, and endeavoured to perſuade myſelf that I did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly hear; but how was it poſſible to doubt any longer? His voice delighted my ears, while it wounded me to the ſoul! This huſband, Celina, ſo dear to Madame Florival, is mine; it is the too benevolent, the too unfortunate Bovile!</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, his deliverer was at my feet; and while he expected to entertain me with nothing but his hopes, he was forced, by my behaviour, to witneſs in himſelf the keeneſt anxiety.</p>
                     <p>"Ought you," ſaid he, "to be ſo much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at their mutual affection, as to turn all your attention towards them? Will you not condeſcend to look upon me alſo for one moment?" Scarcely had he finiſhed the expreſſion of his fears, than I gave him another cauſe of fear ſtill more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. My ſtrength ſuddenly forſook me; and, if he had not withholden me, I ſhould have fallen.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035743_0247_1006B1A881A60328"/>
His cries turned the attention of his ſiſter and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law towards us. "Merciful God!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Bovile, "it is—it is the exceſs of her joy!"</p>
                     <p>For a ſhort ſpace I remained in that ſituation wherein a fainting perſon exerciſes no faculty but that of hearing. My amiable friend and her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſed all poſſible means for bringing me to my ſenſes. Bovile was not leſs earneſt, nor leſs dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent than they: and while aſſiſting me, he could not refrain from repeating his former exclamation, the true meaning of which was underſtood by none but me: "yes, it is—it is the exceſs of her joy!" "May I flatter myſelf," ſaid his friend, "that this was the real cauſe?" Madame Florival affirmed, "it could be nothing elſe."</p>
                     <p>Bovile reſumed and ſaid:</p>
                     <p>"This, then, is the young lady of whom you ſo often ſpoke during our return!"</p>
                     <p>Dolerval anſwered, "that I was."</p>
                     <p>"Is her hiſtory ſtill unknown to you?" ſaid Bovile. "Are you yet unacquainted with her birth and parentage?"</p>
                     <p>"Exactly as I told you," replied Dolerval; "but ſhe is about to make herſelf known; we ſhall be united; I am waiting for my reward; and where can there be a more fortunate lover!—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her, even in this languid ſtate, how beautiful ſhe appears!—See, ſee! ſhe returns to life!"</p>
                     <p>I began, indeed, to recover the uſe of my ſenſes. My unfortunate benefactor, whoſe approaching danger made him exerciſe his uſual preſence of mind, took hold of my hand and gently tapped it with his, as if he had no other intention than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting my recovery; but doubtleſs with a deſign alſo of giving me to underſtand, by his diſcourſe,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035743_0248_1006B1AA8BDCF8D8"/>
that our critical ſituation required the moſt ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous attention.</p>
                     <p>"Dolerval," ſaid he, raiſing his voice a little, "is it not poſſible you may have flattered yourſelf with a groundleſs hope? Since the young lady has kept ſecrets of this nature for ſuch a length of time, perhaps ſhe was compelled to do it by important conſiderations. Are you certain that circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will now permit her to explain herſelf as ſoon as you can deſire?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied the young man, "I have her word for it: and what can be more ſacred than the promiſes ſhe has made me?"</p>
                     <p>Then, unable to reſtrain my firſt emotions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, I cried out, "Ah, Dolerval, what have you dared to ſay! How dreadful is the promiſe I made you!"</p>
                     <p>And, ſuddenly ſtruck with a ſenſe of the dangers which threatened Madame Florival, in a tranſport of compaſſion, I threw myſelf into her arms:</p>
                     <p>"Tremble, my deareſt friend," ſaid I, "trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the thought of learning my fatal hiſtory—it is dreadful!—for I am not the only one, nor the moſt to be pitied!"</p>
                     <p>Perhaps I ſhould have continued, and perhaps betrayed myſelf, had not Bovile, by a penetrating and expreſſive look, implored my ſilence in behalf of his wife; and I was fully ſenſible that it was neceſſary, out of pity towards her, to hide the real cauſe of my diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>And now, he whoſe tragical end I had deplored, ſtood in my preſence. According to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, it is evident, and more eſpecially according to the virtuous character of Bovile, who is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of perfidy, that the lover of Madame Florival
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035743_0249_1006B1B2C5FD3018"/>
admired her long before he was acquainted with me. When, to free me from the ſlavery of the cloiſter, he led me to the altar; the generous mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal not only made me the ſacrifice of his fortune, but of his moſt tender inclinations, to which the advanced age of M. Florival left ſome hope. O that it were in my power, thought I, to fall at his feet and teſtify the gratitude, reſpect, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I feel for his extraordinary virtues! In what an unfortunate place, however, do I find him, and in what trying circumſtances! By how many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes I am ſurrounded! How many dear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying witneſſes, who will often bring me under the neceſſity of offending or deceiving them! Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there a woman in a ſituation more difficult or deplorable! If I ſuffer the leaſt evidence of my reſpectful attachment for Bovile to be diſcovered by my words or actions, I ſhall give equal aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and deſpair to the ſiſter and brother. And ſhall I not be in danger of betraying my huſband while ſtriving to keep Madame Florival in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which preſerves her life? Alas! is it not alſo neceſſary for me to encourage the hope of the young man; the pleaſing hope to which I had voluntarily yielded, and which muſt never be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified? But how can I calmly receive the aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his affection without offending my huſband, who is preſent to hear them?</p>
                     <p>My huſband, do I ſay? He cannot be mine and at the ſame time that of Madame Florival. He has probably loſt all right to Emilia, whom he will doubtleſs renounce! and yet this Emilia would be criminal if ſhe ſhould ſecretly entertain an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for another. O Dolerval, Dolerval! our union will be impoſſible forever!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="unknown:035743_0250_1006B1B6F8D116F8"/>So many, and ſuch painful thoughts do not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me without being manifeſted from time to time by external ſigns, which are diſtreſſing to my lover. I endeavour to comfort him by a kind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. I tell him—yes, I can ſafely tell him, that he muſt not impute my anxiety to any thing but the painful ſtruggles which I muſt naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, when I behold the moment approaching in which I muſt reveal all the horrors of my deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny. But Bovile, in this reſpect, more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than I, could have no reaſonable pretext for his melancholy. His melancholy, do I ſay? It is neceſſary for him to affect tranſports of joy, while he is tortured with keen diſquietude, and, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, in the agonies of deſpair. He ſeems, at ſome intervals, to be wanting in the courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for his trying ſituation; his voice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance often change in an equal degree, and he often ſeems to be affected with gloomy reveries. At firſt his wife appeared to feel no other emotion but of tender ſolicitude for his welfare.</p>
                     <p>"Have a little courage and patience my dear," cried ſhe; "ſince they have reſtored you to liberty, they will doubtleſs reſtore you to honor."</p>
                     <p>But, notwithſtanding all ſhe can ſay, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever efforts he makes to ſeem cheerful, ſhe ſoon beholds him again in the ſame penſive mood as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then ſhe becomes anxious and afflicted for herſelf: "Alas!" ſaid ſhe, "are you now more unhappy than when you returned from Cadiz; or have I become leſs dear to you than formerly?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" replied he, "if it was poſſible not to love you at all, my lot would, perhaps, appear leſs —; perhaps it would appear more ſupportable."</p>
                     <p>Madame Florival was ſtill more alarmed by this
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035743_0251_1006B1C1678CFC18"/>
reply, which her huſband refuſed to explain, and which I could eaſily underſtand.</p>
                     <p>What more, my ſiſter, ſhall I tell you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this evening; one of the moſt trying I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced during my life? Bovile ſeemed to deſire an opportunity of ſpeaking with me in private; and I was deſirous of obtaining his counſels and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this critical ſituation; but there were no means of obtaining them: for Madame Florival, ſometimes calm, and ſometimes agitated; now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and then grieved, had not left her huſband for a moment: And, on the other hand, the young man, continually ſeated near me, at firſt infatuated with flattering hopes, ſeemed now to regard me with increaſing anxiety. Has my refuſal to make the expected explanations given him more lively chagrin, or has he artfully taken it upon him to appear anxious and offended, in order to compel me to a diſcloſure of my ſecrets? All I can tell you is, that he urged me, with great ardour, to make myſelf known. But it was with a tone of voice which wounded true love, by a ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, which, methinks, would never take place if true love is founded entirely upon eſteem. And juſt now, as I was about to retire, he ſaid, with great force of expreſſion, "Why ſhould it ſeem painful to you to make thoſe declarations which you ſtill deny me and continually defer? Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated and perſecuted innocence no longer appears intereſting; we ought never to bluſh at our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; there is nothing but vice which can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur diſgrace. Indeed, if I could believe for one moment, that vice had poſſeſſed the incredible power of ſullying, in the leaſt degree, the purity of your mind, I ſhould ever afterwards deſpair of finding true virtue."</p>

                        <pb n="50" facs="unknown:035743_0252_1006B1C88B969550"/>Theſe ſuſpicions, which he ſo poorly diſguiſed, were rewarded by my ſilence. And now, my ſiſter, I have returned to my apartment, where I ſhall no longer expect to find repoſe.</p>

                     <p>THIS morning I could not refuſe my attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at breakfaſt. Madame Florival was far from appearing tranquil; Bovile had an air of penſive melancholy, and M. Dolerval ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his ſolicitations with an ardour which greatly affected me. For all his behaviour was attended with a reſpectful delicacy, which, from what I heard from him laſt evening, was quite unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was, however, to view it in its true light, an additional affliction to your unfortunate ſiſter. What a culpable propenſity is this, which makes me derive ſatisfaction from the reſpectful love of this young man, whom I am compelled to deceive by falſe promiſes! And how cruel it is to continue in pleaſing him whom I am not permitted to love! It ſeemed, in my deſperation, that I ſhould end in making myſelf known, when Bovile, apparently deſigning to fortify my mind with different reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, turned to Madame Florival, and ſaid, "As we are agreed in it, I will now give your amiable friend a relation of my fatal adventures as far as ſhe is unacquainted."</p>
                     <p>Then he informed me that "his name was Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035743_0253_1006B1C352ABA1F0"/>
that in the latter part of the year 1775, he, for the firſt time, ſaw Mademoiſelle de Sancerre, now Madame Florival, and no ſooner beheld than he admired her; and when he found it was not in his power to obtain her, in order to leſſen the weight of his misfortunes, he followed the ſeas; that M. de Varmont, a celebrated naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, had advanced him, placed him in the royal navy, and ſupported him there; after the death of his benefactor he went to Paris, where he ſaw the youngeſt daughter of his friend, whom he married, to prevent her from being impriſoned in a convent."</p>
                     <p>In this place, Celina, I could not reſiſt my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of interrupting his rapid recital.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Monſieur, how much eſteem and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are due to you from that young woman!"</p>
                     <p>"She is no more," cried he!</p>
                     <p>"Is ſhe no more? Alas! it muſt be ſo, ſince you have married this lady."</p>
                     <p>Then he related how "his Emilia had periſhed in a ſhip which was deſtroyed by fire; how, in a few days afterwards, his perfidious companions in arms, forſook him near the Iſlands of the Azores, in a naval engagement with the Engliſh. My fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate," continued he, "was ſunk; I ſwam upon the wide world of waters, but did not deſpair. Fortune ſeconded my ſtruggles, and at length I was ſaved by getting upon a rock. During three days I was ſupported by the ſhell-fiſh and herbs which grew thereon. About noon, on the fourth day, I was kindly taken on board a Spaniſh ſhip, bound from Terceira to Cadiz. Too well acquainted with the injuſtice of mankind, who are always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to condemn the unfortunate, I aſſumed a falſe name. At this time, heaven ſeemed ready to reward me for my former reverſes of fortune. Soon
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035743_0254_1006B1D362D0D780"/>
after landing at Cadiz, I received a letter from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval, which informed me that his ſiſter, having loſt her huſband, was at liberty. It was not long before I found means of returning to France, and, without delay, I came to this houſe for an aſylum, and the recompence of my hard fortune. In the mean time, how could I obtain it? How contract a ſecond marriage? Although there was a natural certainty in the death of Emilia, it could not be proved by any legal evidence; and, in ſuch caſes, our laws oblige a ſurviving huſband to live ſingle. I propoſed a mean of ſecuring my happineſs, which I believed would injure no perſon in the world; a mean which ſeemed to bring no inconvenience with it. This propoſal ſeemed, in the opinion of Madame Florival, the moſt adviſeable. We went with confidence to the altar, and I was married by the falſe name which my unfavourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances obliged me to aſſume. It was on the night of —." "The 7th of Auguſt," interrupted I! "I ſhall long remember that night!—for my friend has often repeated the date."</p>
                     <p>"I acknowledge it," anſwered Madame Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, preſſing my hand in her own; "I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I have often recollected that night with a mixture of pleaſure and pain. You ſee how dangerous it is for perſons to compound with their duty; at that aera, for the firſt time in my life, I preſumed to do it, and now I am puniſhed for it in a moſt unfortunate union. A continual fear empoiſons all its enjoyments; and though my fear ſeems without foundation, yet it inceſſantly revives in my mind. Alas! this, perhaps, is a foreſight!"</p>
                     <p>"Methinks I underſtand you," interrupted I; "you tremble leſt his firſt wife, ſaved by ſome miracle, may one day come again, and —."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:035743_0255_1006B1DD280E8828"/>"I ſhould certainly die," cried ſhe pitifully.</p>
                     <p>"It is impoſſible," ſaid her brother, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive and conſoling voice."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" ſaid Bovile, regarding me with a look of ſupplication.</p>
                     <p>And I alſo, Celina, moved with terror and pity, ſaid, "It is impoſſible."</p>
                     <p>Bovile, much encouraged by this converſation, continued, "Theſe were, and ſtill are, my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As ſoon as more favourable circumſtances would permit me to requeſt a review of the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous proſecution which diſgraced my memory, I determined to appear in the preſence of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and let them know I was ſtill living. After this, I determined, without delay, to reſort to my miſtreſs, and marry her by my aſſumed name; by which I purpoſed to go into ſome obſcure village, and ſpend my days with her there. But we had not been united more than five days before a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was circulated that M. de * * * *, miniſter of the marine, my perſonal enemy, had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed for an intrigue. I haſtened to Paris, but found, on my arrival, it was a falſe report. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what baſe courtiſan of my powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my informed him of my exiſtence and arrival at the capital—but, in the midſt of the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was dragged away from my lodgings, and plunged into the gulph of miniſterial vengeance. You are acquainted," continued he, "with the reſt, excepting that my wife is now entering the fifth month of her pregnancy."</p>
                     <p>The laſt words of Bovile gave much ſatisfaction to M. Dolerval. "Now," ſaid he to his ſiſter, "your ties have, if poſſible, become more ſacred and dear."</p>
                     <p>Well might he ſay more ſacred and dear! And
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035743_0256_1006B1DFB4CA01F0"/>
it is evident that Bovile mentioned this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to convince me, that out of pity to a mother as well as a wife, I ought to ſpread a religious veil over my fearful ſtory. Of this he may be aſſured! However painful to me it may often appear, I ſhall be ſilent; to the urgent entreaties of this young man, I ſhall turn a deaf ear; I ſhall reject his earneſt ſolicitations; ſupport the weight of his reproaches, and, without being overcome, I ſhall behold his tears flow, and, in appearance, witneſs his deſpair with calm fortitude: happy ſhall I be to preſerve (even at the expence of his happineſs and mine) the life of his ſiſter, who is not only my friend, but an unfortunate mother, and the wife of my benefactor.</p>
                     <p>M. Dolerval, however, who cannot imagine how much I am to be pitied, if it was poſſible for me to declare it, ſtill accuſes me of egotiſm, cruelty and inſenſibility. "Beſides," ſays he continually, "you have promiſed me." And Madame Florival joins her brother in trying to perſuade me to a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of my engagements. O thoughtleſs and unhappy woman! let her tremble leſt I ſhould not always have ſufficient fortitude to keep thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets ſhe urges me to reveal!</p>
                     <p>And now the unkind young man abuſes me again. He repeats thoſe cruel expreſſions which ſo afflicted and offended me laſt evening: "<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted innocence appears more intereſting than before.</hi> Do you underſtand me, young woman, or do you determine not to underſtand?" Then he continued and ſaid, "<hi>We ought never to bluſh at our misfortunes: there is nothing but vice which can incur diſgrace.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Fortunately he ſtopped here. Fortunately he did me ſo much juſtice, or ſtill entertained ſo much
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035743_0257_1006B1E5E540A6D0"/>
reſpect for my character, as not to make again the laſt and ſevereſt reflection which I remember to have heard yeſterday evening with too little impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience."</p>
                     <p>But what can be the meaning of thoſe words, which he pleaſes to repeat when I have wearied his perſevering importunity, and which he repeats with a ſort of myſterious affectation; in which, methinks, I perceive a ſtrange mixture of threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and fear, confidence and jealous inquietude, preſumption and reſpect? What can be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I determine to know before long. Perhaps M. Dolerval will condeſcend to explain himſelf more clearly!</p>
                     <p>To continue; I have juſt had a very tender and trying interview with Bovile. He ſuppoſed he had found a favourable moment to warn me, with a low voice, that he was going to wait for me in the garden, and thought he ſhould not be perceived. Yet I cannot but tremble leſt his wife might have remarked our whiſpering: although ſhe was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another way, ſhe had her eyes fixed upon the glaſs, and in an emotion of ſurpriſe, ſhe looked round, and ſeemed, with difficulty, to ſuppreſs her anxiety. Out of prudence, I thought beſt to wait almoſt half an hour, and fearing Bovile might be out of patience, I made a pretence of retiring to my apartment, where you may ſuppoſe I did not make a long ſtay.</p>
                     <p>He began the converſation by acknowledging and aſking pardon for the crime he conceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf guilty of towards his firſt wife; then, by the tender commiſeration natural to benevolent minds, he conjured me to leave Madame Florival in the error, which alone could ſecure the mother and child from certain death. Afterwards, without
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035743_0258_1006B1E9A85F8688"/>
giving me any ſurpriſe, but ſome embarraſſment, he proteſted, in a very reſpectful and obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that I ought to feel perfectly eaſy on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe the preſent huſband of Eleanor had loſt all right to Emilia: and I could not but bluſh exceedingly when he told me I was to be pitied in being ſtill under the neceſſity of encouraging the love of the young man, who was, in the higheſt degree, amiable. Then he deſired me to inform him by what ſeries of wonderful events, I was ſaved at Breſt and conducted to Tours. I briefly informed him, my dear Celina, of every important circumſtance, except the crimes of that monſter of whom I could now be eaſily avenged, and for whoſe repentance I daily implore the boundleſs mercy of a ſin-pardoning God.</p>
                     <p>Bovile, all attentive to the relation of my ſtory, remarked with fear, "that Murville, being the friend of Varmont, would occaſion Madame Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival to be in continual danger of diſcovering my name and hiſtory: and Murville," added he, "is perhaps, a worſe ſubject than you are aware of; for (permit me to tell it you) your brother can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſtrangely corrupt all thoſe who keep his company."</p>
                     <p>He was going to aſk me but one queſtion more, for we deſired more than any thing elſe, to confer on the moſt adviſeable meaſures for warding off the dangers which threatened Eleanor; but Bovile obſerved his brother-in-law coming directly after us, and we were obliged to change the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After joining us, M. Dolerval accoſted us with congratulations on the great courage we were favoured with, which enabled us, notwithſtanding the winds and cold air, to continue our walk ſo long; and when we returned to the houſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035743_0259_1006B1F3FB769860"/>
Florival ironically told me, ſhe ſuppoſed I was all this time in my apartment.</p>
                     <p>In order to ſupport, during the remainder of the evening, the deſperate ſpectacle of the ill-diſguiſed chagrin of the ſiſter and brother, it was incumbent on me to exerciſe complete ſelf-government. Pity me, O Celina, pity me! for the portion of evils allotted me is already more than I can bear! But if this did not excite your ſurpriſe, you would only need, in order to have it excited, to conſider, for one moment, the ſituation of your ſiſter, in all its aggravating circumſtances, whilſt ſurrounded with the deareſt objects of her affection. The portion of ſorrow, which every day becomes more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and which I am neceſſitated to diſtribute to each of them, muſt, ere long, become intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſevere. And yet they, together, will have to ſupport but the lighteſt part of the burden, whilſt the feeble Emilia is the object on whom its enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous weight muſt fall. O! what would become of me, if, whilſt I am continually obliged to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe diſſimulation to hide from them my burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reflections or diſtractive anxiety; what, I ſay, would become of me, if I were not favoured with the privilege of communication with you, to give you the complete hiſtory of my misfortunes?</p>

                     <p>HOW afflicting it is to give pain to perſons whom we eſteem and tenderly love! and how cruel to endure their diſpleaſure! Madame Florival already begins to diminiſh her affection for Juliette, whom lately ſhe held ſo dear; and I believe the unkind Dolerval will end in hating me.</p>
                     <p>In his moments of impatience, which are more frequent than they were formerly, he continues to repeat thoſe phraſes which he has often ſaid before, and which ſtill ſeem inigmatical; and you cannot conceive to what degree I am wearied with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt behaviour. You cannot imagine what I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure when he purſues Juliette and his friend with inquiſitive glances of jealouſy! And if, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant afterwards, he turns away from us to hide the tears which overflow his face, then how much ſeverer are my trials, how much greater is my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs!</p>
                     <p>And when I behold the intereſting Madame Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, ſo mild and ſo timid in the jealous agitations of her mind, caſt her anxious eyes, by ſtealth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Bovile and me, what hinders me from flying to her arms, and, for an immediate juſtification of my conduct, preſſing her to my boſom, and making myſelf known?

Whenever Bovile and I, after ſeveral vain attempts, have ſucceeded in eſcaping and meeting there, M. Dolerval immediately follows. Yeſterday, as in the evening before, he accoſted us with ironical eulogies, on our invincible courage, which enabled us to endure the intemperature of the air. To-day it is quite otherwiſe; for we ſeveral times ſurpriſed him, to appearance, liſtening to what we ſaid. From the moment he perceives us, he purſues; but he regulates his ſteps in ſuch a manner, that we keep before him; and when he draws near, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances with ſlower ſteps and without noiſe. In this ſituation he is obliged to join us; for, whenever he approaches near, we ſlacken our pace without affectation. Thus forced to come up with us, he does it, but without ſpeaking a ſingle word. He appears to be afraid he ſhall not govern his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as he ought; he only keeps at my ſide, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates his ſteps according to ours, and, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, continues to accompany us until he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained us to return to the houſe.</p>
                     <p>This evening, however, they have left us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther almoſt an hour, and we have come to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reſolution. The reſolution neceſſary for me to take is very painful, and more ſo than I dared to acknowledge to Bovile. He has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, by my perſuaſions, whenever an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offers, to conduct me to whatever convent he ſhall think moſt eligible. This I have done for the repoſe of his Eleanor, and, perhaps, it may be for that of the young man; but never will it prove
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035743_0262_1006B20379459B18"/>
conducive to my own! At firſt I was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes, that by taking ſuitable precaution, I might retire, ſafely and undiſcovered, to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; but Bovile, in a lively and affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, repreſented the many accidents which might, at ſome time or other, diſcover my retreat to that place. And when he brought to my remembrance the hatred which Madame de Varmont ſtill bears me, I felt within me an inexpreſſible horror, on reflecting upon the ſtill greater dangers to which I might be expoſed by the cruelty of her ſon. What, my dear Celina, can now ſupport me? For now I am bereft, even of the miſerable conſolation of hoping to die in your cloiſter.</p>
                     <p>This preliminary being agreed on, we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more urgent to do than returning to the houſe. I was aſtoniſhed to think the young man had not purſued and diſturbed us in our ſad deliberations. The brother and ſiſter alſo, it appeared, had ſome ſecret and diſagreeable buſineſs to tranſact between themſelves. When we made our appearance, they haſtily concealed ſome letters they were reading, and their countenances were covered with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: M. Dolerval ſeemed to be more diſturbed than his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of this evening they have had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral lengthy and myſterious conferences. Juliette, we made no doubt, was the unfortunate ſubject of their converſation. When they ſpoke to each other, it was in a low voice; and they ſometimes turned their eyes towards me in ſuch a manner as gave me much alarm. At ſupper the young man made ſeveral uncommon and painful efforts to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs me; while his ſiſter, in deep contemplation, ſcarcely ſeemed to perceive me. It is all over with me! I have loſt their affection. Although I can
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035743_0263_1006B20514D69840"/>
eaſily pardon Madame Florival, while my heart is affected with relenting pity; yet, as for you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Dolerval, your conduct is unpardonable.</p>
                     <p>Do not imagine, my ſiſter, that the injuries they do me will render the approaching ſeparation leſs trying. No, do not believe it. This departure will be followed by an eternal abſence! This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſeparation will ſhorten the period of my life. Ah! ſo much the better, ſo much the better, if I can thereby ſhorten the term of my ſufferings! But my own ſufferings are not the moving cauſe of my reſolutions. My higheſt motive in retiring, is the giving a little repoſe to theſe unkind perſons who are continually miſerable by my reſidence with them, and who, inſtructed, perhaps too late, of my generous attachment for them, may follow me to weep over my untimely grave.</p>

                     <p>THROUGH what a ſcene I have paſt! Oh, Celina! how I rejoice to think it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but a few more ſo cruel as this to procure me the peaceful ſolitude of the tomb!</p>
                     <p>This morning Madame Florival received me with all the teſtimonies of friendſhip to which I have been accuſtomed at any time before. And, to my ſurpriſe, early as it was, I found M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval in her apartment. He was walking haſtily
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035743_0264_1006B20E62C411F8"/>
about the room in a thoughtful and uneaſy mood, and, after paſſing the firſt compliments, he ſeemed in haſte to look after ſome letters in his pocket-book, but his ſiſter checked him and ſaid, "One moment, my brother! let us do nothing precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately; your friend will come down immediately."</p>
                     <p>Her huſband, indeed, at the ſame time entered the room: then ſeating herſelf between M. Doler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and me, ſhe addreſſes him as follows: "My dear, we have been waiting for you. Will you be ſo obliging as to take a ſeat and hear me one moment without interrupting me; and let every one preſent do me the ſame favour.</p>
                     <p>"By what ſtrange fatality has it happened that the period of your return, ſo much deſired by your lover and your friend, the happy period which ſhould have terminated all their ſorrows—how has it happened unto the preſent moment that it has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved them in the deepeſt perplexity? It is of the utmoſt conſequence to know the cauſe of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, whatever it may be. I do not preſume to ſay it will be alike poſſible to every one to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, much longer, the ſituation which we find is more or leſs painful to us all. And ſince an elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation will ſooner or later be abſolutely indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I hope you will condeſcend to make it with the ſame readineſs and freedom with which I am about to exact it.</p>
                     <p>"It ſeems natural to ſuppoſe, Juliette, that by a moſt tender affection for you, my brother has merited the preference of being acquainted with the impenetrable myſtery of your misfortunes. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have favoured my more fortunate huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a relation of them, or why you have done ſo, I do not inquire. For the intereſt of us all, I limit myſelf to requiring you to let every

one become acquainted with your ſecrets. It is a favour which I requeſt in the name of my huſband, who cannot long enjoy any happineſs at home, while he beholds his wife and his friend in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual anxiety. It is an act of juſtice, which I claim in behalf of my brother, who loves you, and, as you doubtleſs deſerve, with the greateſt ardour and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; but who, by your frequent and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous converſations with Bovile, is driven to deſpair. I conjure you to do it for my ſake alſo," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, taking hold of my hand, which ſhe preſſed in her own with tenderneſs, "who do not wiſh to hide it from you any longer, that I am a little jealous of you. In ſhort, young woman, I muſt inſiſt on your doing it for your own ſake, for your reputation, for a vindication of your virtue, which the darkeſt calumnies have dared to purſue, even to the boſom of the moſt faithful friendſhip and moſt reſpectful love.</p>
                     <p>"Show her thoſe two letters, my brother. He received them," addreſſing herſelf to me, "the fifth of this month, juſt before leaving Paris to return home."</p>
                     <p>"I did not believe one word they contained," cried M. Dolerval, "not one word."</p>
                     <p>"In the firſt place," reſumed Madame Florival, "permit me to accuſe you of extreme diſſimulation. Often have I had occaſion to ſpeak about his elder brother, Murville, and you have never given me the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect you of having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him—I underſtand your ſilence, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liette; the author of this ſecond letter alſo, M. de Varmont, could you, for your misfortune, have—?"</p>
                     <p>I heard no more, my ſiſter, for at the name of Varmont, pronounced by Madame Florival, I fainted.</p>

                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:035743_0266_1006B21B915DDCA0"/>When I recovered my ſenſes, I ſaw her in great diſtreſs, her brother all in tears, and Bovile pale with terror.</p>
                     <p>"She knows him, indeed," ſaid M. Dolerval.</p>
                     <p>"How," ſaid Madame Florival, "could the mentioning this young man's name, or the mere ſight of a letter written by his hand, ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten her?"</p>
                     <p>And Bovile, with a trembling voice, tried in vain to get permiſſion for a peruſal of the letters which occaſioned my terror.</p>
                     <p>"Read them, my friend," ſaid I to Madame Florival, "read them. I tremble, it is true, but not for myſelf."</p>
                     <p>M. Dolerval, actuated with pity towards me, put back the letters into his pocket-book. But I told both him and his ſiſter they muſt no longer keep any thing from me. After urging them for permiſſion to ſee theſe letters, and making many entreaties, Madame Florival deſired her brother to give them to me. I read them, my ſiſter, and was better able to read them through than I expected! But, at preſent, Celina, my ſight is obſcured by my tears, and my hand trembles to ſuch a degree, that I cannot relate the concluſion of this dreadful ſcene: And, before I relate it, I determine to ſend you a copy of theſe letters: afterwards I will tell you what commentaries were made upon them, by what means they remained in my poſſeſſion, and what I intend to do with them.</p>

                     <p>YOU have much ingenuity, my brother; you prove yourſelf to be a man of talents. The picture you ſent me in miniature is ſo much like the original, I was almoſt diſtracted with joy and aſtoniſhment. Since you can paint her ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely from memory, you muſt have known her features perfectly well: but it is fortunate for you that I know her much better than yourſelf. That ſhe is very engaging I cannot deny: but if we may give credit to all that Varmont has told me, ſhe is, with all her attractions, but a little mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter! I am not, I muſt confeſs, the entire dupe of my friend. There ſeems to be in his writings, a ſort of amorous ſpite, which he endeavours, in vain, to diſguiſe; we may, however, conclude, that if he has not told ſome dark falſehoods, he has, at leaſt, exaggerated ſome ugly truths. And, reducing every circumſtance to its true and miſerable value, my poor Dolerval, it appears little ſhort of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right certainty, that your intended is no more than a fortune-huntreſs. Could I be ſatisfied you only meant to addreſs her for no other purpoſe than a little amuſement, it would be well; and in ſuch caſe, I would conſent to give up my right: but, to marry her! I would loſe my life before I would conſent to it. And, believe me, there are no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which I will not try to diſengage you from your undertaking.</p>

                     <p>MY friend, I have no reſentment againſt you at all. The reaſon I did not write, was becauſe ſome miſerable affairs of intereſt have given me no time. My youngeſt ſiſter, who was lately married, is dead; and you are acquainted with the honorable end of Bovile, whoſe goods they have confiſcated. The dowry of his wife, however, is well worth the pains of a ſuit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it, and this occaſions me to be ſurrounded with lawyers, who put me out of my wits. You may tell me, they doubtleſs give me ſome leiſure; very little, I aſſure you, and that little, I muſt own, is well ſpent in the company of a very good girl, who treats me with great kindneſs. You will, therefore, excuſe me for having preferred love to friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="unknown:035743_0269_1006B228739BA3B0"/>As to the little girl you mentioned, I have, for a long time, thought no more of her than if I had never known her; and was almoſt ſurpriſed to learn ſhe was yet in being. But, what is ſtranger than all the reſt, it ſeems ſhe has fallen into other hands than yours. But Lafleur, of whom I have juſt been inquiring, tells me ſhe was poorly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your caſtle, and ſince I know ſhe has great ſkill in running away, I am not much ſurpriſed. Recollecting that I promiſed you her hiſtory, I will now give you an abridgment of it. The dear girl was ſold to me in this place, by a ſort of mother, who guaranteed the premiſes. But I found I had been a dupe in the market. And how great was my ſtupidity! By her continual entreaties I was perſuaded to take her to Breſt. She told me ſhe wiſhed to go there to take leave of a brother, who, ſhe ſaid, was going away in the fleet. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended brother was a ſcoundrel whom ſhe loved. In the midſt of a clear night, and at a time when I leaſt expected it, the amiable girl, prudently ſeized with ſome of my beſt effects, ſoftly opened the door, and made her eſcape. But my valet, who is eaſily awaked, purſued the fugitive, and being ready to overtake her at the port, ſhe got out of her ſenſes, and jumped into the ſea. From thence, by ſome ſtrange providence, ſhe was taken and put into your hands. You may, for yourſelf, Murville, do what you pleaſe; but I promiſe, for your ſake, to let her alone. You will torment yourſelf, I ſuppoſe, by going after her again; but, believe me, ſhe is not worth that trouble.</p>
                     <p>However, if you have any regard for the poor man who is ſo bewitched after her, you cannot take too haſty, I ſhould ſay too violent meaſures, to hinder him from a marriage, which would, at
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035743_0270_1006B235522FCAD0"/>
once, bring him to diſgrace, and, ſooner or later, to miſery.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; my dear Murville, whatever part you may take, I ſhall not feel intereſted in it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on your account. O that you may forget her yourſelf, as I deſire ſhe may forget me! But I hope the fooliſh individual who warranted this girl to me, and thereby robbed me of my money, will ſoon have reaſon to repent of it. If you love her now, I cannot but pity you; and if your friend marries her, I ſhall pity him ſtill more.</p>

                     <p>CONSIDER, my Celina, how greatly I muſt have been confounded by thoſe inſulting let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the preſence of this young man, who was diſmayed with jealous love and fear; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the young man who could not, but with difficulty, refrain from entertaining the moſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſuſpicions againſt the object of his love. When I began to read them, I trembled for his ſiſter. But as ſoon as I diſcovered the nature of thoſe odious falſehoods which Varmont, ingenious in villainy, had invented to ruin me; as ſoon as I perceived that thoſe atrocious calumnies would only ſerve to cover the eyes of Madame Florival with a thicker bandage than before, and had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my new inſults would be the ſalvation of my friend, my courage in ſome meaſure revived. With
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035743_0271_1006B23C227BAEB8"/>
a voice leſs faltering, I was enabled to continue until I had finiſhed reading them. And Bovile, who, in the anguiſh of horrible expectation, was, at firſt, alarmed for the fate of his wife, ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards felt equal apprehenſions for mine.</p>
                     <p>The lengthy commentaries to which the inſolent expreſſions of Murville gave place, ſhall be paſſed over in ſilence; but, unfortunately, ſome of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks made on the calumnies of Varmont merit a repetition.</p>
                     <p>At the following paſſage in the letter of Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, "You are acquainted with the honorable end of Bovile, whoſe goods they have confiſcated," "Inſolent monſter!" cried the huſband of Madame Florival: "how can I take pride any longer in my falſe delicacy? You ſhall now be told what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of not having told you before: it muſt have been Varmont who put me into the Baſtile. Yes, every thing combines to confirm me in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! On the day of my arrival at the metropolis, I went to the houſe of my infamous brother-in-law to learn, from his own mouth, whether he expected to recover ſix hundred thouſand livres which he had never paid me? The arrant knave had ſo much preſumption as to tell me to my face, I ſhould never have given him a receipt for that ſum unleſs he had paid it me. Exaſperated at his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy, I withdrew, and went down to an inn, to which, I ſuppoſe, I was followed by one of his lacquies. Then did I learn, to my ſorrow, the falſity of the intelligence which put me in his way. After I had found my enemy was ſtill in his place, I ſhould have inſtantly departed; but being too much fatigued, and wiſhing to write to my wife I ſtayed ſeveral hours. There was not one man <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

the city, except Varmont, who knew of my exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and arrival at Paris. You muſt be ſenſible that they informed againſt me the ſame night, ſince the vile bearer of the lettre-de-cachet<note place="bottom">This was the term given to a warrant in the king's name to take and put a priſoner into the Baſtile.</note> came and took me by ſurpriſe, at four o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
                     <p>Madame Florival and her brother could hardly give credit to the relation of this wicked action; whilſt I, my ſiſter, by certain infallible marks, could recognize Varmont in every part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital.</p>
                     <p>Soon afterwards I read the letter over again; and while I was reading, I interrupted myſelf: "Indeed," ſaid I, caſting my eyes upon Bovile, "it is too true, that <hi>a ſort of mother ſold me!</hi> But it was the moſt generous of men who bought me. And how ſhamefully has he been rewarded for it by my infamous relations! O that in ſome other family, he may find the happineſs of which mine ſeem formed to deprive him!"</p>
                     <p>Thoſe, my ſiſter, to whom the true meaning of this diſcourſe was unknown, could not but give it a bad interpretation, for Madame Florival bluſhed exceedingly, and M. Dolerval was ſtruck with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment.</p>
                     <p>A few lines farther, Madame Florival aſked me, with a faltering voice, "whether it was true that I was conducted to Breſt?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Madame, it is true." And my anſwer coſt many ſighs to her brother.</p>
                     <p>"Is it true," ſaid he in his turn, "that <hi>you lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a perſon who went away in the fleet?</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered I, "it is true that I loved
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035743_0273_1006B2439406A9C8"/>
ſuch a perſon." Hearing this, he turned pale and ſat down: and he ſeemed ready to fall into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtate in which I had been myſelf.</p>
                     <p>A moment afterwards: "But," ſaid Bovile with vehemence, "this is an abyſs of iniquity, of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and obſcurity, in the depth of which I am loſt!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," cried the young man, riſing with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, "you ſay rightly! An abyſs of iniquity, infamy and obſcurity! A combination of dark deeds! A weight of calumnies, which, in ſpite of her acknowledgments, I cannot yet believe!"</p>
                     <p>At length I had no more to ſay, and Madame Florival was ſilent for a conſiderable time. Then, caſting her eyes upon me with a penetrating look, "Well," ſaid ſhe, "I am waiting —."</p>
                     <p>"For what, my friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Your name," cried ſhe; "your ſecrets, your misfortunes; thoſe misfortunes which juſtify you!"</p>
                     <p>"My dear friend! in order to juſtify myſelf, I muſt ſacrifice the beſt of women."</p>
                     <p>"O Juliette, my deareſt Juliette! appearances, and your own confeſſions, ſeem to be againſt you: ſpeak then, I am ready to believe—."</p>
                     <p>"And I, O moſt intereſting of women! am ready to be immolated."</p>
                     <p>"Young woman," continued ſhe, removing herſelf a little from me, "you muſt be willing to conſider this matter. The confeſſion which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of you is indiſpenſable."</p>
                     <p>"Do you then inſiſt upon it, Madame? Well, give me three days longer."</p>
                     <p>"What! three days longer!" cried the young man, who was liſtening in the moſt painful <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>"Yes," replied I, "three days; and if I do

not, at that time, tell you who I am, I promiſe, at leaſt, to go away, but with the moſt lively regret, from the houſe where my preſence occaſions ſo much unhappineſs."</p>
                     <p>"O, Juliette," replied Madame Florival, "what an alternative is this! Do you think it will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to me whether you ſtay with us or not? And look at my brother!"</p>
                     <p>"Take pity on my deſpair!" interrupted he.</p>
                     <p>"Your deſpair, Dolerval, increaſes my own. I muſt be inflexible in my determination. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave you, I beg of you to grant me one favour."</p>
                     <p>"Mention it," replied he, "mention it; my life, Juliette, is ſtill in your power."</p>
                     <p>"The more horrible thoſe letters are, the more neceſſary it is that I ſhould remain in poſſeſſion of them. Pray be ſo kind as to leave them with me, and let me diſpoſe of them as I think moſt proper."</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid he, "what a dreadful preſent! Juliette, are you determined to leave us? Will you be ſo hard hearted and cruel, as to leave us while we are tormented with ſuch frightful ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions—?"</p>
                     <p>"I cannot avoid it; they muſt remain with you; but, one day, Dolerval, it will be proved, that <hi>calumniated innocence will appear more intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than before.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, my ſiſter, I retired. I have ſomewhat leſſened my ſorrows by depoſiting them in your boſom. And now I am going to deliver thoſe letters, the monuments of Varmont's new <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>THE horrors of my deſtiny, I truſt, are at length completed. Attend, my ſiſter, and hear a relation of the moſt calamitous events.</p>
                     <p>Nearly ſix hours ago, when, by reaſon of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching darkneſs, objects were not clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, I was in my apartment, where I enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the privilege of ſighing alone.

minutes with him in private converſation. As I trembled with fear leſt they ſhould ſee him in my chamber, and thinking it would ſerve to increaſe the jealouſy of his wife, I told him it was more convenient to go into the garden. According to my deſire, we went thither: and as ſoon as we were there, he addreſſed me as follows:</p>
                     <p>"Your brother, I am convinced, is one of the moſt accompliſhed villains. There is no doubt but it was he who ſet fire to the Centaure himſelf, or that it was done by his orders."</p>
                     <p>Upon this, I endeavoured to make him believe that Varmont was incapable of ſuch villainy.</p>
                     <p>"No, no," ſaid Bovile, "your generoſity ſhall deceive me no longer. The truth ſhines clearly into my eyes, and I am certain it is equally viſible to yours. And I tremble, my dear Emilia, leſt it may enlighten others alſo. This morning, in your grief and confuſion, you ſaid too much upon the ſubject. My wife is now reflecting upon what you ſaid, conjecturing, and uniting a number of promiſcuous circumſtances, and comparing them with your irreproachable conduct and equivocal anſwers. She derives from your confeſſions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though obſcure, ſome inferences, which, together with Varmont's letter, may probably aſſiſt her to unfold the frightful myſtery of your misfortunes. But a few minutes ago, as ſhe was walking pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively about the room, ſhe ſtopped ſhort and ſaid, "<hi>Her mother ſold her—A generous man bought her—To Breſt this generous man conducted her —It ſeems that ſhe fell into the ſea.</hi>" And the unfortunate woman, immediately afterwards, aſked <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

fear the dreadful diſcovery is at hand! Let us double our caution to avoid it for a longer period."</p>
                     <p>"Hold!" ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>"Why?" anſwered he.</p>
                     <p>"Don't you ſee the young man behind us— Dolerval, who is coming after us—who liſtens and watches every motion?"</p>
                     <p>"One word only," replied he with a low voice, "let us walk ſeveral minutes longer, ſo as to have no appearance of affectation. Afterwards, retire to your chamber and ſhut the door, and if Madame Florival knocks, do not open it. About midnight I ſhall come to take you away. I will conduct you, too unfortunate Emilia, to the ſolitude of the cloiſter, from which ſolitude I releaſed you but to make you more wretched."</p>
                     <p>"Peace, then!" ſaid I, "he draws near."</p>
                     <p>"Well! let us change our converſation," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Bovile.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, let us ſpeak of the apprehenſions I have from Murville; even in preſence of Dolerval I can ſpeak of his brother without any danger or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience."</p>
                     <p>The young man then drew near, but, as uſual, without offering a word. He only walked at my ſide and kept pace with us, as I have told you he has frequently done before. Without ſpeaking to him, or even looking at him, I continued with that natural tone of voice we make uſe of when we are not afraid to permit another perſon to hear the whole converſation. Addreſſing myſelf to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, I ſaid:</p>
                     <p>"Murville, I fear, is contriving ſome wicked ſcheme againſt me, and I cannot but feel ala<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> for my ſafety."</p>
                     <p>"Don't fear him," anſwered the friend of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035743_0278_1006B25AA6FEA2B0"/>
"thoſe vile ſeducers who are ſo dangerous, are courageous with women only; againſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors they cannot boaſt of being courageous and powerful! Whilſt one drop of blood flows in my veins, you ſhall have nothing to fear from your moſt deſpicable enemies; for the very countenance of a brave man will make them turn pale!"</p>
                     <p>When he had done ſpeaking this we were at the extremity of the ſhaded alley, near a ſmall gate, which ſhuts on that ſide of the garden next the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burb. Almoſt at the moment when Bovile turned around at the end of this alley, thinking we might ſafely return to the houſe, the young man, led by a ſtrange impulſe of folly, ſeized me in his arms, and carried me off as ſwiftly as the lightning. At the ſame moment, the gate, ſeemingly, opened of itſelf, and was ſuddenly ſhut; by which means I was ſeparated from my defender in leſs time than I can write you an account of it. And, whilſt Bovile was probably in amazement at my ſudden diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and by being ſhut in the garden could not relieve me, I was put in a poſt-chaiſe, which muſt have been in readineſs for this purpoſe, and the young man placed himſelf by my ſide, while the poſtillion urged the horſes to ſuch a degree that we ſeemed to fly.</p>
                     <p>Until the moment when the carriage ſtarted with me, I experienced more aſtoniſhment than fear. "Unhappy Dolerval!" ſaid I, "what do you mean? To what a ſtrange degree does your paſſion miſlead you! It is a friend whom you ſo much abuſe! It is from the houſe of your Eleanor you are carrying her, whom your ever-reſpectful <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>ting helpleſs women?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="unknown:035743_0279_1006B266F7E9EF30"/>To this, he gave no anſwer, but kept a deaf ear and diſdainful look. Then was I agitated by real fear. I loaded the young man with queſtions and reproaches, but he obſtinately kept ſilence. Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſions now troubled my ſpirits—cries of terror eſcaped me. Then, with one hand, he covered my mouth, and, with the other, treated me with inſolent behaviour. Enraged, I reſiſted him with all my ſtrength; but, at this time, the cruel ſtruggle was interrupted by a combat, ſtill more cruel. We heard the report of a piſtol, the poſtillion fell, and called out, "Help!" It was now too late: for a man was at the carriage door. A ſecond piſtol was fired; by the light which the exploſion produced, I perceived that the aſſaſſin was in a maſk; that he who had inſulted me, and now protected me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was Murville. Murville ſhielded me with his body, and received the ſhot which was aimed at me.</p>
                     <p>"Whoever you are," ſaid he, "take my purſe and my life, but have ſome reſpect for ſo much beauty."</p>
                     <p>He then ſearched haſtily for his arms, which he could not find; and as he received the third ſhot, which, to appearance, did not touch him, he ſprang out of the carriage, ſeized his enemy by his throat and threw him down, fell himſelf and rolled with him in the duſt. "Bring my piſtols!" cried he continually, "my piſtols! they were put under the ſeat in the bottom of the carriage!"</p>
                     <p>At this moment of horror, Celina, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with unuſual ſtrength and courage. With all poſſible haſte I ſtepped out of the carriage, and thought within myſelf, perhaps the hand of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may diſpatch a highwayman. Imagine, however, what terror ſucceeded this moment of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035743_0280_1006B26F35EA8550"/>
courage. At that inſtant, I was able to diſcern, not far from the combatants, a man, who ſtood in the attitude of grief and aſtoniſhment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained an unactive ſpectator of this fearful ſtruggle. As ſoon as he ſaw me, he drew near, and looking upon me attentively, he ſaid:</p>
                     <p>"What! Mademoiſelle, is it you? Permit me," ſaid he, ſnatching the piſtols out of my hand, "permit him who ſaved your life in this very wood, to avenge you. It belongs to me to be revenged of him for the crimes he has forced me to commit. It belongs to me to puniſh him."</p>
                     <p>By this diſcourſe you will know it was Lafleur, as certainly as I recognized him by his voice; and, conſequently, will not need to be told who the ſavage is, againſt whom Murville ſuſtains an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal combat.</p>
                     <p>The raging domeſtic then fired upon his maſter, but with a feeble, ill-directed, and trembling hand: no ſooner had he done this, than he ſtaggered and fell down, making ſtrange diſtortions. He muſt, however, have wounded his mad accomplice; for he made a dreadful noiſe, and ſeemed to be in great anguiſh. But he was not in the leaſt diſheartened, and, as his wound increaſed his fury, ſo it increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtrength; for he was now enabled to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf from Murville, and ran towards me with his drawn ſword in his hand. Come, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian! thought I, I will not attempt to take up thoſe arms which thy accomplice could not make uſe of to deſtroy thee; for I had a thouſand times rather receive death from thy hands, than give it thee my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But my final hour had not yet come. Murville, animated by a ſenſe of my imminent danger, ran between us: "Poor girl!" ſaid he, "what have
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035743_0281_1006B271CEF0CC70"/>
I done! you are the one whom they moſt wiſh to deſtroy." Unhappy man! he both pitied and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected me at the ſame time! He parried off ſeveral ſtrokes of the ſword by his arm, but through wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, I expected every moment he would fall, and then nothing could prevent his aſſaſſin from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruing his hands in the blood of his ſiſter. But heaven, in mercy, would, in ſuch caſe, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from feeling the pangs of aſſaſſination: for all my limbs trembled with horror, my ſtrength forſook me, and, without any ſenſe of my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I fell down under the wheels of the carriage.</p>
                     <p>When I recovered my ſenſes I beheld—objects of terror! Alas! why was I called back to life? But, Celina, permit me to leave you; permit me to return to the pillow of a dying man!</p>

But, O that we could place her as far, and as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, from the power of grief, as we have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured her from the attempts of a monſter!</p>
                     <p>Dolerval, as I ſuppoſed, ran away with Emilia, whom he ſnatched from me in the garden. Upon this, I flew to the houſe, and found, to my aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that he was ſeated by his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>"O what a prodigy!" ſaid I; "yonder I ſaw you run away with Juliette, and behold you are here!"</p>
                     <p>"Heavens!" exclaimed Dolerval, "it muſt have been my brother. Haſte! let's purſue him!"</p>
                     <p>With all poſſible haſte we ſaddled our horſes; I took my arms, ſo as to be provided againſt the worſt, and the domeſtics were ordered to follow us: but Dolerval and I went full ſpeed, before all the reſt, on the way which was taken by Murville.</p>
                     <p>In a wood, at leaſt half a league from Tours, we ſaw a carriage ſtanding in the midſt of the road. A woman lay by it in a ſwoon, near whom were two men in a violent conteſt. One of them had a ſword, but the other was without arms. "To me direct your ſtrokes," ſaid the brave unarmed young man, who was ſmitten by his enemy and would not retreat.</p>
                     <p>"He is killing Murville!" cried Dolerval. And in a moment we came up with them, and he whom I ſuppoſed to be a highwayman, fell by the ſtrokes of my ſword. Murville, through loſs of blood, was unable to ſupport himſelf a moment after the danger was over. We took him and bound up his wounds as well as the ſmall remains of light would permit. When we had taken care of him, we took Juliette, who had not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her ſenſes, and put her into the carriage. Bitter groans were then heard all around us; and

one cried out, "I feel within me a raging fire, let ſomebody help me, and I will tell you the whole."</p>
                     <p>We ſearched around after him, and I touched a man with my foot, who was rolling in the duſt, and appeared to be in dreadful convulſions. He attempted to ſpeak, but a ſtronger fit ſeized him, ſo that he could make no articulate ſounds. A little farther, Dolerval found a man in the agonies of death, who proved to be the poſtillion of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. And, on the other hand, we heard groans, imprecations and blaſphemies, which gave me to underſtand that the highwayman I had vanquiſhed was not ready to expire. Our ſituation amongſt ſo many perſons dangerouſly wounded, became every moment more and more embarraſſing. At this time I ſaw a number of perſons coming with torches, and made no doubt but they were fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately coming to our aſſiſtance. Theſe perſons who were coming proved to be our domeſtics; but they came not alone. They eſcorted a carriage which conveyed to us—alas! my wife herſelf! Being afraid, that after having joined Murville, we might not be able to perſuade him to relinquiſh his prey, and fearing there would, in conſequence of his refuſal, ariſe a fatal ſtrife between her brothers and huſband, ſhe came hither with an intention of trying her perſuaſions upon Murville, which ſhe apparently thought would have more influence than ours. Oh, hapleſs woman! of what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene will thy ill fate ſoon render thee both witneſs and actreſs! What fatal explanations thou art ſoon to receive!</p>
                     <p>Murville was the firſt who recovered the uſe of his ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>"In the firſt place," ſaid he, in a feeble voice,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035743_0284_1006B28671072D90"/>
"relieve my doubts. Take the maſk from the face of this robber."</p>
                     <p>He was ſoon obeyed, and in the features of this ruffian I recognized thoſe of a man whom I view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with horror.</p>
                     <p>"Cruel Varmont!" continued Murville, "you were going to ſacrifice me for the ſake of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! and not only ſo, but you alſo intended to ſacrifice your miſtreſs!"</p>
                     <p>"His miſtreſs!" cried the man who had ſpoken before; "no, no, his ſiſter!"</p>
                     <p>"His ſiſter!" repeated Murville, with terror and amazement; "his ſiſter! O matchleſs infamy! All is now explained. This is not the firſt time he has attempted to deſtroy her! And yet I have been the friend and companion of this monſter! Great God! juſt and merciful God! thou haſt not unjuſtly nor ſufficiently puniſhed me!"</p>
                     <p>"His ſiſter!" exclaimed Eleanor with ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes; "Myſterious heaven! If this is the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Juliette, whoſe wife then am I?"</p>
                     <p>"His ſiſter!" cried Dolerval in deſpair; "She is torn from me forever! She is not at liberty! His ſiſter! O Bovile, unfortunate Bovile, you have then forever loſt mine!"</p>
                     <p>"Are you Bovile?" ſaid the elder brother of Madame Florival: "What! is that generous, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and reſpectable woman, whom I have ſo much offended; whoſe misfortunes I have ſo cruelly aggravated, and whoſe virtues I have inſulted—is ſhe yours? Is this your wife?"</p>
                     <p>"No," anſwered Emilia, who had juſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her reaſon, "no;" pointing to Madame Florival, "ſhe is his wife."</p>
                     <p>"How!" reſumed Murville; "O yes! my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035743_0285_1006B2882B87C4B0"/>
—was free, indeed. Bovile, who believed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a widower, and whom we believed was dead, is yet alive! Yes, I remember what Dolerval— O now I underſtand; M. Bovile is found to be the huſband of two wives."</p>
                     <p>He then reached forth his hand to Madame Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, viewed her with an air of compaſſion, and mingled his tears with hers.</p>
                     <p>We could not too haſtily quit this horrible ſcene. Murville propoſed that we ſhould put him in his own poſt-chaiſe; that Lafleur ſhould be put in with him, and that ſome perſon ſhould ſtay with Varmont, and watch him until we could return and fetch him. But Emilia, with her wonted ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, oppoſed it, and would not permit her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable brother to be thus deſerted. She deſired, or rather commanded (for her deſires, more than ever before, had now acquired the force of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands); ſhe deſired that Murville and Lafleur ſhould be placed in the back part of the berlin, while ſhe, with Madame Florival, ſhould occupy the fore-ſeat. By theſe means, her two perſecutors might have the conſoling, though painful ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of renewing to her the aſſurances of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. By theſe means, my two unfortunate wives might ſit together, embrace each other, and, perhaps, by confounding their ſorrows, might ſoften them and diminiſh their force. By theſe means alſo, the execrable aſſaſſin of her whom we all hold dear, embrued with the blood ſhed by his cruel hand, was caſt alone into the poſt-chaiſe, where his powerleſs rage breathed nothing but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations.</p>
                     <p>As to the poſtillion of Murville, I ordered his body to be placed upon a horſe. Dolerval and I upon our horſes, kept near the door of the berlin,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035743_0286_1006B28DEF649568"/>
by which means we often heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to our grief, the ſighs of the deareſt objects of our affection. Being thus prepared, we ſet off with a ſlow pace, and, with our whole melancholy train, came back to the city.</p>
                     <p>We had ſent a man forward to go after ſeveral ſurgeons, and when we came home we found them waiting for us. Murville's wounds were examined in the firſt place. Take courage; this brave youth, ſo noble and generous-hearted, even in his erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and licentious career, corrected by an awful warning and dreadful ſtroke of fortune, will, I truſt, be preſerved for an example of complete amendment to his equals in age and libertine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The ball only glanced upon his breaſt, and left but a ſlight contuſion; and, in the unequal ſtruggle againſt his well armed enemy, he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ſo much dexterity, that he received no wounds except upon his arm. And I am happy to inform you that none of his wounds are either dangerous or mortal.</p>
                     <p>But why is capricious fortune equally favourable to the infamous Varmont? The piſtol ſhot which he received from his own valet, did, as it were, but glance upon his ſhoulder; and, although I brought him to the ground by ſeveral ſtrokes and thruſts of my ſword, not one of them is thought to be mortal. The pains which Murville now feels, deprive him of reſt; but Varmont has already fallen aſleep! I tremble for fear he may be reſtored, to continue the ſcourge and diſgrace of human nature. Should it be ſo, I ſhall repent that I did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my part more effectually.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, the miſerable Lafleur, much enlightened by the queſtions we were obliged to aſk him, and ſtill more by the grievous pains he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035743_0287_1006B28F8847B870"/>
ſoon conjectured what the phyſician told us in a low voice, and cried out, "I am certainly poiſoned, there is no doubt of it." And, at length, when he found there was no relief for him in the remedies preſcribed, and his convulſions becoming more frequent and ſtrong, he deſired Emilia, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerval and myſelf, to draw near his bed, and hear his laſt confeſſions. And what follows is nearly all he told us with which you are unacquainted: I ſhall not, however, undertake to relate it exactly in the ſame ruſticity in which it was delivered.</p>
                     <p>"When I brought the boat to my maſter at Breſt, I was ignorant of what he intended to do on board the Centaure. But after the crime was committed, he confeſſed it to me, but proteſted that if I betrayed him, he would acknowledge the fact, and, at the ſame time, declare that I was his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice, and would perſiſt in the declaration till the laſt moment. Soon afterwards he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his victim was alive, and charged me to go and perform, what he called, our operation. Out of fear, leſt the former crime ſhould be diſcovered, and leſt Varmont ſhould conduct me to the wheel along with himſelf, by declaring me his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, I was reſolved to do it. But I was not hardy enough for ſuch an exploit; yet I made my maſter believe I had well performed his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Varmont, as I believed, had already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined my ruin, but retained me in his ſervice; and I, poor wretch, remained in it, becauſe his threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of purſuing me, in caſe of my leaving him, affrightened me: but, I confeſs, my greateſt reaſons for ſtaying with him, was the hope of obtaining the money he had promiſed me. He continued to amuſe me with fair promiſes until he might find a favourable opportunity of putting me out of the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035743_0288_1006B29967C5BB70"/>
way. At length, about the firſt of this month, he told me that M. Murville had inſulted him, and refuſed to give him ſatisfaction, and that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give him a challenge. 'I cannot do it at Breſt,' continued he, 'becauſe he has too many friends there; but go there yourſelf, my dear La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur, and as ſoon as he ſhall be ſo unfortunate as to leave that city, follow him every where he goes, and do not fail to write me, and let me know where he makes any ſtay.' Fool that I was! this was the ſnare in which I was caught myſelf! After receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my firſt letter, my maſter came with all ſpeed into the neighbourhood of Tours, in which city Murville had been concealed during four days. How it happened I cannot tell, but yeſterday was my unlucky day. Early in the morning I gave Varmont an account of what Murville's poſtillion, with whom I had juſt been drinking, had told me; which was, that his maſter expected this very evening to return to his farm, with a little comrade. 'We muſt lie in wait for him on his paſſage,' cried he, with great ſatisfaction. And, in fact, directly after it was noon we went to keep centinel, you know where; and, when it was almoſt dark night, we heard the noiſe of a poſt-chaiſe, and I thought I heard the voice of James, who was hurrying his horſes. 'Well!' ſaid my raſcally maſter; 'but, my dear Lafleur,' added he, taking a vial of brandy out of his pocket, which he knows I love to a rage, 'you muſt firſt take a drink. Take courage, for, perhaps, I ſhall want your aſſiſtance.' I ſwallowed it with diſpatch, but did not tell him till afterwards—'M. de Varmont, I have no arms.' 'That's juſt as it ſhould be, poltroon!' anſwered he with irony and brutality. 'Have you deceived me then, you beggarly raſcal? Very well! ſtand ſtill
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035743_0289_1006B29FD64D59C0"/>
at preſent, and ſee me do it myſelf, and if you ſtir one ſtep, I'll blow your brains out.' Then he made haſte and got into the road, and as ſoon as he knew it was the livery ſervant of Murville, he ran up to poor James, clapt the piſtol almoſt to his breaſt, and ſhot him dead. You know all the reſt."</p>
                     <p>This confeſſion, Celina, which was frequently interrupted by the ſufferings of the wretch who made it, we could not collect from him in leſs than an hour. At length he aſked pardon of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, who was moved with pity and terror, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times over. He alſo deſired her bleſſing; and, ſoon after he had obtained it, happy in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching termination of his miſeries, he breathed his laſt.</p>
                     <p>But how ſhall I deſcribe the admirable conduct of your ſiſter, through the whole courſe of this long and diſmal night! Behold our Emilia, anxious about the continual lethargy of her brother, not leaving us a moment but for the purpoſe of acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with a part of her late misfortunes; running to the pillow of Varmont, whom ſhe yet calls her brother, but who does not hear her; running alſo to that of Murville, who is both comforted and ſurpriſed at her unmerited kindneſs; ſtriving to give courage to Dolerval, who is abandoned to deſpair; fortifying my mind againſt our hard fortune; unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her tears with thoſe of Madame Florival; and ſighing, alas! on the death-bed of Lafleur!</p>
                     <p>But, imagine on the other hand, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſevere misfortunes, how great muſt be the triumph of her long-perſecuted virtues, and her late acknowledged innocence. Repreſent to your imagination, my dear Eleanor, who, perhaps, is leſs afflicted with her own trials and ſorrows than
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035743_0290_1006B2AA5CC92FB8"/>
thoſe of her friend; and Dolerval, bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching himſelf for the unjuſt jealouſy he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, for the cruel and injurious ſuſpicions he was tempted to conceive againſt Emilia; whilſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, continually becoming more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his errors, more and more repenting his paſt conduct, and more and more grieved to think he has not merited the eſteem of this adorable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! "Yes, Dolerval," cries he, "your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were juſt; ſhe is, as you ſaid, <hi>deſerving univerſal homage!</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Endeavour to imagine, Celina, how much I am enchanted, and how deſperately my feelings muſt be excited, while I behold theſe two women, who, if not equally beloved, are at leaſt equally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Strive to form an idea of the alternative horrors and charms which the different pictures around me preſent to my view!</p>

                     <p>To day, till the clock ſtruck twelve at noon, ſhe ſtayed with him, ſitting conſtantly on the ſide of his bed, waiting, with impatience, the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the oppreſſive ſleep which ſtill held dominion over him. At this time, he awoke, and caſting his eyes fiercely upon his ſiſter, he knew her, and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035743_0291_1006B2ABF02E6960"/>
ſprang furiouſly towards her. She ſcreamed aloud with terror, and fled from him; and, as ſhe was fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I haſtily ſtepped between them and ſtopped him. This was a ſeaſonable movement, for had I waited a ſecond longer, he would have caught her, and then it would have been all over with Emilia! In the mean time he was affected with a burning fever, which gave him prodigious ſtrength; ſo that if every one in the room had not come to my aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he would have overpowered me. The blood-thirſty ſavage then turned all his rage againſt himſelf. He rolled upon the floor, tore himſelf, and rent to pieces the bandages which covered his wounds. At firſt they tried to prevent him. "No," ſaid I, "leave him to accompliſh his own fate; he had much better die here than at the place of public execution. Have not his crimes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſtreſſed his family?

No, let him alone. Let the infamous monſter himſelf execute the decree of his vindictive fate. There is none but Varmont who can ſuitably inflict the puniſhment merited by his crimes."</p>
                     <p>Out of reſpect to you, Celina, I will not relate the horrid imprecations which his impure mouth has uttered. Nor will I afflict you with a recital of thoſe continual dreams in which he ſeemed to be ſurrounded by the moſt frightful ſpectres. Nor will I deſcribe to you the fearful delirium in which he

                     <p>AFTER ſo many fatal eclairciſſements, and after the unhappy rumour of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had been ſpread abroad, it was neceſſary, my ſiſter, that Bovile and Dolerval ſhould not remain more than twenty-four hours at the place where they could hear the ſighs of the unfortunate Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and diſconſolate Emilia. They departed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about three days ago; they are going to follow the ſeas, in order to leſſen their ſorrows and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their hope.

A reign of iron and duſt diſhonors the people whom it oppreſſes, and begins to weary its aſtoniſhing patience. In the mean time, the enemies of our nation, actuated by a ſpirit of inconceivable giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſtead of lightening the yoke, daily continue to render it more burdenſome. Soon muſt this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion come to an end; ſoon muſt my country be ruined, or undergo a complete regeneration. Alas! I cannot but hope and pray that the great Arbiter of the univerſe, who governs and decides the fate of kingdoms and empires, may ſupport France through the horrors and convulſions of that awful criſis, which alone, after ſome moments of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, can reſtore the luſtre of her former youth with a vigor thenceforth unalterable, and raiſe her again to the higheſt rank amongſt nations. Then ſhall we behold the ſudden fall of many prejudices, as ancient and deſpicable as the ignorance and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition which gave them birth. Then," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, preſſing my hand in his own, "your dear Celina will no longer groan in her wretched confinement: for the cloiſters, opened or raſed to their foundations, will let their victims eſcape: then the poor and unfortunate M. Sevin, who is now ſo wretched, may find ſome conſolation on earth: for celibacy, not ſatisfied with filling the convents, but extending even to the clergy, will no longer embrace whole generations. Then," continued he, addreſſing himſelf to Madame Florival, "we ſhall no longer hear our tribunals ring with thoſe demands in caſe of a ſeparation, which muſt be followed with ſuch great ſcandal, and obtained by
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035743_0294_1006B2B8B766FBC0"/>
the price of ſo much diſgrace; which is attended with the unhappy conſequence of condemning young married people, who may be ſeparated, but not diſunited, to drag themſelves along, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, even to the grave, between the evils of celibacy and the crimes of adultery. Then thoſe unions, ſo improperly termed unions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, might be eaſily done away; thoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, ſo ſuddenly contracted by deluded young people, who, not being mutually informed of what fortune each other is poſſeſſed, believed themſelves ſufficiently acquainted, and often, upon better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, deteſt themſelves and one another. Then ſhall we behold many others, not leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, deſirous of becoming huſbands and fathers of families, who are diſcouraged by the examples of preſent marriages, are afraid to take a wife who muſt eternally be theirs, and, ſooner or later, are found guilty of ſeducing the wives of other men. How many laws are wanting in this vaſt empire, to inſure a ſudden reformation in its manners; laws, which, to millions of individuals, would be the end of their misfortunes or beginning of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! One only, the law of Divorce; a law, which, in its effect, would infallibly prevent the neceſſity of having recourſe to it. This would impoſe on every married perſon, an obligation of continually practiſing thoſe mutual kindneſſes, thoſe delicate attentions, and thoſe tender cares, which might daily increaſe their affections. As ſoon as this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent law ſhall be proclaimed, a thouſand mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried perſons will break their chains, which were formed under the yoke of indiſſolubility; their chains continually bedewed with tears: and, under the moſt favourable auſpices, a thouſand lovers
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035743_0295_1006B2C0764FA7F0"/>
will form the deſired union. Dolerval will then obtain the woman he loves, and Bovile, the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Bovile, will again find his Eleanor."</p>
                     <p>Such were his laſt words and ſentiments at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which our tender credulity could eaſily confide, and which Eleanor recollects with the greateſt delight.</p>
                     <p>However, this hope, ſo far removed beyond our preſent reach, is not ſufficient to ſupport my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent friend under her ſorrows: alas! and could I ſay it if the unfortunate woman did not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſay it herſelf, againſt her remorſe! Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all I can ſay or do, ſhe often falls into a deep melancholy, which, I fear, may, in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, prove as dangerous to her as her tender offspring, on whoſe conception ſhe often reflects with unavailing regret.</p>
                     <p>And O that the ſpectacle of her affliction were the only one which tortures my imagination! But another, not leſs painful to endure, although it has but once afflicted my ſight, unceaſingly torments me with its cruel remembrance.

Notwithſtanding the injuries we have received from Madame de Varmont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot but lament her untimely death: and as ſhe was our mother, we ought to mourn for her. I believe, with you, that the news of her ſon's crimes, and his conſequent tragical end, too ſoon ſpread abroad by the voice of the public, have haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened her to the grave. How great muſt have been her ſufferings in her laſt moments! O my God! God of all juſtice and goodneſs! have not her ſufferings atoned for her crimes? Freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don her, O moſt merciful Father! as I pardon her myſelf.</p>
                     <p>You tell me, my ſiſter, that nothing can hinder me any longer from retiring to your ſolitude, there to receive and beſtow the conſolations which to us are mutually neceſſary. Permit me, however, to delay. Madame Florival will need my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. She expects me to attend her to a certain village, whither ſhe is going to conceal her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her acquaintance, and ſtay till the time of her delivery. After this, ſhe authorizes me to promiſe for her, as well as myſelf, to go and take refuge in your convent. M. Murville has reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of his wounds, and is now at Breſt. But he has given his ſiſter encouragement to expect he will accompany her to Paris whenever ſhe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to eſtabliſh herſelf there, with my ſiſter and me. In conſequence of this, I have taken all my arrangements accordingly: for I know you too well to ſuppoſe you will require me to abandon my friend when ſhe will moſt require my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                     <p>As to one particular cauſe or ſubject of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which you accuſe me of wiſhing to hide from you, I am now ready to reveal it. In the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035743_0297_1006B2C86ACAA6A0"/>
firſt moments of our agitation, on parting with Bovile and Dolerval, almoſt every circumſtance of it was out of my mind; but ſince that time, by a ſtrange and inevitable propenſity, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employs my thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Our brother, my dear Celina, in a fit, during his ardent fever, attempted to deſtroy me; and, in the anguiſh of his delirium, he ſtrove in vain to deſtroy himſelf. I found there was no relief for him except in the tender mercies of God. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the all-powerful conſolations of religion would, diſſipate the fearful alienation of his mind. After it was noon, I had repeatedly required a confeſſor, who had not arrived. At length, when the fury of the poor mortal was ſo great that every perſon in the room was employed to reſtrain him, I ran out myſelf. In the city of Tours, where I was totally unacquainted, I could not go to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for a prieſt; but I went to the neighbouring village, fully perſuaded that the curate of St. Cyr would not refuſe his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>I a ſhort time I arrived at the parſonage. Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the old domeſtic of Madame Florival, opened the door, and, with ſurprize in his countenance, aſked me what I wanted.</p>
                     <p>"To ſpeak with M. Sevin," anſwered I.</p>
                     <p>"With M. Sevin, Mademoiſelle!"</p>
                     <p>"Why, yes."</p>
                     <p>"With M. Sevin! is the young lady ſure of it?"</p>
                     <p>"What a queſtion is this!" replied I: and, puſhing him away in a gentle manner, I went in.</p>
                     <p>"Very well, young lady," ſaid he, "I am not made to employ my ſtrength againſt you: look in the garden."</p>
                     <p>Upon this I ran thither. "M. Sevin," ſaid I, "come quick!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:035743_0298_1006B2CFF5E4D830"/>"Poh!" cried he; "is it ſhe who is there?"</p>
                     <p>"Of whom do you ſpeak?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! but it ſeems to be her! Ah! of whom ſhould I ſpeak?"</p>
                     <p>"But we do not underſtand one another! I pray you to go and viſit a ſick perſon, in order to perform your laſt duties to him."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! is that all," replied he, and turned around to go back again.</p>
                     <p>"But it is one of my relations who is in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate."</p>
                     <p>"What, then! this is no urgent matter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides," ſaid he, "why do you come to entertain me with death? let's talk of nothing but marriage."</p>
                     <p>"But my —"</p>
                     <p>"I cannot, fair lady," interrupted he. "She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come but while I am without! imagine—."</p>
                     <p>"But, my uncle!—"</p>
                     <p>Hearing this, he turned round; and the air with which he viewed me confirmed me in a melancholy truth, which, in the fluttering ſtate of my mind, I did not perceive before. "Yes," ſaid he, with much ſoftneſs of expreſſion, "it was by this title ſhe once called me! Do you know her then?"</p>
                     <p>"My dear uncle!" At firſt, in an impulſe of compaſſion and ſurprize, I attempted to take him by the hand.</p>
                     <p>"Don't touch my hand," cried he, drawing back: "don't touch my—. She kiſſed my hand! And hold: there is the place" (pointing to his hand). "O ſweet and beloved girl! It was in this place ſhe dropt a tear—My lips immediately collected it; and I felt it even to my heart. Take care! you are going to ſtep upon this honeyſuckle! I had rather any one ſhould walk upon my body. It was ſhe who propped it! Beſides, I take great

care of it myſelf. The others withſtand the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very well; but this muſt be exceedingly tender; and, to keep it in better ſafety, I have covered it with ſtraw.—Come this way: the flowers which you ſee here I have put in this ſort of green-houſe; becauſe I muſt keep them to the end of my life. Only conſider, it was ſhe who has ſprinkled them with water an hundred times. Don't you think, when ſhe returns, that ſhe will be pleaſed to find every thing as it was, and in the beſt ſtate poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?"</p>
                     <p>While he was ſpeaking in this manner, I was far from feeling eaſy, and gradually withdrew from him, and advanced towards the parſonage.</p>
                     <p>"You are removing from this grove," ſaid he, "and you do well. Love in this place is but a terrible god. It was here that an unjuſt jealouſy tore my heart aſunder: here it was that my malady commenced. My God, what a malady! I thought I ſhould have died of it: and, had it not been for Dolerval, I ſhould have died. I took it in my head to believe ſhe loved me better than him. I did not conſider that ſhe could not diſcover her love for me until they ſhould marry the prieſts. It was me ſhe loved, and not Dolerval. This dear friend told me ſo himſelf. How then! he has done better. One day—on that day I was ready to go into the other world: I could neither eat nor ſleep; fooliſh beſides. Always complaining; ſtriking the third and fourth parts<note n="*" place="bottom">Of muſic.</note> to no purpoſe. Well, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, he came—this dear friend. He brought with him, from Paris, a large gentleman,<note n="†" place="bottom">This gentleman, it ſeems probable, was the phyſician Dolerval brought from Paris.</note> of good

countenance and good humor. But a brave man he was! He was not afraid of me! and a learned man. This polite man could ſpeak Latin as well as myſelf. Madame, he was the father of my ſweet miſtreſs. 'Do not be diſcouraged,' ſaid he; 'ſhe loves you; ſhe will come to-morrow! To-morrow they will marry the prieſts!"</p>
                     <p>By this time we had come to the yard, and I haſtened to get to the door. "Go into the houſe, one moment," ſaid he. I endeavoured to get rid of him; but he held me by my arm. Then Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſpoke to me in a low voice, and told me not to reſiſt him, and aſſured me that M. Sevin would not do me the leaſt injury. Upon this, I yielded to his entreaties. No ſooner had we entered the dining room than a great number of birds came fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing around us, and ſeveral of them, as it were in ſtrife, repeated, "Juliette, Juliette!" And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them very diſtinctly ſaid, "come to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row!" "Yes," ſaid my uncle, leaping for joy, "yes! becauſe to-morrow they will marry the prieſts! It is true I expected her to-day," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, pointing to a plate covered with a napkin, "but I am miſtaken. It is to-morrow! becauſe it is to-morrow they will marry the prieſts. Wait for her to come, that you may liſten to her muſic."</p>
                     <p>Saving this, he led me into the next room, and ſeated himſelf by the ſide of the piano, took his baſe-viol, made a ſhort prelude, and endeavoured to perſuade me that a woman was ſinging, and he accompanying her voice with his inſtrument. In a little time his inſtrument fell from his trembling hands, and he liſtened with mute attention. At length he fell upon his knees, "Sweet miſtreſs!" ſaid he, "well beloved! enchanting girl! ſoul of
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035743_0301_1006B2DA5911C920"/>
my life! come! don't delay! come to-morrow; for to-morrow they will marry the prieſts."</p>
                     <p>And I, my ſiſter, a witneſs of his ſenſeleſs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, could not refrain from tears; and could not but make this indiſcrete exclamation, "Poor M. Sevin!"</p>
                     <p>"Do not pity me," anſwered he, "I am the happieſt of men. I have, in this manner, heard her all day long! All night long I ſeemed to ſee her! But to-morrow ſhe will certainly come! To-morrow I ſhall really ſee her, for to-morrow they will marry the prieſts. But go now: you will wait too long; ſhe will not ſing under two long hours. You know that otherwiſe ſhe would hurt her lungs. And if you ſhould die, Juliette! if you ſhould die! the whole world, the world which you captivate, would, at once, come to nothing."</p>
                     <p>At this time we came to the door, and I was extremely ſolicitous of eſcaping this too affecting, and too doleful ſpectacle. "Oh!" ſaid he, "ſince you are acquainted with her, endeavour to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her this evening. Talk with her concerning him who adores her. Tell her, that for her I have preſerved every ſweet remembrance; that it is for her I languiſh; that I wait for her with the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of a lover. Oh! let her come, ſweet miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs! Let her come to-morrow! becauſe, to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is the day when they will marry the prieſts!"</p>
                     <p>How great, my dear Celina, is the frailty of human reaſon! In this poor unfortunate man we may behold a ſtriking picture of its imbecility. This, alas! is the conſequence of my imprudence! What ſtupidity in me to retire to ſuch a place for ſecurity againſt human paſſions! In every place to which I have retired, I have conveyed miſery and diſorder! Wherever I turn my eyes I behold

wretched perſons, and thoſe who have been render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſerable by my influence! Poor M. Sevin!— And the young man! Is he leſs to be pitied? Does he love me any leſs than M. Sevin? Is he not as fatally ſeparated from me? Can I ever become his? Tell me, my ſiſter, is not M. Dolerval as much to be pitied? No, certainly: for he is the object beloved. Heavens! Celina, what have I written? What doleful thoughts poſſeſs me? Almoſt under the eye of a huſband! Almoſt at the grave of a mother! Ah, my ſiſter, how ſad is my condition!</p>

                     <p>JUST heaven! In what an abyſs of gloomineſs and miſery do I find myſelf, and in which I am loſt! A ſudden flaſh of lightning caſts into it a horrible gleam of light, by which I behold, almoſt at my ſide, the daughter whom I buried alive, clad in mourning veſtments; and, ſomewhat farther— but a few ſteps at moſt, I behold a monſter, born of me!—embruing his hands in his younger ſiſter's blood! My eyes, alas! are opened—too late! and are about to be cloſed forever.</p>
                     <p>But you, my daughters, whom I have ſo cruelly immolated; who, ſeemingly, ought to have breathed nothing but hatred againſt me, may learn, perhaps, in the end, that I am deſerving your pity.</p>
                     <p>My barbarous parents, alſo, made a ſacrifice of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035743_0303_1006B2E648663CF0"/>
me. I was ſacrificed with, perhaps, greater inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity at the marriage bed, than you, Celina, at the altars of religion. A paſſion, ardent in its commencement, had inflamed my heart. At this time, they propoſed to me, for a huſband, M. de Varmont. Alas! what did the only pleaſures which nature ſeeks, even in her rude ſimplicity, avail me in my lively adoleſcence; of what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence were the talents, the wounds and victories of a brave man to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was not the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, the moſt brave, nor the moſt renowned that I deſired. The youngeſt and moſt ſprightly were, in my fancy, the moſt amiable; and I had already determined my choice: nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to complete my wiſhes but the conſent of my parents. But to my entreaties they turned a deaf ear. They ſnatched from me the object of my tendereſt affections, and caſt me, like a ſlave, into the arms of this ſtranger. What horror ſeized me when I became capable of underſtanding the duties they had impoſed on me, in their full extent! Thoſe ties with which they had bound me, were indiſſoluble! Even to my grave, without relief or without intermiſſion, muſt I wear my deteſtable chain.</p>
                     <p>Deſpair took poſſeſſion of my ſoul, a ſoul as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous in its hatred as its love. Attend, my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and bluſh at my deep diſgrace; tremble to reflect on the extreme misfortune which extorts the confeſſion from me. My ever-oppreſſed ſex has but one mean of obtaining revenge, and that is ſpeedy, eaſy and infallible. Without delay, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to employ it. Poor Emilia! let her be leſs ſurpriſed at the cruelty of her brother. She and her cruel aſſaſſin had not the ſame father. This barbarous youth was not the ſon of M. de

Varmont. He was neither the child of love nor marriage; but the fruit of a premeditated criminal intrigue.</p>
                     <p>This was not all. I did not commit this crime to hide it from my huſband: for I expected he would diſown and forſake me when the child of my infidelity was brought to the light. This was what I deſired and intended. But, to my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and grief, it happened quite otherwiſe: from my ſtoic of a huſband I obtained nothing but the perſecutions of tyrannical jealouſy. This pretended hero was ſo weak as to perſecute me with his odious love, notwithſtanding my delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate infidelity, and though I took pride in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *. Pardon me, O my daughters! for I deteſted you becauſe I knew you to be his children!</p>
                     <p>Towards my ſon, I preſerved a continual and fatal partiality, and brought him up in the hatred of his ſiſters. He was taught to view the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his ſuppoſed father in the light of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome co-heirs of a large fortune; intruders who were born to deprive him hereafter of a great part of thoſe immenſe riches, which ought to be reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his mother, as an only and ſmall indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the miſeries ſhe endured for his ſake. How well did the hard-hearted youth improve his wicked inſtructions! What a dreadful price he has paid me for the unnatural leſſons I gave him!</p>
                     <p>Although an unfaithful and incomplete recital of his crimes may have, in ſome meaſure, extenuated their horrors, yet it has frozen my heart with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and his cruel ſpirit poſſeſſes me! His ſoul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the cries of nature and kindred blood, has taken complete poſſeſſion of mine! This cruel ſon, although he is no more, ſtill urges me to the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035743_0305_1006B2F59BFBD950"/>
commiſſion of unnatural deeds. 'Tis the phrenzy of his ſoul by which I am hurried along. By another crime, his mother is about to follow him to that execrable tomb, into which his enormities have thrown him!</p>
                     <p>Adieu, my daughters—your father's piſtols are on the table before me while I am writing this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I have charged them without trembling, and, without trembling, ſhall I make uſe of them. I ſhall not leave the buſineſs of my deſtruction to the pains of a ſlow poiſon, nor apply for aſſiſtance to the feeble ſuccours of art; nor, like a feeble victim, ſtruggle ſeveral hours with death. No, let a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſingle and remedileſs ſtroke, cut ſhort my deſtiny; and let renowned warriors, who are vainly proud of their courage, learn, that even a woman can attain to that ſublime virtue.</p>
                     <p>No one, however, will ſupport me in the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and confuſion of my laſt moments! Not one word of comfort will be addreſſed to me! Nor will one of my children be preſent to cloſe my eyes! Thy children! wretched woman! thou never hadſt but one.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have been a continual cauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, the manner of my death may bring tears from their eyes, and pity from their tender hearts.

                     <p>THE author of <hi>Emilia de Varmont</hi> ſubjoined the following addreſs to his readers, at the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the third volume:—</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>When the National Aſſembly ſhall have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed <hi>the marriage of the Prieſts and Divorce,</hi> it will then be lawful for me to give you, in a ſhort pamphlet, which, if you pleaſe, you may call a ſupplement, the details of a triple marriage, that may, perhaps, be intereſting to the reader: that of Bovile and Eleanor, that of Dolerval and Emilia, that of M. Sevin and —; I will tell you who—I will then tell you what woman, poſſeſſed of ſuch charms as greatly to reſemble his Juliette, has been able to reſtore the good Curate to reaſon and happineſs.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The American publiſher, deſirous of gratifying that curioſity which muſt ariſe in the minds of American youth, after reading the foregoing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, informs them, that as the original author has fallen a ſacrifice to the guillotine, it is doubtful whether the promiſed pamphlet has ever been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. But as all the obſtacles to their union were removed, when the deſired laws were proclaimed, there is no doubt that Bovile and Eleanor, as well as Dolerval and Emilia, have long ſince met, and enjoyed all the endearments of conjugal affection. A gentleman from the city of Tours has informed the publiſher, that the good Curate, with whom he was perſonally acquainted, actually tried the pleaſant ſtate of matrimony ſoon after the law had paſſed the National Aſſembly. Who ſhe was I have not been able to learn. In this particular I
