            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>UNDER the deep impreſſion of that great event which has clad a nation in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you will feel the propriety of my addreſſing you, in the words of David, on the death of the General of the armies of Iſrael, 2d <hi>Samuel,</hi> iii. 38.
<q>A GREAT MAN IS FALLEN.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NEVER could this ſentence be applied with greater juſtice, to any natural deſcendant of our primitive parents, than in the preſent inſtance. Every heart aſſents, whilſt awakened by his death, to melancholy reflection; our thoughts naturally run back to former periods, and retrace the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and extenſive ſervices to his country and to mankind, by which the ſubject of our mourning obtained, and forever ſecured, to himſelf, a juſt claim to greatneſs.</p>
            <p>WE might here, with very little reſerve, adopt the language which our divine Saviour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to John the Baptiſt. <hi>"Among thoſe who are born of women hath not ariſen a greater than" our il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious WASHINGTON.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:039070_0005_10139596AF79AFC0"/>
BUT he is fallen—fallen a victim to death, that laſt enemy, that univerſal deſtroyer of our ſpecies, whoſe ſhafts level, without diſtinction, the great with the little, in the grave. Adored be the GOD of mercy, this laſt enemy ſhall, in the end, be compelled to releaſe his captives, reſtore his prey, and be himſelf completely vanquiſhed, by Him who is higher than the higheſt, and greater than the greateſt of the children of men.</p>
            <p>IN conformity to our text, we will
<list>
                  <item>I. GIVE the general outlines of true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it reſpects the character of man; and then,</item>
                  <item>II. APPLY it to the preſent occaſion, with ſuitable improvement.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>ONE great, wiſe and benevolent deſign is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, in all the works and ways of GOD: this leads us to the knowledge of his character, and to adore him as infinitely good, the fountain of being and of bleſſedneſs. This affords us a ſtandard by which we are to eſtimate every ſubject preſented to our thoughts, whether in the material, animal, or rational world.</p>
            <p>IT is not merely the diffuſive light and warmth of the ſun, the ſalubrity of the air which we breathe, the verdure and fertility of the earth, with the numberleſs ſources of innocent and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous pleaſure, which he has opened to his ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al offspring; but the painful diſcipline of affliction, by which he trains us for an happy immortality,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039070_0006_10139568CD4B59D0"/>
equally evidences the parental goodneſs of GOD, his affection for us, and that the end of all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations is the happineſs of his univerſal family.</p>
            <p>BY this ſtandard we are to eſtimate the value of every ſubject; and the characters of men riſe to greatneſs, or ſink to contempt, in proportion as they are or are not qualified and diſpoſed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the accompliſhment of this great deſign of the benevolent Parent of the univerſe. When we apply this rule to rational and intelligent beings, we take into conſideration what conſtitutes the beauty and moral excellence of every action; it muſt reſult from inclination and choice.</p>
            <p>WE thus aſſign to all nature, and to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, their proper place in our eſtimation. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhades of glory or of greatneſs are, as St. Paul obſerves, annexed to the ſun, the moon and the ſtars; not becauſe they ſhine with different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſplendour; but becauſe they tend, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees, to promote the comfort and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>THE Saviour of the world founds greatneſs on ſervices performed. If any man will be great among you, let him be your ſervant—let him be the ſervant of all. On this he founds his own greatneſs—<hi>I am among you as one who ſerves.</hi> Many qualifications, and many favourable circumſtances, muſt unite in the man who riſes to diſtinguiſhed greatneſs in this way, and by ſuch means as we have mentioned above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:039070_0007_101395983552B220"/>
HE muſt poſſeſs a vigorous, active and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing genius, capable of the moſt extenſive and comprehenſive views, of diſcerning at once what is proper to be done, and the beſt means for effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his purpoſe. This ſuperior genius muſt be connected with a body equally vigorous, and which is capable, not only of ſuſtaining, but of ſeconding, the energies of the mind.—To this muſt be added a form and addreſs, ſuited at once to inſpire reſpect and to conciliate affection.—He muſt poſſeſs an high degree of ſelf government, the control of his paſſions, his words and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that each, in its place, may be made to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his purpoſe. This ſelf government muſt be the effect of exalted piety towards God; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt extenſive good will to men, meaſured and regulated by the different grades of ſocial, civil and domeſtic relation. Theſe are ſome of the qualities which muſt unite in forming the character of the truly great man.</p>
            <p>BUT, in addition to theſe, there muſt be an happy concurrence of circumſtances to call his talents and his virtues into action. Some theatre muſt be opened to him, adapted to his capacity and equal to his views. He muſt be called to act on an extenſive ſtage. The part aſſigned him, in the providence of God, muſt be arduous and difficult; ſuch as might terrify another, but is only ſuited to call into action the ſuperior powers with which he is entruſted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:039070_0008_1013956A52F38448"/>
THE exerciſe of the greateſt talents, with the concurrence of every favourable circumſtance, is not always followed with ſucceſs, which it is not in mortals to inſure. The exertions of the good man, in the cauſe of human happineſs, ought to be acknowledged, though unſucceſsful; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in the end, loſe their reward from Him, whoſe judgments are righteous altogether. But, with men, ſucceſs is wiſdom. In order, therefore, to render a man great in the view of the world, it is neceſſary that the exerciſe of the aſſemblage of virtues, and the improvement of the happy concurrence of circumſtances mentioned above, ſhould be followed with the accompliſhment of ſome purpoſe of extenſive and laſting utility to mankind.</p>
            <p>THIS ſucceſs, inſtead of being attended or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the genera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pride of conqueſt, or an increaſing fondneſs for the wealth, pomp and ſplendour of this world, muſt produce effects di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the contrary, and afford an opportunity for exhibiting an example of diſintereſtedneſs, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and humility, equally extraordinary, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of admiration, as the ſervices performed.</p>
            <p>To give to greatneſs effects ſtill more diſtinct, extenſive and laſting, we muſt ſuppoſe the poſſeſſor to have been equally uſeful, by the exerciſe of the ſame exalted talents in different departments; and that his exertions, ſucceſsful in each, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured new bleſſings on his country and on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and conſequently thrown new rays of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039070_0009_1013959AA78464E0"/>
greatneſs or of glory around the character of our illuſtrious mortal.</p>
            <p>To complete the picture, which we meant to draw, of human greatneſs, to give it all the force and render it as impreſſive as poſſible on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind, we muſt ſuppoſe this diſtinguiſhed char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter is withdrawn from our ſight, at a period when it ſhone with its full ſplendour, ere the ſhades of evening had in any perceptible degree dimmed the luſtre of its rays, or the debilitating influence of years had leſſened our veneration for or expectations from it. In that caſe, whilſt we follow the illuſtrious ſpirit to the realms of light and glory, we are ready to lament for ourſelves and our country in the language of Eliſha, when he beheld the aſcenſion of Elijah, "<hi>My father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof.</hi>"</p>
            <p>SUCH are the requiſites to true greatneſs of character in man. It admits of infinite varieties, indeed, from the lowly cottager, who acts his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle part in obſcurity, confined to the domeſtic cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to him who figures in the view of admiring nations, and is inſtrumental of obtaining the moſt rich and laſting bleſſings for his country, and for mankind.</p>
            <p>How widely different is this from what the world has been uſed to eſtimate as greatneſs, and to diſtinguiſh with its loudeſt applauſe! A wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton triumph over all that is dear and valuable to man, the peace, order, liberty and happineſs of ſociety; a throne to which the aſpiring ſon of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039070_0010_1013956BF4D98698"/>
pride has waded, through rivers of human blood, or climbed over heaps of ſlaughtered fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ſplendour of which is ſupported by the groans and tears of oppreſſed millions. Curſed of the GOD of mercy is ſuch deſtructive great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it well deſerves the fate aſſigned it by the prophet—"<hi>Hell is moved to receive it.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THE character which we have drawn is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to this havoc of lawleſs ambition; it repreſents an earthly god, imitating the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the GOD of heaven, in diffuſing bleſſings on all around him.</p>
            <p>YOU have anticipated me in applying this char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter to the ſubject of our preſent mourning. Such was our country's favourite ſon; and whilſt we behold her, with downcaſt eyes, weeping over the urn which contains his ſacred aſhes, we approve her grief, and ſay, Weep on; never could tears flow for a cauſe more juſt.</p>
            <p>ALL the various qualities and circumſtances mentioned above, are combined in the ſubject of our preſent mournful admiration.</p>
            <p>A MIND capable of the moſt extenſive views; active as light; at once embracing a variety of objects, comparing them, and forming the moſt accurate judgment on the whole; a form and addreſs, adapted at once to pleaſe and command reſpect; a perfect maſtery over his paſſions, calm and collected in the moſt trying ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations; a profound ſenſe of the being, perfection and providence of GOD, and of the neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence

of man upon the great Author of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, for individual and for ſocial happineſs; an highly cultivated ſenſe of moral relations, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and duties reſulting from them; purity of heart and life; an ardent, but rational affection for his country and for mankind, are ſome of the natural, moral and religious qualities, with which he was enriched and adorned, and which rendered him inſtrumental, in the hand of GOD, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the moſt extenſive ſervices, the reſult of which is, the moſt ſolid and laſting greatneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT, enriched as he was with all the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mentioned above, they might have been exerciſed in promoting the intereſt of ſome obſcure village, confined to a family, or waſted like the virtues of the recluſe within the walls of a cloiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had not the providence of GOD ſo diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lot in the world, as to call his talents and virtues into action, on a ſtage ſo extenſive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, as that admiring millions ſhould at once witneſs the extent of his ſervices, and be filled with pleaſing aſtoniſhment at the ſplendour of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>HIS military talents were exerciſed in arduous enterprize at an early period; and when, as yet but a youth, it is a well known fact, that his more than manly prudence, had it been liſtened to, would have preſerved a veteran Britiſh General from the moſt fatal diſafter.<note n="*" place="bottom">Alluding to Braddock's defeat.</note>

            <p>WHEN war commenced between this country and our oppreſſive parent State, WASHINGTON
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039070_0012_101395702EF10B48"/>
was the man to whom a propitious Providence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the eyes of his country for her defence and deliverance. He ſoon reduced our armies from confuſion to order; economized our ſcanty mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtores, and in a meaſure ſupplied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency by his wiſdom and prudence.</p>
            <p>TIME will not permit us to follow this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father of our revolution, through that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable train of events which aſtoniſhed the world, and terminated in the complete vindication of our liberty, and eſtabliſhment of our independence and peace, we truſt, on a baſis which ſhall laſt with time itſelf.</p>
            <p>NEVER could we have had any ſuitable concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worth of WASHINGTON, had we not been favoured with his letters, which breathe at once the greatneſs of his views, the ardour of his affection for his country, and the reſolute firmneſs and perſeverance of his ſoul. When retiring, through the Jerſeys, in the greateſt apparent diſtreſs, followed by a powerful and exulting enemy, not a ſingle word do we hear of diſcouragement, much leſs did he deſpair of the Commonwealth. He retired with dignity, with his eye ſteadily fixed on his enemy, and the firſt moment their inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afforded opportunity, he turned the torrent of war on his purſuers, and, by repeated ſtrokes, humbled their pride and re-animated our hopes.</p>
            <p>"GOD," ſaid a wiſe ancient, "is never abſent where prudence preſides." How forcibly is this verified in the example before us. Prudence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039070_0013_1013959E09139BC0"/>
in the counſels of WASHINGTON, and Heaven, almoſt by miracle, crowned his efforts with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>How do our hearts bleed, for this beſt and greateſt of men, when we read that he freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to the cenſure of his countrymen, by hiding from them the weakneſs of their own army, leſt it ſhould come to the knowledge of their enemies.</p>
            <p>THUS the wiſe parent conſults the intereſt of his children, at the hazard of their diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>THE laſt ſcene, in this great military drama, was worthy the preceding acts, and equally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting. With what indeſcribable dignity did the Hero retire, when he had accompliſhed the wiſh of his country, to enjoy the rewards of his exalted virtues in the ſhades of ſolitude.</p>
            <p>BUT, at his country's call, he once more quits his beloved retirement, to preſide in that Convention which formed a Conſtitution of Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; at once the boaſt of the American States, and the admiration of other nations.</p>
            <p>WITH what inimitable modeſty did he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the firſt Preſidency in compliance with the united voice of his country, to him ever ſacred. The ſame greatneſs marked his character in civil as in military life. He held the balance of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence with a ſteady hand, and taught us a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the greateſt importance, to conſider ourſelves as Americans, and to diſdain foreign influence.</p>
            <p>THE legacy he bequeathed us, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the chair of government, is worthy to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039070_0014_10139572A3C0FFF8"/>
be written in letters of gold, or, rather, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed on the hearts of an enlightened, free, and grateful people. He was ſtill our ſhield, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort and hope, under Providence, in the day of our trouble; and whilſt WASHINGTON lived, his life ſeemed to be the pledge of our ſafety and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE time and the manner of his death, like every circumſtance of his life, are adapted ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to impreſs the public mind. His ſun ſet ere the rays of its luſtre were dimmed with age. He has quitted the ſtage with the unimpaired admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his country and mankind.</p>
            <p>HAIL, illuſtrious ſhade of our departed father! We follow thy progreſs to the reward of thy vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in the happineſs of heaven; forever live thy great example, for the inſtruction of mankind; may it inſpire millions yet unborn to emulate thy greatneſs, by copying thy virtues; may thy fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers, offered on her behalf, ſecure to our country peace, proſperity and public happineſs, till time ſhall be no more.</p>

            <p>THE period for a new election of a citizen, to adminiſter the executive government of the United States, being not far diſtant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts muſt be employed in deſignating the perſon, who is to be clothed with that important truſt, it appears to me proper, eſpecially as it may conduce to a more diſtinct expreſſion of the public voice, that I ſhould now appriſe you of the reſolution I have formed, to decline being conſidered among the number of thoſe, out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>
            <p>I beg you, at the ſame time, to do me the juſtice to be aſſured, that this reſolution has not been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without a ſtrict regard to all the conſiderations appertaining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039070_0016_101395A16707D240"/>
the tender of ſervice, which ſilence in my ſituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intereſt; no deficiency of grateful reſpect for your paſt kindneſs: but am ſupported by a full conviction that the ſtep is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with both.</p>
            <p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your ſuffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform ſacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your deſire. I conſtantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, conſiſtently with motives, which I was not at liberty to diſregard, to return to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The ſtrength of my inclination to do this, previous to the laſt election, had even led to the preparation of an addreſs to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical poſture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of perſons entitled to my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>
            <p>I rejoice, that the ſtate of your concerns, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as well as internal, no longer renders the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of inclination incompatible with the ſentiment of duty, or propriety; and am perſuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my ſervices, that, in the preſent circumſtances of our country, you will not diſapprove my determination to retire.</p>
            <p>The impreſſions, with which I firſt undertook the arduous truſt, were explained on the proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. In the diſcharge of this truſt, I will only ſay, that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and adminiſtration of the government, the beſt exertions of which a very falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment was capable. Not unconſcious, in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039070_0017_10139575E0209C00"/>
outſet, of the inferiority of my qualifications, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in my own eyes, perhaps ſtill more in the eyes of others, has ſtrengthened the motives to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of myſelf; and every day the increaſing weight of years admoniſhes me more and more, that the ſhade of retirement is as neceſſary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have given peculiar value to my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, they were temporary, I have the conſolation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political ſcene, patriotiſm does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it.</p>
            <p>In looking forward to the moment, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to ſuſpend the deep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of that debt of gratitude, which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me; ſtill more for the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt confidence with which it has ſupported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifeſting my inviolable attachment, by ſervices faithful and perſevering, though in uſefulneſs une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to my zeal. If benefits have reſulted to our country from theſe ſervices, let it always be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered to your praiſe, and as an inſtructive example in our annals, that under circumſtances in which the paſſions, agitated in every direction, were liable to miſlead—amidſt appearances ſometimes dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—viciſſitudes of fortune often diſcouraging—in ſituations in which, not unfrequently, want of ſucceſs has countenanced the ſpirit of criticiſm—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of your ſupport was the eſſential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I ſhall carry it with me to my grave, as a ſtrong incitement to unceaſing vows, that Heaven
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039070_0018_101395A4C1A5A950"/>
may continue to you the choiceſt tokens of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence—that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual—that the free conſtitution, which is the work of your hands, may be ſacredly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained—that its adminiſtration, in every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be ſtamped with wiſdom and virtue—that, in fine, the happineſs of the people of theſe States, under the auſpices of liberty, may be made complete, by ſo careful a preſervation and ſo prudent a uſe of this bleſſing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, the affection, and adoption, of every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>HERE, perhaps, I ought to ſtop. But a ſolicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehenſion of danger, natural to that ſolicitude, urge me, on an occaſion like the preſent, to offer to your ſolemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, ſome ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the reſult of much reflection, of no inconſiderable obſervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a people. Theſe will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only ſee in them the diſintereſted warnings of a parting friend, who can poſſibly have no perſonal motive to bias his counſel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my ſentiments on a former and not diſſimilar occaſion.</p>
            <p>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is neceſſary to fortify or confirm the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The unity of government, which conſtitutes you one people, is alſo now dear to you. It is juſtly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039070_0019_1013957860C1F0C8"/>
ſo; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence; the ſupport of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your ſafety; of your proſperity; of that very liberty which you ſo highly prize. But, as it is eaſy to foreſee, that from different cauſes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortreſs, againſt which the batteries of internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enemies will be moſt conſtantly and actively (though often covertly and inſidiouſly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you ſhould properly eſtimate the immenſe value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happineſs; that you ſhould cheriſh a cordial, habitual and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attachment to it; accuſtoming yourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as of the palladium of your political ſafety and proſperity; watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing whatever may ſuggeſt even a ſuſpicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the firſt dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the reſt, or to enfeeble the ſacred ties which now link to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the various parts.</p>
            <p>For this, you have every inducement of ſympathy and intereſt. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, muſt always exalt the juſt pride of patriotiſm, more than any appellation derived from local diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. With ſlight ſhades of difference, you have the ſame religion, manners, habits and polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical principles. You have, in a common cauſe,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:039070_0020_101395A648710E78"/>
fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you poſſeſs are the work of joint coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and joint efforts, of common dangers, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>But theſe conſiderations, however powerfully they addreſs themſelves to your ſenſibility, are greatly out-weighed by thoſe which apply more immediately to your intereſt.—Here every portion of our country finds the moſt commanding motives for carefully guarding and preſerving the union of the whole.</p>
            <p>The North, in an unreſtrained intercourſe with the South, protected by the equal laws of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional reſources of maritime and commercial enterprize, and precious materials of manufacturing induſtry. The South, in the ſame intercourſe, benefiting by the agency of the North, ſees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the ſeamen of the North, it finds its particular nav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouriſh and increaſe the general maſs of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime ſtrength, to which it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is unequally adapted. The Eaſt, in a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the Weſt, already finds, and, in the progreſſive improvement of interior communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by land and water, will more and more find, a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The Weſt derives from the Eaſt ſupplies requiſite to its growth and comfort; and, what is perhaps of ſtill greater conſequence, it muſt of neceſſity owe the ſecure enjoyment of indiſpenſable outlets for its own productions to the weighty influence, and the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:039070_0021_1013957C9ABF7538"/>
future maritime ſtrength of the Atlantic ſide of the Union, directed by an indiſſoluble community of intereſt as one nation. Any other tenure, by which the Weſt can hold this eſſential advantage, whether derived from its own ſeparate ſtrength, or from an apoſtate and unnatural connexion with any foreign power, muſt be intrinſically precarious.</p>
            <p>While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular intereſt in Union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find, in the united maſs of means and efforts, greater ſtrength, greater reſource, proportionably greater ſecurity from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal danger, a leſs frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of moſt ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable value! they muſt derive from Union an exemption from thoſe broils and wars between themſelves, which ſo frequently afflict neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countries, not tied together by the ſame gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; which their own rivalſhips alone would be ſufficient to produce, but which oppoſite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and embitter. Hence, likewiſe, they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, under any form of government, are inauſpicious to liberty, and which are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as particularly hoſtile to Republican Liberty. In this ſenſe it is, that your Union ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a main prop of your Liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation of the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations ſpeak a perſuaſive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the UNION as a primary object of patriotic deſire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can embrace ſo large a ſphere? Let experience ſolve it. To liſten to mere
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:039070_0022_101395A8BAD829C8"/>
ſpeculation, in ſuch a caſe, were criminal. We are authoriſed to hope, that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the reſpective ſubdiviſions, will afford a happy iſſue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With ſuch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experiment ſhall not have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated its impracticability, there will always be reaſon to diſtruſt the patriotiſm of thoſe, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the cauſes which may diſturb our Union, it occurs as matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould have been furniſhed for characterizing parties, by geographical diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—<hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern—Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Weſtern;</hi> whence deſigning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular diſtricts, is to miſrepreſent the opinions and aims of other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts. You cannot ſhield yourſelves too much againſt the jealouſies and heart-burnings which ſpring from theſe miſrepreſentations; they tend to render alien to each other thoſe who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our Weſtern country have lately had a uſeful leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on this head: They have ſeen, in the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Executive, and in the unanimous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the univerſal ſatisfaction at that event, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the United States, a deciſive proof how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded were the ſuſpicions, propagated among them, of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States, unfriendly to their intereſts in regard to the Miſſiſippi: They have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039070_0023_1013957E22C1FEB8"/>
to the formation of two treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which ſecure to them every thing they could deſire, in reſpect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their proſperity. Will it not be their wiſdom to rely, for the preſervation of theſe advantages, on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be deaf to thoſe adviſers, if ſuch there are, who would ſever them from their brethren, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect them with aliens?</p>
            <p>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indiſpenſable. No alliances, however ſtrict, between the parts, can be an adequate ſubſtitute; they muſt inevitably expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have experienced. Senſible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your firſt eſſay, by the adoption of a Conſtitution of Government, better calculated than your former, for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of your common concerns. This Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the offspring of your own choice, uninflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and unawed; adopted upon full inveſtigation and mature deliberation; completely free in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; in the diſtribution of its powers, uniting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity with energy; and containing within itſelf a proviſion for its own amendment, has a juſt claim to your confidence and your ſupport. Reſpect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquieſcence in its meaſures, are duties enjoined by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maxims of true liberty. The baſis of our political ſyſtems is the right of the people to make and to alter their conſtitutions of government—But, the conſtitutions which at any time exiſts, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is ſacredly obligatory upon all. The
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039070_0024_101395AB8CB22328"/>
very idea of the power and the right of the people to eſtabliſh government, preſuppoſes the duty of every individual to obey the eſtabliſhed government.</p>
            <p>All obſtructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and aſſociations, under whatever plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible character, with the real deſign to direct, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the conſtituted authorities, are deſtructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. They ſerve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a ſmall, but artful and enterpriſing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumph of different parties, to make the public adminiſtration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of conſiſtent and wholeſome plans, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by common councils, and modified by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſts.</p>
            <p>However combinations, or aſſociations, of the above deſcription, may now and then anſwer popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ends, they are likely, in the courſe of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ambitious, and unprincipled men, will be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſubvert the power of the people, and to uſurp for themſelves the reins of government; deſtroying, afterwards, the very engines which have lifted them to unjuſt dominion.</p>
            <p>Towards the preſervation of your government, and the permanency of your preſent happy ſtate, it is requiſite, not only that you ſteadily diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance irregular oppoſitions to its acknowledged authority, but alſo that you reſiſt, with care, the ſpirit of innovation upon its principles, however ſpecious the pretexts. One method of aſſault may
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:039070_0025_101395ADF9200600"/>
be to effect, in the forms of the Conſtitution, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which will impair the energy of the ſyſtem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at leaſt as neceſſary to fix the true character of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, as of other human inſtitutions; that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is the ſureſt ſtandard, by which to teſt the real tendency of the exiſting conſtitution of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypotheſis and opinion, expoſes to perpetual change, from the endleſs variety of hypotheſis and opinion; and remember, eſpecially, that for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient management of your common intereſts, in a country ſo extenſive as ours, a government of as much vigour as is conſiſtent with the perfect ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of liberty, is indiſpenſable. Liberty itſelf will find in ſuch a government, with powers properly diſtributed and adjuſted, its ſureſt guardian. It is, indeed, little elſe than a name, where the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is too feeble to withſtand the enterpriſes of faction, to confine each member of the ſociety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits preſcribed by the laws, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all in the ſecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of perſon and property.</p>
            <p>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in a ſtate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical diſcriminations. Let me now take a more comprehenſive view, and warn you, in the moſt ſolemn manner, againſt the baneful effects of the ſpirit of party, generally.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit, unfortunately, is inſeparable from our nature, having its root in the ſtrongeſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the human mind. It exiſts, under different ſhapes, in all governments, more or leſs ſtifled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, or repreſſed; but in thoſe of the popular
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039070_0026_101395ADF9200600"/>
form, it is ſeen in its greateſt rankneſs, and is truly their worſt enemy.</p>
            <p>The alternate domination of one faction over another, ſharpened by the ſpirit of revenge, natural to party diſſention, which, in different ages and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, has perpetrated the moſt horrid enormities, is itſelf a frightful deſpotiſm: But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent deſpotiſm. The diſorders and miſeries, which reſult, gradually incline the minds of men to ſeek ſecurity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the abſolute power of an individual; and, ſooner or later, the chief of ſome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this diſpoſition to the purpoſes of his own ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, on the ruins of public liberty.</p>
            <p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheleſs ought not to be entirely out of ſight) the common and continual miſchiefs of the ſpirit of party are ſufficient to make it the intereſt and duty of a wiſe people to diſcourage and reſtrain it.</p>
            <p>It ſerves always to diſtract the public councils, and enfeeble the public adminiſtration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealouſies and falſe alarms; kindles the animoſity of one part againſt another; and foments, occaſionally, riot and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acceſs to the government itſelf, through the channels of party paſſions. Thus the policy and will of one country are ſubjected to the policy and will of another.</p>
            <p>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are uſeful checks up on the adminiſtration of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and ſerve to keep alive the ſpirit of liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039070_0027_1013958265E0EE10"/>
in governments of a monarchical caſt, patriotiſm may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the ſpirit of party. But in thoſe of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a ſpirit not to be encourged. From their natural tendency, it is certain, there will always be enough of that ſpirit for every ſalutary purpoſe: and there being conſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its burſting into a flame, leſt, inſtead of warming, it ſhould conſume.</p>
            <p>It is important, likewiſe, that the habits of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a free country, ſhould inſpire caution in thoſe entruſted with its adminiſtration, to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within their reſpective conſtitutional ſpheres, avoiding, in the exerciſe of the powers of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, to encroach upon another. The ſpirit of encroachment tends to conſolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the form of government, a real deſpotiſm. A juſt eſtimate of that love of power, and proneneſs to abuſe it, which predominates in the human heart, is ſufficient to ſatisfy us of the truth of this poſition. The neceſſity of reciprocal checks in the exerciſe of political power, by dividing and diſtrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uting it into different depoſitories, and conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each the guardian of the public weal againſt invaſions by the others, has been evinced by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ancient and modern; ſome of them in our country, and under our own eyes. To preſerve them, muſt be as neceſſary as to inſtitute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the diſtribution or modification of the conſtitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way which the Conſtitution deſignates.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039070_0028_101395B06AE02E58"/>
But let there be no change by uſurpation: for though this, in one inſtance, may be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good, it is the cuſtomary weapon by which free governments are deſtroyed. The precedent muſt always greatly overbalance, in permanent evil, any partial or tranſient benefit which the uſe can at any time yield.</p>
            <p>Of all the diſpoſitions and habits, which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labour to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be ſimply aſked, Where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a ſenſe of religious obligation <hi>deſert</hi> the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſtice? And let us with caution indulge the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of refined education, on minds of peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail, in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religious principle.</p>
            <p>It is ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or leſs force, to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpecies of free government. Who, that is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere friend to it, can look with indifference upon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſhake the foundation of the fabric?</p>
            <p>Promote, then, as an object of primary import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039070_0029_10139586A77D8EE0"/>
In proportion as the ſtructure of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives force to public opinion, it is eſſential that public opinion ſhould be enlightened.</p>
            <p>As a very important ſource of ſtrength and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, cheriſh public credit. One method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it is, to uſe it as ſparingly as poſſible; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions of expenſe by cultivating peace; but remembering alſo, that timely diſburſements, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for danger, frequently prevent much greater diſburſements to repel it; avoiding, likewiſe, the accumulation of debt, not only by ſhunning occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of expenſe, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to diſcharge the debts which una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable wars may have occaſioned, not ungener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly throwing upon poſterity the burden which we ourſelves ought to bear. The execution of theſe maxims belongs to your repreſentatives, but it is neceſſary that public opinion ſhould co-operate.</p>
            <p>To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there muſt be revenue; that to have revenue there muſt be taxes; that no taxes can be deviſed, which are not, more or leſs, inconvenient and unpleaſant; that the intrinſic embarraſſment inſeparable from the ſelection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deciſive motive for a candid conſtruction of the conduct of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in making it, and for a ſpirit of acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the meaſures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</p>
            <p>Obſerve good faith and juſtice towards all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; cultivate peace and harmony with all: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039070_0030_101395B308D49EC0"/>
diſtant period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple always guided by an exalted juſtice and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. Who can doubt, that in the courſe of time and things, the fruits of ſuch a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be loſt by a ſteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, at leaſt, is recommended by every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impoſſible by its vices?</p>
            <p>In the execution of ſuch a plan, nothing is more eſſential, than that permanent, inveterate antipathies againſt particular nations, and paſſionate attachments for others, ſhould be excluded; and that, in the place of them, juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated. The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree a ſlave. It is a ſlave to its animoſity or to its affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Antipathy in one nation againſt another, diſpoſes each more readily to offer inſult and injury, to lay hold of ſlight cauſes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occaſions of diſpute occur. Hence frequent colliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, obſtinate, envenomed and bloody conteſts. The nation, prompted by ill will and reſentment, ſometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the beſt calculations of policy. The government ſometimes participates in the national propenſity, and adopts, through paſſion, what reaſon would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; at other times, it makes the animoſity of the nation ſubſervient to the projects of hoſtility, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by pride, ambition, and other ſiniſter and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious motives. The peace often, ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:039070_0031_101395882FB063A8"/>
So, likewiſe, a paſſionate attachment of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for another, produces a variety of evils. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy for the favourite nation, facilitating the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an imaginary common intereſt, in caſes where no real common intereſt exiſts, and infuſing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It leads alſo to conceſſions to the favourite nation, of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conceſſions; by unneceſſarily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealouſy, ill will, and a diſpoſition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themſelves to the favourite nation) facility to betray, or ſacrifice the intereſts of their own country, without odium, ſometimes even with pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous ſenſe of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the baſe or fooliſh compliance, of ambition, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or infatuation.</p>
            <p>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, ſuch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domeſtic factions, to practiſe the arts of ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to miſlead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a ſmall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the ſatellite of the latter.</p>
            <p>Againſt the inſidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealouſy of a free people ought to be conſtantly awake; ſince hiſtory and experience prove, that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:039070_0032_101395B491D18DD0"/>
foreign influence is one of the moſt baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealouſy, to be uſeful, muſt be impartial; elſe it becomes the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the very influence to be avoided, inſtead of a defence againſt it. Exceſſive partiality for one foreign nation, and exceſſive diſlike of another, cauſe thoſe whom they actuate to ſee danger only on one ſide, and ſerve to veil and even ſecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may reſiſt the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become ſuſpected and odious; while its tools and dupes uſurp the applauſe and confidence of the people, to ſurrender their intereſt.</p>
            <p>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign nations, is, in extending our commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to have with them as little political connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion as poſſible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith.—Here let us ſtop.</p>
            <p>Europe has a ſet of primary intereſts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence ſhe muſt be engaged in frequent controverſies, the cauſes of which are eſſentially foreign to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. Hence, therefore, it muſt be unwiſe in us to implicate ourſelves, by artificial ties, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary viciſſitudes of her politics, or the ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and colliſions of her friendſhips or enmities.</p>
            <p>Our detached and diſtant ſituation invites and enables us to purſue a different courſe. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al injury from external annoyance; when we may take ſuch an attitude, as will cauſe the neutrality, we may at any time reſolve upon, to be ſcrupulouſly reſpected; when belligerent nations, under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of making acquiſitions upon us, will not
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:039070_0033_10139589F0D330F8"/>
lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may chooſe peace or war, as our intereſt, guided by juſtice, ſhall counſel.</p>
            <p>Why forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? Why quit our own, to ſtand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of European ambition, rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, intereſt, humour or caprice?</p>
            <p>It is our true policy to ſteer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; ſo far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it: for let me not be underſtood as capable of patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing infidelity to exiſting engagements. I hold the maxim no leſs applicable to public than to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs, that honeſty is always the beſt policy. I repeat it, therefore, let thoſe engagements be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their genuine ſenſe. But, in my opinion, it is unneceſſary, and would be unwiſe, to extend them.</p>
            <p>Taking care always to keep ourſelves, by ſuitable eſtabliſhments, on a reſpectable defenſive poſture, we may ſafely truſt to temporary alliances for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary emergencies.</p>
            <p>Harmony, liberal intercourſe with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity and intereſt. But even our commercial policy, ſhould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither ſeeking nor granting excluſive favours or preferences; conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural courſe of things; diffuſing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifying, by gentle means, the ſtreams of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but forcing nothing; eſtabliſhing, with the powers ſo diſpoſed, in order to give trade a ſtable courſe, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to ſupport them, conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rules of intercourſe, the beſt that preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039070_0034_101395B80D8282E8"/>
and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or varied, as experience and circumſtances ſhall dictate; conſtantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for diſintereſted favours from another; that it muſt pay, with a portion of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that character; that, by ſuch acceptance, it may place itſelf in the condition of having given equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alents for nominal favours, and yet of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. It is an illuſion which experience muſt cure, which a juſt pride ought to diſcard.</p>
            <p>In offering to you, my countrymen, theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the ſtrong and laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I could wiſh; that they will control the uſual current of the paſſions, or prevent our nation from running the courſe which has hitherto marked the deſtiny of nations: But if I may even flatter myſelf, that they may be productive of ſome partial bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſome occaſional good; that they may now and then recu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to moderate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſchiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard againſt the impoſtures of pretended patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; this hope will be a full recompenſe for the ſolicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</p>
            <p>How far, in the diſcharge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records, and other evidences of my conduct, muſt witneſs to you and to the world. To myſelf, the aſſurance of my own conſcience is, that I have at leaſt believed myſelf to be guided by them.</p>

In relation to the ſtill ſubſiſting war in Europe, my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Repreſentatives in both Houſes of Congreſs, the ſpirit of that meaſure has continually governed me; uninfluenced by any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>
            <p>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the beſt lights I could obtain, I was well ſatisfied that our country, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intereſt to take, a neutral poſition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as ſhould depend upon me, to maintain it with moderation, perſeverance and firmneſs.</p>
            <p>The conſiderations which reſpect the right to hold this conduct, it is not neceſſary on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to detail. I will only obſerve, that, according to my underſtanding of the matter, that right, ſo far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</p>
            <p>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any thing more, from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which juſtice and humanity impoſe on every nation, in caſes in which it is free to act, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inviolate the relations of peace and amity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other nations.</p>
            <p>The inducements of intereſt for obſerving that conduct will be beſt referred to your own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and experience. With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to ſettle and mature its yet recent inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to progreſs, without interruption, to that degree of ſtrength and conſiſtency, which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give it, humanly ſpeaking, the command of its own fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:039070_0036_101395BA734463C0"/>
Though in reviewing the incidents of my admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, I am unconſcious of intentional error, I am nevertheleſs too ſenſible of my defects, not to think it probable that I may have committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its ſervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as myſelf muſt ſoon be to the manſions of reſt.</p>
            <p>Relying on its kindneſs in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is ſo natural to a man who views in it the native ſoil of himſelf and his progenitors for ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations; I anticipate, with pleaſing expectation, that retreat, in which I promiſe myſelf to realize, without alloy, the ſweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midſt of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government—the ever favourite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I truſt, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</p>
