            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough there be a Truth in the Proverb, <hi>That a Fool may ask more than a Philosopher can answer;</hi> yet I that am one of the first sort, am going to ask nothing but what a Person of as mean parts as my self, may answer. Tis a time when every man should be active in pursuing the Peace of his Countrey; and I have some hopes, that if my Countrey men give themselves the trouble of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering these <hi>Quaeries,</hi> the Effect will be but peaceable.</p>
            <p>A Former Paper of <hi>Quaeries,</hi> written and published by one that had not been half seven years in this Countrey, did the Countrey no harm. Which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the Writer and Publisher of these further <hi>Quaeries</hi> (who also is not a Native of <hi>New-England,</hi> tho a great Observer of, and Well-wisher to it) to adventure a second part of the same Tune: with no design but that of Service te the Countrey; my good Friends, the <hi>New-Englanders,</hi> may see, that some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and retired Persons unknown to them, do take more notice of their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances than they are well aware.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the GOVERNMENT.</head>
               <p>Whether it be not a great Injury and Prejudice against the most Loyal People in all the <hi>English Dominions,</hi> to represent <hi>New-England</hi> as if it had the least Inclination to deny a most obedient Submission or Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Authority of <hi>England?</hi> and whether even the most Thinking part of the Countrey ever thought of such a thing, till they heard it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the mouths of their most malicious Adversaries? or have yet thought of it with any Passions but those of Detestation?</p>
               <p>Whether we have not all imaginable reason to embrace our antient (however condemned or vacated) <hi>CHARTERS,</hi> as the best Instrument of our Government, by conformity whereunto, (tho there be <hi>one</hi> of them
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000507_0002_0FA6A792BB0DD028"/>
not yet so good in Law) we shall most express our Allegiance to Their <hi>Majesties,</hi> and our Dependance on the Authority of <hi>England?</hi> Inasmuch as,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Even the late <hi>K. James</hi> in his Proclamation, Dated <hi>October.</hi> 17<hi>th</hi> 1688. did restore some (if not all) of our <hi>Charters,</hi> as far as a Proclamation could go towards it. [<hi>Quaere</hi>] whether they who thought an illegal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of K. <hi>James</hi> could supersede our Charters, might not as well think an illegal Proclamation of K. <hi>James</hi> could restore them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Highness, the <hi>(then)</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Engaging in that glorious Expedition, upon the first notice whereof, <hi>New-England</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested an earlier zeal for Him and It, than any of all the <hi>American</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had these Words in His Declaration; <hi>All Magistrates who have been unjustly turned out, shall forthwith Resume their former Employments, as well <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> all the Burroughs of</hi> England <hi>shall return to their antient Prescriptions and Charters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when we were Condemned, they found us in <hi>England,</hi> it was the <hi>Massachusets Colony</hi> in <hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In our Address to Their <hi>Majesties,</hi> Dated <hi>June</hi> 6<hi>th</hi> 1689. our words are these, <hi>Finding an absolute necessity of Civil Government, the People generally manifested their desire and importunity once and again, that the</hi> Governour, Deputy Governour <hi>and</hi> Assistants, <hi>Chosen and Sworn in</hi> May 1688. <hi>according to Charter and Court, as then formed, would Assume the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The said</hi> Governour, Deputy Governour <hi>and</hi> Assistants <hi>then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Colony, did consent to accept the present Care and Government of this People, according to the Rules of the</hi> Charter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In answer to that Address, His Majesty, in a most gracious Letter, bearing Date, <hi>Aug.</hi> 12<hi>th.</hi> 1689. does Authorize and Impower our present Rulers to continue in His Name the Care in the <hi>Administration of the Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Letter is Superscribed [<hi>To such as For the Time Being, take care for preserving the Peace, and Administring the Laws, &amp;c.</hi>] An Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which implies a <hi>Succession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Body of the <hi>English Nation</hi> Assembled in Parliament have Declared the Invasion made upon our Charters, to be illegal and a grievance. And the Bill for the Restauration of <hi>Charters,</hi> so far as <hi>New-England</hi> is concerned in it, has thrice passed the Honourable House of Commons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000507_0003_0FA6A793A4093C28"/>These things are mentioned, not as if they were sufficient Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Massachusets Charter,</hi> (as for the Charters of the other Colonies, 'tis peevishness to question whether they be not in as good force as ever) from the disadvantages with which a pretended but injurious form of Law has hampered it. But they are produced as Intimations of the best Rule that our Government can at present have, while in a conjunction with all these Encouragements, there is the voice, and vote, and consent of the <hi>whole People,</hi> so far as it can be legally understood, agreeing thereunto, So that we go on to enquire.</p>
               <p>Whether the Foundations being every where overturned, and all things out of course, it be not become utterly impossible at such an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Time, for the Niceties and Punctilioes of Law, to be exactly observed? And, whether those that are Baiting and Bantring at the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, for wanting some Circumstances of Law, to strengthen the foundation which they act upon, can suggest any other Foundations, but what would be a thousand times more feeble and rotten, than those which we are now upon?</p>
               <p>Whether it can be pleasing unto the Almighty God, or unto Their Majesties, or the Honourable Parliament; that this great Country should live from year to year without any Civil Government? Or whether one of these Colonies, which never had any Charter at all, did not Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably jog on for one threescore years in an innocent &amp; laudable Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Government without ever being blamed for it?</p>
               <p>Whether the best Course that we can at present steer, be not for us to observe the allowed methods of the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation, in this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and Critical time of Confusions, and to learn by the best Hints we can get, what will be most agreeable to the Glorious Designs of Their Majesties, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; managing of our selves with a most Loyal and Religious Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereunto? And whether it be not something worse than Ignorance to say that we are not now steering of such a Course?</p>
               <p>Whether it can be a fair thing, for a Company of Strangers, who have had all manner of Civility and Protection, and are growing rich under the present Government, yet out of their antipathy to the good Order &amp; the good people here, to send home Addresses for the imposing of such a Form of Government upon us, as the biggest part of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000507_0004_0FA6A7972C00D4E0"/>
Plantation more than seven to one, humbly but warmly Deprecate?</p>
               <p>Whether Considering the Antient Enjoyments, and the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Inclination of this People, and the Circumstances of our Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Those Men are not under the power of a meer Phrenzy who desire not the Restoration of our Charters?</p>
               <p>Whether those few little men who now pretend that they are bound in Conscience to Declare against this Government, because they imagine some Circumstantial Forms of Law not exactly observed in our Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thought themselves under any Obligations of Conscience to appear against the late Government, wherein all English Laws, and English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, were perfectly overthrown?</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the ELECTION.</head>
               <p>Whether our Government being now so allowably taken up, according to the <hi>Rules of our Charter,</hi> it has been amiss, for the General Court to Remember, that an Anniversary Election is among the most Fundamental <hi>Rules of our Charter</hi>?</p>
               <p>Whether all the Corporations in <hi>England,</hi> none of which have their Charters Restored, go not on with their Elections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as we?</p>
               <p>Whether the greatest Objection against an Election, be not the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Choice which Distemper and Faction may be too ready, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate this people unto? And whether all good men, ought not with a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous watchfulness over their own passions, to endeavour the prevention of that Inconvenience?</p>
               <p>Whether the Arduous Affairs which the Approaching Summer is like to entertein us with, will not be so perplexed, as to require the ablest and wisest men in the Country to go thro with them?</p>
               <p>Whether the Gentlemen that are now in the Government being by uncomfortable Experience, thus well acquainted with Government, (for Governing is a skill, as great as any of the Liberal Arts) It would not be a madness to make too <hi>Essential</hi> or <hi>Considerable</hi> Alterations, in our New Election?</p>
               <p>Whether in our Choice of Magistrates there should not be a special Eye to this that as they be persons of great affection to the True Interest of their Country, so they may be for the most part, of good Fashion and Quality, and such as may maintain the due Grandure of a Government?</p>

               <p>VVhether we are not now evidently Reduced unto that extream Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, that either <hi>New-England</hi> or <hi>New-France</hi> must unavoidably perish?</p>
               <p>Whether all our Encounters with several Bodies or Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> that may quarrel with us, be not meerly a lopping of Branches, whereas by an Attack upon <hi>Port-Royal</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> we fall upon the Root of all our Miseries?</p>
               <p>Whether it be not Good Husbandry, in a manner to throw up all Business, and apply our selves one and all to this <hi>French</hi> War, in which if God give us Prosperity, we shall get more from our Enemies by Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than we can get of one another by Trading?</p>
               <p>Whether in all parts of the Country it be not incumbent on well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected persons immediately (with the Countenance of Authority) to List themselves, and humbly offer to our Honourable Rulers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their best Service, in the Expedition which is now propounded?</p>
               <p>Whether if we make a vigorous Assault upon our <hi>French</hi> Neighbours, we may not by the blessing of God, hope to be victorious over them?</p>
               <p>Whether a thousand things do not now Conspire to invite us unto such an Expectation?</p>
               <p>Especially, These Four:</p>
               <p>First, That the Wheel of Divine Vengeance is now Turning apace upon the <hi>French</hi> Papists, for their late Bloody and Matchless Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in which Persecutions, Our <hi>French</hi> Neighbours have had a very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar share: Why mayn't we hope to be the Executioners of Gods wrath upon them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, A great part of the <hi>French</hi> People, which we propound to invade are such as would see it their happiness to come under the <hi>English Government</hi>?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>English</hi> Arms in other parts of the <hi>West Indies</hi> are now very prosperous against them; 'Tis probable, their time is come to go down the Wind.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Mohawks</hi> now offer that at the same nick of Time, when we visit them by Sea, they will be upon them by Land; and they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000507_0006_0FA6A797FB1B7458"/>
will certainly be so discouraged, as wholly to desert us, and unite with our Enemies, if we are now wanting to our selves·</p>
               <p>Whether our subduing the <hi>French</hi> Territories will not be a thing as acceptable to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as profitable to the people of <hi>New-England?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether it would not be a Generous, and most Christian Service, for some well disposed <hi>New-Englander,</hi> to undertake the Gospellizing of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> who, though much Tampered withal by the <hi>French</hi> Papists, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press an inclination to the Protestant Religion?</p>
               <p>Whether there would not be a great piece of Policy as well as of Piety in such an Undertaking? And whether all Orders of men among us, would not study to support and honour the Undertaker with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest Gratitude?</p>
               <p>Whether the advantages, which the <hi>French</hi> have against us, do not proceed very much from the Conduct of that Gentleman, whose unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Industry and Mediation procured of the <hi>French</hi> King the Return of those <hi>Mohawks</hi> which had been carried unto <hi>France</hi>?</p>
               <p>Whether there be not these words to be read in a Memorial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented lately to Their Majesties against that Gentleman by one Mr. <hi>P.</hi> —R —y.</p>
               <p>The Petition (concerning Salt Ponds about <hi>New-York</hi>) was never returned, but the Design put by, because 'twas against the Interest of <hi>France.</hi> It E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appears that he had a Correspondency with the Governour of <hi>Canada.</hi> Hearing of several Protestant People that deserted <hi>Canada,</hi> to find it out, he makes his Application to a Merchant at <hi>New-York,</hi> saying, he heard that several Discontented Persons Deserted <hi>Canada;</hi> some of them Labouring Men; and that he had occasion for a Gardiner, some presented themselves, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of imploying them, he sends them to the Western Islands.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> has for divers years sent several Companies of Souldiers to <hi>Canada;</hi> among which are many Protestants; several young men of Good Families, who think themselves not men, except they have seen a Campaign. But when they are got into <hi>Canada,</hi> they are kept there, and cannot Retreat, nor have any Exercise of their Religion, but are Compelled to go to Mass. So that several did endeavour to come to <hi>New-York;</hi> but Sir <hi>Edmond Andross,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus acted has prevented them. The King of <hi>France</hi> is so great in those
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000507_0007_0FA6A798B99A1FD0"/>
parts, that every year, he sends Souldiers, and when they are there, they are encouraged to Marry, having Land and Houses given them, with other Necessaries; they daily increase, at the Backside of <hi>New-England,</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> extending to the Backside of <hi>Virginia.</hi> They grow so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that they will in few years be Masters of all these Countries, if a speedy care be not taken.</p>
               <p>They have now a Fort, sixty miles within the <hi>English</hi> Empire. The Governour of <hi>Canada</hi> was Required to Demolish his Fort by Collonel <hi>Dungon,</hi> then Governour of <hi>New-York.</hi> And Order came from King <hi>James</hi> to the Governour of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> to Retreat, and lay down their Arms; and the like from the King of <hi>France</hi> to the Governour of <hi>Canada.</hi> And that the two Kings would end the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy in <hi>Europe.</hi> Notwithstanding all that, they kept their Ground, and a Fort, and a Cloister of Jesuits. Sir <hi>Edmond Andross,</hi> who pretends to be a Protestant, found fault with Governour <hi>Dungon,</hi> who is a Roman Catholick, for making War with <hi>Canada,</hi> notwithstanding the Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove written: alleadging that the two Kings were in great Alliance and Friendship.</p>
               <p>Whether the Consideration of such things as these, may not more than a little endear the present Government of <hi>New-England</hi> unto all that would be loath to see the Country given away to its greatest Enemies?</p>
               <p>Whether in Conjunction with the Indian Testimonies, which were so much despised this time twelve month, persons a few months ago escaped from a <hi>French</hi> Captivity have not given upon Oath, such farther Testimonies as these?</p>
               <p>J n. L. d. of <hi>Salem</hi> testifies, that being on Board the <hi>(French)</hi> Admiral, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lumbuscado, and in said Ship car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Prisoner to <hi>Port Royal,</hi> he did then hear several of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany on Board said Ship, say, That they came directly from <hi>France,</hi> and that there was Ten or Twelve Sail of them, Ships of War, that came in Company together, but some of them were taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> and some were lost since; and that they
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000507_0008_0FA6A799834ACDD0"/>
were all bound directly for <hi>New-England</hi>; and that Sir <hi>Edmond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dross,</hi> late Governour of <hi>New-England,</hi> had sent to the <hi>French</hi> King for them to come over, and the Country should be delivered up into his hands, and that they expected that before they should Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, it would have been delivered into the hands of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>B n. m. y. of <hi>Salem</hi> Testifies, That he heard the same related by several on Board the other <hi>French</hi> Ship of War that was in Company, with the Lumbuscado, namely, the <hi>Frugum.</hi> And also, that they had lost most of their Ships coming over.</p>
               <p>Sworn, <hi>Nov.</hi> 23. 1689.</p>
               <p>P p. H. p. of <hi>Salem</hi> Testifies, That being carried on Board the Lumbuscado, he heard several of the Company say, as above. Sworn <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. 1689.</p>
               <p>J n. C t. Testifies, That being Carried to <hi>Port Royal</hi> a Prisoner, one Mr. <hi>M. O.</hi> told him, that the <hi>French</hi> on Board the Lumbuscado, told him as above. And that the (<hi>French</hi>) having lost several of their Ships in their Voyage, and hearing that Sir <hi>Edmond Andross</hi> was taken and now in hold, they should not proceed at present, but threatned what they would do the next Summer.</p>
               <p>Sworn, <hi>Nov.</hi> 23. 1689.</p>
               <p>The same is Testified by M l. C n.</p>
               <p>J s A n. Of <hi>Salem</hi> testifies, That the Lieutenant of the <hi>Lumbuscado</hi> told him as above.</p>
               <p>J C s Testifies, That on Board the <hi>Lumbusado</hi>; one <hi>Peter Goit</hi> told him, there were thirteen Ships of them came out of <hi>France</hi> in Company together, and that they were bound directly for <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> expecting that the Country, was before, or would be delivered up to the King of <hi>France</hi>; and told him, before they could get clear of the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> several of their Ships were taken by the <hi>English Ships</hi> of War, and the rest of their Fleet taken or dispersed and lost, about <hi>Newfoundland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sworn <hi>Nov.</hi> 23. 1689.</p>
               <p>Whether the Consideration of these things, be not enough to awaken and animate the utmost Efforts that we can make towards the preservation of our Country?</p>

               <p>Whether the Government have had any requital for the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble toyl and time which they have spent for us the last year, but only unreasonable Railings and Complaints?</p>
               <p>And whether such requitals will not at last make all sensible men to say, <hi>I will not be an healer to this people?</hi> so that we must perish, because no man of sense will serve a people so dis-ingenuous?</p>
