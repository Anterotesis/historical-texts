            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE ſanguinary ſchemes of the preſent Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration have been ſealed with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the late miniſterial Parliament. Every veſſel that came to this, or the neighbouring ports, ſince the proceedings of our late Congreſs were publiſhed in London, brought us freſh intelligence of the hoſtile meaſures reſolved on againſt us.—More regiments are to be ſent over, ſome of which will be ſtationed in this metropolis, and in New-Jerſey, to ſupport the <hi>King's friends,</hi> to intimidate, and divide us, to be a check on the ſouthern Colonies, and if judged practicable, to <hi>prevent</hi> their relieving our ſuffering brethren of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</p>
            <p>Theſe particulars, and many more have, doubtleſs, come to the knowledge of that <hi>body,</hi> commonly ſtiled our <hi>Repreſentatives</hi>:—And yet, amongſt the objects of <hi>real</hi> complaint, <hi>reſolved</hi> as ſuch by that Aſſembly, in their late catalogue of grievances, we do not read any of the ruinous conſequences of an act of Parliament, which was <hi>ſolely</hi> machinated to <hi>extort</hi> the ſubmiſſion of <hi>all</hi> the Britiſh Colonies to every parliamentary, or, what is ſynonimous, to every miniſterial mandate,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014351_0003_0F91ECFB98D42BB0"/>
though ever ſo ruinous! But it may be predicted that, ſooner or later, this act will have the intended effect, ſhould its not appearing to preſs upon us <hi>in a direct manner,</hi> render us ſo inattentive, or ſo very ſelfiſh as to ſuffer its <hi>continuing</hi> to be enforced WITH IMPUNITY.</p>
            <p>This introduction muſt point out to you, that the act, or rather edict here alluded to, is THAT, which was made <hi>for extending</hi> to <hi>all</hi> the Britiſh Colonies on this Continent, the acts of Parliament <hi>relating</hi> to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and deſertion <hi>in Great Britain,</hi> as likewiſe, to maintain the diſcipline of <hi>his Majeſty's army,</hi> ſo ſtiled, <hi>inſtead</hi> of its true <hi>deſcriptive</hi> name, <hi>the Britiſh,</hi> or <hi>National army</hi>:—An impropriety of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to a free people, juſtly jealous of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and conſcious of their real dignity! But, to the manifeſt danger of the national Liberty, this is little attended to, by military men; too many of whom, from a Field-Marſhal to a drummer, <hi>miſtake</hi> the true ſenſe of that phraſeology, which, when at firſt uſed, was meant but as a <hi>compliment,</hi> and appeared, as it really was, perfectly harmleſs, <hi>before</hi> our Kings kept a <hi>ſtanding army.</hi> Erroneous notions on this head are now big with ruin, it being not unfrequent to find in the military order, a <hi>commiſſioned,</hi> as well as a <hi>non-commiſſioned</hi> varlet, ignorant enough to believe, that he <hi>eats</hi> the <hi>King's bread,</hi> and <hi>is bound,</hi> for that very reaſon, implicitly <hi>to obey any command</hi> he receives from his ſuperiors, who <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> bread! As men of this ſtamp never inquire with <hi>whoſe bread</hi> the King, himſelf, is fed, it is judged very neceſſary, at <hi>this</hi> critical juncture, to awake the attention and ſenſibility of many men of liberal principles, who ſerve in the <hi>Britiſh army</hi> and <hi>navy,</hi> ſome of whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertently <hi>mention</hi> the King, and even <hi>addreſs</hi> him, as <hi>their maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The enemies to our conſtitution, well knowing the fatal effects of the illuſion, which this old prejudice never fails to produce in the minds of the vulgar, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitiouſly
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014351_0004_0F91ECFC55A02200"/>
               <hi>provided</hi> themſelves with the <hi>extenſion edict,</hi> before [though <hi>not long before</hi>] the late Parliament iſſued their <hi>inquiſitorial</hi> ſentences againſt the people of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay. That edict demonſtrates to you, by what means the Miniſtry have determined to conduct their CONSPIRACY againſt our Liberty.— Surely, this is a <hi>grievance</hi> of the firſt magnitude!</p>
            <p>The American news papers have informed you ſince that time, that Courts-Martial have dared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree <hi>various</hi> puniſhments, which have been <hi>inflicted</hi> on ſoldiers in America;—but, tho' ſuch Courts Martial acted under colour of that ſame <hi>illegal</hi> edict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we do not learn that any of their members, or the deluded victims that became their accomplices, by executing the <hi>felonious</hi> ſentences, have been indicted for their reſpective crimes! Nay, have not ſuch unlawful Courts-Martial been ſuffered in our metropolis, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſame illegal authority?</p>
            <p>About the beginning of the laſt war, an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration which had formed no deſign againſt our liberty, acted on very different principles, to prevent the mutiny and deſertion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> forces in North America! The miniſter ſent circular directions to moſt of the American Governors, for procuring <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Acts,</hi> which, as they manifeſtly tended to the welfare and ſafety of the whole Britiſh empire, were cheerfully <hi>granted.</hi> The legiſlatures to which ſuch applications were made, <hi>extended</hi> to their reſpective territories, the acts of Parliament for puniſhing mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and deſertion, &amp;c. Thoſe acts, afterwards, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> the <hi>royal aſſent</hi>:—But the legal force of every ſuch temporary act has long ſince expired. They were granted with the ſame caution, that acts of a ſimilar nature paſs in Great-Britain, where the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons know, that the national liberty might be eaſily deſtroyed, ſhould they declare acts of ſuch importance, PERPETUAL. The Legiſlature can give no <hi>lawful</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſuch acts of <hi>perpetual</hi> duration, any more than they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014351_0005_0F91ECFD12ED0820"/>
can lawfully ſurrender the liberties of the people. Theſe have, in reſerve, an <hi>unalienable</hi> right to <hi>ratify,</hi> or <hi>annul,</hi> every act of their Delegates to legiſlative Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>The fair proceedings of the Adminiſtration above mentioned, are of public notoriety. They <hi>not only</hi> prove, in the moſt authentic manner, that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration <hi>then believed</hi> the Britiſh Parliament had <hi>no right</hi> to bind us, in <hi>all caſes whatſoever</hi>—but that <hi>the King and his Miniſters</hi> were ſolicitous to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the uprightneſs of their intentions—that they would <hi>not</hi> violate <hi>any</hi> of our <hi>conſtitutional</hi> rights, by attempting to bind us, in <hi>any caſe whatſoever, without</hi> our legal conſent.</p>
            <p>The Anti-Britiſh junto, being ſenſible the <hi>legal expiration</hi> of thoſe <hi>temporary acts</hi> of the Colonies was an invincible obſtacle to their projects of <hi>depredation,</hi> ſo artfully conducted themſelves in, and out of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament that their dark deſigns were not ſuſpected. For this reaſon, the patriotic Minority, who did not think that more regiments were <hi>intended</hi> to be ſent over to America, made little or no oppoſition to the extenſion edict.—This ſhows you, my brethren, how cautious you ought to be of your friends, themſelves. They may be ſincere—but, they do not feel!</p>
            <p>Let us ſee now, what our late venerable Congreſs did for us—they who <hi>felt</hi> with us, the innumerable evils, that are inſeparable from a ſtanding army, <hi>not</hi> dependent on ourſelves!—Their ninth reſolve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly declares, that to keep ſuch army, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and conſequently proclaims the <hi>nullity</hi> of the <hi>extenſion edict,</hi> in the comprehenſive words, which are prefixed to this addreſs, although the <hi>conſequence</hi> which reſults from the truth contained in them, being founded on the ſelf-evident principles of univerſal juriſprudence, that reſpectable authority might have been omitted here, without the leaſt danger. This conſequence is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the uniform proceedings of every
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014351_0006_0F91ECFDCB98F2C8"/>
civilized country relative to diſtributive juſtice, as well as in the judgment of every perſon, who is not in a ſtate of inſanity. <hi>Whatever is done anywhere againſt law, cannot be ſupported there, by law.</hi> It is a mere <hi>nullity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have often been aſtoniſhed at the ſuperlative effrontery of miniſterial hirelings; and yet, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable any caviller of that tribe, will be ſo irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and ſcurrilous as to urge, that the ninth reſolve of the Congreſs does not affect the Extenſion Edict.— However, ſhould you meet with that wretch, read to him, and intrench yourſelves <hi>within</hi> the tenth reſolve in their <hi>bill of rights,</hi> from which the following quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is inſerted here, to ſupport the ninth reſolve, and ſeveral other parts of this Addreſs; to wit,</p>
            <p>"All and each of which," (that is to ſay, <hi>the rights mentioned in the nine preceding reſolves,</hi>) <q>the aforeſaid Deputies in behalf of themſelves, and their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents, do claim, demand, and inſiſt on, as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable Rights and Liberties; which cannot be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally taken from them, altered or abridged by any power whatever, without their own conſent, by their repreſentatives, in their ſeveral Provincial Legiſlatures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the courſe of our enquiry we find many infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and violations of the foregoing rights; which, from an ardent deſire that harmony and a mutual intercourſe of affection and intereſt may be reſtored, we paſs over for the preſent, and proceed to ſtate ſuch acts and meaſures as have been adopted ſince the laſt war, which demonſtrate a ſyſtem formed to enſlave America.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, can a <hi>fair</hi> reaſoner aſſert, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>declared illegality</hi> of the infringements alluded to in the preceding quotation, the declaration implies, that the Congreſs admitted the <hi>legal</hi> operation of any ſuch act, <hi>till</hi> it ſhould be <hi>repealed?</hi>—That it is to be ſo underſtood, though the whole of the proceedings
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014351_0007_0F91ECFE8BA28400"/>
ſhows, that <hi>it is feared</hi> there will be <hi>a civil war, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be repealed</hi>?—Though the repeal be ſolicited, <hi>not to annul</hi> ſuch acts, they being all <hi>illegal,</hi> and <hi>every one of them,</hi> whether <hi>enumerated or not,</hi> being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>null and void,</hi>—BUT "to reſtore harmony," <hi>that is,</hi> to <hi>prevent</hi> that civil war, which is juſtly <hi>feared, unleſs</hi> the violences which have been <hi>already</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>to enforce</hi> thoſe <hi>unlawful, illegal,</hi> and NULL acts, be <hi>diſcontinued</hi>?</p>
            <p>If thoſe men, who ſolemnly appealing to God and the equity of mankind, for the juſtice of our cauſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to you and the other members of the Britiſh nation, that "to keep a Standing Army in theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, without our conſent," <hi>is againſt law,</hi> had juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the leaſt ſuſpicion of their admitting <hi>that it was not againſt law to puniſh, without our conſent,</hi> mutiny and deſertion in ſuch <hi>unlawful</hi> Standing Army—Believe me, my dear, devoted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, the moſt iniquitous Adminiſtration, that can be conceived—the <hi>preſent</hi> Adminiſtration itſelf, never would wiſh to obſtruct their proceedings.</p>
            <p>The Extenſion Act is <hi>unlawful, illegal</hi> and <hi>null,</hi> being made to ſupport the diſcipline of an <hi>unlawful</hi> ſtanding army: And ſhould a ſtanding army be made <hi>lawful</hi> in any colony, which God avert! the Extenſion Act would, nevertheleſs, remain <hi>unlawful, illegal,</hi> and <hi>null</hi> in that colony, until the legiſlature ſhould have given it <hi>there,</hi> local <hi>lawfulneſs, legality,</hi> and therefore <hi>exiſtence.</hi> But, you have do reaſon to fear this; for <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi> will effectually prevent the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned traitor from making a motion of that tendency, in any American legiſlative aſſembly, againſt the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a people, protected by the Britiſh conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Regardleſs of every principle of juſtice and policy, the Britiſh Parliament are trying againſt our Liberty, experiments which, if hazarded againſt the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their immediate legiſlative authority, would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly involve Great-Britain in a civil war, and might
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014351_0008_0F91ECFF4D1146A0"/>
produce <hi>another</hi> revolution there. The king is veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſupreme command of all the forces of the nation, wherever they may be ſtationed; but he has no legal coercive authority any where, over the ſoldiers or ſailors, otherwiſe than by local laws, made from time to time, to that effect. And, as the ſafety of every conſtitutional right depends on the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that authority, the other branches of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature grant him but temporary acts, for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſcipline of the Army and Navy, by coercive laws, and for reſtraining or enlarging the power of Courts-Martial in both theſe departments, within the limits of that legiſlature by which they are granted.</p>
            <p>The limited duration of thoſe laws being as ſhort as it appears from occaſional circumſtances, to be conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with public ſafety, the <hi>treaſonable</hi> deſigns of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration may be counteracted with more facility, <hi>than</hi> if ſuch laws were <hi>perpetual. After</hi> the legal expiration of thoſe acts, the King's lawful authority over the national forces, expiring of courſe, can he <hi>puniſh,</hi> or <hi>detain</hi> any body in <hi>that</hi> ſervice, ſince Courts-Martial are <hi>aboliſhed</hi> by law, as they <hi>now</hi> are <hi>in the Britiſh Colonies</hi>? And, if the King would attempt to retain them in <hi>his own</hi> ſervice, how could he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, before he had uſurped an arbitrary power over the purſes of the people?—Could he ſatisfy capricious demands, which would increaſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the knowledge that every man in <hi>his</hi> army and navy would have of the embarraſſments of <hi>their maſter</hi>?—No—for, thoſe ſalutary limitations are <hi>ſolely</hi> intended to preſerve inviolate, our rights of opening or ſhutting up our purſes, as we think fit. They have, till now, prevented ſuch uſurpations, which, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe with ſafety, is the ultimate end of <hi>every other</hi> uſurpation that ever was exerciſed by any tyrant in the world.—It was but to attain <hi>that end,</hi> the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Parliament of Great-Britain have ſo flagitiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the limits of lawful power.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014351_0009_0F91ED000CEB7AD8"/>If you admit as lawful, the extenſion illegally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by a miniſterial Parliament, and machinated, but as a <hi>proviſional edict,</hi> to inſure the ſucceſs of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures reſolved on, relatively to the proſcription of the Boſtonians, and other proſcriptions <hi>in petto.</hi> If you <hi>only</hi> tolerate its illegal operation any longer, the king will not experience thoſe difficulties, which would thwart his arbitrary projects in Great Britain, were his uſurpations to begin there. <hi>His</hi> Parliament might pay us the compliment of renewing the Extenſion, and other Temporary Acts of their own ſole legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for the ſole purpoſe of raiſing a Revenue, to lighten their own burthens, which luxury and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption have already prodigiouſly increaſed, and which your tameneſs will increaſe to a degree, which it is now beyond the power of calculators to aſcertain.— But, you may reſt aſſured that, in a very ſhort time, Adminiſtration will ſport with your Liberties, and ſoon after, with thoſe of the whole Britiſh Empire.— The opprobrious and degrading denomination of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> which now is but an innocent and unmeant miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of a foreign word adopted in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, will ſignificantly deſcribe the real ſtate of every Britiſh Colony, and indeed, of every ſhire in Great-Britain and Ireland!—Never forget that about two years ago, a Crowned Miſcreant compelled the States of Sweden, the Parliament of that Country, to releaſe him from his Coronation Oath! His ſucceſs may tempt others to commit the ſame ſacrilege.</p>
            <p>Our enemies are now terrified at the ſuperiority of ſtrength, which the juſtice of our cauſe gives us over them, in the preſent conteſt. They will be amazed at the effect of their ſlimſey artifices, if, by tolerating the Extenſion Edict, we ſtupidly ſubject ourſelves to a ſet of men, upon whom we can have no check;— who having exempted themſelves and their tools, from the power of our tribunals, will drag before theirs, ſuch of us, who may indicate the leaſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014351_0010_0F91ED00CBD95340"/>
to a better change. Then, our diſguiſed friends, and our open foes, united in the Britiſh Parliament, will, with iron hands and unfeeling hearts, "bind us in all caſes whatſoever." We ſhall be in the condition of the Swedes, French, Spaniards, and moſt other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where now and then, an honeſt man may regret the loſs of his natural Rights, but where, an attempt to recover them would be next to madneſs.</p>
            <p>It will be a melancholy reflection to us, perhaps for many years! that no ſtrictures have yet been tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reſpecting the deſtructive tendency of the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Edict. It is expected that the tried Patriotiſm of our ableſt Writers will inſpire them to hold it to public view, in its moſt minute circumſtances. The ſilence now complained of diſmays our friends, and ſecretly elates our enemies, on the other ſide of the water: It may, in ſome meaſure, exculpate the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Grand Juries, who have not yet brought to juſtice, any of the perſons who are liable to be proſecuted in their reſpective Diſtricts, for crimes committed there, under the unlawful ſanction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Edicts.</p>
            <p>But, every ſuch Edict, or illegal Act of Parliament, being void and null in law, reſpecting its operation amongſt us, it clearly follows, That all the robberies and burglaries committed by Cuſtom-houſe Officers and others, under colour of ſeveral Edicts of a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nullity:—That all the murders and violences, perpetrated under the directions of illegal Courts-Martial.—That the oppreſſion of the ſoldiers, who now are, legally, under the ſole protection of the civil power of the Britiſh Colonies on this continent, where they are unlawfully ſtationed by a deſpotic Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: And that, the enormities which Cuſtom-houſe Officers, and illegal Courts of Admiralty or Vice-Admiralty, or which the deluded ſoldiery in the miniſterial ſervice, have already committed, or may hereafter commit, ſhall be wholly chargeable to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014351_0011_0F91ED018B64BB98"/>
puſillanimous, or treaſonable connivance of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts themſelves, if ſuch crimes remain unnoticed by thoſe, whoſe ſworn, and therefore, whoſe indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty it is to bring them to light and trial.</p>
            <p>O my countrymen! Will you ceaſe to incur the contempt of the world? Will you no longer continue the jeſt of your enemies?—Liſten no more to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling delinquents, who artfully whiſper to you, that your Courts of Juſtice would quaſh ſuch indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.—For God's ſake! Do juſtice to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and integrity of your Judges. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and you will clearly ſee that, were they as corrupt as we know them to be otherwiſe, they would not dare, at this juncture, to betray their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitous partiality. Nay, the moſt profligate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Aſſembly, though he could depend on the concurrence of a majority, of the ſame corrupt principles, would not dare now, to abuſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo far, as to move for a Bill, tending to ſkreen, directly or indirectly, under the illuſory declaration of your aſſent, manifeſted by them only, <hi>any</hi> of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious Acts, which the late Congreſs reprobated, as demonſtratory of "A ſyſtem formed to enſlave America.</p>
            <p>Timid well-wiſhers to their country may object, that our zeal will be fruſtrated by an unprincipled Governor; that, not daring with a high hand, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the proſecution of criminals, protected by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will ſtretch prerogative, even to the pardon of <hi>irremiſſible</hi> crimes, none of which are more ſo than thoſe, by which our ſacred conſtitution is endangered. But, may not the well-known fate of a PORTEUS check traitors, by convincing them, that they cannot always ſhelter themſelves under the wings of prerogative? And, ſhould this prove ineffectual, our holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teaches us, that no worldly conſideration ought to deter the juſt from doing his duty. Our committees, and what is much ſafer, Colonial Conventions, veſted
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014351_0012_0F91ED024C44E268"/>
with diſcretionary powers, will, at laſt, baffle the arts of miniſterial tools, and work our political ſalvation.</p>
            <p>If there be amongſt us a conſcientious lawyer, he certainly will point out to the officers of the unlawful ſtanding army, ſtationed in the Britiſh colonies, the imminent danger they run, by detaining ſoldiers in North-America, under the illegal extenſion edict. As to pettifoggers, we know they are ſeduced by the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a plentiful harveſt; and that, ſelf-intereſt, not juſtice, determines them to act, whatever ſide they undertake to defend. If the miniſter do not value theſe enough to retain them in his ſervice, for ſupporting the unlawful acts, they will, of courſe, rejoice at the almoſt innumerable actions of a civil nature, which may be grounded on the local nullity of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary edicts, and commenced by ſoldiers, for unjuſt detention, loſs of time, and unpaid labour; or for various treſpaſſes, unjuſtifiable before tribunals, which follow the Britiſh ſyſtem of law.</p>
            <p>All injuries ſuſtained by any perſon in this colony, in conſequence of the ſame unlawful ſanction, may be redreſſed, and the ſame offences will be prevented for the future, if we have but ſenſe and firmneſs enough to apply as we ſhould, and where we ſhould. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver too late to do our duty; let us truſt the event to the omnipotent ruler of the univerſe, and he will reward our perſeverance.</p>
            <p>If through ignorance, or inattention, any of you ever gave a verdict, in contradiction to the fundamentals of juſtice; if he admitted the force of any act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which your own colonial laws have given no ſuch force, that man muſt be very unhappy, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he reflects on the injuſtice he has occaſioned; but he is guiltleſs—he deſerves compaſſion.—It is far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with jurymen, who knew the local nullity of acts of Parliament, and by their verdicts, authoriſed their illegal operation!—Thoſe jurymen, and the judges who deſignedly ſuffered it—who have ſuppreſſed the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014351_0013_0F91ED030CFB74B0"/>
warnings and inſtructions which they ought to have given, and ſtrengthened with their eloquence, have been bribed. Whether hope, feare avarice, or any other worldly motive influenced ſuch judges and jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—they have been <hi>bribed.</hi>—They ſtand <hi>guilty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man, of wilful and corrupt perjury.</p>
            <p>Do not believe, my dear countrymen, that infatuated as the junto may be, they hope that the Continental Aſſociation can be diſſolved, by the external, the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defection of any colony, were it even <hi>ours,</hi> which is nearly central, and the moſt liable to ſuch ſuſpicions. A Governor may bribe the majority of an aſſembly, who fancy that they repreſent a people, not virtuous enough to exerciſe their rights of chooſing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives and elective officers, by ballot. Illegal warrants may be iſſued, and remain unquaſhed, for a conſiderable time, to bewilder the bulk of the people with the innumerable doubts, which, it is evident, will ariſe from the untried illegality of thoſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;—to intimidate and oppreſs, till the bench de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the queſtion;—and, in the mean while, to deter the injured from proſecuting ſuch daring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators.</p>
            <p>He may bribe a few trading juſtices, and ſeduce other ſons of corruption and power, who hold, or expect to hold magiſtracy, or other offices, during pleaſure, and are as much afraid of colonial conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the miniſter is of Continental Congreſſes:— But he cannot bribe the body of the people, in whom, originally, and finally, lies the ſovereign power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented for their benefit only, by <hi>one</hi> ſingle perſon.</p>
            <p>All the Colonies, nay, the internal force of any ſingle colony can puniſh a few venal officers, for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the authority with which they are intruſted by their ſuperiors, who are, themſelves, ſubordinate to <hi>another</hi> ſuperior, likewiſe intruſted by, and, as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous experience ſhows, accountable, as well as every one of his dependents, <hi>to the people</hi> at large, whether they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014351_0014_0F91ED03CBF76678"/>
meet in one ſingle ſpot, or in their reſpective diſtricts. The patriotic ſpirit of the American Britons cannot be ſubdued. They will exerciſe their conſtitutional right to hold conventions for their ſafety; a right, which cannot be queſtioned, without openly denying the legal title of the Hanoverian line of our Kings, to the Britiſh crown. Therefore, my dear countrymen, do not baſely relinquiſh that ſacred right, when you ought to exerciſe it. You know that, ſhould you be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a wicked knot of traitors, you will be delivered by your happier neighbours, as ſoon as their aſſiſtance is required.</p>
            <p>The arch-fiend to our conſtitution knows all this: The Colonies which delegated members to the late Congreſs, have already appalled him, that inſolent, cruel, and cowardly wretch, who, a year ago, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his wicked trumpet, that he would not relent, "till he ſaw you proſtrate at his feet!" Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs made him ſtoop to propoſals, which he well knows you will reject with diſdain. He means but to divide and betray you, whom he deſpairs to ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by force. However, he will ſend more troops, more indeed, than he thinks it is prudent now to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge. But it is not ſolely in that reinforcement he confides. Will you believe it, my dear, devoted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, it is in his opinion of your folly! I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to you his grand ſecret— the only reſource left him to extort your compliance.</p>
            <p>Now that the vices of the nation have reduced to a ſtate of impotence, the ſmall portion of virtue which ſtill remains in the Britiſh Parliament, he hopes that a ſuperſtitious reverence for that body, degenerate as it is, will continue to betray you into abſurdities, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent paſſiveneſs! He ſtill hopes that your <hi>inattenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the <hi>Extenſion Edict</hi> will enable him at laſt to defeat your united forces. Your ſupineneſs juſtifies him in believing, and perſuading his aſſociates, that you will always tolerate the operation of that deſtructive Edict,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014351_0015_0F91ED048B359548"/>
which is ſufficient in itſelf, to put all the others in force.</p>
            <p>Can we, without feeling the ſevereſt ſtings of ſelf-reproach, reflect on the many crimes, which, ſince the Extenſion Act was quietly enforced, our inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has emboldened Cuſtom-houſe Officers, and other ſons of tyranny to commit? Oh! had criminal proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions been inſtituted in that country, where the firſt felony, or the firſt degradation of human nature was committed, in defiance of our laws, and under the uſurped authority of Courts-Martial, or rather, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after their firſt unwarrantable ſentence was known!—Had ſoldiers been duly protected againſt their tyrannical maſters, robberies and murders might have been prevented; our brethren at BOSTON could not be dragooned; we might long ago have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the combinations of the parricidal junto, whoſe aim is to deſtroy our conſtitution!—We ſhould no longer fear their dethroning our King, and fixing his Crown on the head of a race of tyrants, whom a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic Parliament juſtly proſcribed, about ninety years ago, as irreconcileable foes to the natural rights of the Britiſh Nation! With truth and ſecurity we might tell the arch-fiend "What do you think of Venal Parliaments NOW?"</p>
            <p>Since no ſophiſtry can delude an incorrupted Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Jury; ſince the joint efforts of the Miniſterial hirelings cannot, without our connivance, hold up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the ſoldiers, the veil which hides from them the knowledge of their civil rights, let us inſtruct thoſe deluded victims; let us openly protect them againſt their oppreſſors. If we adopt this paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mode of reſiſtance, which no political caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, who has ſubſcribed to the revolution Creed, can diſapprove, the miniſter may ſend over as many regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he pleaſes; the intended inſtruments of our ruin will but add to our ſtrength add proſperity. As ſoon as they know it is againſt law to detain
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014351_0016_0F91ED054B6F5A58"/>
them in the army, the miniſterial army, there will be no obſtacle to their deſertion. Then, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sycophants, paid to calumniate and betray the Britiſh colonies, will in vain attempt to perſuade the inſtructed, and leſs credulous ſoldiers, that we ſhall deliver them up to facilitate our reconciliation with the Britiſh Parliament, who will not hear of any propoſal of accommodation, unleſs this, their <hi>ſine qua non</hi> condition, be firſt complied with. If we adopt this generous meaſure, we ſhall enjoy the pureſt pleaſure that can affect freemen—that of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing our fellow creatures, our brethren, from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful bondage. And, if experience can teach us wiſdom, we ſhall ſo cautiouſly grant temporary acts, for preventing mutiny and deſertion, ſhould ever the ſafety of the Britiſh Empire make it again neceſſary to grant ſuch acts, that the abominable project of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing us into a ſtate of Slavery, by the means of a ſtanding army, cannot enter the head of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miniſter.</p>
            <p>The virtuous part of the Britiſh Officers, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, impatiently wait for this manifeſtation of our prudence. They will ſecretly rejoice, as Britons, at the mutiny and deſertion of whole Battalions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may do in their public character, to the contrary. And General Gage, whom his weakneſs and incapacity recommended to a perfidious Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, who emulouſly extol his abilities, though they would not have employed him, if a ſenſible man of an eſtabliſhed military reputation, had accepted the diſhonourable command—That General, whom they have decorated but as a bound victim, may be brought to juſtice, and anſwer for the many crimes, which his thirſt of power, inſpired him to perpetrate, or patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, as the moſt acceptable offerings, which could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate to him his tutelar Deity at St. James's.</p>
            <p>It is not yet too late to purſue this plan of philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy and ſelf-defence; but we muſt exert ourſelves
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014351_0017_0F91ED060B610A48"/>
with activity and conſtancy. If we loſe time, the ſoldiers, not knowing the local nullity of an Edict, made for the purpoſe of detaining them againſt law, on an unnatural ſervice which they abhor, will be afraid of being treacherouſly delivered up, in caſe they deſert. They will not ceaſe to be awed by illegal Courts-Martial, though if they were proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed, they would not fear, but deſpiſe the authority uſurped by thoſe Courts; and the ſoldiers who have been injured by them, or by any military officer, would obtain legal redreſs, ſhould they make proper application.</p>
            <p>If we ſuffer them to be miſled by a ſacrilegious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of their military oath, from which they are releaſed as ſoon as the army is kept againſt law: If we ſcandalouſly forſake them, in vain ſhall we cry out to them, in the ſtrain of the Roman Patriot,<note n="*" place="bottom">
