            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN a Country of much Trade and Buſineſs, and where the <hi>Silver</hi> (which is the beſt <hi>Medium</hi>) is drawn off, the Trade will thereby be greatly diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged.

               </gap> ſome Years a uſeful Expedient; but they being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſcarce, and daily decreaſing, various have been the Projections of ſetting up a <hi>Bank</hi> to the value of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> more or leſs, as the only <hi>Medium</hi> of Trade.</p>
            <p>Before the Conſideration of the ſeveral Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it may be of uſe to conſider, that before the War, 26 or 27 Years ſince, there was a competent Caſh to anſwer the Trade of the Country; and to enquire what it was that drew it in, and how it comes to paſs tis now drawn out; that ſo the firſt may be encouraged, and the other avoided.</p>
            <p>And tho' the Wrecks and the Privateers did bring in conſiderable Quantities, yet many are of the Opinion thoſe were but a ſmall Proportion to the runing Caſh of the Country; but that the Fiſhery was then the <hi>N. E. Silver Mine,</hi> and if Peace conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, may prove the principal Means to draw in <hi>Silver</hi> again; and ſo much the more, if it has all needful Encouragement given by the <hi>General Court.</hi> For tho' tis true the needleſs Expence in many reſpects, as in <hi>Silks, fine Cloth,</hi> both <hi>Linen</hi> and <hi>Woollen,</hi> as alſo the Drinking ſo much <hi>Wine</hi> &amp; <hi>Rum,</hi> &amp;c. has been a great means of carrying off the

               <hi>Silver,</hi> yet this is a Toppick eaſier to ſpeak to, than to redreſs; &amp; is a Matter worthy of the Legiſlators care. And if the <hi>General Court</hi> ſhould lend upon good Security, and without Intereſt, (only paying for the making) great Sums of Bills for inabling Particular Men to carry on any uſeful and beneficial Works, and ſhould give to others ſufficient to Encourage them to ſet up uſeful and profitable Inventions or Trades, it would be not only ſome addition to the Running Caſh, but alſo would prevent much of our Importation. And Encouragement to our Fiſhery would much increaſe our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="7 letters">
                  <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
               </gap>tion, whereby in time, the Difficulties we now labour under, would be abated. For till our Exportation exceeds our Importation, if <hi>Silver</hi> ſhould happen to be brought into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>untry, it could not abide here, but of neceſſity muſt be again Exported to pay the Debt contracted. But as a needful Expedient, and while other Methods can be taken, (the Country Bills failing, and ſhortning every Day more and more) ſeveral have been the Projections of Banks to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Defect.</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſed, is a <hi>Private Bank</hi>; wherein a number of Men, of good Real Eſtates, entering their Names, and Subſcribing for any Sum proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Security they can give in Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take out perhaps half the Sum Subſcribed for, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Intereſt</hi> for what they take out; the reſt of the Bills to be let out to ſuch as will hire the ſame upon good Security; a part of the whole <hi>Intereſt</hi> to be to Publick Uſes, the reſt to the <hi>Bankers</hi>; He
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001855_0003_0FB91D7A1AF91338"/>
that Subſcribes moſt to have moſt Voices, ſo that one Man may have 5 Votes in all Matters, with many other Articles.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Bank</hi> ſeems projected more for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Bankers,</hi> than for the <hi>Publick Good</hi>: For (not to mention many other Objections) till we can be aſſured that not only the preſent <hi>Bankers,</hi> but alſo their Poſterity, will always ſeek the <hi>Publick</hi> above their own <hi>Private Advantage</hi>; What Aſſurance can there be, that thoſe Gentlemen of 5 Votes a-piece, will not by joyning together, eaſily ſway the Votes to their own Advantage; as by drawing out of great Sums to Monopoliſe not only Goods, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; with many other ways ruinous to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>?</p>
            <p>The ſecond Projection is; That the Country Emit <hi>Bills</hi> and let them out upon <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and upon good Security, which will bring in a large Revenue towards the ſupport of the Charges of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>This has likewiſe met with Objections; and till the <hi>Throne</hi> can be ſecured from a Prince of Arbitrary Principles in all times to come, ſuch a <hi>Bank</hi> will be dangerous: For how eaſy will it be for ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> to divert ſuch a large Revenue to his Uſe and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? If any think otherwiſe, they may conſider the laſt 5 Reigns, and ſee if they can aſſure us, that any more than one of them would not have taken hold of ſuch an Opportunity: For tho' (thanks be to Heaven) we have a King upon the Throne, that Studies nothing more than the welfare of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001855_0004_0FB91D7B96D7EA68"/>
yet all Men are Mortal, and as Changes have been in our Kindom of <hi>England,</hi> ſo no doubt may be again; and if a Prince of ſuch Principles ſhould ever Aſcend the Throne, all the Laws of ſecure ſo large a Revenue, would prove but as <hi>Spiders Webs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two <hi>Banks</hi> which are level'd to raiſe a large Income yearly, which muſt alſo have many Officers, and a large Penſion for their Service, are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſed by both; neither of the two Parties, but can ſee danger in the others obtaining their ends.</p>
            <p>A third Propoſal has been, That the Country ſhould make a competent Sum of <hi>Publick Bills,</hi> and lend them to the ſeveral Towns in proportion to their <hi>Rates,</hi> at 5 <hi>per Cent</hi> for 20 Years, in which time the whole being paid in, the Principal to be to ſuch <hi>Town,</hi> who may either let it out upon <hi>Intereſt,</hi> or purchaſe Lands with it for the uſe of the Town.</p>
            <p>This third Propoſal being without the Charge of great Officers and Salaries, and without the riſque of <hi>bad Bills,</hi> or <hi>Cheats,</hi> yet anſwering the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſupplying a Medium of Trade, and having none of the former Objections lying againſt it, may reaſonably be accounted the moſt eligible, &amp; every way preferable, rather than any of the two former, or than that of framing a new <hi>Specie</hi> of <hi>Bills</hi> founded upon the Mortgaged Lands; and all the Country's undivided Lands, which ſo long as any of thoſe <hi>Bills</hi> were out, would bar the Country from ſettling one Town more; and (without the Country's Sanction) would involve the People in new Perplexities how to pay their Specialties for <hi>Province Bills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001855_0004_0FB91D7B96D7EA68"/>And it being ſuppoſed, that many that are rather for no <hi>Bank,</hi> yet joyn in ſome with one ſide, ſome with the other, in order to obſtruct emiting of any; as beſt ſuiting their particular Intereſt: In which caſe a Fourth has been propoſed, (<hi>viz.</hi>) A <hi>Private Bank,</hi> of a competent Number of Men in Buſineſs agreeing together, make <hi>Bills,</hi> &amp; give Security each to other to anſwer them; to let their Books lie open for any Man in the Province to Subſcribe his Sum; and giving in Security ſufficient, to take out what <hi>Bills</hi> he Subſcribes for, without paying any <hi>Intereſt,</hi> only at taking out, to pay for the making, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to be obliged in ſome Penalty to meet once a Year, and pay off the neceſſary Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Caſh be taken out, and then the Books to be ſhut up, and no more <hi>Bills</hi> Emitted, ſave only to change the defective, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a <hi>Bank</hi> might be very Uſeful as a Medium of Trade, and would ſoon obtain in this Province, to be as good as the <hi>Bills</hi> of the other Colonies.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, <hi>Banks</hi> of what kind ſoever, cannot be (in our declining Circumſtances) a compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but only may render us more Comfortable in our conſuming Condition; as a Cordial to a Man in in a deadly Diſeaſe, may be ſome Support till other Means can be uſed; for which Reaſon 'tis preferable to all <hi>Banks,</hi> that the Government Emit large Sums for promoting what may be Beneficial and of a general Good; (<hi>ut ſup.</hi>) which will not only be a Supply of preſent Caſh, but will alſo lay certain and ſtable Foundations of increaſing the Produce of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001855_0005_0FB91D80166229E0"/>
the Country; which is the Intereſt and Wiſdom of all Nations.</p>
            <p>Such as lending large Sums upon good Security, without <hi>Intereſt</hi> for ſome Term of Years, (only pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the making) for building a Bridge over <hi>Charles</hi> River, cutting a Channel at <hi>Sandwich</hi> for ſafe and more ſpeedy Paſſage of Veſſels, if thoſe Works upon Mature Conſideration ſhall be found Practicable. And here being both <hi>Iron Oar,</hi> and a plenty of Wood to work it, and this Country hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great occaſion for all ſorts of Iron Work; it may be adviſable to advance conſiderably in <hi>Bills,</hi> either by the way of <hi>Loan</hi> or <hi>Gift,</hi> to ſuch as will undertake to ſet up a <hi>Finery,</hi> and cauſe it to Work to Effect; which would work the <hi>Iron</hi> better, and in greater Quantities; and by the help of which, <hi>Pots</hi> &amp; <hi>Kettles</hi> might be made here for the uſe of the Country. To encourage which, the Duty laid in <hi>England</hi> upon Hollow Ware, would have no ſmall Influence. True it is, here was a <hi>Finery</hi> in the beginning of Times at <hi>Lynn,</hi> which did not proſper, here not being then a competent Number of People to manage them, nor yet to take off the Wares when made, tho' at half the Price now ſold at. It ought not to be any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in the Undertaking, now both the quantity of Hands to work at it, as alſo to expend the Goods when made, are double; the Price they then were at, being alſo doubled.</p>
            <p>And here being great occaſion for <hi>Nails,</hi> &amp; other ſmall Works, which at preſent cannot be made at the price for want of a Slitting Mill, to ſlit the <hi>Iron</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001855_0005_0FB91D80166229E0"/>
into ſuitable Rods; (for it is found that 'tis as much Labour to fit the Rods, as to make the Nails when the Rod is prepared) If the Country ſhould give or lend a competent Sum to any that ſhall procure Workmen to bring ſuch a Mill to work to Effect here, it would inable the <hi>Smiths</hi> to make a ſufficient Supply of <hi>Nails</hi> for this Country. And if the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at the Caſtle had <hi>Nailers</hi> to inſtruct them, many of them might be imployed in it, which would be a benefit to ſuch Soldiers in their Health. This one Article of <hi>Iron-works,</hi> which might be ſet upon for a few Hundreds, would ſoon ſave the Country ſome Thouſands in a Year.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glaſs-works</hi> might alſo be improved here, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials being all at hand, which in its ſeveral parts, as <hi>Window-Glaſs, Beer-Glaſſes</hi> and <hi>Bottles,</hi> would amount to a very great Sum; and a ſmall Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Country, would be ſufficient to ſet it up here. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Paper</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, working upon <hi>Horn</hi> for <hi>Combs, Ink-Horns,</hi> &amp;c. which with Encouragement, would ſave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try very Conſiderable.</p>
            <p>The improving the ſowing of <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> is alſo a Matter worthy of great Regard; &amp; is much obſtructed by the inability of many to break up Land ſuitable. In which caſe, it would be a good Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to lend them without <hi>Intereſt,</hi> ſuch a Sum as may inable them yearly to break up and Fence in 10 or 20 Acres for that Uſe. This would be of very great Service to the Country.</p>
            <p>And tho' the Crown will always have a jealous
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001855_0006_0FB91D8965222250"/>
Eye upon any Increaſe of the <hi>Woollen</hi> Manufactury here; yet it will rather Encourage the working upon <hi>Linen</hi> or upon <hi>Cotton,</hi> (as in <hi>Ireland</hi>) which with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Encouragement, is capable of a vaſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, by making <hi>Sheeting, Shirting,</hi> &amp; <hi>Callicoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Country being often liable upon a failure of Crops, to be bro't to Extremity for want of Grain; and when a time of Plenty comes, there are but few Buyers, whereby 'tis often run down below a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Price: To prevent both which Extreams, the erecting of Store-houſes or Graineries, would be of ſingular Uſe: And if the Country advance ſome Thouſands for building of Graineries, for ſafe lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Grain, many in a time of Plenty, would lay up their Grain in them; and taking a Receit for it may with it pay their Debts. (As is practiſed in <hi>Germany</hi>) It is eaſy to conceive, that this would be a very great Benefit to Trade, and that which <hi>Holland,</hi> tho' they have comparatively but little Grain growing, yet hereby are inabled in times of Scarſity, to ſupply not only themſelves, but alſo the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations.</p>
            <p>Tho' this Country be large, and much good Land in it, which for want of People, cannot be improved in many Generations; yet a ſhame it is to ſay, This Colony cannot provide themſelves neceſſary Food.</p>

gone out of this Colony, to Plant 12 good Towns in <hi>Connecticut</hi> only; beſides what have gone to other Places. The reaſon of the not improving the Country more, and alſo many going out, when here is want of double the Number we have, is a Matter worthy to be well conſidered.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Setling this Country, Land was eaſy to be attained, and at a low price, which was an Inducement to multitudes to come over Servants: But now the Land being ſo generally taken up, few come over that can live elſewhere; ſo that Servants now brought, generally prove Run-aways, Thieves, or ſome way Diſorderly: To avoid having of ſuch, multitudes have rather choſen to get Slaves, tho' at exceſſive Price; which Practice, tho ſo directly againſt the Peopling the Country, is encouraged in ſtead of being remedied, even by the Laws of the Country. For he that is able to purchaſe a Slave, comes off in the Rates cheaper than his poorer Neighbour that has an Apprentice: tho' indeed in that hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Tax of <hi>Polemoney,</hi> the Maſters are made equal. But he that has an Apprentice, muſt pay more for him, than his richer Neighbour is ſet at for his Slave; &amp; the poor Man's Apprentice muſt Watch &amp; Train, and not only ſo, but in a time of War, muſt be Preſt from him: All which his richer Neighbour is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, beſides his paying leſs in the Rates; to the encouraging of Slavery, and diſcouraging of the Poor; and conſequently to the putting a full ſtop to the Growth of the Country: Slaves being a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather than Addition to the Strength of a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001855_0007_0FB91D8EC4EF5228"/>
Country. <hi>Boſton</hi> alone is ſuppoſed to have 3 or 400 Slaves; which were there ſo many Servants in their ſtead, enough would come out of their time yearly, to people a good Town.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the Hindrances of the Increaſe of the Country; for Remedy whereof, it is humbly Propoſed, That the Country make ſuch Proviſion, that Servants when out of their time, ſhall be entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to 50 or 60 Acres of Land, &amp; a Townſhip appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them; and if others ſhall joyn with them in ſettling ſuch Town, they to pay to the Country a moderate Price for Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch Townſhip not to exceed 4 or 5 Miles Square; for the extravegant Bounds of Townſhips, is that which has occaſioned great Quarrels among themſelves, and alſo given a great deal of Trouble to the <hi>General Court</hi> about pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing new <hi>Meeting-Houſes,</hi> and the Bounds of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts. And ſuch Townſhip (if it may be) to have a Brook or River in it, proper for a <hi>Griſt-Mill</hi> and a <hi>Saw-Mill,</hi> the <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> to be ſet in the middle of the Townſhip, and the Houſes as near as may be to it. And as ſoon as ſuch Townſhip is filled up with Inhabitants, then to appoint another. And this would be the greateſt Inducement to the coming over of Servants, and the greateſt Means of Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Strengthening the Country.</p>
            <p>To effect which, if thoſe Gentlemen that have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſt vaſt Tracts of Land, without any deſign ever to ſettle them by themſelves, Servants or Slaves, ſhould Voluntarily thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> up into the Country's Hands, one half of what may have ſo Ingroſt, in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001855_0007_0FB91D8EC4EF5228"/>
order to furniſh Conveniences for ſuch Settlements, they might be gainers by it in the other half.</p>
            <p>Or if the Country ſhould put a Rate upon ſuch Tracts of Land as lie convenient to ſettle Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips upon, in order to make them willing to throw them up to the Country; ſuch yearly Rate would be more Juſtifiable, and more Equal, than to Rate a poor Man 10 <hi>s.</hi> that has much ado to live; thoſe Eſtates being valued worth <hi>hundreds of Pounds</hi> by the Owners thereof, who keep them only in hopes that as other Places hereafter ſhall be ſettled, they may Advance upon the Price, yet Pay no Rates for them: And in the mean time their poor Neighbours muſt pay perhaps a greater Rate than would be put upon him in the moſt Arbitrary Kingdom in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either of theſe two ways, with what Lands remain yet in the Country's Diſpoſe, would ſoon furniſh Land ſufficient to ſupply Servants as they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Free, and ſupply others that they need not withdraw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if neither of theſe two Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſhould be approved of, If the Country ſhould Enact, <hi>That as often as there ſhould be occaſion, a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Townſhip be lookt out and Survey'd, and made ſure to them, and ſuch others as ſhall joyn with them, they after ſome Years to pay a quit Rent, in ſome Proportion to the former Value of the Land, to the Owners thereof when they ſhall have made out their Claims</hi>; This would be ſo far from being a Damage, that it would be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to ſuch Owners of Lands, by having an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that which if the former Methods continue, can hardly ever be ſettled.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001855_0008_0FB91D9456808F20"/>Some that are good Farmers, who obſerving that the Lands are ſo generally Ingroſt, fear they ſhall not procure ſufficient to ſettle their Children upon, have ſtraitned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and perhaps run in debt to buy Land, to the diſabling them to improve the Lands they before had. For inabling ſuch to improve their Lands, if the Country ſhould lend 100 <hi>l.</hi> without Intereſt, upon Condition that in ten Years time they break up and keep ſubdued 50 Acres of Land; this would be a great Encouragement to them, and would much Increaſe the Produce of the Country.</p>
            <p>And as to Slaves, as was before Demonſtrated, they are a great hinderance to the Peopling and Improving the Country: And the Proverb tells us, That <hi>the Receiver is as bad as the Thief</hi>; and <hi>that if there were no Receivers, there would be no Thieves</hi>: If thoſe are true <hi>Proverbs,</hi> then are not we of this Country guilty of that Violence, Treachery and Bloodſhed, that is daily made uſe of to obtain them; we rendring our ſelves Partakers with them in that Wickedneſs? (For 'tis not to be ſuppoſed, that theſe do voluntarily abandon themſelves to be carried into a Foreign Country, and there to be ſold for Slaves) If therefore the Country in ſtead of many Laws they have made obout <hi>Negroes,</hi> ſhould Enact, That twenty Years hence there ſhould be no Slave in the Country, it would hurt no Man, but would greatly Encourage Servants to come, and neceſſitate their being brought over, to the great Increaſe and Strengthning the Country.</p>
            <p>And now if any ſhall object to what is ſaid, in order to better the Propoſals, for advancing the general Good of the Country; or ſhall add mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ch better Reaſons to Enforce what may be ſaid, they would therein do good Service to their Country.</p>
            <p>But if they Object with deſign to hinder the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hinted at, from private and ſecret Views of their own, however they may eſteem of themſelves, are far from being true Friends to the Country.

            <p>For Anſwer, Can it be thought, that a little Uſe-Money ſhould be a greater Benefit to the Country, than any or all the various Methods hinted at, or that might be thought of?

            <p>Or can it be conceived, that a Committee, tho' well choſen, can Inſpect the Title and Value of Lands in all the remote Parts of the Province, better than the ſeveral Towns can act for themſelves?
