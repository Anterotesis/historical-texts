            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Acknowledge, that it concerns me more than any Man, seriously to consider the Exceptions you make against the Dialogue intitled, <hi>A</hi> DISPLAY <hi>of God's special Grace.</hi> My Conscience bears me witness that it was my Aim and Endeavour in writing that little Book, to promote the Glory of GOD, the Interest of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's Kingdom, and the Welfare of immortal Souls. It is sad indeed, if I have so mistaken my Way, that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>is more adapted to destroy the Power of Godliness, than the worst</hi> Arminian <hi>Performance that ever was written,</hi> as you say it is, (<hi>Page</hi> 23.) and, <hi>that it is impossible for the Pen of a

If these Accusations are just, it is high Time I should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of my dangerous Errors, that I might make my Retrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as publick as the Doctrines you complain of; and join with you, in <hi>lifting up my Voice as a Trumpet against</hi> that Book, <hi>witnessing both to small and great, in season and out of season, the everlasting Misery and Destruction that are in the Ways of it,</hi> as you express yourself (<hi>P.</hi> 17.)—But if on the other hand, it should appear upon a Review of the Case, that the Mistake is on <hi>your</hi> side of the Question, and that there is no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for that harsh Treatment you have given to so many of your Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry (who were pleas'd to honour my Book with their Recommendation) and for your bitter Reflections upon them, to the Injury of their Characters, and the Prejudice of their ministerial Labours, but your own wrong Apprehension of Things; it is then Time for you to reflect upon what you have done, and to remember, that you can't finally find your Account in <hi>beating your Fellow-Servants,</hi> and reproaching their faithful Endeavours to bring perishing Souls to CHRIST.—Let us then impartially consider this Case, in the Fear of GOD. For it will stand neither of us in stead a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Your first Accusation respects the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Libertinus</hi> (my Adversary in the <hi>Dialogue</hi>) concerning which you exclaim in the following Words. <hi>And who is this</hi> Antinomian <hi>design'd to personate? A great part of those who are Zealous for the Work of GOD, without Controverly. And is it applicable to them? No, (blessed be God) I believe the Author could not, to save his Life, find one single Person in each of our Colonies, to whom the Character is adjusted. (P. 5)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer, that I ben't certain what you mean by those Words, <hi>(each of our Colonies.)</hi> You may perhaps intend the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> If so, and if there be not any Person in both those Colonies, who has embraced the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors, you have indeed Cause to bless GOD <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

he has hitherto kept out the fatal Contagion. May the dark Appearances in the neighbouring Colonies, alarm you to be upon your Guard, not only against the more gross &amp; perilious Principles of that Sect; but also against their more p'ausible Delusions, which directly (tho' not so apparently) lead Men into the same destructiveSnare.</p>
                  <p>That you may not any longer be led by Jealousies and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Surmises, about the Reasons of my endeavouring to lay open the dangerous Tendency of those licentious Principles of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> I will give you this plain Account of the Matter. I wrote it as an Antidote against the spreading of that dangerous Disease, which I thought I had great Reason to be apprehensive of. For, It has already appeared in its worst Form; and made considerable Progress in <hi>Pensylvania,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> And tho' the painful Endeavours of a number of Ministers, may have given some Check to it, I am persuaded the Danger is not yet over.—The <hi>Moravians</hi> are coming among us in great Numbers, and endeavouring to make Proselytes; and if we may judge of their Principles, by Count <hi>Zinzendorff's</hi> printed Sermons, they embrace the worst of those Doctrines, <hi>Libertinus</hi> is represented to patronize, in the <hi>Dialogue.</hi> I add to this, <hi>Antinomianism</hi> for some Time past has been, and now is appearing with open Face, in all its Colours, and gaining Ground too fast, in the several Parishes of <hi>Southold</hi> on <hi>Long-Island,</hi> notwithstanding all the Endeavours of the Ministers there, to suppress it ; as I have good Reason to be assured. And the same Thing may be observed, with respect to considerable Numbers in <hi>New Jersey,</hi> who seem to act from the same Principles, in following a scandalous, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and excommunicated Minister, against all Admonitions to the contrary. I might have mentioned some Informations, from both your Colonies in <hi>New England,</hi> of the Danger of these Principles spreading there; had you not assured me, that I could not, to save my Life, find one single Person in each of them, that embrace them.</p>
                  <p>You must allow me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to know my own Views, in that Undertaking; and I do assure you, it is your Mistake, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that <hi>I design'd</hi> Libertinus <hi>should personate</hi> any one of <hi>those that are zealous for the Work of GOD.</hi> I design'd he should personate those only, who are in direct Opposition to it. I design'd he should personate the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> whom you all

                        </gap> damning Error.</hi> (P. 5.) That no Man is farther concern'd in the Character of <hi>Libertinus,</hi> than he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces his Principles. And I take this Opportunity solemnly to declare, that I was so far from entertaining the least Thought, of bringing a Slur or Reproach upon the <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> which has been so conspicuous of late in our Land, or upon any that are <hi>zealous</hi> for it, in any Part of that <hi>Dialogue,</hi> that I was acted by directly contrary Views, in the whole Undertaking. Tho' I must also declare, that I then did, and still do think, that <hi>some</hi> zealous and godly Brethren, who are earnestly and sincerely engaged in that Cause, have run into very great Irregularities; and have thereby been accidentally very injurious to it, in their Endeavours to promote it; and that others (the <hi>Antinomians</hi> in particular) may pretend the Cause of GOD, when they are in the most direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Manner, subverting and undermining it. Upon these Accounts, I could not but hope, it would be of some Service to the Interest of CHRIST's Kingdom, to set <hi>that Cause</hi> in a proper Light; to shew the <hi>Opposers</hi> of that miraculous Work of divine Grace, the dreadful Danger of their Case; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince some of our <hi>godly Brethren,</hi> of the ill Effects of their <hi>mistaken Conduct;</hi> and to detect, and if possible prevent the progress of those mischievous <hi>Errors,</hi> which so openly appear among us, and would take Sanctuary under a pretence of the Cause of GOD and Religion. This, <hi>Sir,</hi> is a plain and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account of my Motives to that Work; and I can't but flatter my self, from the Acceptance that little Book has met with, that GOD has graciously been pleased to bless my poor Endeavours, with some Success.—I now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>your Exceptions,</hi> against the <hi>Doctrines</hi> you are so much displeased with.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dialogue</hi> represents <hi> Libertinus </hi> complaining of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, in the following Terms. <q rend="margQuotes">You shew your <hi>legal</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by teaching Sinners the Necessity of <hi>Preparations</hi> for their coming to CHRIST; and not directing them to come <hi>immediately,</hi> without Delay.</q> Upon which you observe, that <hi>very great Honour was certainly done him, by making him dispute, for Ministers calling Sinners to come to</hi> CHRIST <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; and for Assurance being at some Times the common Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of all Believers.—These two Things, which they make</hi> Libertinus <hi>contend earnestly for, are by a nick Name called</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005161_0007_0F5FE9E22DAAFE88"/>
                     <hi>Conceits, tho'</hi> Anti-Arminian <hi>Tenets, is the proper Name for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, SIR, How unhappy will it prove, if you your self are teaching the very same Doctrine, which you so warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppose; and if your Invectives against it do fully and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily establish it? There were six Things proposed in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as necessary <hi>Preparatives</hi> to a saving Faith in Christ. A Knowledge of the Way of Salvation by Christ, a Sense of Sin and Misery, a Discovery of our natural Impotency and Necessity of Christ, such a Desire of an Interest in Christ as will make us willing to accept him, a Renunciation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hopes and Confidences; and a Discovery of Safety in believing in him, and venturing our eternal Interests in his Hands. And tho' I there declare, that we who hold the Necessity of these previous Preparations, are as earnest with Sinners to believe in Christ <hi>immediately;</hi> as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> can be; yet it is evident from the very<hi>Nature of Things,</hi> that they will not comply with these Exhortations, until they have these Preparations; or such Impressions upon their Minds, as will dispose them to an Acceptance of the Gospel-Offer. This is the Doctrine you oppose.</p>
                  <p>I shall now consider, whether you do not your self teach every one of these Things, as necessary Preparatives to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ, the first, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> A Knowledge of the Way of Salvation, only excepted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dialogue</hi> teaches, that a Sense of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> is previously necessary to our coming to Christ. Mr. <hi>Croswell</hi> teaches, that <hi>instead of giving Sinners long and particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, how to close with Christ in the Way of Duty, it would certainly be much better, to be almost continually sitting before them, the Vengeance of the eternal GOD, who is their Enemy: and to teach and command them in his Name, to come to Christ for Refuge.</hi> (P. 9.) And again, <hi>This Imagination will lessen their Convictions, and lighten their Burden; and for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to lessen the Burden of Sinners, is in Truth, only to stop them from coming to Christ,</hi> (P. 7.) And again, <hi>The plain and strong Tendency of which is, to settle all strict</hi> Pharisees, <hi>upon the damnahu Foundation of their own Works, to keep those who are but little, from being much concern'd about their Souls, to make those who are much concern'd, to lose their Convictions; and to stop short of Christ and the New Creature.</hi> (P.15) And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

not this the very same Doctrine, which you so zealously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? Is it not by your own Account of the Matter, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that Sinners should be sensible of their Sin and Misery; or in your Words, that they should have <hi>the Vengeance of the eternal GOD set before them,</hi> in order to their <hi>flying to Christ for Refuge;</hi> that they should have <hi>Convictions</hi> that must not be lessened, a <hi>Burden</hi> that must not be lightned, since to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Burden stops them from coming to Christ? Don't you your self make it necessary, that we should not keep those who are <hi>little</hi> from being <hi>much</hi> concern'd about their Souls; or make those who are much concern'd to <hi>lose their Convictions?</hi> And have I said any thing more than thin comes to, in the Book you oppose? If Sinners must have the Vengeance of the eternal GOD set before them, in order to their flying to Christ for Refuge: If they must have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, that must not be lessened; and a Burden that must not be lightned, lest they are stopt from coming to Christ: If they must be much concern'd about their Souls; and not lose their Convictions, left they stop short of Christ and the New-Creature; then a Sinner must be sensible of his sinful and miserable State, as was asserted in the <hi>Dialogue.</hi> Thus far then we teach the same Thing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dialogue</hi> teaches, that a Sinner must have a Sense of his natural <hi>Impotency;</hi> and of his <hi>Necessity of Christ,</hi> in order to his coming to him. Mr. <hi>Crosswell</hi> teaches, that <hi>this is what Sinners need to be convinced of, that tho' they must come to Christ, they are absolutely unable to come to him.—The awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd Sinner must have his Way hedg'd up. He must be left in a Wilderness, before he is found of Christ.</hi> (P. 7.) Now, SIR, Where is the Difference between your Doctrine and mine? I suppose, that Sinners should see their Necessity of Christ; and you tell us, that they <hi>need to be convinced,</hi> that they MUST come to Christ. I suppose, that they should have a sense of their natural Impotency; and you tell us that they <hi>must be convinced,</hi> that they are <hi>utterly unable</hi> to come to him, that their Way <hi>must be hedg'd up;</hi> and they <hi>must be lost</hi> in a Wilderness, <hi>before</hi> they are found of Christ. I know no Difference in this Matter, between what is said in the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> and what you say in Opposition to it; but only, that you are pleased to express the same Thing in other Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005161_0009_0F5FE9E3A6279FB8"/>The <hi>Dialogue</hi> teaches that Sinners, in order to a true Faith, must have such <hi>Desires</hi> of an Interest in Christ, as <hi>makes 'em willing</hi> to accept him, upon <hi>his own Terms.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> teaches, that Sinners <hi>being told, that they deserve Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for every Refusal, puts them upon doing their utmost; and convinces them, that really they can do nothing; and so is a Means of humbling them to the Dust; and of causing them to come to Christ, to take the Burden off from their sinking Souls.</hi> (P. 7.) Here then is such a Desire, previous to the Sinners coming to Christ, as puts him upon <hi>utmost Endeavours</hi> to help himself, that lades his sinking Soul with a <hi>dreadful Burden,</hi> when his Disappointment from his false Refuges is discovered: and that finally CAUSES <hi>him to come to Christ,</hi> as his last Refuge, that his Burden may be taken off. And why is not this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as innocent in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as in your Reply?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dialogue</hi> teaches, that a Sinner must <hi>renounce</hi> all <hi>other Hopes</hi> and Confidences, <hi>before</hi> he will come to CHRIST. And Mr. <hi>Croswell</hi> teaches, that <hi>since there is such a violent propensity in Sinners when awakened, to rest in their Duties, such Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these Ministers plead for; and are commonly practiced, will be exceeding likely to keep them from</hi> CHRIST; <hi>and to marry them to the Law their natural Spouse. (P. 8.)</hi> Well then, if resting in Duties keeps Men from CHRIST, it is certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that they <hi>renounce</hi> these false Confidences, before they will come to Christ.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dialogue</hi> teaches, that the Sinner must, previous to his coming to Christ, see such <hi>Safety</hi> in believing in him, as will <hi>encourage</hi> him to venture his eternal Interests in his Hands. And Mr. <hi>Crosswell</hi> teaches, that <hi>Ministers should beseech and command Sinners in his Name to come to Christ for Refuge; and to venture Souls their upon him. (P. 9.)</hi> Very well then, they must be taught, and must be sensible, that Christ is a Refuge for 'em to fly to, that there is safety in believing in him; and that they may safely venture their Souls upon him.</p>
                  <p>And now, my dear Brother, can you think, that you have done justly and charitably, in making such tragical Exclamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those Things, which you yourself at the same Time in Effect declare to be true and right.</p>

                        </abbr> I do invite Sinners to come Christ <hi>immediately;</hi> but yet I do <hi>not</hi> invite them to come immediately.</q>—I must insist upon it, that there is full as much Propriety, in fixing these Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon your <hi>Reply,</hi> as there is in fixing them upon the <hi>Dialogue.</hi> And the very same Reasoning (be it what it will) that shall clear <hi>you</hi> from these Contradictions, will clear <hi>me</hi> also.—And now let us proceed to the Merits of the Cause.</p>
                  <p>I readily acknowledge the Truth of what you say, (P.6.) That <hi>the great GOD calls, invites and commands poor perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners to come to Christ (or believe on him) for Life and Happiness; and that he requires them to come immediately.</hi> And it is therefore the Duty of Gospel-Ministers, to press
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005161_0011_0F5FE9E5B68CC478"/>
Sinners by the most forceable Motives to a present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Gospel Offer. But then, It is our Duty <hi>also</hi> to let them know, that while they remain in a State of <hi>Stupidity</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> while insensible of their Danger and of their Need of a Saviour, or while depending upon their Self-righteous Attainments, they neither <hi>can</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> come to him; and that it is therefore necessary, to use all proper Endeavours to <hi>awaken</hi> them out of their Security; and to shew them, that the Avenger of Blood is pursuing them, that so they may fly to the City of Refuge. And herein I have the Satisfaction to find, that <hi>you</hi> (notwithstanding all your seeming Opposition to me) are really of my Sentiments; and that a greater than either you or I, took the same Method, in exhorting Sinners, <hi>to awake out of their Sleep, and to arise from the dead, that Christ might give them Light.</hi> Eph. 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>But then, Some of our modern <hi>Antinomians,</hi> the <hi>Moravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in particular, do insist upon the direct <hi>contrary</hi> to all this; as appears from a variety of Passages in Count <hi>Zin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zendorff's</hi> Sermons; tho', not having the Book now in my Hands, I can't here point out to you the particular Expressions. They insist upon it, that without any previous preparatory and legal Work, firmly to believe that Jesus Christ is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in particular, puts us into a State of Salvation; and that it is no uncommon Thing for Men to obtain Salvation meerly by this Belief, even in the last Moments of their Life. They therefore, avoid all Methods of awakening Sinners out of their Security; and of giving them any disquieting Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of their Misery and Danger, both in their publick and private Addresses.—I would now appeal to your own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, whether <hi>this</hi> Way and Manner of exhorting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to believe in Christ immediately, be a likely Mean to bring 'em to a saving Faith in him.

this is the most successful Method of preaching, the Method that you your self are in? What then, my dear Brother, has soured your Spirit to such a Degree against the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as to provoke you to such Asperity, towards so many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ministers of Christ, who saw fit to recommend it? Can you find any Thing <hi>there,</hi> inconsistent with this Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Matter? Nay, Are not all the Arguments with <hi>Libertinus</hi> on this Subject, directly aim'd at this View of the Case?—The best Apology I can make for your Conduct is, that you were alarm'd with a Jealousy of something de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, which never came into the <hi>Author's</hi> Thoughts, or the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> 
                     <hi>Prefacers;</hi> and which has no Foundation at all in the <hi>Book,</hi> you are pleas'd to make the Object of your Resentments.</p>
                  <p>I am the more confirm'd in this Apprehension, by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Invectives, against <hi>Ministers giving their Hearers a long Train of Directions,</hi> (P. 7.) <hi>keeping the Way to Christ (as they call it) always open and clear before them; and therefore, instead of guiding them to Christ, they only lead them from Christ to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which they in Effect make a Christ of, (P.8.)</hi> and by your insinuating, that <hi>such Directions</hi> are what <hi>these Ministers plead for.</hi> (Ibid.)—But what is there in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> to give any Umbrage for all these Insinuations? Nothing at all, that has the least Appearance of this kind.</p>
                  <p>When you are finding Fault with <hi>a long Train of Directions,</hi> (P. 7.) and telling us, that you <hi>are not absolutely against all sorts of Directions, (P. 8.)</hi> it must be presumed, that the Directions you complain of, must be such as are specified by you;—Such Directions as <hi>naturally cause Sinners to imagine, that if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them carefully, God will be thereby inclined to save them, such as will lighten their Burden, and thereby stop them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ. (P. 7.)</hi> and such as will <hi>lead them from Christ to Ordinances, which they (in effect) make a Christ of. (P. 8.)</hi> And therefore such Directions, as have a quite <hi>contrary</hi> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to these dangerous Effects, are what you yourself must <hi>approve</hi> of. From whence it follows, that if the whole of that <hi>Conference</hi> now before us, were formed into <hi>Directions;</hi> and every one of those Directions should prove exactly contrary to those evil Effects which you speak of, they must be such as you approve; and consequently you have done unworthily by those

Ministers, by insinuating that they are pleading for such Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as you complain of.</p>
                  <p>If that whole <hi>Conference</hi> were turn'd into the Form of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> they must be these that follow. Sinners must (first) be directed to get a <hi>knowledge</hi> of the Gospel, and an Acquaintance with the Way and Terms of Salvation therein proposed, left they hope for Salvation, they know not how or why. For, <hi>how can they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Rom. x. 14.—Secondly, Sinners must be directed to consider and lay it to Heart, that they are in a <hi>sinful, guilty</hi> and <hi>miserable State,</hi> and that because they believe not, <hi>they are condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</hi> and <hi>the Wrath of God abideth on them,</hi> as expressed <hi>John</hi> iii. 18, ult.—Thirdly, Sinners must be directed to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themselves not only sinful and miserable, but <hi>impotent</hi> and utterly unable to help themselves; and therefore in the last Necessity of an Interest in Christ, <hi>without whom they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> xv. 5.—Fourthly, Sinners must be directed never of rest till they feel such <hi>Desires</hi> after Christ, as bring them to a hearty Compliance with the Gospel-Offer; and a Willingness to receive him upon his own Terms. They must be directed, not to rest until they find that they are indeed <hi>made willing in the Day of Christs Power,</hi> as <hi>Psalm</hi> cx. 3.—Fifthly, they must be directed, to bring none of <hi>their own Righteousness</hi> to Christ, nor to except Salvation from him for their own sake, for their Duties, good Purposes, or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; but to renounce all other Hopes and Confidences, but Christ only, that they <hi>may be found in him, not having their own Righteousness which is of the Law; but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. iii. 9.—Sixthly, they must be directed, never to satisfy themselves till they have such a discovery of<hi>Safety</hi> in believing in Christ, as that they can readily venture their eternal Interests in his Hands, and till they are bro't to that Language of Heart, <hi>To whom shall we go? For thou hast the Words of eternal Life,</hi> Joh. vi. 68.—Seventhly, They must be directed, to do all this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;</hi> for it is a Case of infinite Importance, that admits of no Delay; and yet we must assure them, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>will</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> comply with these Directions, as long as their Darkness, Stupidity, carnal Security, Self-Sufficiency, and Self-Righteousness bolt and bar the <hi>Doors of their Hearts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Christ. Therefore,—Eighthly, They must be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to go to GOD in the use of appointed <hi>Means,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move these <hi>Hindrences</hi> out of the Way, that is, to <hi>enlighten</hi> them, and to <hi>persuade</hi> and <hi>enable</hi> them to believe, that they might be saved; and to <hi>awaken</hi> them out of their Sleep, that they may arise from the Dead, and that Christ may give them Light.—Those are all the Particulars that can be found in that Conference, if the whole of it were turn'd into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Directions. And I appeal to the World, whether every Word of this is not directly contrary to <hi>Sinner's Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that GOD will be inclined to save them for attending Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;</hi> directly contrary to <hi>lightning their Burdens</hi> in a Christless State; and directly contrary to <hi>leading them to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> that they may <hi>(in Effect) make a Christ of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this a true and just Representation of the Case, every Man may see, who will take the Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s to compare it with the <hi>Dialogue.</hi> And from this Representation of the Case, it plainly appears, how little Reason you had to exclaim as you do, (P. 11.) <hi>I must observe, that I never read any Thing more</hi> legal <hi>and</hi> dangerous, <hi>than their supposing that Men must get the Hindrances out of the Way, in order to their coming to Christ; and their Eyes and Hearts somewhat open'd, before they behold him, or receive him into their Hearts.</hi>—I acknowledge with you, that <hi>this and only this is pure Gospel, that Jesus Christ is both Righteousness and Strength; and that poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners must come to him for all that they want.</hi> (ibid.)</p>
                  <p>But you must remember, that <hi>coming to Christ,</hi> was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Dialogue</hi> to signify, receiving him by <hi>Faith;</hi> and was accordingly so explain'd. Now the Question is, Whether the <hi>Hindrances,</hi> such as Men's natural Blindness, Stupidity, carnal Security, Self-Sufficiency, and Self-Righteousness, must not be first remov'd out of the Way, by a Work of the Spirit in <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Humiliation,</hi> before Sinners either <hi>will</hi> or <hi>can</hi> receive Christ by Faith? Answer this directly; and I am mistaken, if you don't teach Doctrines as <hi>legal and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> as this which you so warmly exclaim against—There are but two Ways, in which you can possibly give a direct Answer to this. You must <hi>either</hi> assert, that Men's natural Blindness, Stupidity, carnal Security, Self-Sufficiency,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005161_0015_0F5FE9E8F2B22640"/>
and Self-Righteousness, are <hi>no Hindrances</hi> to Sinners receiving Christ by Faith, which <hi>need to be removed out of the Way,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it; but that Sinners may receive Christ by Faith, while they remain in Such a State: <hi>or else</hi> you must allow, that these Hindrances <hi>must</hi> be removed out of the Way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sinners will or can come to Christ.—I think, upon cool and calm Reflection, you will hardly choose the former of these Answers; and therefore you must acknowledge, that 'tis a proper Method, to imitate our blessed Lord, in calling upon Sinners to <hi>pray to GOD,</hi> that He would remove all Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances, and perswade and enable them to believe in Christ,—and to <hi>open to him, that he may come in, and sup with them, and they with him.</hi>—Thus it is expressed in the <hi>Dialogue;</hi> and not as you are pleased, in a ludicrous manner, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that Sinners must come to Christ <hi>as they are,</hi> if they come at all; they must come as <hi>Sinners,</hi> as guilty, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Sinners, without any Qualifications to <hi>recommend</hi> them to his Acceptance. And therefore it is absolutely necessary, that they be <hi>sensible</hi> of this. For while they are proudly, and with an unhumbled Spirit, endeavouring to <hi>recommend</hi> themselves to Christ, by their good Qualifications and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, this proves a <hi>Barr</hi> in the Way to their Acceptance with him. This <hi>Hindrance</hi> must therefore by <hi>removed</hi> out of the Way; they must come as lost, unworthy Sinners: and receive Christ as a free Gift, without bringing any Thing with them to purchase his Favour, or make them meet for his Acceptance, if they would ever obtain an Interest in him, and his saving Benefits. <hi>The whole need not the Physician; but they that are Sick.</hi> Christ <hi>came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi>—But so much for Answer to your Talk on the Head of <hi>Ministers Duty to call Sinners to come to Christ im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, without first getting the customary Preparations,</hi> as you express it.</p>

                  <p>I have one Argument against this, which it certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you to get rid of as well as you can.

                        </gap> Sanctification, in such a Manner as they have done.</hi> Now the Manner, in which this is done in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and in that very Page you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to, is to clear up their Interest in Christ, by <hi>an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Course of</hi> VITAL <hi>and</hi> TRUE HOLINESS; and no otherwise. This is directly expressed in Terms; and there is not the least Appearance, from any one Expression in that whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, of any <hi>other</hi> Manner of putting Persons upon finding cut their Justification by their Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>Whence I argue,</p>
                  <p>If an habitual Course of <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Holiness does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways so engage GOD's special Presence with those who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, that he <hi>never withdraws sensible Joy and Comfort</hi> from them while they maintain it; '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yet it don't follow, that the maintaining an habitual Course of vital and true Holiness, is an <hi>Evidence</hi> of our Justification.—It is impossible to give any other direct and consistent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Argument, than one of these Two; and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative is at your Choice.</p>
                  <p>I think you must necessarily allow, that one or the other of these Complaints in the Protestation are causeless, and without Foundation. On the one Hand,</p>
                  <p>You represent it as a false and dangerous Doctrine, to teach that a Person can maintain a Course of <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>true Holiness,</hi> without <hi>sensible Communion;</hi> because such as these <hi>always</hi> have Joy and Comfort from God, <hi>while</hi> they maintain such a Life. Well, suppose it to be so, and suppose the Mistake to be as great and dangerous as you please: Yet if so, the maintaining a Course of vital and true Holiness, is then certainly a good <hi>Evidence</hi> of our Justification; for <hi>while</hi> maintain'd, it is <hi>always</hi> accompany'd with sensible <hi>Communion, which two make up the only Foundation of Hope.</hi> This by your 'own Account of the Matter, <hi>is found Speech that cannot be condemned. (P. 19.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You on the other Hand, testify against it as a dangerous Doctrine, to put Persons upon finding out their <hi>Justification</hi> by their <hi>Sanctification,</hi> that is, by <hi>maintaining an habitual Course of vital and true Holiness,</hi> as it is expressed in the <hi>Dialogue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> Well! suppose this to be so, then it follows, that ALL who maintain an habitual Course of vital and true Holiness, have <hi>not</hi> always while they do maintain it, <hi>sensible Communion,</hi> or sensible <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort;</hi> for if they had, it would be a good <hi>Evidence</hi> of their Justification.

                        </gap> for Refuge to the Hope set before him.

                  <p>Can you <hi>(Sir)</hi> deliberately assert, that the Children of GOD <hi>while</hi> maintaining a Life of vital Piety and true Holiness, are <hi>never</hi> exercised with such <hi>Temptations of Satan,</hi> as deprive them of Joy and Comfort?

Don't they experience <hi>the fiery Darts of the wicked one?</hi> which often fill them with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Confusion and Distress; and make them <hi>roar, by reason of the disquietment of their Hearts.</hi> If you say, that this arises only from great Breaches of vital and true Holiness, you have nothing at all to warrant your Conclusion. Our blessed LORD himself was tempted of the Devil. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his Rapture into the third Heavens, had a <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of Satan to buffet him, left he should be lifted up above measure:</hi> and <hi>these Temptations are common to Men,</hi> to the best of Men, I Cor. x. 13. And I appeal to the Experience of all Ministers, who have had most occasion to converse with <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, tempted Souls,</hi> whether they have not often found this to be the Case of some of the most serious, heavenly, and devout Christians of their Acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>I would again enquire, whether none of the Children of GOD, while maintaining a Course of true vital Holiness, may full into a State of <hi>bodily Melancholy,</hi> and so have every Thing look dark to 'em. Is there any Thing more common, than to see the most serious, devout and spiritual Persons, when under such Melancholy, to be under Doubts and Fears about their State? And I am sure, you can being no Evidence to prove, that all those who maintain a Life of vital Holiness, are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this Disease.</p>
                  <p>And I must once more enquire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

other Instances, that might be assigned. The first Instance is <hi>David,</hi> if he was (as it's probable he was) the Penman of the xlii.

He <hi>cryed Day and Night before GOD,</hi> and yet he <hi>suffered GOD's Terrors, till he was distracted.</hi> GOD's <hi>fierce Wrath went over him, and his Terrors cut him off:</hi> And this was not a sudden and transient Distress, but he <hi>was thus afflicted and ready to die from his Youth up.</hi> And yet, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> well observes upon it, there can be no greater Expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But these are different Things. A Man may have <hi>Grace,</hi> and yet not have it at some Times much <hi>acting:</hi> He may have Grace for <hi>Life,</hi> and not have it for <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> tho' it be his Duty to have it. <hi>Rev. iii. 2.—2 Tim. i. 6.</hi> And a Man have Grace <hi>acting</hi>in him, and yet not <hi>know,</hi> not be sensible, that he hath acting Grace.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have done something more than strongly to assert, that <hi>your</hi> Doctrine is contrary to the Experience of the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD's Children.</hi> I have set some opposite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Testimonies before you; and I might have produced as many more, as I could come at Authors of Note, who treat upon this Subject; by which you may judge what Foundation this Exclamation of yours, and of your three Friends, is built upon.</p>
                  <p>Tho' I believe, it is ordinarily the Case of the Children of GOD, that they have <hi>at some times</hi> such Manifestations of the Love of GOD to their Souls, and such Evidences of his Favour, as carry them above any disquieting Doubts and Fears; and tho' I believe also, that a full Assurance of Faith is a more common Attainment, than is ordinarily supposed: Yet I can't but conclude with Dr. OWEN, that <hi>if we look to have such an Evidence, Light into, and absolute Conviction of this Matter, as shall admit of no Doubts, Fears, Questionings, just Occasions and Causes of new Trials, Teachings, and Self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:005161_0024_0F5FE9F06E38C768"/>But still I don't see how careless Sinners, carnal and secure Professors, or <hi>strict Pharisees</hi> (as you express it) can reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably take any Advantage from this Doctrine. For it certainly is the Character of every Child of GOD, that he either hat Assurance; or is earnestly <hi>reaching after it.</hi> No one that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes eternal Things to himself, can rest and be easy in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Uncertainty, whether he is to be <hi>saved,</hi> or <hi>damned</hi> to all Eternity. They therefore who can be easy in such an Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, have a black Mark of Unregeneracy upon their Souls. However, if such as these will improve this Doctrine to their own Ruin, We must nevertheless imitate our blessed Master, in <hi>not breaking the bruised Reed,</hi> and in <hi>not quenching the smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proceed to consider the <hi>Distinction,</hi> by which you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to clear up the Doctrine under Consideration. You say, that <hi>Manifestation, or a Persuasion of our justified State, is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the</hi> Exercise <hi>of saving Faith; tho' Manifestation is not necessary to the</hi> Being <hi>of it. (P. 11.)</hi>—But I suspect, that this won't bear the Trial. Let us consider the Case a little.</p>
                  <p>If this be so, then <hi>Manifestation</hi> or Persuasion of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied State, must be essential to the <hi>first</hi> Exercise of saving Faith (which indeed was the very View in which the <hi>Dialogue</hi> was considering this Matter) and by Consequence must necessarily, in order of Nature, <hi>Precede</hi> our Justification: We must have <hi>Manifestation</hi> or Persuasion of our justified State, even <hi>before</hi> we are actually justified: And so consequently it is essential to the Exercise of a saving Faith, that we have a Persuasion of that which is <hi>not true</hi> in Fact.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that we are justified and have Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Children of GOD, by <hi>receiving the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and are not justified till we have received him. <hi>Joh. i. 12. Rom i. 17. Chap. iii. 30.</hi> and iv. 24. If therefore a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion</hi> that we <hi>are</hi> justified, is <hi>essential</hi> to our receiving Christ; then it is essential to our receiving Christ, that we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded of that which was not previously <hi>true</hi> in Fact. For it is not true in Fact, that any Man is justified <hi>before</hi> he receives Christ by Faith.—There is no Way to get rid of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against your Doctrine; but by asserting, either,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>receiving</hi> Christ, is not the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Faith. Or—</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005161_0025_0F5FE9F158EB68E8"/>2. That <hi>receiving</hi> Christ by Faith, even in its <hi>first</hi> Act, does not (in order of Nature) go <hi>before</hi> our <hi>Justification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or else—</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>our more Persuasion</hi> makes that become a real <hi>Truth,</hi> which was previously <hi>false in Fact.</hi>—All which are palpable Absurdities.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that our receiving Christ by Faith, and our obtaining an Interest in him, are Things <hi>contemporary:</hi> That is, at the same Instant in which we have actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, he is ours. But then, we have no special saving Interest in him, <hi>before</hi> we have received him, nor until the Act of receiving him (in first Exercise of Faith) is <hi>finish'd</hi> and <hi>perfected.</hi> And therefore, to be persuaded that he is ours, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the Act of receiving him is accomplish'd, is to be persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of what is <hi>false</hi> in Fact. Let the Case be illustrated by this Similitude. Supposing a Present be made me on Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my accepting it with my Hand, that Instant I receive it in my Hand, it becomes my Property: But it is not so while I am stretching out my Hand to take it, nor till the Act of receiving be finished. And therefore, if I am persuaded, that it is in my Hand, and is my Property, before this, I am persuaded of a Falsehood; and if I rest in that Persuasion, I lose the Present, and must go without it. The Application is plain and familiar.</p>
                  <p>Another Objection against this Doctrine of yours is, that it opens a wide Door to <hi>Licentiousness.</hi> For if it be true, that the Persuasion of our justified State be <hi>essential</hi> to the Exercise of saving Faith: then all that have that <hi>Persuasion,</hi> will readily conclude themselves to be in the Exercise of saving Faith; whatever other Characters of a true Believer may be wanting. A Man will hardly be persuaded, that he has the <hi>Essence</hi> of a Thing; and yet has <hi>not</hi> the Thing itself.</p>
                  <p>Another Objection is, that this Doctrine is directly contrary to <hi>Scripture.</hi> Thus, Eph. i. 13. AFTER <hi>that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of Promise.</hi>—That to <hi>believe's</hi> to exercise Faith, is what I think no Man can deny. For tho' a Man may be a Believer, yet he never does believe while the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Faith is suspended; and the Text assures us, that the <hi>Sealings</hi> of the Spirit are <hi>consequent</hi> to <hi>believing;</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005161_0026_0F5FE9F1E642EC00"/>
therefore not <hi>essential</hi> to it.—I might produce the like Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> many other Places of Scripture; but I shall be too voluminous. And if you would ice this Point more fully clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be pleased to read Mr. SHEPARD'S <hi>Sound Believer.(Boston</hi> Edition, from P. 185, forward.) And be pleased also to read the <hi>Dialogue</hi> over again; for all the Arguments there stand good against you, notwithstanding this <hi>Distinction</hi> of yours.</p>
                  <p>This appears, because it is by the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Faith (and not by the Habit of it, while the Exercise is suspended) that we are justified. We are justified (as was before observed) by receiving Christ by Faith, or by <hi>actual</hi> Believing in him; and not by any <hi>Habit</hi> of Soul, that we either have or can have, which leaves us to rest short of an <hi>actual</hi> Compliance with the Gospel-Call. Whence it follows, that the boasted Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration (as you are pleased to call it) and the other Arguments there used, stand good against you, For it is certain, that we must have the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Faith, before we can <hi>know</hi> that we believe in Christ, and so are justified by him; since there is no Habit of Faith, that does or can justify us, without the <hi>Exercise</hi> of it; and we cannot <hi>know,</hi> that we have that, which in <hi>Fact</hi> we have <hi>not.</hi> And consequently the Evidence or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of our Justification, is no more <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Faith, than to the <hi>Habit</hi> of it: Your Distinction therefore don't at all help the Case. This Argument and the other Arguments in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> stand yet in their full Force against this Opinion of yours; and you must pardon me, if I still suppose, that they are really Unanswerable.</p>
                  <p>What you say in Confirmation of your Opinion, is true, but not to the Purpose; as was particularly shewn you in the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</hi> It is certain, that <hi>when Men do exercise true Faith, they are always sensible of it,</hi> as you observe (P. 12.) That is, they are always sensible of that <hi>Exercise of their Minds,</hi> which is true Faith. But it is <hi>not</hi> Fact, that they are always sensible that <hi>this Exercise</hi> of the Mind must necessarily be <hi>true Faith.</hi> These are two very different Things. To know what is the <hi>Exercise of the Mind,</hi> when we believe in Christ (as well as in any other Case) is but one <hi>simple</hi> Act of the Understanding. Such an Exercise of the Mind does (upon our Reflection) offer itself to the Understanding, in an immediate and direct View, without any Argumentation or comparing Things
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005161_0027_0F5FE9F633A45A28"/>
together to obtain the Knowledge of it: And therefore must be known and observed by every one that attends to it. Every Man that strictly attends to his own Thoughts, must know what they be, in an <hi>intuitive</hi> way, without any Argumentation at all.—</p>
                  <p>But then to discover the <hi>Quality</hi> of this Exercise of the Mind, and to discover whether it be <hi>saving Faith,</hi> or not, is a <hi>complex</hi> Act of the Understanding; requires the <hi>comparing</hi> a Variety of Things together, and drawing a safe <hi>Consequence</hi> from those Things when compared: And this is not such an easy Matter, whatever may be pretended. How well so ever we are acquainted with the Exercise of our own Minds in this Case, yet before we can have any Certainty that this is <hi>saving Faith,</hi> we must know, upon what <hi>Terms</hi> Christ is offered to us in the Gospel; and whether this Exercise of our Minds be a full <hi>Compliance</hi> with all those Terms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reserve: We must know, that this Faith of ours, is <hi>Specifically distinct</hi> from the <hi>false</hi> Faith of Multitudes, who will finally perish, notwithstanding a strong <hi>Persuasion</hi> of their safe State: We must know, that we heartily <hi>receive Christ,</hi> in his whole Person and Character, in all his Offices, with all the Inconveniences which may attend our cleaving to him; and that we are heartily willing to be, to do, to bear any Thing, which he calls and enables us to: We must know, that we are willing to <hi>forsake Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Sisters; yea, to hate even our own Lives also, for his Sake;</hi> and to <hi>take up our Cross daily and follow him.</hi> And is this such a plain and easy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that every one who exercises Faith, <hi>must know it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I acknowledge indeed, that the Spirit of GOD <hi>can,</hi> when he pleases, and very often <hi>does,</hi> shine into the Soul of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, with so full and clear a Light, as to dispel all Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Difficulty; and give a full View of the Exercise of Faith, in all these Particulars; and thereby <hi>witnesses with our Spirits, that we are the Children of GOD:</hi> But he has no where <hi>promised</hi> such a Discovery, to every Act of Faith; and it is certain in Fact, that he <hi>does not</hi> always grant it.</p>
                  <p>You next cite a Text of Scripture, to prove your Opinion. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> I Joh. V. 10. But (to pass all other Remarks) the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005161_0028_0F5FE9F6E9C31210"/>
Question is, What is <hi>that Truth,</hi> to which the Believer hath the Witness in himself; or what his Faith is a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of? It must either be the Truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Faith is a Witness in our selves; as the Text is generally understood, and as is most agreable to the Context: Or else, the Truth of <hi>our personal Profession,</hi> and so the Safety of our ownState.—If we understand the <hi>former</hi> of these Sense to be intended, it will prove Nothing to your Purpose. For we may have such a Faith in the Son of GOD, as will make the Truth of Christianity evident and unquestionable to us; and yet have no Evidence of our own Justification.—If we understand the Text in the <hi>latter</hi> Sense, it will, if duely considered, prove as little to your Purpose. For a Man may <hi>have</hi> the Witness in himself; and yet not always <hi>hear</hi> that Witness speak, nor certainly <hi>know</hi> the Truth of what it does speak. To exemplify this, we read in the 7th and 8th Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of this same Chapter; <hi>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost;</hi> and <hi>there are Three that bear Witness on Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood.</hi> These always bear Witness unto all Men under Gospel-Light, of the Truth of Christianity. For <hi>this is the Witness of God, which he bath testified of his Son.</hi> (Verse 9th.) But do all Men <hi>receive</hi> this Witness; and <hi>feel</hi> the Force and Truth of what is witnessed? Alas, it is quite otherwise. So in the present Case: It is one Thing, to have a Witness of this Truth <hi>in</hi> our selves; and another Thing, to have it witnessed and made evident <hi>to</hi> our selves, to our full Conviction and Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the Consideration of your last Complaint; which is, that <hi>our Author and his seven Witnesses are pleased to tell us, that Men may be good Christians, tho' they never bad any clear Manifestations of the Love of</hi> GOD; <hi>and that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must find out their Justification, by their Sanctification</hi> (P.12.)</p>
                  <p>As to your first Article, the Words in the Dialogue are, <hi>(pag.</hi>108.<hi>)</hi> 
                     <q rend="margQuotes">How many true Believers are there, who may have never experienced <hi>such clear,</hi> RAVISHING, and UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUESTIONABLE <hi>Manifestations</hi> of the <hi>Love of GOD</hi> to their Souls?</q>—But you have be'n pleased to express it very differently, so as quite to hide the genuine Purport of the Passage: Whether this was upon Design, that you might
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005161_0029_0F5FE9F7EAE2F548"/>
make the more plausible Appearance in your Opposition to it, or not, you can best tell.—I have already spoken to this Subject; and shall therefore pass it over now; and proceed to the last Part of your Complaint, That <hi>Persons are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finding out their Justification, by their Sanctification.</hi> It must be observed, that the <hi>Sanctification</hi> by which Believers are put upon evidencing their Justification, in the <hi>Book</hi> you oppose is thus described; <hi> "The Fruits of the</hi>SPIRIT in Heart and Life—"An habitual Course of VITAL and <hi>true Heliness</hi>—"A <hi>Principle</hi> of Holiness in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and a Carefulness to be practically holy in Life and Conversation.—"Sorrow for and Hatred of all Sin, Love to Holiness; and unfeigned Endeavours of Conformity to GOD in all Things—"Finding the <hi>purifying Effects</hi> of FAITH—"Having <hi>old Things past away,</hi> and <hi>all Things become now.</hi>—This, all this, and nothing but this, is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as an Evidence of our Justification.—And now, let us consider what is <hi>your</hi> Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Matter. You thus represent the Doctrines, which you charge us with:—<hi>That a good Life,</hi> i. e. <hi>good Works, are a sufficient Evidence of a Man's Justification. (P.</hi> 13.<hi>)</hi> That <hi>we do so much Honour to</hi> Morality, <hi>in such a Day as this, as to make it a good Evidence of a Man's Title to the heavenly Inheritance, when be can find</hi> nothing <hi>else.</hi> (Ibid.) That we <hi>say a Confederacy</hi> (with the Arminians) <hi>in this one Article of a good Life's being a sufficient Evidence of a justified Sate.</hi> (P. 14.) That <hi>these Ministers give it under their Hands, that Men may conclude, that they are good Christians, from the Goodness of their Lives.</hi> (P. 17)</p>
                  <p>And now, my dear Brother, I appeal to the World, and even to your self, whether this be a just and fair Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Case. Look back, I pray, and consider what <hi>Motive</hi> you could have to insinuate, that we hold such Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines as you there represent; unless it were to blacken our Characters, prejudice your Readers against us, and find a groundless Occasion of Triumph! You tell us, that you <hi>

                        </gap>ould gladly have let them</hi> (the Boston-Ministers, who sign'd the Preface to my Book) <hi>alone, if your Conscience would have let you alone.</hi> (P. 18.) But would not your Conscience let you alone, without treating them with so much Injustice and Injury! Or indeed how could it let you alone, while you were doing this!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005161_0030_0F5FE9F8AC142A18"/>These however are the <hi>Doctrines</hi> you oppose, which you calculate your Arguments against, and which you cry out of, in such a warm and vehement Manner. But how do all your Exclamations at all affect the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> where there are <hi>no</hi> such Doctrines to be found?—Will it satisfy you, if I now publickly declare, that I do not think, that merely an external <hi>good Life,</hi> i. e. <hi>good Works,</hi> is a sufficient Evidence to any Man, of his Justification; and that I do not do so much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Morality,</hi> as to make it a good Evidence of a Man's Tide to the heavenly Inheritance, when he can find <hi>Nothing else.</hi> If this will satisfy, I will make that Declaration as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and as repeatedly as you can reasonably desire; and I doubt not, those <hi>Boston-Ministers,</hi> to a Man, will join with me. But yet I must have better Light, before I can renounce one Article of what is said in the <hi>Dialogue</hi> upon this Subject; for the following Reasons.</p>

Hope.</hi>—I have not here represented to you a mere Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my <hi>Imagination,</hi> but a <hi>Case in Fact,</hi> which as to the Substance of it often occurs.</p>
                  <p n="4"> 4. Another Reason, why I must insist upon the Truth and Importance of <hi>this Doctrine,</hi> is, because the <hi>contrary</hi> to this opens a wide Door to a <hi>false Hope</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> and if once ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received, might be a Means to deceive Multitudes of poor Souls, to their eternal Perdition.—If poor Sinners can once persuade themselves, under the Influence of a <hi>warm Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> that they are the <hi>Favourites of Heaven,</hi> and that they are not to evidence their Justification by their <hi>Sanctification,</hi> they may go on peaceably and securely, even with Transports of Joy, in Expectation and imaginary Assurance of Happiness, tho' they have never experienced that great and important Change of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> and tho' they fall vastly snort of that <hi>spiritual Mind</hi> and <hi>heavenly Conversation,</hi> which is the distinguishing Characteristick of a <hi>Christian indeed.</hi> That this has be'n, and still is, the Case of Multitudes of poor deluded Souls, is evident to the World. Great and numerous Sects and Parties have taken their Rise and Progress from this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Mistake.—From this delusive Dream sprang up the <hi>Familists, Muggletonians, Ranters, Seekers, Quakers, Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</hi> &amp;c. in the last Century. From hence likewise did the <hi>French Prophets</hi> take their Rise, some Years ago. And the present <hi>Moravianism,</hi> which so greatly threatens our Land, is the Offspring of the same haughty and deluded Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I must in faithfulness add, that I have never known the Time, when the Ministers of Christ had a louder Call to stand up for the Cause of <hi>Holiness,</hi> or vital and practical Christianity, than they now have.</p>
                  <p>You will Answer to this (as in <hi>P.</hi> 18) that tho' <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes Holiness the Mark of a justified State; yet not separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Witness of the Spirit, and the divine Sealings, which the Scripture makes the common Priviledge of all Believers.</hi>—Not to take Notice of the <hi>Impertinency</hi> of this Answer, <hi>Holiness</hi> undisguised, <hi>true &amp; vital Holiness,</hi> I mean, which is the necessary Evidence of <hi>saving Faith,</hi> and a good Estate, such Holiness as was consider'd in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi>) being in itself a <hi>Witness of the Spirit,</hi> and a <hi>divine Sealing</hi> to Believers; I must observe, that those under such warm Imaginations, will readily answer in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005161_0034_0F5FE9FBB5171850"/>
your Words, <hi>that when Men do exercise true Faith, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways sensible of it (P. 12.)</hi> They themselves are accordingly <hi>sensible</hi> of it; and therefore <hi>know</hi> that they have true Faith. They may answer to every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hing of this Kind, that can be said to them, as you do, that <hi>the Way to know that a Man is really justified, is to find that in himself, that aoth justify; and not to find that which don't justify.</hi> (P. 19) (Your Language here does not seem to <hi>Anti-arminian;</hi> but I spare Reflections of this Nature) Now, they suppose they find <hi>this;</hi> and are therefore safe.—They may add, that <hi>a Man may as easily make a World, at maintain a Course of vital and true Holiness, without Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation.(P. 20)</hi> They therefore, as they imagine, do maintain a Course of vital and true <hi>Holiness</hi> (not withstanding their Sin and Imperfection) for they have <hi>Manifestation,</hi> which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to you and them) is <hi>essential</hi> to such a Life, and therefore speaks the Being of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another Reason, why I must yet hold fast <hi>this Doctrine,</hi> is; that it has been constantly taught by <hi>all our eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> in all Ages of the Church, And I have not such an Apprehension of my own Sufficiency, as to venture to forsake <hi>the Footsteps of the Flock,</hi> without better Reason for it.—There have indeed numerous <hi>Sectaries</hi> risen in the Church, in the several Ages of it, who have taught such Doctrine as that I am now opposing: But there have never been wanting such eminent Servants of Christ, as have opposed and refuted the dangerous Mistake. And it has ever remained (as far as I have been able to observe) the <hi>received Doctrine</hi> of the true Church of Christ, from the <hi>Apostles</hi> Times until now, that <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (such Sanctification as I have described) is a good <hi>Evidence</hi> of a <hi>justified</hi> State. Where there have been great Differences about other Matters, this has still be'n agreed upon, as a sacred Truth. And I believe, it will be hard for you to find <hi>one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Divine</hi> of Eminency in the Church (the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and such <hi>Sectaries</hi> as are above mention'd, only excepted) who will contradict this Truth.—If any would see this Matter set in a strong, full and clear Light, let 'em read that excellent Book before mention'd, Mr. SHEPARD's <hi>Sound Believer. (Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>-Edition, from p. 236, to p. 247.)

                  <p>But it's now Time to consider what you have to say against this Doctrine. <hi>You desire</hi> (you say) <hi>to produce your Cause; and to bring forth your strong Reasons against it.</hi> (p. 15.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your first Reason is, <hi>It's adapted to settle all strict Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, upon the damnable Foundation of their own Works. Among the many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of strict Pharisees, into whose Hands that little Book may come, is there one but may think himself a good Christian, according to it? No, not one. (p. 15)</hi>—This requires but a short Answer. If a strict Pharisee may have the Fruit of the Spirit in his Heart and Life; if he may maintain an habitual Course of vital and true Holiness; if he may have a Principle of Holiness in his Heart, &amp; be careful to be practically holy in his Life and Conversation; if he may have a Sorrow for, and Hatred of all Sin, a Love to Holiness, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seigned Endeavour of Conformity to God in all Things; if he may find in himself the purifying Effects of Faith; if he may have old Things past away, and all Things become new in him; and yet remain but a <hi>strict Pharisee</hi> still. your Argument is just. But if not, it is altogether impertinent; and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justisable Reproach to those Reverend Ministers, who attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as well as to the Author of that Book.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005161_0036_0F5FE9FD29308288"/>
For it is such Holiness, described in the very Words above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is proposed in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as an Evidence of our Justification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your second Reason is, that <hi>it tend, to keep those who are but little concerned, from being much concerned, about the Things that belong to their Peace. (p. 16)</hi> To which it's sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that they who have the Sanctification described in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> have no Cause of distressing Concern about their State: But have Reason to adore and magnify the Riches of that Grace, by which they have been translated out of the Kingdom of Darkness, into the Kingdom of God's dear Son.—And on the contrary, they who have not the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication there described, have Reason to be awakened by what is there taught, since it is evident concerning them, that they are in a State of Death and Perdition.</p>
                  <p n="3"> 3. Your third Reason is, that <hi>it tends to make those who are in the Bitterness of their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uls enquiring what they shall do to be saved, lose their Convictions, and so stop short of Christ and the new Creature.</hi> The same Answer will serve to this, as was given to the last Argument. For it is certain, that such who have the Holiness described in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> are in Christ; and are new Creatures already; (as I have fully proved) and therefore, cannot be in danger of stopping short of Christ and the new Creature. And as for those, who have <hi>not</hi> that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness there described, the <hi>Dialogue</hi> tends to awaken them, and not to beat off their Convictions, since it expressly represents and proves them to be <hi>the Children of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Your fourth and last Reason is, that <hi>Fire doth not more naturally ascend upwards, than this Doctrine tends to fill the World with Opposers to the glorious Work, which God is now carrying on in the Multitude of his tender Mercies.</hi> (p. 16)—To which I answer, I have prov'd the Doctrine which is taught in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> to be agreeable to the Word of God; and therefore it cannot, unless by accident, any Way tend to fill the World with <hi>Opposers</hi> to the <hi>glorious Work,</hi> which God has be'n carrying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>manifest</hi> among us, when you rank those who are pleading for the Necessity of true <hi>Holiness,</hi> among the <hi>Opposers</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>That there <hi>has been a most glorious Manifestation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> in the Conviction and hopeful Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>great Numbers</hi> in these Provinces, is what <hi>ought to be acknowledged to the Praise of GOD, by all sincere Christians.</hi>—But, that there is a strong and violent <hi>Opposition</hi> to this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonishing Progress of GOD's glorious Grace, is a sad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Truth.

What a Pity is it, that you, or any of your zealous godly Brethren, that join in Sentiment with you, should prove so much as a <hi>remote Occasion</hi> of undermining that Work, Which you have been Instruments of building up!</p>
                  <p>If now you are offended with me, for this plain dealing and undisguised Representation of the Case; if you are pleased to rank me among the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and to censure me for an <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> of the Work of GOD; I shall have this Advantage of you, I can chearfully and patiently bear the Reproach, hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love you, and pray for you; and I hope, I shall find the Comfort of a forgiving Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Let us in the next Place consider what is according to <hi>your</hi> Account of the Matter, <hi>a good Evidince</hi> of our Justification. <hi>As joyful Discoveries of Christ</hi> (you tell us) <hi>are a vain Hope, without Holiness; so is Holiness without these.

                  <p n="1">1. It will appear utterly <hi>inconsistent with the rest of your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>—With respect to <hi>Holiness</hi> being in itself an Evidence of our Justification, you say, <hi>There is Death in that Doctrine, it leads right down to the Regions of Darkness and Habitations of Despair.</hi> (p. 14) And <hi>among the many Thousands of strict Pharisees, into whose Hands that little Book may come, is there one but may think himself a good Christian according to it! No, not one.</hi> (p. 15.) Whence I argue, that if <hi>Holiness,</hi> in it self, be no Evidence at all of our Justification, but what has <hi>Death</hi> in it, and what may be obtain'd by every strict <hi>Pharisee;</hi> and (as you also express it) by every <hi>close Hypocrite</hi> under Heaven;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005161_0040_0F5FE90FE1A013F8"/>
then it will be no Evidence at all of our Justification, when it is <hi>accompanied</hi> with joyful Discoveries of Christ. Whatever Evidence our joyful Discoveries may be, <hi>Holiness</hi> (according to you) can be none at all. This is necessarily true: or else it must be true, that every strict <hi>Pharisee</hi> and every close <hi>Hypocrite</hi> under Heaven, tho' they have <hi>before</hi> no Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but what <hi>leads right down</hi> to the Regions of Darkness, and Habitations of Despair; yet <hi>when</hi> they have (or imagine they have) such <hi>Discoveries,</hi> they have <hi>good Evidence</hi> in their Favour. That is, in plain Terms, <hi>Holiness</hi> is <hi>no Part</hi> of our Evidence that we are in a justified State. For can that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Part of our Evidence of a justified State, which <hi>leads right down to Hell,</hi> and may be obtain'd by every strict <hi>Pharisee</hi> and close <hi>Hypocrite</hi> under the Heavens. All the <hi>Discoveries</hi> in the World won't alter the Nature of <hi>Holiness;</hi> it will please GOD no better, and consequently be no other Evidence for us, when <hi>accompany'd</hi> with joyful Discoveries, than before. The Evidence therefore, must (according to you) rest whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon <hi>joyful Discoveries</hi> of Christ. And will you stand to this? No. For you observe—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These filthy Dreamers</hi> (who imagine this) <hi>are as far from the Truth, as He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The Evidence from <hi>Holiness</hi> alone leads right down to <hi>Hell;</hi> and may be obtain'd by every strict Pharisee, and close Hypocrite under Heaven. It can therefore certainly have Nothing in it, but what is <hi>bad:</hi> Nor there can Nothing else lead right down to <hi>Hell;</hi> there can be Nothing else in the Character of a strict <hi>Pharisee</hi> and close <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> We have no Evidence then remaining, but <hi>joyful Discoveries;</hi> &amp; yet he that receives these <hi>alone</hi> for Evidences in his Favour, you tell us, <hi>is as far from the Truth, as Hell is from Heaven.</hi> That is, <hi>Both</hi> these Evidences <hi>separately</hi> consider'd, have <hi>Nothing</hi> at all in 'em. But tho' they be, <hi>Each</hi> by it self, <hi>Cyphers;</hi> yet <hi>Both</hi> being put together, they make up a substantial Sum.—It is your Part to clear yourself of this Inconsistency in your Discourse, as well as you can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. I also charged this Doctrine of yours, with being <hi>contrary to Truth.</hi> Which thus appears: If <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> are never right and well grounded, but when they <hi>flow from good Evidence of our justified State,</hi> then they ought not to be

considered as the <hi>Evidence</hi> it self, or any <hi>Part</hi> of the Evidence of our Justification. But the former is true; as is fully made appear in the <hi>Dialogue</hi> (p. 47.) to which I refer you; and therefore the latter is true also. Our <hi>Joy</hi> must <hi>arise</hi> from and bear <hi>Proportion</hi> to the <hi>Evidence</hi> we have of our justified State, or else we rejoice without Rule or Reason. And if our <hi>Evidence</hi> of our Justification be <hi>previous</hi> to our Rejoicing, and must in Order of Nature go before it; then our <hi>Rejoicing</hi> can be no <hi>Part</hi> of that <hi>Evidence.</hi>—The <hi>Spirit of GOD</hi> first <hi>witnesseth with our Spirits,</hi> by shewing us the <hi>Evidence</hi> of our Justification; and thence arises the <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> of Believers. When their Interest in Christ becomes sensible &amp; fully evident to 'em, <hi>Joy</hi> is then no longer at their Command; they can't help <hi>rejoicing with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</hi> But when any Man rejoices in his good State, without <hi>previous Evidences</hi> of it, his Joy is unreasonable and delusive. True it is, there may be a very <hi>quick Transition</hi> from Darkness, to spiritual Joy and Comfort; because the Spirit of GOD can very quickly give good and clear Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Justification, as was shewn you in the <hi>Dialogue.</hi>—In a Word, tho' Joys Comforts are proposed in the Scripture, as the blessed <hi>Priviledge</hi> of Believers; yet they are no where considered as an <hi>Evidence</hi> of our Justification; nor do I know of one <hi>Promise</hi> of Salvation, in the whole Bible, made to <hi>rejoicing</hi> in a comfortable <hi>Persuasion</hi> of our Interest in the Favour of GOD.—Don't forget here to distinguish between <hi>this,</hi> which is a <hi>Priviledge</hi> or Benefit, and that <hi>delighting our selves in GOD,</hi> which is a <hi>Duty,</hi> of everlasting Obligation, and of possible Performance (in some Degree) when those transporting Comforts are not enjoy'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>last Thing</hi> before me is, to consider that strange As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of yours, that <hi>a Believer thus deserted</hi> (i.e. so as to want sensible Joy, and ravishing clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

These Things you strongly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, without any Proof (or at least without any Thing that appears to me, to carry the least Countenance of Proof in it)

                  <p>That I may effectually convince you (and others who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the like Sentiments) of your Mistake in this Matter, I will answer you in the Words of two very eminent Divines, both of much greater Learning, and of much greater Experience in these Things, than either You or I.</p>
                  <p>Dr. COTTON MATHER, in his <hi>Case of a troubled Mind,</hi> (P 13,—15.) thus shews his Opinion.—<q rend="margQuotes">It was well remark'd by the great <hi>Voctius</hi> in his excellent <hi>Asceticks</hi> [a Book highly worthy to be studied by all Candidates of the Ministry] that such bright <hi>Luminaries</hi> as the <hi>Saints</hi> of GOD, are they who suffer these <hi>Eclipses.
