            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHOEVER is no entire Stranger in our <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> knows what Animoſities, Diſputes and Contentions have ariſen, and are ſtill ſubſiſting in the ſame; ſo that it is almoſt become a <hi>Meſech.</hi> May the Love of Truth, conſtrain me to aſcribe them unto their real Cauſe! that they who have raiſed, may anſwer for them. Our intended College is the Bone of Contention, all will grant: But how it comes to be ſuch, and who were the Inſtruments of changing and perverting, what was by our Aſſembly intended for a Bleſſing, into a Curſe, about that all do not agree: The Caſe to me, notwithſtanding, is as plain, as any Thing in Nature can be; and will be evident, I believe to all, who open their Eyes to the Light of Truth. Were my Neighbour, with whom heretofore I lived in good Harmony, to come to my Houſe, and in a peremptory and inſolent Manner, to demand of me ſomething I eſteemed the moſt valuable of all my Poſſeſſions, ſeizing the ſame in theſe Words, <q>Friend, this I muſt have, whether thou wilt let me or not;</q> And I were to return his Compliment; <q>What meaneſt thou, inſolent Man? be gone;</q> And ſo ſaying, ſnatch it out of his Hands: And this kind and mannerly Neighbour of mine, thereon to go and alarm the Neighbourhood, complaining of my falling out and breaking with him: Would not the Caſe be plain, my Neighbour behaved like an odd ſort of a Man? Or, that I may ſet off the Caſe yet in a clearer Light: There
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007456_0003_102DAEA8C559F308"/>
once lived two Siſters near by one another, the Name of the one was <hi>Politeſſa,</hi> and the Name of the other <hi>Prudentia. Politeſſa,</hi> one Day came to <hi>Prudentia,</hi> and in a gay Air, accoſted her thus; Ah! Lard bleſs me, Siſter <hi>Prudentia,</hi> I dont know, what thou intendeſt to do with thy Children, poor Creatures! I am affraid thou wilt make them all as aukward Prudes as thy ſelf; they never will be gay, if they ſtay with thee; let them come to me, I will put them, in the firſt Place, to the dancing School; and next, I ſhall take Care to learn them all my gay and grand Airs; and that they may the better take them, to be ſure, let them never come within thy Houſe, for they would be infected with thy low and mean Demureneſs. Nay, I intend to make them ſuch fine Ladies, that they ſhall for ever be aſhamed to own thee for a Mother: But thou ſeeſt Siſter, how much thou art obliged to me for my Propoſal, that I expect thee to pay for the Education of my Children, as well as for thine: Don't look ſo grave, for do it thou ſhalt; I have already agreed with the dncing Maſter, to take all of them. Siſter! Siſter! replied <hi>Prudentia,</hi> is it not enough that thou ſpoileſt thy own Children; wouldeſt thou alſo do it to mine? No, Siſter, no; that ſhall never be. Now <hi>Politeſſa</hi> began to grumble, and ſcold, upbraiding <hi>Prudentia,</hi> with an unſiſterly Behaviour: Whereon <hi>Prudentia</hi> withdrew into another Room, and <hi>Politeſſa</hi> went off in a mighty Buſtle, complaining grievouſly to all ſhe met, how ill <hi>Prudentia</hi> had uſed her; although, at the ſame Time, <hi>Prudentia</hi> had the greateſt Reaſon to complain, I think. Were I not afraid of muliplying too many Similitudes and Compariſons, to illuſtrate one and the ſame Thing, which was ſelf-evident before, I ſhould here bring in the Diſputes at preſent ſubſiſting between us and our Neighbours the <hi>French.</hi> It was in Time of profound Peace, that they began to build Forts on the Lands along the <hi>Ohio;</hi> we thereon are all in Arms, threatning them War: What if the <hi>French</hi> ſhould call us bad Neighbours, Promoters of War, Strife and Contention; will not, muſt not every rational Perſon, aſcribe the Cauſe of thoſe Commotions to them, on Account of their unjuſt Encroachments on our Borders, and their Endeavours to take from us what is our Property?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007456_0004_102DAEAA48B0BB40"/>Now, if any Man in his right Senſes, who will not be duped, conſiders what hath happened among us, will he then any longer be at a Loſs to aſcribe our Strifes, Quarrels and Contentions, to their real Cauſes? Was there not a Sum of Money raiſed by our Aſſembly, in order to erect a College or Seminary of Learning for the Education of Youth? And did not a certain Party petition for, and obtain a Charter, in which the Preſident is appointed for ever to be a Member in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and for Morning and Evening Worſhip, to be uſed the Liturgy of the Common Prayer Book, or a Collection taken out of the ſame, and by far the Majority of Truſtees ſtrenuous Propugnators for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Act of Parliament eſtabliſhed in South Britain, but not here? And will not our Youth, by this Conſtitution, be under the ſole Government of that Party (as yet not numerous in this Province) and thereby be imbued with their Principles, ſo that High Church be brought in a likely way to triumph over us? Were a Heathen Emperor, the Subjects of whoſe Empire were half Heathens and half Chriſtians, reſolved to make the whole, or by far the major Part embrace Heatheniſm, I think he could not fall upon a better Scheme to accompliſh his Deſign, than to entruſt the Education of Youth to Heathens. Should a popiſh King, whoſe Subjects were partly Papiſts, partly Proteſtants, take a Reſolution to make Popery prevail, what better could he do, than appoint popiſh Preſidents and Tutors in the Seminaries of Learning? And is there a Country or Province, in which there are ſeveral Denominations of Proteſtants, whoſe religious Liberties hang in <hi>Equilibrio,</hi> no one by Law eſtabliſhed above the reſt; and were a certain Party a mind to ſaddle and ride the reſt; what could they contrive better, or what Stratagem invent more adapted to promote their domineering Sway, than by graſping to themſelves the Aſcendency, or Superheminence in the College or Seminary of Learning, erected for the General Education of Youth? Will not the Youth be tinctured with the Principles of thoſe who teach them? And will this not ſoon model Church and State?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007456_0005_102DAEAC8049BB00"/>When theſe Things are duly conſidered (which ſurely are very obvious to every thinking Perſon) I hope they who belong to the Reformed Church, as conſtituted by the Synod of <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> will no longer ſuffer themſelves to be ſo much impoſed upon, as they have been for ſome Time of late: For my Part, I am not more amazed, though I am much ſo, at the aſtoniſhing Impoſition of the incroaching Party, that would monopolize our intended College, than I am at our own Infatuation, Stupidity and Lethargy, in doing ſo little as hath been hitherto done, in order to aſſert and ſecure the ineſtimable Bleſſing of Bleſſings, by Treaties ſecured unto us, and now in Danger of being ſnatched from us all at one fatal Graſp; I mean the Enjoyment of Liberty of Conſcience in public Worſhip, and in Church Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>How in the Name of Wonder, comes it then to paſs, that a pretended Friend of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church, ſhould write, as I find he hath done, in the Supplement to the <hi>New-York Mercury</hi> in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 140, ſubſcribed, J. V. D. This Letter writer may ſtile himſelf as much a Well-wiſher to his Country, and our <hi>Dutch</hi> Eſtabliſhment, as he pleaſes; I fear that in his Friendſhip there lies a lurking <hi>Serpent,</hi> and if the Maſk was thrown off, he would only be an Inſtrument of that incroaching Party, endeavouring by Inchantment and Artifice, to lull us aſleep, while they deſpoil us of our Churches.</p>
            <p>He exclaims, in the firſt Place, bitterly againſt the <hi>Independent Reflector</hi> and the <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> as Peſts of the Peace of Society; and then ſignifies his Surpriſe at many of his pretended Brethren of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church, who countenance thoſe Writings, charging them with diſturbing the Peace and Tranquility of this Colony; a Charge ſo juſt, as that wherewith in the Fable, a ravenous Wolf doth accuſe an innocent Sheep, that ſtands below him in the Stream, of having troubled the Waters; which, I think, may be more fully collected from the Similitudes and Compariſons I have drawn above.</p>
            <p>With Regard to the <hi>Independent Reflector,</hi> and <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> (though I am not of his Sect as to Principles in Religion) I believe the Lord in his wiſe and gracious Providence, hath
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007456_0006_102DAEAF2F765C30"/>
been pleaſed to uſe him as a Means to bafle and fruſtrate an incroaching Party, in their unjuſt Demands: Had the <hi>Independent Reflector</hi> and <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> proſtituted his Pen, in encouraging the unreaſonable Pretences of thoſe, who now declare him the Bane and Peſt of Society, he had been by them extolled to the very Skies; he had been proclaimed a Wonder, a Prodigy of the World! the happieſt Phenomenon of the Age! no lucrative Job, no gratifying Boon in the Province, had been too great for him: But now, while he pleads and vindicates the Cauſe of perſecuted Liberty and Rights, they ſeem to envy him the vital Air he breathes in: May the Lord reward him for it! and I hope, there will yet come a Time, when his Country ſhall ſee, how much they are obliged to him.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, our pretended Friend and Well-wiſher (I fear ſuch a one as <hi>Sanballet</hi> the <hi>Horonite, Tobiah</hi> the <hi>Ammoniteſh</hi> Servant, and <hi>Gaſhem</hi> the <hi>Arabian,</hi> were to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) throws a gloomy Glance on our <hi>Dutch</hi> Prieſts educated in <hi>America.</hi> And why muſt they be the Butt of his Indignation? The Caſe is clear; it is becauſe, as they underſtand a little of the Engliſh Language, and ſee what Ruin was meditated their Churches, they endeavour to avoid the fatal Stroke, by forming themſelves into a Reformed Claſſis, according to the Canons of the Synod held at <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> in the Years of our Lord, 1618 and 1619, that they may be capable of acting in a joint Body; which is likely to be of better Conſequence, than what is done by ſingle <hi>Kerkenraet.</hi> The Neceſſity of this, for our Preſervation, I could eaſily evince by many valid Reaſons; but our Friend, the Letter-Writer, ſpares me that Labour at preſent, by his Endeavours to prejudice our Church againſt it, being either ſo ignorant, or ſo malicious, as to ſuggeſt, that when we ſet up a Claſſis of our own here, we have done with <hi>Holland:</hi> As he ſtiles the <hi>Claſſis of Holland,</hi> it ſeems as if he knew not that there are many Claſſis in <hi>Holland,</hi> and two Synods of the Reformed Church, either of which, no doubt, will be willing to form, conſtitute and acknowledge us a Claſſis: But he ſeems to be under a terrible Apprehenſion, when this is effected, the <hi>Jerſey</hi> College will be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007456_0007_102DAEB0F15DFC38"/>
encouraged, and ours at the ſame Time neglected: I hope we will wiſh the <hi>Jerſey</hi> College well, becauſe their Aim at graſping after all our Churches, hath not hitherto been ſo glaring, as that of the High Church College in this Province; and I believe the religious Principles inculcated in the former, agree better with Holy Scripture, and with the Confeſſion of our Church, nay, even with the doctrinal Part of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than I expect will be taught in the latter: Moreover, they who erected it, have not as yet endeavoured to impoſe the Charge of keeping it upon us: But if our Friend had not been haſty, and had waited but a little while longer, he would perhaps have been informed, that we don't chuſe to have too near a Connexion with either; but intend, pleaſe God, an Academy of our own, for the free Education of our Youth (for which their Parents, their Godfathers and Godmothers, even in their Baptiſm, did promiſe and vow before God and his Saints, they ſhould be inſtructed in the Doctrine of our Reformed Church) And although this our Reſolution be but juſt and equitable in itſelf, and no more than what is manifeſtly our indiſpenſible Duty, we may notwithſtanding, in a great Meaſure, thank our kind Siſter Churches for it, who by the whole of their late Conduct towards us, even by their Dreams and Prophecies, have ſhewn us the Neceſſity thereof, unleſs we reſolve ignominiouſly, to ſurrender and give up our Churches to them, and thus in order to aggrandize our Siſters, ſuffer Annihilation ourſelves, and perhaps be the Means of putting our Siſters in a fair Way to ruin one another, and to work out the Deſtruction of this whole Land.</p>
            <p>As to our fictious Friend's Invention, of a Proteſterian Synod; I leave the Gentlemen he has in View, to anſwer for themſelves; they are of Age, and every Way a Match for him. What a Happineſs, that a Man bleſt with ſo lively an Invention, is ſo ſincere a Friend to us, in this our oppreſſed State, in which ſharp-ey'd Eagles hover over and about us on every Side! Who knows what admirable Schemes, what un-thought of Projects, he may invent, and bring about for our Good! I wonder ſo great a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007456_0008_102DAEB40D845F78"/>
Friend, and ſo ſurpriſing a Genius, adviſes us ſtill to ſtick to our old, negligent, obſolete, exploded Plan; by which our Church in <hi>New-York,</hi> is got ſo much on the declining Hand, that the Grandeur of the High Church conſiſts in Proſelytes, gained from her Siſter <hi>Low Dutch Church.</hi> It is poſſible this our Friend may be one of thoſe, who plume themſelves on having prejudiced our Church in <hi>New-York,</hi> againſt calling a Reformed Miniſter to preach in Engliſh, becauſe we were in Danger of one of the Proteſterian Sect. But what of that? It left us juſt where we were, all in the Dumps! and ſtill the Neceſſity appears, that a Miniſter of our own Order, ſhould preach in Engliſh in our Churches, to prevent the falling off from us, ſuch as do not underſtand <hi>Dutch</hi> (which if not prevented, muſt inevitably, in a little while, prove our Ruin) and why doth our Friend not ſhew us the Way, how we may do this ſafely? I pretend not to ſuch Inventions as he; and yet I can eaſily do it. Our Junior Miniſter is a known Orator, and as he has the Latin, may ſoon learn Engliſh ſufficient to begin with to preach; he will, when once begun, improve very faſt, or may not young <hi>Dordracenſis,</hi> be called thereunto? Why don't our <hi>Kerkenraet</hi> deſire him to do it? We have already our Catechiſm and Liturgy tranſlated in Engliſh amongſt us; and as I am informed, may have from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> even the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> tranſlated in that Language, adapted to the Metre and Muſic of <hi>Petrus Dathenus,</hi> which we uſe. This Scheme, I fear, will be propoſed and approved of, laſt of all by our Friend and his Party; they will ſooner adviſe a Church of <hi>England</hi> Miniſter, to go on as he doth, to preach <hi>Low Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Mohawk</hi>'s Country, preſſing on after the laborious Steps of his Predeceſſor, who did the ſame in the City of <hi>Albany.</hi>

            <p>In regard to the true Specimen among our People, of one of our <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters, late of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> but now of <hi>Bergen,</hi> in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> I muſt remark, that <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Words to <hi>Joram,</hi> are very applicable; <hi>What Peace ſo long as the Whoredoms of thy Mother</hi> Jezebel, <hi>and her Witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> As alſo are the Words of our bleſſed Lord to his Diſciples; <hi>Think not that I came to ſend Peace on Earth: I came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword.

For I come to ſet a Man at Variance againſt his Father, and the Daughter againſt her Mother, and the Daughter-in-Law againſt the Mother-in-Law. And a Man's Foes ſhall be they of his own Houſhold.</hi> It is well known this Clergyman waged War againſt the Kingdom of Darkneſs. The <hi>Diabolians,</hi> in their Turn, attacked him fiercely, and called into their Aid and Succour, ſome of his carnal Brethren, who plotted his Ruin, and were in a likely Way to effect it, had not the Eyes of the Claſſis of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> been opened, by a fair and candid Repreſentation of the Caſe. And this true Specimen ſhews us the Neceſſity of our being formed into a Claſſis here, that the Enemies of experimental Religion, may not have it in their Power, by their falſe and malicious Gloſſes and Miſrepreſentations, before the Claſſis of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to hurt the Promoters of real Piety and Godlineſs.—Whence came thoſe Quarrels of a different Nature on <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> in former Times? Whence thoſe of another Nature, which broke out after his Removal, and are as yet not come to an End? And what muſt we at laſt think of our ſham Friend's Advice, ſtrictly to adhere to our Eſtabliſhment, and not ſuffer the leaſt Change, or Alteration, by Prieſts or People? Is our Friend really of Opinion, our Church is eſtabliſhed here, or the Church of <hi>England</hi> either; why doth he then not prove it? Or would he have us, for the Sake of Eſtabliſhments, prepatriate to <hi>Holland,</hi> or to <hi>South Britain,</hi> from whence many emigrated to avoid them? Oh! this mock Eſtabliſhment is a Darling of theirs to enchant and delude the Ignorant and Unweary! The Net is already thrown out round about us; it hath already encircled us; if we remain but quietly and tamely where we are, no doubt, the High Church Party will make the greateſt Draught; as our real and honeſt Friend <hi>Phileleutheros</hi> hath ſhewn.—But our <hi>Ulyſſean</hi> Friend, it ſeems, is not contented even with this; we muſt, like ſenſeleſs and dumb Fiſhes, run into the Net, of our own Accord, to facilitate the Labour and Toil of our Fiſhermen, in drawing our own Ruin and Deſtruction upon us. We muſt, at the ſame Time, unite with the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in promoting their High Church College, in order to get our Youth ſo freely educated,

that they forever renounce their own Church, and when they get into the Aſſembly, make us pay for it, and feel the Smart of it. Is this a Foundation to build a College upon? Is this a Baſis whereon to fix a Seminary of Learning, in a free Land, deſigned for a Place of Refuge, for an Aſylum to perſecuted Souls, in which the incroaching Party is perhaps ſcarcely a twentieth Man at preſent? Gracious God! Was there ever before ſuch a Demand made on thy rational Creatures! Merciful Heaven! Thou who didſt forbid the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thy favourite People, of old, <hi>To ſeethe a Kid in his Mother's Milk;</hi> let us rather ſuffer Martyrdom, than pollute our Souls with ſo great an Abomination in thy Sight!</p>
            <p>Come on then, <hi>my dear Brethren,</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> be arouſed out of your Lethargy; Start! O! ſtart from your Enchantment. Conſider, I beſeech you, what our pious and venerable Anceſtors, have done and ſuffered for their Religion: Shall we ſuffer ourſelves ignominiouſly to be diſpoiled of the ſame, by little cunning low Craft, and hallow Artifice? Heaven forbid we ſhould!—His moſt gracious Majeſty, King GEORGE, whoſe liege and loyal, whoſe dutiful and peaceable Subjects we are, in whoſe Cauſe we will chearfully at all Times venture our Lives and Fortunes, who allows us the Liberty of our Conſciences in public Worſhip, and in Church Diſcipline; will be graciouſly pleaſed, no doubt, if we need and humbly pray it, to grant us a Charter too, for the Education of our Youth, as well as any other religious Denomination whatſoever, tolerated in his Dominions; whereas his moſt gracious Majeſty, in this, as much as in any Thing, the Reſemblance of the Supreme Being, delights in the Happineſs of his loyal and loving Subjects, though of various religious Sentiments; among which I believe, there is not one ſingle individual diſaffected, either to his ſacred Perſon, Family or Government. Let us Men, and Brethren, put our Truſt in God, and be unanimous among ourſelves, and not hearken to domineering Parties, who endeavour to divide us; we have no Buſineſs with their Colleges; they may erect as many as they pleaſe, and muſt expect to maintain them too themſelves. Let
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007456_0011_102DAEBA99E7DDD0"/>
every one provide for his own Houſe; and ſuch as are weak and poor, if they aſk an Alms of us, in a ſuitable Manner, let us not with-hold our Hand; but to demand our Property, as their juſt Due, for ruining of us, we muſt, for the future, treat with a ſilent Contempt. And let them ſay what they will, one Thing we know, which is this, that we cannot be ſpoiled but by the Concurrence of our own Aſſembly; and therefore we ought, for the future, to be more cautious, and on our Guard, what Repreſentatives we elect. I hope what has happened, has opened our Eyes a little in this Particular, at leaſt our ſham Friend ſeems to be affraid of it. Were I to give my Opinion, how we ought at preſent to conduct ourſelves, it ſhould be this Maxim; whatever any incroaching Party adviſes us to do, let us ſay Nothing, but not do it: Whatever they adviſe us not to do, let us ſay Nothing, but do it: If we take the Contrary of their Advice, I dare ſay, in the Main, we will do well by it. I know they will ſet up a hedious Cry, a Huen-Cry, when they perceive this; but we muſt not mind that neither. As it is now a Time in which we exert ourſelves, to oppoſe, reſiſt, and repell our unjuſtly incroaching Neighbours, the <hi>French</hi> and their Indians, let us conſider, our God requires of us alſo, to make a Stand for our moſt holy Religion, the Truth, as it is in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Lord our Righteouſneſs: And for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for <hi>Sion</hi>'s Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and for the Safety of our Land, we ought to watch and pray, to labour and ſuffer, and remain ſteadfaſt in the Faith once delivered unto the Saints. And this is the Exhortation of your true Friend.</p>
