            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF this <hi>Piety,</hi> the Holy <hi>Job</hi> was a Notable and Glorious Example. There was of Old a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church of GOD; we find it in <hi>Origens</hi> Commentaries, that it was found, <hi>In Antiquorum dictis,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> preſented the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Captivity; that they might read it in their Families, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their Hearts in GOD under their Diſtreſſes. We are yet more ſure, that in the <hi>Primitive Days</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> they Publickly read the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> on ſorrowful occaſions, and privately carried it alſo to one another on all ſuch occaſions. I do well at this Day, to take a Text from it. <hi>Job</hi> is afraid, That <hi>Piety</hi> would ſignify little to bring him <hi>out of Trouble;</hi> inaſmuch as it had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his coming <hi>into</hi> Trouble. The <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> while he was yet in his <hi>Proſperity,</hi> is thus deſcribed unto us. He was not <hi>Secure;</hi> He did not fall into a Sleep of Security; He did not fall aſleep with a vain Dream, that no <hi>Changes</hi> of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> would ever overtake him. He now ſaw <hi>Miſerable Changes:</hi> But the <hi>Changes</hi> did not come altogether Unlook'd for. <hi>The Thing which I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feared;</hi> This pious <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> was not ſuch an Anxious &amp; ſuch a Tormenting <hi>Fear,</hi> as to take away his Eaſy, Pleaſant, Thankful Enjoyment of his Comforts. To live always in ſuch a Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting <hi>Fear</hi> of loſing what we enjoy, as to loſe all comfortable Enjoyment of it, while we have it: this were no vertue in any Man; it were a <hi>ſore Judgment</hi> of GOD upon a Man. But the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> was a <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Caution;</hi> a <hi>Fear</hi> that put him upon <hi>Sacrificing</hi> to GOD every Day; a <hi>Fear</hi> that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002560_0005_0FDB700A074075E8"/>caus'd him to entertain the <hi>Changes</hi> that came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, with a Ready <hi>Reſignation,</hi> and upon them to ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the LORD!</hi> He could not foreſee the particular <hi>Changes</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him: It was enough, That in the midſt of his <hi>Proſperity</hi> he often thought, <hi>I do not know what may happen:</hi> And he did <hi>Fear</hi> the worſt that could happen.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Leſſon of Piety</hi> to be now recommended unto us, is this;
<q>
                  <hi>WE have Reaſon to Live in a continual Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Troubleſome Changes; and make ſuch a Religious Preparation for them, that we may be able ſuitably to bear all the Troubles of our Changes.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IT will be our <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to be <hi>always Ready</hi> for ſorrowful <hi>Changes:</hi> to be in ſuch a <hi>Readineſs</hi> for them, as may abate the Sorrows of the <hi>Changes.</hi> We may be at preſent in <hi>Proſperity;</hi> or at leaſt we may have many <hi>Comfortable Poſſeſſions</hi> about us. Well, but we ſhould have a <hi>Fear,</hi> that ſome <hi>Changes</hi> may be near unto us, a Devout <hi>Fear,</hi> that things will not continue long juſt as they are; an Holy <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> which may produce in us a Temper, that ſhall entertain what befalls us, with all due compoſedneſs of Mind, &amp; <hi>Reſignation.</hi> We ſhould be ſo Apprehenſive of all ſorts of <hi>Changes,</hi> that whatever befalls us, we may be able, with ſome Quietneſs of Soul to ſay; <q>'Tis no other than the <hi>Thing which I fear'd,</hi> that is come upon me; I am not <hi>ſurpriſed</hi> at it; It is no worſe than what I have long been <hi>looking for.</hi>

            <p>OUR <hi>Duty &amp; Intereſt</hi> is diſpoſed into Two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;

            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> WE have Reaſon to Live in a continual <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> of <hi>Troubleſome Changes;</hi> To <hi>Fear Changes,</hi> as things that are very likely to come upon us.</p>
            <p>WE will Enquire; Firſt, What <hi>Reaſon</hi> have we to Live <hi>Expecting</hi> of <hi>Troubleſome Changes?</hi> The Firſt Anſwer ſhall be; Where <hi>do we Live?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we were got ſafe to <hi>Heaven,</hi> we were then got beyond all <hi>Troubleſome Changes.</hi> Of them that are got out of this World, into a better, we read, Rev. XIV. 13. <hi>They Reſt from their Labours.</hi> Even ſo, They <hi>Reſt from then Changes.</hi> When <hi>Death,</hi> which is our <hi>great Change,</hi> has come upon a Child of God, he ſhall find it his <hi>Last Change;</hi> that is to ſay, the laſt that will have any Trouble in it. It is true, There is a <hi>Change</hi> to be Expected <hi>after Death;</hi> The <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> will be a wondrous &amp; an Happy <hi>Change</hi> upon them. It is of that <hi>Change,</hi> that we read; Job 14.14. <hi>I will wait until my Change come.</hi> But the Saint ſhall never ſee any <hi>Troubleſome Change</hi> after <hi>Death.</hi> In the mean time, while we Live in <hi>this World,</hi> we are in a World full of <hi>Changes.</hi> Nothing in this World is <hi>Conſtant,</hi> but the <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> of the World. In the <hi>Natural World,</hi> there are continual Changes. We read; Pſal. LXXIV. 16, 17. <hi>Day &amp; Night, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer &amp; Winter.</hi> And the <hi>Political World,</hi> has as many <hi>Changes.</hi> The <hi>Viciſſitudes</hi> in the World are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable.

All Things are upon <hi>Wheels; Nations</hi> find it ſo; And <hi>Perſons</hi> find it ſo. It is the Fate, both of <hi>Crowns</hi> and of <hi>Spades.</hi> The Victorious King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had his Chariot drawn by Four Captive Princes. One of them kept looking very Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively on the Wheels of the Chariot, and when the King <hi>Seſoſtrys,</hi> ask'd him, What he ſaw there; Sir, ſaid he, <hi>I ſee, that what is now uppermoſt ſoon becomes undermost! I ſee, 'tis a Rolling ſort of a World that we live in!</hi> Indeed, who ſees it not? It is not until the <hi>World to come,</hi> that we ſhall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Kingdom that cannot be moved.</hi> While we are in ſuch a World, we are mad, if we don't Expect <hi>Changes</hi> every Moment! Where is there any one Perſon free from this <hi>Common Lot</hi> of the World! The Experience of all the Men in the World, cries aloud unto us: <q>
                  <hi>Behold, Changes! Changes upon all the World!</hi>
               </q> In this univerſal <hi>Experience,</hi> we may ſee <hi>Reaſon</hi> enough to Expect <hi>Changes</hi> upon us. <hi>Man,</hi> Why ſhouldeſt thou Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an Exemption from the <hi>Common Lot</hi> of the World!</p>
            <p>BUT then, Secondly.

We may juſtly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>Changes</hi> every day, to take away thoſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> which we don't improve to the Glory of GOD, as we ought to do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. TO <hi>Expect Changes,</hi> is the way to <hi>Prevent Changes,</hi> that they ſhall not come, or to <hi>Sweeten Changes,</hi> when they come. It is often ſo, That the <hi>Expectation</hi> of <hi>Changes,</hi> proves our <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> from them. Tho' the World uſually proves <hi>worſe than we hope,</hi> yet it uſually proves alſo <hi>Better than we fear.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Job</hi> could ſay, <hi>The Thing which I greatly feared, is come upon me.</hi> But then, he ſpeaks of the caſe, as a <hi>Rare caſe;</hi> he wonders at it, that it ſhould be ſo. 'Tis moſt frequently otherwiſe; The <hi>Changes</hi> which we moſt <hi>Expect,</hi> are thoſe that we moſt frequently <hi>Eſcape.</hi> It may be, our <hi>Fear</hi> puts us on thoſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Safety,</hi> that ſave us from our <hi>Feared Changes.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002560_0009_0FDB7013074AB300"/>If we were upon the Stroke of <hi>Prognoſtication,</hi> would we moſt probably <hi>Prognoſticate,</hi> what <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> a Man ſhall have befalling of him? I know not a more probable Rule of Conjecture than this; <hi>What is the Mans greateſt Point of Security?</hi> The Thing that a Man does leaſt of all <hi>Fear,</hi> 'tis <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Feared,</hi> that this is the Thing that is to come upon him. We read, Pſal. XXX. 6, 7. <hi>I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved, — Thou hiddeſt thy Face, and I was troubled.</hi> What is the Thing that a Man has leaſt apprehenſion to ſee <hi>Moved?</hi> It is very likely, That is the very Thing, which he ſhall ſee <hi>moved &amp; changed,</hi> and be <hi>Troubled.</hi> Or, if <hi>Expectation</hi> will not <hi>keep off</hi> our <hi>Changes,</hi> but the <hi>Thing which we greatly fear</hi> muſt come upon us, yet it will <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>mollify</hi> our <hi>Troubles,</hi> in our <hi>Changes. Tela Praeviſa minus feriunt.</hi> By being <hi>Fore-warn'd</hi> of our <hi>Changes,</hi> we are <hi>Fore-arm'd</hi> for them. Our Spirits being afore-hand a little <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliariz'd</hi> unto our <hi>Changes,</hi> will be when they come, the leſs Affrighted at them. We leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of thoſe things, which we know, are to be <hi>look'd</hi> for. The <hi>Wound</hi> is the leſs, when the <hi>Dart</hi> was <hi>Look'd for.</hi> The Expectation of <hi>Changes</hi> will fortify us, with <hi>Patience</hi> to bear them the more eaſily &amp; handſomely. The Meſſenger of <hi>Death</hi> put the famous Martyr into no Diſturbance, for, ſaid, he, <hi>This is no other than what I have been this long while Daily Looking for!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE will Enquire, Secondly; <hi>What</hi> are the <hi>Troubleſome Changes,</hi> which we muſt Live in a daily <hi>Expectation</hi> of! The Anſwer to this muſt be very General. <hi>Of all in General;</hi> Becauſe no
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002560_0010_0FDB701873DA3B20"/>body can tell what in Particular. The Servant of GOD could ſay; Act. XX. 22, 23. — Even ſo may we ſay, <q>
                  <hi>I know not what ſhall befal me, but it is very ſure Afflictive Changes do abide me.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Contingencies</hi> of this World cannot be Numbred. And what is there in this World, that is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto them? We read; Eccl. IX. 11. <hi>Chance happens to all.</hi> Let us be ſo Extenſive in our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, as that whatever our changes may be, we may be able to ſay, <hi>I was a little Aware of this.</hi> And yet we will a little particularize.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER our <hi>Eſtates</hi> may be, do not preſume, That it is impoſſible for us, to be ſtript of theſe <hi>Eſtates.</hi> A <hi>Job,</hi> a Rich, and a Great Man, may ſoon be <hi>Poor to a Proverb.</hi> Tho' we may ſwim in <hi>Riches,</hi> yet we muſt live in this Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Theſe Riches may ſoon take themſelves wings, and flee away.</hi> We are guilty of <hi>Trusting in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Riches,</hi> if we lay aſide all ſuch Expectation. Of all <hi>Riches</hi> on this ſide Heaven; we are adviſed unto what they are obnoxious; Matt. VI. 19. <hi>Moth and Ruſt, and Thieves.</hi> Suppoſe, that the <hi>Fair Houſe</hi> may be laid in Aſhes, or a Stranger may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Owner. Suppoſe, that the moſt <hi>boarded Caſh,</hi> may become <hi>Running Caſh,</hi> and <hi>Run</hi> quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Owner. When we are ſending a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny Intereſt <hi>abroad,</hi> ſuppoſe it may come <hi>ſhort home;</hi> and the Sum Total of the Gains of the Voyage, may be that; Hag. 1.9. <hi>Ye Look'd for much, and, lo, it came to little.</hi> Suppoſe all that we have to be liable unto Innumerable <hi>Caſualties.</hi> All the <hi>Elements</hi> may prey upon us; and <hi>Enemies</hi> may have a commiſſion to ſieze upon what we have.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002560_0011_0FDB701B7574BCF8"/>We ſhall not be the firſt, if we muſt come to ſay, <hi>I was full, I am Empty; the Almighty has Afflicted me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN; Whatever our <hi>Honours</hi> may be, Let us not imagine, our <hi>Mountain to be ſo ſtring,</hi> that we never can be <hi>Degraded,</hi> never <hi>Diſgraced;</hi> we read, Pſal. XLIX. 12. <hi>Man in Honour abideth not.</hi> Let them that ſtand on <hi>High Places,</hi> remember they ſtand on <hi>Slippery Places.</hi> How many <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> have been dethron'd in our Time! And <hi>Mighty Men</hi> without Number have been <hi>broken in pieces;</hi> and others been ſet in their head. If the cry be, <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> to day, Expect, It may be, <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify,</hi> to Morrow!</p>
            <p>ARE we in <hi>Health?</hi> Let us live in Expectation of <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> No <hi>conſtitution</hi> ſo ſtrong, as to be Sickneſs-proof. No <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of Clay, ſo ſtrong, but that it may be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>WE have our Deſireable <hi>Relatives</hi> Don't think, 'Tis impoſſible for them to <hi>Dy.</hi> I hope, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives</hi> are not ſuch, that you <hi>hope for their Death.</hi> Pe they what they will, GOD forbid, you ſhould indulge that Hope. Yet ſuch a <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>their Death,</hi> you ſhould have, that if it arrive before your own, you may truly ſay. <hi>The thing which I greatly feared is come unto me. Conſorts,</hi> Expect a <hi>Parting-Time.

I always though, this Friend had been an Immortal one.</hi>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002560_0012_0FDB701CC719E6D0"/>
THERE is one <hi>Change</hi> more to be Expected. And tho' I mention it the <hi>Laſt,</hi> yet I would pray my Hearers to Expect it the <hi>Firſt</hi> of any. <hi>Death, Death,</hi> is the <hi>Change</hi> I mean. Oh! let us Live in a continual <hi>Expectation of Death.</hi> It is an awful Admonition, Prov. XXVII. 1. <hi>Thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> When we go to ſleep in the <hi>Evening,</hi> it ſhould often be with ſuch an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; <hi>It may be, this Night my Soul will be required.</hi> When we get up and go out in a <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> it ſhould often be with ſuch an Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>It may be, my Sun will ſet before Sun-ſet</hi> When we part with a <hi>Friend,</hi> it ſhould often be with ſuch an Apprehenſion, <hi>'Tis poſſible, this may be the laſt Time of my Speaking to him.</hi> And when we hear a <hi>Sermon,</hi> why ſhould it not be with ſuch a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? <hi>For ought I can tell, This may be the Laſt Sermon I ſhall hear throughout Eternal Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT thus we are to manage the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of our Work. This is to be our <hi>Expectation;</hi> That we have nothing here, but what may <hi>ſoon be cut off.</hi> We proceed unto the <hi>Second Part</hi> of the Work. And certainly, Every one will readily grant it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II</hi> 'TIS <hi>Reaſonable</hi> for us to make a Religious <hi>Preparation</hi> for <hi>Troubleſome Changes!</hi> To <hi>Fear Changes</hi> only with a Deſign to get into a fit poſture for them. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> LV. 19. We will Explain this <hi>Frame of Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. OUR <hi>Fear of Changes,</hi> muſt not be a <hi>Torturing Fear,</hi> that ſhall Kill or Spoil our <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> We read of a Miſerable Thing; Eccl. VI. 2. A Man <hi>has not power</hi> to taſte his own Enjoyments. Very
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002560_0013_0FDB701E5DB679D0"/>dreadful is the <hi>Wrath &amp; Curſe</hi> of GOD, upon the Children of Men, when they are given up to ſuch a <hi>Fear,</hi> as deprives them of all Reliſh in the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which He beſtows upon them. When the <hi>Fear</hi> of Loſing our <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> takes away our <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> the Lord then fulfils that fearful Threatning upon us; <hi>I will curſe your Bleſſings.</hi> Our <hi>Fear</hi> of our <hi>Changes,</hi> it ſhould not hinder our <hi>Joy</hi> in our <hi>Bleſſings; What can there be better for a Man, than that he ſhould eat &amp; drink, and make his Soul enjoy good in his labour?</hi> It would be a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward &amp; fooliſh <hi>Ingratitude</hi> unto GOD, for us to <hi>threw away</hi> our <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> before GOD ſhall pleaſe to <hi>take them away.</hi> To <hi>Live in Bondage, thro' Fear,</hi> of what is coming upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 BUT yet, by our <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Changes,</hi> we ſhould come to ſit more looſe from all our <hi>Comforts.</hi> We are thus adviſed; 1 Cor VII. 29, 30. <hi>The Time is ſhort: — Be as tho' not</hi> —. Even ſo; ſince we may Expect <hi>Changes,</hi> let this <hi>Expectation</hi> produce in us, a due <hi>Mortification.</hi> We ſhould grow very <hi>Mortifi'd &amp; Indifferent</hi> unto all our <hi>Comforts</hi> in this World; becauſe we may fear <hi>Changes</hi> a coming on our <hi>Comforts.</hi> We ſhould Hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>too faſt.</hi> Why, we know not how ſoon every thing may by ſome <hi>Deadly Changes</hi> be ſnatched and fetch'd away from us. Write upon all our Enjoyments, <hi>Uncertain Things! Vaniſhing Things! Departing Things!</hi> And let this <hi>Lower the price</hi> of them. Of thoſe Enjoyments for which we have moſt of Tenderneſs, let us Remember, <hi>They will not ſtay with us!</hi> When any thing is getting too far into our Affections, Let us <hi>cool</hi> our Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002560_0014_0FDB702589FEBF10"/>and Inordinate Affections, with this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; <q>
                  <hi>I do not know, what Changes may come, and how ſoon theſe Enjoyments may be taken away.</hi>
               </q> Oh! let your <hi>Moderation</hi> in every thing, be <hi>known unto all Men; A Change is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. SINCE we may <hi>Fear Troubleſome Changes,</hi> Let this <hi>Fear</hi> awaken us to get into ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we ſhall <hi>Suffer no real Damage</hi> by any of our <hi>Changes.</hi> Oh! happy condition, in the midſt of all <hi>Troubleſome Changes!</hi> Oh! <hi>Beneficial Changes,</hi> the <hi>Fear</hi> whereof ſhall drive us into ſuch a condition. Let us heartily conſent unto the <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD, and of Grace, in all the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of it. Let us Accept of our Lord JESUS CHRIST as our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Leader,</hi> and <hi>Ruler,</hi> and of GOD in Him, as our <hi>Portion.</hi> Let us with Souls Renouncing all the ways of Sin, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to the CHRIST of GOD, cry out, <hi>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</hi> Then we need <hi>Fear</hi> no Changes. For, whatever <hi>Changes</hi> now come upon us, we need not be <hi>afraid</hi> of any <hi>Damage</hi> from them. The Voice of the Good GOD unto us, now is that; Jer. XXV. 6. <hi>I will do you no Hurt.</hi> All the <hi>Changes</hi> that now paſs over us, will be <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable</hi> to us; They will only bring us nearer to GOD, only make us Fitter for <hi>Heaven.</hi> That Promiſe will be fulfill'd unto us; Rom. VIII. 28. <hi>All things ſhall work together for Good.</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be <hi>taken from</hi> us in any of our <hi>Changes,</hi> yet now we have <hi>Leſt unto us,</hi> what will make up the want of all that is taken from us; what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>better</hi> than all that is taken from us. GOD is ours, CHRIST is ours, <hi>Heaven</hi> is ours. Oh!

               <hi>Changes!</hi> Do your worſt, we are Happy, we are Happy, you cannot Rob us of our Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">WE <hi>Expect Changes,</hi> we know not what <hi>Changes;</hi> Let us <hi>commit</hi> all our concerns into the Hands of a <hi>Faithful</hi> GOD, that He may order all our <hi>Changes</hi> in very Faithfulneſs. It was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, Pſal. XXXI. 15. <hi>My Times are in Thy Hands.</hi> The <hi>Times</hi> of all our <hi>Changes,</hi> and all the <hi>Changes</hi> that are to paſs over us in our <hi>Times,</hi> are in the Hands of GOD. Let us leave all in thoſe Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hands. The Pſalmiſt could ſay, Pſal. LVI. 3. <hi>At whatſoever Time I am afraid, I will put my Truſt in Thee.</hi> Are we <hi>Afraid</hi> of <hi>Changes?</hi> Let us cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>Truſt GOD</hi> with all our concerns; and put our Truſt in Him, that He will permit no <hi>Changes</hi> but what ſhall be Good for us, to befall us in any of our concerns. Humbly put over all into the Hands of a Glorious CHRIST, who is the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of the World, who diſpoſes all the Affairs of <hi>Providence</hi> with His Almighty Hands; and ſay to Him;
<q>O my GOD; Great is thy <hi>Compaſſion;</hi> Great is thy <hi>Faithfulneſs;</hi> I put over all my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi> into thy precious Hands; There I <hi>cast</hi> them; There I <hi>leave</hi> them: Oh!

            <p n="5">
               <hi>CHANGES</hi> are coming on; Let us be mightily ſatisfied in the <hi>Conduct</hi> of GOD, the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of that Conduct, which mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges all our <hi>Changes.</hi> We <hi>greatly Fear</hi> many <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> We may be greatly aſſured, that not the leaſt of thoſe Changes can befall us, without the will of GOD.

Let us be deeply affected with the <hi>Wiſdom &amp; Goodneſs</hi> of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>Think;
<q>
                  <hi>Changes</hi> are coming upon me; but they are ſuch as the <hi>All-wiſe GOD</hi> ſees Fit for me. It is fit, It is fit, that I ſhould leave all to His Determination. <hi>Lord, Thy Underſtanding is infinite!</hi>

            <p>Think again;
<q>
                  <hi>Changes</hi> are coming upon me; but they will be no other than <hi>GOD has meant unto Good.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> GOD knows that it is my deſire to Seek Him, and Serve Him: He is my <hi>Father,</hi> and will not let any thing befal me, that ſhall do me any <hi>real Harm</hi> in my Serving of Him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">WE are to meet with <hi>Changes,</hi> and look for <hi>Changes;</hi> But let us own the <hi>Favour</hi> of GOD in it, that He keeps us <hi>Ignorant</hi> of what <hi>hanges</hi> we are to meet withal.

This is a thing that will never <hi>come upon</hi> thee. The Firſt Sinners were <hi>Afraid,</hi> aſſoon as they began to Reflect on what they had done. Ever ſince it has been ſo; <hi>Guilt</hi> will fill Sinners with <hi>Fear.</hi> They that ſee their <hi>Sins</hi> to have been Many, and Heinous, and Long perſiſted in, are often <hi>Afraid,</hi> That they cannot find a Favourable Reception with their SAVIOUR. But as the Angel ſaid unto the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherds,</hi> Luk. II. 10. <hi>Fear not, for unto you there is born a SAVIOUR:</hi> So may it be ſaid unto all <hi>Sinners,</hi> even unto the <hi>chief of Sinners; Fear not, but come to your SAVIOUR, and you ſhall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Him.</hi> O comer to thy SAVIOUR; Doſt thou <hi>Fear,</hi> that if thou come to thy SAVIOUR, and Ask of Him, and Lean on Him, to make thee Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous &amp; Holy, and bring thee home to GOD, He will reject thy <hi>Prayer,</hi> and make thee <hi>Aſhamed of thy Hope?</hi> There is no <hi>Fear</hi> of it; This is a Thing that will never come upon thee; A LORD who is <hi>Good unto the Soul that ſeeks Him,</hi> never dealt ſo, with any that in Earneſt ſought unto Him. Haſt thou not the word of thy SAVIOUR for it, Joh. VI. 37. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt cut?</hi> And canſt thou be <hi>Afraid,</hi> that He will not be True to His Word? It is a moſt Heart-melting Thought, with which thou mayſt be comforted. When our SAVIOUR un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent all the <hi>Sorrow</hi> of the Things that were done unto Him, in the Day wherein He was <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002560_0020_0FDB7036427D5FF8"/>from the fierce Anger of GOD,</hi> What was it that His Bleſſed Soul then <hi>Travailed</hi> for? No little part of the <hi>Joy ſet before Him,</hi> was this fruit of His Horrid Sufferings; That He ſhould ſee the Children of Men come unto Him for His Mercies. Ah, Diſtreſſed Sinner: When thy SAVIOUR ſees thee come unto Him for His Mercies, He ſees what His Bleſſed Soul Travailed for, and what He Joyfully Eſteemed a Recompence of His Bitter Sufferings. And canſt thou be Afraid, That He, will not <hi>Receive</hi> thee, in thy coming to Him? Oh! <hi>Fear</hi> it not. A Rejection from thy SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, is a Thing that cannot <hi>come upon</hi> thee. No; Be thy Sins, of never ſuch a <hi>Scarlet</hi> and <hi>Crimſon</hi> Aſpect, it cannot <hi>come upon</hi> thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly. BY ſome Souls, deſirous &amp; ſtudious always to <hi>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</hi> it is a Thing that is <hi>Greatly Feared, I ſhall meet with ſuch Things as will be too Hard for me.</hi> But, be not <hi>Afraid,</hi> O Soul Truſting in thy SAVIOUR. This is a Thing that will never <hi>come upon</hi> thee. A Good Man has before now ſaid, Job IX. 28. <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrows.</hi> The Children of GOD, and they who <hi>walk Humbly with their GOD,</hi> are ſometimes <hi>Afraid,</hi> that they ſhall never get well thorough what they may be call'd unto. But, <hi>Fear</hi> not; yea, O Anxious Mind, Thy SAVIOUR ſays to thee, <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; Be not diſmay'd, for I am thy GOD; I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee.</hi> One gives way to this; <hi>I am Afraid, I ſhall not hold out unto the End, in a courſe of Obedience to GOD. My Corruptions will be too ſtrong for me. I ſhall not be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002560_0021_0FDB703841D4D770"/>able always to Reſist the Tempter.</hi> Another gives way to this; <hi>I am Afraid, I ſhall not be able to bear the painful Things that may be ordered for me. I ſhall ſink, I ſhall ſink, under my Loads.</hi> There are yet more that gives way to this; <hi>I am Afraid, I ſhall not be able to look Death in the Face with any Courage; I am Afraid, my Dying Agonies will be Intolerable.</hi> But, Oh! Be not <hi>Afraid with any Amazement</hi> concerning ſuch Things as theſe. Keep hold on thy SAVIOUR; <hi>Go up out of the Wilderneſs Leaning</hi> on Him, as the <hi>Beloved</hi> of thy Soul. Then, <hi>Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer.</hi> For none of <hi>theſe things</hi> will be found among them. 'Tis enough, that, Heb. XIII. 5. <hi>He bath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor for ſake thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; BY ſome Souls that have the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Tokens of Salvation</hi> upon them, it is a Thing that is <hi>Greatly Feared, I ſhall Miſcarry after all, and my Portion will be that of the Hypocrites.</hi> But, be not <hi>Afraid,</hi> O Soul always doing &amp; ſhowing the <hi>Things that accompany Salvation;</hi> This is a Thing that will never come upon thee. Our SAVIOUR ſaid unto ſome, Luk. XII. 32. <hi>Fear not, little Flock; It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> This is what He ſpeaks unto the Souls that <hi>follow hard after Him.</hi> Search into thy ſelf, O Soul, with the <hi>Candle of the Lord</hi> See; Haſt thou Begun to <hi>Live</hi> unto GOD, and aim at the Serving &amp; Pleaſing of GOD, above all things, and behave thy ſelf as under the <hi>Eye</hi> of GOD, and feel the <hi>Will</hi> of GOD ever giving Law to Thine? Then, Be not <hi>Afraid.</hi> Here is that <hi>Life of GOD</hi> begun, than never can Dy. Haſt thou the <hi>Good
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002560_0022_0FDB704069A2B4E8"/>Work</hi> produced in thee, which diſpoſes thee above all things to Love GOD, and Prize CHRIST, and Hate Sin, and Live <hi>Godlily,</hi> and <hi>Soberly,</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,</hi> and bear Patiently and Fruitfully Every thing appointed for thee; and Suppreſs all Evil frames towards thy Neighbour? Then, Be not <hi>Afraid.</hi> Thou art a <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD, and ſuch a <hi>Workmanſhip</hi> of His, as the <hi>Everlaſting Fire</hi> could never be intended for. O Soul, Set on a CHRIST, and Full of a CHRIST; Be not <hi>Afraid.</hi> Thou art in His Hands; Nothing will be able to pull thee out. Thou ſhalt certainly be <hi>with Him,</hi> and <hi>Behold His Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II.</hi> THERE are ſome Things which are the <hi>worſt of Evils;</hi> and the <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of Eſcaping them, renders things <hi>Greatly to be Feared:</hi> Such a <hi>Fear</hi> of theſe things, as may prevent them, is to be commended unto us. To <hi>Fear</hi> thoſe Things is the way to Eſcape them. And with regard unto ſuch Things, it is the Direction of Heaven to us, 1 Pet. I. 17. <hi>Paſs the Time of your Sojourning here in Fear.</hi> Nay, If the <hi>Fear</hi> be ſuch as to ſet <hi>Prayer</hi> to GOD into a proper Exerciſe; This will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly prevent them. And ſo it may be ſaid; Prov. XXVIII. 14. <hi>Happy is the Man that feareth always.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt. LET all of us, even the very Beſt of us, Look upon this, as a <hi>Thing that is greatly to be Feared;</hi> That we may be <hi>drawn into Sin</hi> againſt the Glorious GOD, by the <hi>Snare laid for us in the Earth.</hi> It is enjoyn'd upon us; Phil II. 17. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear &amp; Trembling.</hi> Sin
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002560_0023_0FDB7041A923F798"/>is a <hi>Fearful Evil;</hi> a <hi>Fearful</hi> Evil! Nothing to be ſo <hi>Feared.</hi> We have theſe Enſnaring Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually about us, which threaten to draw us into Sin. Our Hearts are Treacherous, and from their Inclinations we are Eaſily Enſnared. Oh! Let us <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Watch,</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> mightily, that we be not <hi>Led into Temptation.</hi> This <hi>Fear</hi> will be our <hi>Preſervative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. LET all that have not their <hi>Vocation</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> yet made ſure to them, look upon this as a <hi>Thing that is Greatly to be feared;</hi> That they <hi>Dy in their Sins,</hi> and fall into thoſe <hi>Hands, which, it is a fearful Thing to fall into.</hi> O you, that have never yet made thorough work of Turning to GOD, Is it not a dreadful Thing, — How <hi>greatly to be feared,</hi> ſuch a Thing; — To Periſh &amp; Languiſh under the Wrath of an Infinite GOD! Let the <hi>Sinners in Zion be Afraid,</hi> when they think, and Oh! that they would oftner, and more ſeriouſly and affectuouſly Think on, the <hi>Devouring Fire,</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting Burnings</hi> which they are Expos'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>Fear, Fear,</hi> O Souls in Darkneſs, leſt you <hi>come ſhort of Entring into the Reſt,</hi> which is <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> in the Goſpel. Be <hi>afraid,</hi> leſt by Delays you ſo provoke the Holy Spirit of GOD, that He <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> from you.— Be <hi>afraid,</hi> leſt you be overtaken <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
