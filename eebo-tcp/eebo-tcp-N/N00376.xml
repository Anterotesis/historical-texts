            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Tis onely the Trust reposed in me, and my reall desire of the Common good which puts me on, very well knowing, that nothing but ill Will is like to be my reward.</p>
            <p>Further, I am sensible of mine inability to wade in those great Affaires, and would not abound in my own sence, nor in any sort take upon nor go about to teach those of whom I had need to learne; yet, <hi>Plus vident oculi quam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I having with others, (tho much against my own Inclination) received his Majesties Commission as a Justice of the Peace for the County of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and having at that time taken the Oaths. of Supremacy and Obedience, as also that of a justice, for keeping of the Law, the Conservation of the Peace, and the quiet and good Government of the people, it did concern me to Consider the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000459_0003_0FA5AC6AC97E34D0"/>The present Motion seems to me to be not only illegall, needless &amp; unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but indeed very criminal dangerous and hurtful to us, and that upon these Considerations.</p>
            <p>First, Before you can Regularly (or by Virtue of and according to your late Patent) hold a Court of Election, you must be first Restored to your former politick Capacity, whereby you were under the Name of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Governour and Company of the English Colony of <hi>Connecticott,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons able &amp; capable in the Law to plead and be impleaded  and to Have, Take, Require and possesse Lands and other Hereditaments &amp;c. of which, that Priviledge of <hi>Government</hi> was a principall one given by your Patent.</p>
            <p>For I reason thus, If you do now assume the Government, and proceed to Election, you do it either in a private and personal Capacity, or in a publick and politik Capacity, I suppose you do not pretend to the First, for that is not to do it according to your patent, and besides it is criminall.</p>
            <p>For Subjects in <hi>private</hi> Capacity to take upon them to set up &amp; exercise Government as they see cause, is direct <hi>Rebellion</hi> &amp; Treason. Therefore you must do it in a publick and politick Capacity, but this you cannot do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you are restored to such a Capacity, in which indeed you once were, but now are not: which I thus prove from the Patent it self.</p>
            <p>Our late Soveraign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, did in the year 1662. by his Letters Patents for himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Heires and Successours, Ordaine &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitue the therein named Patentees, &amp; the then present &amp; future Freemen &amp;c.

And also to Have, Take, Possesse, Acquire and Purchase Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments &amp;c. This is the expresse Letter of that Clause of the Patent, whereby you were constituted one body politick and Corporate, able and capable in the Law as aforesaid; and whereby also, you were by the name of Governour and Company to have perpetuall Succession, or to be perpetuated by annuall Election, at least, as the Patent afterwards shews, and upon this Clause do all the priviledges afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> granted depend.</p>
            <p>But now you are not such a Body politick and Corporate capable in Law as aforesaid, for you know, that by the late Transaction between his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and his then Governour and Company of the late Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi>

               </gap> the Corporation, nor capable to plead or be impleaded as such, but the Governour and Company together. If they Claime or Take, they must Claime or Take together, if they Sue, they must Sue together, and if they be sued, they must be sued together and not apart. Besides, by the meanes aforesaid the Succession is interrupted and broken off, for by the same name of the Governour &amp; Company of &amp;c. you were to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Succession, and that Succession to be perpetuated by annuall Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Governour, Deputy-Governour &amp;c. which hath not been. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your present state you are not Successours of the former Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and consequently cannot take the priviledges untill restored to your former politick Capacity: and (to add that) you cannot restore your selves to it, for that is inconsistent with your Subjection to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power.</p>
            <p>By all this it doth appeare, That as there is no Governour, or Deputy-Governour to give Order for the Assembling of the Company, (without which their Assembling for such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Also there are now no Assistants enbaled by lawfull Authority (without which none may do it) to take the Oath of the Governour or Deputy-Governour when Chosen; all which things the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent doth expresly require.</p>
            <p>All this seems necessarily to follow from the very words of the Patent, and how it can be avoided I cannot see: but that I may not seem to vent

my own Notions onely, I shall briefly give the words of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> as sound a Lawyer and as great a friend to the <hi>English</hi> Subjects Libertyes as ever <hi>England</hi> knew, <hi>In the Case</hi> (saith he) <hi>of Mayor &amp; Commonality</hi> (which is the same in effect as Governour and Company) <hi>Where there is no Mayor the Commonality cannot make claim; because they have neither ability nor Capacity to take or sue any Action.

               </gap>3.] so that without a Governour or Deputy Governour you cannot so much as Claime the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Law, much lesse enter upon it. And therefore we see that in the Patent, the King doth not Constitute onely a number of Freemen, and make them immediately capable to take such and such priviledges, and give them power rudely to run together whensoever some factious spirits shall make a bustle, and so in a tumult to choose them a Governour &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates; No, but he first creates them a Body politick consisting of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verour and Company, and by that name makes them capable in Law to take the priviledges which he thereafter gives. And he himselfe nominates and appoints the first Governour or Deputy Governour for the time being, to give order for the Assembling of the Company upon all occasions (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Election or otherwise) and in such orderly manner gives them leave to assemble as often as need requireth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, (Which doth also confirm the former) Before you can hold a Court of Election according to the Patent, you must have a General Court or Assembly constituted according to the Patent: the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Patent doth ordaine, that the Governour, Deputy-Governour, and Assistants &amp;c. be annually chosen, not without, but in the said Generall Court: concerning this matter the King, in his Patent, ordains three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every Second Thursday in May and October <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or oftner if need be) there shall be a Generall Assembly. 2. That this Generall Court or Assembly, consist of the Governour or Deputy-Governour, and at least six of the Assistants, and of the Freemen or their Deputyes. 3. That at least once in every year (Viz.) on the second Thursday in May, the Governour Deputy Governour &amp; Assistants of the said Company and other Officers &amp;c. shall be in the said Generall Court and Assembly to be held from that day or time newly chosen for the yeare ensueing &amp;c. Thus saith the Patent expresly: But you have now no Governour, Deputy Governour, nor As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants, therefore can have no such Generall Court or Assembly; therefore can hold no Court of Election by virtue of or according to your Patent. Examine the Patent and see &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From these two Considerations it appears, that if you do proceed to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in your present state, you will but deceive your selves and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

You will but trouble your <hi>selves,</hi> for you will be immediately liable to a <hi>Quo-Warranto,</hi> and can give no account by what Authority you do these arbitrary things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Government is now in the Kings hands, (and here, that no person may cavill, the word <hi>King</hi> may be understood indefinitely for the King his Heires &amp; Successours, for the Heir or Successour is King, when the Time of Succession is come. But I say, The Government is now in the Kings hands, and it will be wisdome to proceed in a regular way, if you desire to recover it. For in regard of the dignity of his person, the King has by Law a Prerogative above the Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the keeping of what he hath. Hence, a man may not enter upon the King as he may upon his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low subject; muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may he enter upon the King by Force. I do not now enter upon that Question, <hi>How far those that are by and under the King entrusted with publick Power and Office, for the defence of the Lawes and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertyes of the Subject, may, in case, use force for that end; and the people under them at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Call and Command</hi>; This is another Question, and not our case, and those that desire satisfaction, may consult those that have written weightily upon that Subject. It is one thing to defend the Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subject. This some think <hi>some</hi> may do, and this defends the Government: But it is another thing to subvert &amp; change &amp; take possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government it self, this none may do. And tho' some may say, <hi>But the Government is illegally taken into the Kings hand, and it is one of our great Liberties</hi>: 'I shall say something to that by and by.</p>
            <p>Therefore to let that Question passe untoucht. I said that the Subject may not enter upon the King with force: now you cannot enter upon the King in point of Government, but it is with force, for all power of Government implies force antecedent, for the setting of it up, and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant for the Support and Defence of it, and partly because you cannot do it in this way of Election without Multitude, which is <hi>Force</hi> in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law, aswell as <hi>Manus arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ae,</hi> or Force of Armes, so that if you do it, it must necessarily be done with force; now to enter upon the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000459_0007_0FA5AC72070D7B20"/>
King in point of Government with Force, what is it but to invade the Crown? And Kings do account their Heads &amp; Crownes to be very neare each to other; and that he that attempts against the one, attempts against the other.</p>
            <p>This Affaire therefore doth touch the Crowne, and nearly concerne your Allegiance, and is worthy to be well considered, for it is of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; 'tis dangerous to those that shall Choose, and be Chosen, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; dangerous to all that shall any waies contrive, counsell, abett or conceale, (tho here is hardly room for Concealing, <hi>(A Citty set on a Hill cannot be hid,</hi> and these things cannot <hi>be done in a Corner)</hi> 'tis dangerous to your selves and Posterity, yea dangerous to us all, and doth require more skill in Law and state affaires than is very common among us, to make the way plain to a safe proceeding in it; for I cannot find that the Law doth use any softer Language concerning such Actions, than that of <hi>Tumults, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections, rebellious Riots, Sedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion, Rebellion, Treason,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I hope you will be carefull to keep at a due distance from such things which are wont to be <hi>Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>rnesse in the end.</hi> 'Tis an easy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to run too farr; And the worst is wont to be made of such things when they come to Tryall.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You may here consider that the Government was not taken into the Kings hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without your own Submission, and some sort (at least) of Consent; whence possibly there was not so much Illegality in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as some do imagine. I was not personally acquainted with those Transactions, and therefore cannot undertake much in this; but this I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose will not be denied, that if parties be at Law (whether King and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or subject and subject) and instead of standing a Tryal, they agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conditions, and the Conditions are performed, and so the Action be let fall, this is not illegall: and if afterwards either party be sensible of inconveniency, will it be fair and honest for him to say it was illegall, &amp; thereupon breake his Agreement? The <hi>Inhabitant of the Holy Hill swears to his own hurt, and changeth not.</hi> You were at Law with the King, and its like you thought it would be a great Charge to maintaine the Action, and it might go against you at last, &amp; you should be annexed to <hi>Yorke</hi>; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you submit to the Kings Wisdome and pleasure, begging that you may be annexed to the <hi>Bay</hi>; the King performs this condition, and lets fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his Action, Demands the Government, and you yield it up to him; if now you finde it prejudiciall, you must <hi>lay your hand upon your mouth,</hi> and not take it again by force. We must not think to leave and take whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we please.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, None are allowed by the Law to be Judges in their own Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000459_0008_0FA5AC73D7CDC7D0"/>
no not the King himself: But if you proceed in this manner, you take upon you, in your own case to judge the King, to condemn and take possession, which in reason will never be borne, for Princes are as tender of their Prerogative as Subjects can be of their Liberties.</p>
            <p>But to abate the Force of these Considerations, some say, <hi>We heare there is no King, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Therefore I say first, That Rumours are but a sandy foundation to ground such assertions, or to change &amp; build Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, we have yet nothing of Record concerning the King. 2. This doth not help our case at all, for if it were indeed so, that <hi>the Sceptre were departed,</hi> you have then nothing to do with the Patent; Tis onely the <hi>King</hi>'s Governour and Company that hath Interest in the Patent, and the King grants it onely for Himselfe, his Heires and Successours, if there be none of these, your Patent and Estate in it are expired without any more to do. But, 3<hi>ly.</hi> The King is a Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But others say, <hi>What shall we do? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Governour is not the Head of the Government but the <hi>King.</hi> And the Goverment is not his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and originally but the <hi>King's.</hi> The Governour is but a Minister of the King in the Government, which Ministry it is said he hath surrendred to be secured and be disposed of by Orders that shall be re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without matter of Record of as high a nature. You may take one instance from <hi>Charles</hi> the first his time, He was indeed the head of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but yet notwithstanding the great Breach and long Warrs between him and his Parliament, and his long imprisonment after that, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) from 42. to the end of 48. there was still a Government, and it was his Government, and exercised by the Kings Commissions as long as he lived, for they were not changed nor superseded till a year after his death, as the Histories of those times shew. So that notwithstanding all the Rumours we have had from abroad, and the Overtures at home, there is a Government still, to which we ought to submit; and that for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake. Let us not have cause to say, that <hi>there are none that will be governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly. I may desire you to consider those honoured Gentlemen who had the Rule over you under the former Government, and are now also in place under this Government, who I believe would hardly have accepted any Commission under the present Government, but for this end, that you might not be so much Ruled by strangers as otherwise you might have been, and to prevent the miseries that might follow thereupon: I am sure that this was one principall Argument that they used with me, when they saw me so averse as I was to Accept, and I think the end has been so far at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as that you ought with Thankfullness to acknowledge, that by this meanes you have escaped the greatest part of those grievances which others complain of, and not now (you think you have the staffe in your hand) to ride over their Consciences who are under Oath (from which neither they nor yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tis a golden Rule, That which you would that others should do to you, do you the same to them; &amp; do not recompence evil for good.</p>
            <p>Some I know reflect hard upon them for giving up the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; much like those that refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventhly. Consider your Profession, we are all Protestants, I hope there is not a Papist in our Limits, I know not any: and we professe to believe (rejecting humane Traditions) That the word of God is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sufficient Rule of Faith and Manners. And do we not there finde that <hi>Sure word of Prophesie, to which we may do well to take heed, as to a light that shines in a Dark place,</hi> which doth direct and counsell us, <hi>To fear the Lord and the King,</hi> and <hi>not to meddle with those that are given to change,</hi> To <hi>Keep the Kings Commandment, and that in regard of the Oath of God,</hi> To <hi>Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's,</hi> To <hi>Study to be quiet, and to be subject to Principalities and powers (because they are of God) and to obey Magistrates,</hi> To <hi>submit our selves to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the King as supreame, or unto Governours as unto those that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of them that do well, for so is the will of God, that with well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>Not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise Government, nor to speake evill of Dignityes?</hi> These are sound Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and will well consist with the protestant Religion (else we had reason to be ashamed of it) and it were to be wished, That these among us who <hi>are the salt of the earth</hi> &amp; <hi>Light of the world</hi> would season the people by putting them in mind (as <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>Titus</hi>) of those great Duties so necessary for these perilous days, wherein men are (as was prophecied they would be) so apt to be Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Eighthly, Consider the time and state of affaires in the Christian world.

I wish there be not some Jesuit that has foisted in this Project amongst them in the Bay and us here, as the most probale way to ruin us at this time; for it is the old trade of that Diabolical sort of men by their plausible crafty Counsells, to make protestants destroy themselves, by stirring up, and fomenting divisions among them; and promoteing any thing which tends thereto, the which, how naturally &amp; necessarily they will flow from this proceeding is easy to shew: but it is better to be silent than by speaking to shew men the way which they are too ready to run into</p>
            <p>Ninethly, More might be said, but the last Consideration that I shall off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (and which I think may satisfy any reasonable man) is, That it is known the Countrey is in daily Expectation of Orders from the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the Settleing and Regulating of the Government, those Orders will either contradict or overthrow your Election, or else countenance and Encourage it:</p>
            <p>If they overthrow it, to what end is it to hold a Court, (if we could hold a Court) to make Election, to change and turn things up-side down, and hereby put the Countrey (which is poor enough allready) to unnessary Charge, and know not how to defray it when we have done, and to run the hazzard of displeasure from the supreame power abroad, and of making Division and Mischief at home, and all for an imaginary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may possibly last for a week or a moneth. <hi>Sapiens incipit a Fine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Orders that shall come do countenance and encourage to an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they will be such as will enable us to it, and so we shall preserve a good Aspect abroad, and Unity and Peace at home; what need then of such Haste? These things cannot be spoken against. And the Town-Clerke of <hi>Ephesus</hi> could say, that these things being so, <hi>you ought to be quiet &amp; do nothing rashly.</hi>

            <p>But say others, If we have an Election before these Orders come, we shall be in a Capacity to capitulate, and so obtain the better termes, &amp;c. I answer this is a great mistake, It will be a mighty Disadvantage; for it will be a wonderfull thing if you be not look'd upon and dealt with as Criminalls.</p>
            <p>Again, Whome do you mean to Capitulate with? Surely it will be good manners for us to Aske, and not to Command; to Follow our Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and not to go before them.</p>
            <p>But some think; These are small matters that will be over-look'd, and easily pardoned, we need not stand upon such nicetyes.</p>
            <p>But I Answer how small they are will be best seen afterwards, and it is better not to need a pardon, than to presume upon getting one.</p>
            <p>From all these Considerations I conclude, that our strength is to sit still, and therefore do advise</p>
            <p>That instead of moving towards an Election, the Judges and Justices in the severall Counties, considering their Commissions which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and the Oathes which they have taken, for the faithfull Execution of them, and Remembring that the Judgement is not man's but God's who is with them in the Judgement, they take Courage and do it; and in Order thereto Unanimously Declare, that they will Maintain and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the Government (in their Degree) according to their Commissions, in Conformity to the Lawes which are the Rules of their Commissions, &amp; the true and propper Bulwarks of the Subject's just Libertyes, being carefull to do nothing contrary thereto, to the best of their understanding: &amp; that the good People here do willingly &amp; cheerfully submit &amp; yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the severall Officers in their Respective places, as their Duty is, untill such time as sufficient Warrant shall come from the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for other Orders.
