            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>MEMORIAL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT was reported to me, that every method was practiſed by lawleſs people on ſhore, to ſacrifice me and the ſervice to their diſappointment and vengeance.</p>
            <p>That one of the Alliance's bargemen was put in priſon by Mr. Dale and Mr. Williams, for ſaying, that ſaid barge (being at L'Orient) was Captain Landai's barge.</p>
            <p>That one of the ſerjeants of the marines received five French guineas, and ſeveral marines ſixty l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res, and ſome other ſeamen more or leſs, by the direction of Captain Jones, for acknowledging him to be their Captain; and they ſaid they had promiſes to be paid all their prize-money (and were directed to tell the ſame to every man on board) if they would return to their duty, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſuppoſe, if they would deliver the frigate to him.</p>
            <p>Some of the Bon-homme Richard's people formerly, who made part of the Alliance's crew then, having received intelligence of Captain Jones's promiſes made by his agent, were heard to ſay they would cut the cables in order to have the frigate drove on ſhore.</p>
            <p>A whole crew of one of the Alliance's boats being ſent on duty to L'Orient, were taken, and put by force on board the Ariel.</p>
            <p>Mr. Moylan ſtopped and prevented the Alliance's ſtores and proviſions from coming on board.</p>
            <p>Mr. Blodger, the Alliance's purter, was confined by Captain Jones for ſome days, on board the Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhip.—By all which proceedings the Alliance's crew would ſoon have been bribed and deterred from their duty; and being reduced in numbers, become incompetent to the ſhip's ſervice, and inſufficient and incapable to defend her againſt the enemies.</p>
            <p>By theſe dangers attending the ſending the boats on ſhore to L'Orient, I was compelled to have part of the freſh water brought on board with great difficulty from Groay iſland.</p>
            <p>The Bon-homme Richard's people on board, diſcovered ſo much diſſatisfaction, and evinced a ſpirit of mutiny to ſuch a degree, that, tho' I was not fully manned, I ſent ſeventeen of them to Captain Jones.</p>
            <p>The ſtores and proviſion came at laſt on the 30th June on board, and were taken in during the night time. Lieutenant Elwood, of the marines, had two hogſheads of wine brought on board; I was ſo preciſe to the orders I had received from the Navy-Board at Boſton, to let no private goods be brought in the ſhip, that I ordered they ſhould not be ſtowed in the fiſh-room or hold, that they might not be carried to America.</p>
            <p>Beſides the abovementioned dangers, of being deprived of the crew by their being forcibly put on board the Ariel—of being reduced to want of proviſions on board, by the oppoſition made on ſhore to their coming off—having already the crew almoſt bribed, by the promiſes made on ſhore to them by Captain Jones's agents, to do any thing againſt my command—the ſaid frigate was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019056_0003_0FAA0D83A3C038C0"/>
to the ſtorms in an open road, and moreover to the ſurpriſe or ſuperior force of the enemies; which concurrence of plots and dangers made her ſailing neceſſary.—But tho' I had been already better than two weeks waiting for his Excellency Dr. Franklin's order, and for his anſwer to the people about their prize-money, I wanted yet to ſtay a little longer on theſe accounts.</p>
            <p>Mr. De Gourlade ſent on board three ſmall boxes, not weighing together above fifty pounds, for the Chevalier De la Luzerne, the French Miniſter Plenipotentiary at Philadelphia; I thought that Congreſs would approve my receiving them, in conſequence I ordered the Maſter to receive and charge them in his book, and give a receipt for them, being the only private goods on board to my knowledge.</p>
            <p>Two days before our ſailing, Capt. Bell's brother and Capt. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rk came upon deck, and the former told me that he had a letter from Mr Moylan for me; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no buſineſs whatever with Mr. Moylan, and he might do what he pleaſed with ſaid letter, as I would not receive it.</p>
            <p>Having waited in vain till the 8th July for his Excellency B. Franklin's orders, and the expected payment of the crew's prize-money, and perceiving plainly that he would give neither— ſeeing alſo the dangers the frigate had been and was ſtill expoſed to in that road—the ſolid reaſons of the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> contained in his letter to me of the 25th June ult. for ſailing —the Congreſs's order for the Alliance's return to Philadelphia—and the real blame I ſhould incur in ſtaying longer without the poſitive order of his Excellency B. Franklin, determined me to ſail immediately.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, at one o'clock, P. M. having in company the ſhip Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, Capt. Bell; a brig, Mr. Montgomery; a chaſſe maree, Mr. Smith; and a ſchooner, Mr. Kerdie, which had aſked me to ſail along with the Alliance. I had the ſignal to get under way made, and we did the ſame in the Alliance; the ſhip's company being all in high ſpirit, conſiſted of two hundred and fifty men, beſides paſſengers. The ſhip had been loaded too much by the ſtern; ſhe being very foul, I had her bottom well hogg'd fore and aft the day before, and the barrels of gunpowder which had been imprudently ſtowed, were put in another place, out of danger in caſe of an engagement, by the gunner.</p>
            <p>M. De la Grandville, acting Intendant of the Navy at L'Orient, had given me intelligence when there, that an Engliſh fleet of five and twenty line of battle ſhips had been ſeen off O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſant, about the 12th ult. but ſince had not appeared—having alſo read in the papers, that the enemies had ſent two two-deckers and ſome frigates, to cruize about the weſtern iſlands;—judging the naval Engliſh fleet was gone off Finiſterre, in order to prevent the junction of the French and Spaniſh fleet together; to avoid meeting which, and thoſe about the Weſtern Iſlands, I thought it was beſt to keep in high latitude, where there was little danger, but to meet with a ſingle ſhip at a time, which we might take or engage with, to defend the veſſels in company: Beſides which, we ſhould thereby avoid the calm and extreme heat, conſequently the greateſt dangers of the enemies, ſickneſs among the ſhip's company, and have a ſhorter paſſage to the banks of Newfoundland, where I intended to have the ſhip's bottom hogg'd again, before we made directly for Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Few days after we got under ſail, being at dinner, the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſaid he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been to Boſton, nor had he ever ſeen the Eaſtern States, which induced him to wiſh that I would go thither; two of the Marquis de la Fayette's Aids de Camp and his Secretary joined with him, ſaying, it would ſpare them much fatigue and great expences to which they muſt be expoſed to go from Philadelphia to Rhode-Iſland, at which place the Marquis was then known to be. Others ſupported them, magnifying the dangers of going to Philadelphia. To all which I could anſwer nothing, but that the order of Congreſs was to carry the frigate there, whither then
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019056_0004_0FAA0D842D247520"/>
we muſt go:—Nevertheleſs, tho' I had ſhewn to the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, Ludwell Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> theſe orders at L'Orient, before I reſumed my command, as may appear by what he mentioned in a letter to me, dated there June 15th, and in which he mentioned alſo, that an officer is guilty whenever he does not obey his ſuperiors order, they and others try'd to perſuade me to the contrary; and finding they could not, they grew peeviſh on all occaſions:— And I ſuppoſe, from ſubſequent tranſactions, which will be ſeen in the ſequel, that the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had already deviſed the plan to have the frigate carried to Boſton, with or againſt my conſent.</p>
            <p>On the 11th July, the chaſſe maree ſprung and carried away ſome of her ſpars, Mr. Smith determining thereon to go back to France, the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deſired me to take on board his nephew, Mr. Lewis Lee, and ſome other paſſengers who had embarked in this veſſel, which I did inſtantly, by ſending a boat to bring them on board, having nothing more at heart, next to the ſervice, than to oblige him in all I could.</p>
            <p>The Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for whom I had all the deference and complaiſance due to his rank and former character as Miniſter, having let him chuſe the beſt ſtate-room in the cabbin, and all other accommodations that could be procured on board; notwithſtanding, began to wrangle with me on all accounts, particularly every day at table, complaining and applying, with bitterneſs and haughtineſs, to me as the author that the water ſtank—the meat and other things were either too much or not done enough, &amp;c. &amp;c. I repreſented to him, that the reaſon why the water was not good, was that the caſks had not been properly cleanſed before they were filled, and it was taken in a place that was not clean, as they waſhed their linen, &amp;c. but I could not help it, as it was put on board before I reſumed the command.—However, tho' the ſhip was already very crank, with a deſign to pleaſe him if poſſible, I ordered a water-tub holding two hogſheads to be filled and fixed cloſe to the main-maſt on the quarter-deck, and there filled every morning, to air the water, and take off as much as poſſible its bad ſmell; at the ſame time ordered a centry to ſtand by to make every body obſerve cleanneſs in taking the water out of ſaid tub for any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: the petty officers were alſo to take a quart of water thence every day for tea.—I ſent at almoſt every meal for the cook, and recommended him to have the meat more or leſs done, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the taſte of the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> but all I did to keep in peace, tho' far beyond my duty, was in vain, as he had probably a plan in his head which he wanted to begin by wrangling. He had to ſecond him in the firſt place his two nephews, Meſſirs. Lewis Lee and Ludwell Lee, and Mr. Livingſton, Lieutenant of a man of war, (who was then paſſenger, and had helped him with his teſtimony againſt Silas Deane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>) all three devoted to his will, and fit perſons to work on the mind of the other paſſengers and officers, and promote the execution of his projects.</p>
            <p>The ſhip having been from the beginning too much loaded by the ſtern, beſides the ward-room filled ſince with officers and paſſengers trunks, I repreſented to the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (who had his birth filled alſo with his trunks) the caſe, that the ſhip did not ſail ſo well as uſual, that ſhe was crank by having too much weight aloft, and that his trunks were in the way of two of the guns, which might prove of bad conſequence in a ſudden engagement; that he might tell his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to put all his neceſſary things for ſea in one of his trunks, which he might keep in his birth, and the others ſhould go with mine and all the reſt amid ſhip between decks, under the guard of a centry; he aſſented to it in appearance, and I ordered not only the trunks to be put amid ſhip, but alſo all the boxes of ſmall-arms and lumber between decks to be put forward; and after all that had been done, the ſhip was hardly in good trim.—But ſoon after every body, from the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to the ſeamen, began to grumble at having made this change, tho' for the beſt, by which I perceived the whole crew was worked upon by ſomebody or other, but I could not find out who were the movers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:019056_0005_0FAA0D84E8AC9CE8"/>On the 13th inſt. every one but the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and myſelf being gone to bed, he aſked me what I wanted to do by chaſing every veſſel we met with in our way? I anſwered, I wanted to fulfil my firſt orders from the Navy-Board of Boſton, which were to take or deſtroy all the enemy's veſſels I could. His next queſtion was, whether I would attack an Engliſh frigate of the ſame force we were? I ſaid yes, by all means; that we were provided with all things for that purpoſe, and better manned than an Engliſh frigate of the ſame rate, therefore we ſhould have a good chance to take her. He ſaid, he adviſed me to the contrary, and even to avoid and fly before any enemy's ſhip, and conſider whom I had on board; that I had two Aids de Camp, and the Secretary of the Marquis de la Fayette, and how unhappy it would be if they or other paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers had an arm ſhot off. I replied, I would be very ſorry if any body on board met with any accident whatever; but that the dangers to which every perſon muſt neceſſarily be expoſed in the frigate, ſhould have been conſidered before they came on board:—And obſerved, that tho' the Alliance was fitted out on purpoſe to carry over to France the Marquis de la Fayette, I had orders to attack, engage and take any ſhip from the enemies I could meet with, and the Marquis himſelf was never againſt it, but quite to the contrary.—Then he ſaid, but what would be the fate of my ſervant, if he had an arm ſhot off? I told him, I knew not what the fate of his ſervant would be, but that I ſuppoſed when he took him in his ſervice, he had warned him of the dangers he might undergo, and pay him in conſequence. But ſaid he, have you reflected what a loſs it would be to America, if the Alliance ſhould be taken? Yes, ſir, ſaid I, and I conceive it would be a great one; But if an American man of war always run away before an Engliſh one, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can take the latter; and if the latter chaſe and can come up with the former, ſhe muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take her, as the crew in the ſhip that runs away loſes half their courage, while the crew of the other ſhip who chaſes gains it, by imagining ſome reaſons to be the cauſe of her flight.— Finding he could not convince me by theſe reaſons, he tried another way, ſaying, that if he were in my place, he would think of nothing but ſailing as faſt as poſſible to Philadelphia, becauſe, tho' my caſe was never ſo good againſt Captain Jones, if he arrived there before me, he and his friends would make the ſtory againſt me take ground; but if I arrived firſt, it would be the contrary. I replied, that on all occaſions I would venture my life for the good of the ſervice, and in this caſe I would even venture my reputation in diſcharging my preſent duty; and that I relied entirely on the juſtice of Congreſs.—Thus the converſation between us to the ſame meaning laſted till very late, when I wiſhed the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a good night. He appeared to be diſſatisfied with my reaſoning and ſenſe of duty; but tho' I was very ſorry for it, I could not comply with his deſires, which were ſo diametrically oppoſite to my duty. It is to be ſuſpected that he took that time when no perſon was preſent to witneſs the converſation, to ſpeak to me thus, in caſe that had I complied with his wiſhes, he might have denied theſe counſels after, if he had found it neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every one, paſſengers and officers, on board the Alliance and other veſſels in company, wanted to keep a courſe ſuitable to his opinion; ſome would have gone by the ſmall latitude, to take the trade wind, others by the middle one, &amp;c. without conſidering the ſeaſon we were in, and other circumſtances. Capt. Bell, of the Luzerne, always ſteering more towards the ſouth than the courſe given, tried to draw us in leſſer latitude.</p>
            <p>The Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as the headmoſt of the paſſengers, was the ſpeaker who always made the motions, being certain to be ſupported, right or wrong, by all officers and paſſengers. One day being at table, he aſked me why I kept the ſhip in 47 degrees latitude north? I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him all the advantages which we ſhould derive from it, and particularly, that we ſhould avoid the calm, and conſequently have a ſhorter paſſage. He replied, that it could not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019056_0006_0FAA0D8578CC67C0"/>
be, as the ſhorteſt way from one point to another, was to ſteer the courſe only that lead to it.— I told him it was not always the caſe, and that chiefly two courſes of the compaſs were oftener the ſhorteſt way to go from one point to the other. He ſaid, he would be glad if I would prove it and all the others laid the ſame. I took a twelve-pound ſhot, and with ſome chalk drew a parallel ſuppoſed by eighty degrees north latitude; on it one point ſuppoſed to be the firſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and another to be 180 degrees longitude, and ſaid, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> way to go from one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe points to the other, was to ſteer north to the pole arctic, and thence ſouth to the other point; and that theſe two courſes were ſhorter than due eaſt or weſt, which would alſo lead from one of theſe points to the other: I allowed that we were not wholly in that caſe, but by running <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver the degrees of longitude in high latitude, where they were ſhorter than in leſſer; as going upon Newfoundland and thence to Philadelphia, we lengthened but little our way, and would by theſe courſes gather all theſe advantages heretofore mentioned. But all I ſaid was out of regard and complaiſance to the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as I was the only one anſwerable to a court martial for the ſame. Nevertheleſs, he and the others could or rather would not underſtand ſo plain a demonſtration.</p>
            <p>On the 14th inſt. the wind at north by eaſt, and the ſea very ſmooth, being upon deck before ſupper, ſeeing the weather braces ran in, and the ſhip going one point large, I told Lieutenant Degge thereof, and ordered him to have the ſails trimmed properly, and the ſhip kept cloſe to the wind, which he did. After ſupper, when I went back on deck, I found that he had the weather braces hall'd in again, and the ſhip going large; I repeated my order to him, but he not being rational after ſupper, fell in a paſſion and ordered to brace the yards fore and aft; and ſtamping with his foot on the quarter deck, ſaid that I wanted to loſe ſight of the ſhip Luzerne, which was not a mile diſtant on our lee quarter. I told him to mind how he charged me in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic with bad intention; he repeated the ſame; I ordered him to go and keep under an arreſt in his cabbin; he ſwore he would not go, and no body could make him. I went to him, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him he had better go, or he ſhould be forced to it. He took me by the collar of my coat, and aſked whether I would force him? I ordered Lieutenant Warren, who was on watch, with two marines, to force him to go down in his birth. Lieutenant Degge left me and went on the forecaſtle, ſoon after Lieutenant Warren came to tell me that Lieutenant Degge had a pike brandiſhing in his hand, threatening to run it through any body who would offer to come to him. I told him to follow me; when Lieutenant Degge ſaw that I went directly to him, he let fall the pike, and got over the rail on the cathead, ſaying, he was going to jump into the ſea. I went back on the quarter deck, after having repeated my order to Lieutenant Warren, who came to tell me, ſoon after, that Lieutenant Degge was in his birth.</p>
            <p>I daily perceived a great change in the crew's behaviour towards the ſervice and myſelf; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the high ſpirit, activity and obedience they ſhewed at firſt, they gradually grew remiſs, backward, and grumbled in proportion as the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and other paſſengers and officers grew peeviſh, licentious and undutiful; and I ſaw plainly the former were enticed by the latter, but could not tell how, nor know poſitively who actuated them ſo, as they kept all their proceedings ſecret from me: Beſides, I was determined to ſuffer perſonally from the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for whom I had yet the ſame regard, rather than to act with a right authority that would have been ſupported by no body, thinking he would never attempt any thing againſt the ſervice.</p>
            <p>The Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and his two nephews, always kept company with Meſſieurs De Pontgibeau and La Colomb, the two Aids de Camp to the Marquis de la Fayette, and M. Poiré,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019056_0007_0FAA0D87A06C81B0"/>
his Secretary, all three young men, who were eaſily prevailed upon by the art and ſuggeſtion of the former, and brought to be zealots in their party.</p>
            <p>One day, as two of them were playing at cheſs together, M. De la Colomb told the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that M. de Chavane, Captain of the French frigate the Senſible, had told him that when all a ſhip's company agreed to take the command from their Captain, the only reaſon that can juſtify them is, to ſay, all together, that the Captain was crazy.</p>
            <p>Another time M. De Pontgibeau ſaid, that when the Captain of a ſhip was unwilling to do that which all the reſt wanted to be done, there was always ſome body that could do for him at once.—The next day after he brought his piſtols from the ward-room into the cabbin, and put them in the ſtate-room of the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Mr. Poiré aſked him if they were loaded? He anſwered they were. All that was ſaid and done in the Honorable A. Lee, Eſqr's preſence; who, to encourage it, quibbled, and uſed double meaning—words to the ſame intent and purpoſe, but concealed his true meaning with more art and cunning than the former: But of all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers on board, Mr. Ludwell Lee diſtinguiſhed himſelf in that way above the others; and beſides, he altered and ſubverted all that I ſaid: He had acquired ſuch a credit on that account, and I ſuppoſe in their private aſſemblies, that they called him the lawyer; and the French officers repeatedly paid him the compliment, in my hearing, that from a bad cauſe he would make appear a good one.</p>
            <p>On the 16th inſt. Mr. Montgomery, in the brig in company bore away to the ſouthward, and left us.</p>
            <p>On the 17th inſt. at day-break, Mr. Buckley came to acquaint me of a ſail being in ſight, bearing S. W. from us. I ordered to bear upon her, and have all ſails ſet. I went up and ſaw ſhe was a large ſhip, cloſe to the wind on the larboard tack, under topſails only, which proved ſhe was a ſhip of war cruiſing. As ſoon as ſhe perceived we chaſed her, ſhe bore away and crouded all ſail in a very ſhort time to run away from us. Perceiving that the officers, far from being anxious to make all ſail to come up with her, were very remiſs at it, I told Mr. Lynd to attend and have the driver ſet; he anſwered, he knew not how. Seeing his unwillingneſs to do it, I called a quarter-maſter, and ordered him to ſet the driver, before Mr. Lynd. I went forward to have all ſail ſet there, ſeeing the officers were unwilling to do it; but while I was looking and ordering a ſail ſet, they had another halliard let go; and it was ten o'clock, A. M. before we were under all ſails. We gained little upon the chace, when Mr. Larcher, followed by other officers, came to tell me that if all the trunks and boxes of arms were put aft again, we ſhould ſoon come up with her. Tho' I knew the contrary, I conſented to it; for if I had refuſed, they would have ſaid I miſſed that ſhip by my own fault. (We loſt ſight a-ſtern of the Luzerne ſhip about two o'clock, P. M.) At ſeven o'clock the chace had gained from us; I then gave up the chace, and went to viſit a Portugueſe ſnow, which had paſſed along-ſide of the chace, which he ſaid had four and twenty guns upon her main-deck, and ſix or eight upon her quarter-deck:—So we miſſed the chance of taking a fine frigate, by the undutifulneſs of the officers.</p>
            <p>One day, going upon the quarter-deck, I obſerved for a while Mr. Livingſton and James Pratt, quarter-maſter, leaning together on the rail, whiſpering to each other. This quarter-maſter had of late, and was the only one who had, his hammock hung under the quarter-deck, in order to be found there at once when wanted, as will appear in the ſequel. He was alſo the man who knocked down with a handſpike ſeveral hogs, I heard ſince, to ſhorten freſh proviſions, with a deſign to oblige us to go to Boſton.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:019056_0008_0FAA0D884B429180"/>Once, when I was walking alone on the quarter-deck, Mr. Brown, a paſſenger gentleman of Charleſton, accoſted me, and ſaid if I would give up chaſing any veſſels, all the paſſengers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether would make me a preſent of a handſome ſum of money. I looked at him with diſdain, and aſked him if he wanted to attempt to bribe me out of my duty. They tried thus all means to inſnare me.</p>
            <p>The Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> finding that I took no notice of his and others quibbling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, changed it gradually into the groſſeſt inſults, in order to provoke me at laſt to act with him with the ſeverity, it required, being ſure that his abettors would alter and invert all to his and their advantage, and give it out to the crew and others in their own way.</p>
            <p>Once, at dinner time, he began by applying to me as uſual, complaining with bitterneſs of all that was upon the table, the water, &amp;c. I made my uſual apology, in order to ſatisfy him, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſaying, that there was at every dinner three diſhes of different freſh meats, beſides ſalted ones, which I had always ordered the cook to dreſs to his own liking; there was alſo three different ſorts of wines, punch and beer; I acknowledged the water was not good, but all that could be done to make it better had been practiſed, and added, that I could not have done more for a King, had he been on board, than I had for him:—That he had choſen and took the beſt ſtate room; uſed the cabbin as his own, diverting in it himſelf, with ſuch company and whenever he pleaſed, whether I was buſy in writing in it or not:—That at table I never offered to help myſelf, but as ſoon as the meats were carved, or the deſert upon table, I always obſerved to hand him the diſhes one after another, but had alſo obſerved that after he had taken out that which pleaſed him beſt, he handed it round the table that I might have it the laſt; that I mentioned that laſt part no other ways than to let him know I was ſenſible of his affected diſregard for me, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, all that was on board was at his ſervice, but I could procure him no better, he ſaid, with ſcurrility, it was good enough for me, and deſired I would take his ſtate room from him; I ſaid, it was not my intention, but he inſiſted and repeated ſeveral times that he wiſhed it; I told him to give me in writing that his wiſh and deſire was ſuch, he ſaid I was an aſs, and when in America I ſhould have my ears cut off; I told him I knew his views in abuſing me thus, that I was determined not to reſent any thing whatever, when on board, but when on ſhore, any body that would offer to fight me either with ſword or piſtols, ſhould have a ſatisfaction; but if any there threatened to cut my ears, I would then actually horſewhip him, and I inſtantly roſe from table.</p>
            <p>After that had paſſed, the other paſſengers and officers grew altogether progreſſively more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, and the crew more undutiful.</p>
            <p>On the firſt of Auguſt, Mr. Buckley came at 6 o'clock, A. M. to acquaint me of a ſail being in ſight, I went up and found that ſhe was lying to on the ſtarboard tack, bearing N. W. of us, at two leagues diſtance, I ordered to chaſe her, ſhe bore away, and made all ſail ſhe could ſteering weſt, the wind blowing freſh, I ordered a reef to be taken in the main-top ſail, but they were better than an hour in doing it; Mr. Lynd having gone aloft on purpoſe, I ſuppoſe to prevent its being done ſooner, and when it was finiſhed the weather earing was ſo looſe that it kept better than half an hour more before it was hauled taught to the yard-arm, during all which time the main-top ſail being on the maſt, and the chaſe making all the ſail ſhe could bear, we gained none upon her, and an hour after a thick fog coming on, we loſt ſight of her, however I continued the chaſe until noon, when I ordered Mr. Lynd, who took the watch, to have the three top-ſail yards lowered on the caps, and then come to the courſe, which was W. N. W. cloſe reef the top-ſails; and having been wet through all the time of the chaſe, I went down to ſhift my cloaths, but Mr. Lynd, inſtead of doing that, as I had ordered him, came cloſe to the wind before the top-ſail yards
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019056_0009_0FAA0D89C7C307B0"/>
were lowered, by which the ſhip lay on her lee broad-ſide, and the main maſt ſprung: I went on the quarter deck and ordered the helm a-weather, and the three top-ſails and mizen clewed up, the main-top gallant muſt to be launched, and preventer ſtays to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the 5th inſtant, having a lightning conductor ready made, by the armourer, I ordered the carpenter, about 7 o'clock, A. M. to have it fixed to the main royal m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. de Pontgibeau went to awake the Honorable A. Lee, Eſq, at half paſt ſeven o'clock, he got up directly and went out of the cabbin. Some time after my ſteward told me, that ſome of the crew being aſſembled under the quarter-deck, wanted to ſpeak with me; I ſent immediately for my clerk, had the regulation for the navy, with pen, ink and paper on the table, when Mr. Lynd, who had juſt taken the watch, came to tell me the ſame, I anſwered, he might tell them to come five at a time in the cabbin; the Honorable A. Lee came in, and James Pratt behind him held the door open, about thirty ſeamen were aſſembled under the quarter-derk; James Pratt ſaid, they would ſpeak to me all at once and on the quarter-deck, and added, they would make more ſail, and one of the fore-top men ſaid, let us go and make more ſail, and accordingly they went forwards to do it.</p>
            <p>I bid my clerk to take the pen, ink and paper, and follow me on the quarter deck, where we found part of the paſſengers, and the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and the reſt following me: I ſaw part of the crew who had been under the quarter-deck, hoiſting the fore-top ſail yard, I ordered Lieutenant Elwood of the marines, who was on watch, to have inſtantly all the marines under arms, he did not ſo much as anſwer me, but continued to walk with an air of indifference, fore and aft, by which conduct I perceived I had no more help to expect from him than from all the reſt of the officers who were all abſent but Mr. Lynd, who had the watch: I gueſſed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the paſſengers was premeditated to encourage the people to mutiny.</p>
            <p>Though I ſaw plainly by the countenances of the paſſengers, and abſence of the officers, that this mutiny was concerned amongſt themſelves, and carried on only by a ſmall part of the crew, that I could not expect to be ſupported by any body; nevertheleſs, I thought it my duty to try all means to ſtop it, if poſſible: I therefore ſent for Captain Parke, Meſſrs. Buckley, Larcher and all the other officers;—word was brought me that they were ſhaving themſelves, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>James Pratt, who was on the ſtarboard gang-way, ordering the others how to make more ſail, ſeeing me on the quarter-deck, called to ſome of them to follow him, and they came there; I aſked him if he knew what he was about, and the conſequence thereof, he anſwered yes, and if I would not make more ſail, they would chooſe a better Captain than I was, looking at maſter Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſton: I told my clerk to read to them the regulation for the American Navy; James Pratt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019056_0010_0FAA0D8A0C4BA0F8"/>
ſaid, there was no need therefor, as they knew them all being made by them; I aſked his name, he told it, I ordered my clerk to write it down, as I had told him to write down my queſtions and his anſwers, but he would neither write his name, nor a ſyllable of what was ſaid: I don't mention all James Pratt's abuſive language to me, and the ſatisfaction which appeared in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and other paſſengers, that part being eaſily imagined, and uſeleſs to be related; at laſt James Pratt ſaid to the others, let us go and make more ſail, the fore-top man mentioned heretofore, repeated the ſame, and they went again forward.</p>
            <p>At laſt Capt. Parke came up from the ward room, I ordered him to have all the marines under arms, and if they did not obey at the firſt call, to have them called name by name, as they were wrote on his liſt, and to write the diſobedience of any one that would not obey, before his name; he anſwered, he had not the liſt; I replied, he or ſome other officer of marine had it, he ſaid it was in the marines birth; I told him to ſend for it, he ſaid he had no body; I told him then to go himſelf for it, at laſt, after he had evaded as long as he could from doing his duty on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he ſent a ſerjeant therefor: by all that conduct of his, inſtead of anticipating my orders to have the marines ready to ſtop the mutiny, as was his particular and immediate buſineſs, I was convinced that ſaid mutiny was preconcerted and ſupported by both paſſengers and officers.</p>
            <p>I told Mr. Lynd to go and let fly the fore-topſail yard hallyards, he anſwered, the people had wrecked the fore-top yard ties and back ſtays together, I told him to go and unwreck them.— Sometime after the liſt of the marines was brought to Captain Parke, I repeated my order to him, and went forward to Mr. Lynd, whom I told to let go one of the fore-top yard hallyards, while I let go the other, I let my ſide one fly, but he kept his ſide one faſt to give time to a man to wreck it again, as he did. Though I had not been more than two minutes abſent when I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the quarter-deck, I found Captain Park doing nothing, I aſked him why he did not call the marines, he anſwered he had, but they had all refuſed to come, and he promiſed he would give me a copy certified of ſaid liſt, with their diſobedience annexed to each name, as they had been called.</p>
            <p>I ordered Mr. Lynd to take all the petty officers to help him to ſhorten ſail, he anſwered, what can a man do when all are of one mind againſt him; though I underſtood very well that he meant all the officers were in the general plot, I aſked if any officer had refuſed to obey, he ſaid nothing: Meſſrs. Buckley and Larcher appeared then, I told them to take with them all the officers and to lower the fore-top ſail yard, the former came ſoon after to tell me, they held him and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his doing it; I told him to give me the name of any one who had touched him, he would not, but went again forward, and came back to tell me that twenty of the ſailors held the hallyards and would not let them go, and added, what in the name of God can a man do againſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. (N. B.) That the only ſeamen which appeared in mutiny, were not forty in number, that had the officers of marines, ſerjeants and corporals took arms, they might have ſtopped the mutiny at once, and had all the ſea officers and petty officers oppoſed theſe ſeamen, they were capable by their number to ſtop alſo the mutiny; but inſtead of that I ſurprized them ſmiling at one another, and at the paſſengers, which made me ſenſible they were not only in the plot, but that they made ridicule of it, and of the orders I gave thereon.—Wherefore I told them I had ſeen and heard enough to convince me that they would do nothing to help me to ſtop the mutiny, that, it being impoſſible for me to do it alone, I was going, and accordingly went down.</p>
            <p>The Carpenter came to aſk me what he ſhould do with the lightening rod, as he could not fix it, I told him to put it down again, and that we muſt go without it.</p>
            <p>Half paſt eleven o'clock, when I went to obſerve the ſun at meridian, I found Mr. Livingſton and James Pratt walking and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſing together on the quarter-deck, in preſence of the Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and other paſſengers and officers, but when they ſaw me they parted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:019056_0011_0FAA0D8AD0017920"/>Half paſt two o'clock, P. M. Meſſrs. Buckley, Larcher and others, came to aſk me what courſe I choſe to ſteer, and ſaid the people had altered the courſe, I told them the ſame, being certain it had not been altered, they aſked me what ſail they muſt carry, I told them as much as ſhip and maſts could bear.</p>
            <p>Theſe demands of orders with regard to the courſe and ſail which I choſe to make, were new proofs that all that had been done in the morning was by the officers directions; for had the crew really got maſters of the ſhip againſt the officers endeavors, when the latter had all the arms, &amp;c. at command, they would not have been ſo poſitive in aſking my orders, when the crew had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready got maſters of the ſhip, and conſequently of all that was on board.</p>
            <p>Next morning Mr. Buckley came to acquaint me, we had ſounding on the bank of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by thirty five fathom, I ordered him to fill ſail again, without loſs of time, but not ſeeing the ſhip come to her courſe, I went up and found Mr Buckley fiſhing himſelf with the reſt, I put the helm a-weather, and ordered to let fall the fore ſail, and make proper ſail. The conduct of the officers and crew proved they were agreed together to ſtop the ſhip or increaſe her ſail when they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>I ſent my Clerk to aſk of Capt. Parke a copy of the marine liſt, certified by him, with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal annexed to it.—Capt. Parke refuſed it, as may appear by the following certificate.</p>

            <p>On the ſame evening at about ten o'clock, after I had, as I ever did ſince I reſumed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, locked the door before I went to bed; the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> came to aſk me the key of it, I gave it to him; he went out for about a quarter of an hour, and when he came back I begged of him to lock the door again, he ſaid he had done it, and laid the key on the table: The next morning I was ſurprized to ſee the ſteward early in the cabbin, who told me he had found the door unlocked; and ſome days after he aſſured me, that when he found the door ſo unlocked there was no centry out ſide of the door as uſually; all which appeared ſuſpicious in the preſent circumſtances. The night following and every evening after the Honorable A Lee, Eſq: left his birth in the cabbin, and went to lay in the ward room; the true reaſon of it may be aſcribed, by what happened a few nights after, to the neceſſity of his being in the ward room during the night, to promote and encourage the following tranſactions.</p>
            <p>On the eleventh inſtant, while at table, I felt myſelf ſo ill, that I got up to go to bed, one of the paſſengers got up alſo, and went out in a hurry; a few minutes after, James Pratt having paſſed the centry out-door, without leave, opened the cabbin-door and kept it ſo, I ſaw about thirty men under the quarter-deck, and James Baily, with another, advanced towards my bed, told me, they came in the crew's name to repreſent their home was near Boſton, and begged I would carry them there; I told them I could not comply with their requeſt, as Congreſs's order was to carry the frigate Alliance to Philadelphia; thoſe two men went away without grumbling; but James Pratt ſaid he would go to Boſton, and the fore-top man, mentioned in the firſt mutiny, repeated the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon Mr. Buckley came, he ſaid, to repreſent to me that the wind, which was then eaſterly, might and would, in his opinion, ſhift to the weſt, and then we muſt be a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could get to Philadelphia, that the greateſt danger of meeting the enemies was going there, as they were very thick on thoſe ſea: I anſwered, that it was probable Congreſs had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered thoſe things before they ordered the frigate to go there, and had found the propriety thereof, and it was not our buſineſs to pretend to be wiſer than they.</p>
            <p>Soon after all the officers brought, (they ſaid in writing) their opinions, which were contained in a letter as follows, viz.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:019056_0013_0FAA0D8C519509A0"/>I would not read this letter, telling them I had not required their opinion, Congreſs having ordered the frigate Alliance's immediate return to Philadelphia; I would never conſent to break their order, upon ſpecious pretences; Mr. Blodged preſſing me exceedingly to go to Boſton, I told him I was afraid ſelf-intereſt made him ſo urgent.</p>
            <p>The officers ſaid, and Mr. Elwood in particular, inſiſted, that if I would ſhew them my orders, they would cheerfully obey me in going to Philadelphia; (N. B. the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was preſent had ſeen them, as heretofore ſaid, in l'Orient) I replied, that dutiful officers never aſked to ſee the orders a Captain had to obey him: They then told me to go and ſpeak to the people, I ſaid I could not, being ſick, and I had ſpoken to them already, and could ſay no more than I had, and added, were I well and to go on the quarter-deck, I think I could expect no more aſſiſtance from the officers to help me to perſuade the people to do their duty by going to Philadelphia, than I had experienced when I wanted their help to prevent or ſtop their mutiny on the 5th inſt. they never offered me any aſſiſtance, but aſked my orders, which I told them they had in writing, to keep the courſe weſt half ſouth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lynd came again ſome time after, repeating the ſame thing; Mr. Buckley had told me before about the dangers going to Philadelphia, but aſſured me the courſe would not be altered whilſt he was on watch; by which I was ſtill more convinced that the people were only the agents of the paſſengers and officers, and would never offer of their own accord to alter the courſe, if the others did not join with them; and in that caſe, I alone, againſt the paſſengers, officers and crew, could not prevent their doing it. All that had paſſed before three o'clock; and the officers having exhauſted in vain their ſchemes to perſuade me to break Congreſs's orders by going to Boſton, I expected they would give up that unwarrantable point.</p>
            <p>All being very quiet the remainder of the afternoon, as I had much ſuffered by a rheumatic pain or cold over all the body, when it ſubſided late in the evening, I fell aſleep, when I awoke an hour after looking at my hanging compaſs, I ſaw the courſe was altered and kept to the N. W. by weſt, I got up inſtantly and crawled up as well as I could on the quarter deck, finding all aſleep but the quarter maſter and men at the wheel, I aſked for the officer of the watch; the quarter-maſter went to awake Mr. Buckley, who was lying upon a gun; I aſked him whether he knew that the courſe was altered, though againſt my written order, to keep it weſt half ſouth, which they had? He ſaid yes. I told him that he muſt anſwer for it. Seeing that tranquility which was in his countenance and all over the ſhip, I judged it had been done by the officers and paſſengers conſent, without any compulſion of the crew, and that it was out of my power to oppoſe it in any way, at leaſt until I knew how it had been carried on, accordingly I went down, expecting to learn more about it in the morning, and to conſider what could be done in that caſe.</p>
            <p>On the 12th inſtant, at 5 o'clock, A. M. I ſent my Clerk for the maſter's log book, but it was refuſed, until the evening, then I ſaw therein that the courſe had been altered wholly by the paſſengers and officers concerted wills and agreed mutiny, and that they had given the command, as to a deſperado, to the already very guilty Lieutenant Degge, whom they had taken out of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt on purpoſe:—Then it was too manifeſt, that the officers, paſſengers and crew were all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers, the latter by the ſuggeſtions of the former, and of courſe it was impoſſible to pretend to do any thing againſt their general revolt, had I been in a ſtate of health to go upon deck.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs I ſent a written order to Lieutenant Degge, to go back and keep under arreſt, but he would not obey it.</p>
            <p>I ſent alſo the followings, viz.</p>

            <p>Had they received and obeyed theſe orders, I would have aſſumed as much command as they would have let me, I ſay as they would have let me, as I could have it but by their own accord, ſince the paſſengers, officers and crew had taken it alternately from me; and I would have tried to carry the ſhip into Rhode-Iſland, whence I could have given the firſt intelligence of what had paſſed to the admiralty at Boſton and Philadelphia, and keep every one on board, until I could have an anſwer; but by this re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l they prevented that, and all I would have offered to do.</p>
            <p>On the 15th inſtant, being a little better, I got up, and ſaw one of the ſhip's jolly boat, with James Pratt in it, towing a fiſhing boat on board; I went on the quarter-deck and ordered Mr. Buckley to let no-body go out of the ſhip, and ſtepped in the cabbin where I kept night and day a light ready to ſeal my letter for the Navy Board, whenever an opportunity might occur, but when I came up with it, the boat was off, I called to the people on board to take my letter, they would not do it.</p>
            <p>Seeing then Lieutenant Degge ſtanding on the booms, I ordered him to go to his birth again under arreſt; he looked reſolute and undetermined until Mr. Louis Lee and Mr. de la Colomb whiſpered with him, after which he ſaid, every one had put him in command of the ſhip, and he would keep it, ſome other paſſengers joining them; I ſaw it was uſeleſs to ſay any more, as he would not, nor any body elſe, obey.</p>
            <p>About an hour after, the wind being N. W. and the weather very foggy, the ſhip being cloſe hauled on the larboard tack, I ſaw from the cabbin the breakes of Shoals-Iſlands, bearing N. N. W. within half a mile of us, I went on the quarter-deck, and ordered the helm hard a port, and to ſhiver the after-ſails, which was done inſtantly; Lieutenant Degge then came there and ordered the crew to obey no-body but himſelf, to which they ſubmitted; I told Lieutenant Degge, that it looked as if he wanted to loſe the frigate, as he ran her ſo amongſt the ſhoals, he anſwered, it was I, and that he would fight me when on ſhore, and the paſſengers backed him, ſaying, I muſt fight them all: M. de Pontigbeau, being very guilty for his former conduct, then ſpoke in French, abuſing me for a quarter of an hour, in ſuch language that a porter muſt bluſh to repeat it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to provoke me to aſſault him before the crew who did not underſtand him, but he loſt his time, as I did not even reply a ſingle word, but left him and went away into the cabbin.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Alliance came at anchor in Nantaſket-Road, on the 16th inſt. moſt of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and officers went together, unknown to me, in the barge on ſhore, and directly, to make
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019056_0015_0FAA0D8DC4A6CFA8"/>
their own ſtory good, went to the Navy Board to complain firſt againſt me as a guilty and crazy captain, who had reſigned (they ſaid) the command of the ſhip, and added to theſe falſehoods all they thought could juſtify their black deeds, and bring blame upon me.</p>
            <p>The Honorable Navy Board might have perceived by the conduct and hurry of the paſſengers and officers to charge me thus, that it was unnatural to ſuppoſe me really guilty; as had I been ſo, it muſt ſoon have been known without ſuch parade, which looked rather as though they were themſelves guilty, they, with a preconcerted deſign came to make the ſame agreed ſtory, in order to prepoſſeſs ſaid Navy Board againſt me, that they might not liſten to the truth I would ſay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>The paſſengers, ſatisfied with the credulity of the Navy Board, ſpread ſoon their plotted fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tale all over the town; as the ſeamen did amongſt the ſeafaring men; which gained ſo much the more credit, as I could not contradict it, being kept on board, without my power to have a boat to go, or ſend my official letter to the Navy Board.</p>
            <p>If the Honorable Navy Board had ſent an impartial officer, or other, from ſhore, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was really crazy or not, and if I had any thing to ſay in my behalf, it would have enabled them to judge with more propriety the veracity or falſehood of the paſſengers and officers ſtory, but inſtead of that they wrote a letter to Lieutenant Degge, directing him to bring the ſhip up, which implied their approbation of his being in command.</p>

                  <p>I acquainted them thus:—I have had two revolts of the crew, the firſt one on the <hi>5</hi>th inſtant, in which I was not ſupported in endeavouring to prevent it; and the crew, in appearance, got maſters of the ſhip.—The ſecond was on the <hi>11</hi>th inſtant, in this one the paſſengers and officers had hands, as appear per log book, for it was by them the courſe was altered, contrary to my written orders; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, requeſted, and charged with, a Lieutenant to bring the ſhip here—which he has effected, though he was under an arreſt: You may ſee, gentlemen, by the above proceedings it is to be ſuſpected that a great many are concerned in theſe revolts, ſome out of policy, others by adventurous intereſt, and all the guilties in the firſt revolt, through fear that the occaſion of it would be better ſearched into at Philadelphia than at Boſton.—I was taken ill on the <hi>11</hi>th inſtant, all that has been done ſince, was without even adviſing me thereof. There are on board two ringleaders in the firſt revolt, but I cannot have them ſecured till I have ſomebody to obey me, and I ſuppoſe the intention of every body is to exculpate them. All the officers refuſed to receive my written orders; ſome ſaid they received Mr. Degge's orders, who is the firſt Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant choſen for the purpoſe, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>It is to be obſerved that the Honorable Navy Board ſent me a receipt without a ſignature to it, for my official letter to them, which letter, in all appearance had no effect with them, as Lieutenant
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019056_0016_0FAA0D8EFB1198E8"/>
Degge was continued in command, and no order ſent to ſecure the two ringleaders of the firſt mutiny mentioned therein.</p>
            <p>I had ſent them word alſo, that I had neither men or boat left under my command, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my going on ſhore to acquaint them with further particulars of what had happened; but none was procured me.</p>
            <p>When the ſhip came up to Boſton, ſhe was (which was uncuſtomary) immediately put along-ſide the long wharf, as to give the two ringleaders of the firſt mutiny an opportunity to eſcape, as they did; becauſe, had they been ſtopped and properly proſecuted, they muſt have detected the mover of the plots and ſome of their accomplices.</p>
            <p>Going out of the ſhip in company with Lieutenant Brown, who had been ſent for me from the Navy-Board, Lieutenant Degge offered me to have the ſhip's ſide mann'd. I told him I could not accept his offices, being unlawful, having broken his arreſt. He followed me on the wharf, and challenged me to box with him there. I told him, if he wanted to fight me, he ſhould take a ſword as I had by my ſide, then I would be his match: But as he did not like to fight this or any gentleman-like way, he made uſe of bad language to me all along the wharf, and left us at the end of it.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Brown being with me at the Navy-Board, we waited a long time before the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable James Warren, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Preſident of ſaid Board, and the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> came out of a private room, where they had, to all appearance, conſulted together about the means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpate the guilty.</p>
            <p>The Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> being gone directly, the Honorable James Warren, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> aſked me why I did not come ſooner on ſhore? I told him I had let him know that I had neither boat nor men left under my command to do it, ſince the officers and paſſengers had mutinied and got maſters of the ſhip. He replied, that they ſaid I had reſigned the command. I anſwered, they muſt needs ſay ſomething to palliate their guilt, if poſſible; but it was explained in my official letter to them, that they had taken ſaid command abſolutely from me on the 10th inſt. and ſince had even refuſed to receive and obey my written orders to them; and all that becauſe I would not break Congreſs's order, which was to carry the frigate Alliance into Philadelphia, and comply with their deſires in coming to Boſton.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Brown then related before Preſident Warren and his colleague, Mr. Vernon, of the Navy-Board, how Lieutenant Degge had juſt now challenged me to box with him on the wharf, &amp;c.—He had hardly ended his narration, when Lieutenant Warren, of the Alliance's marines, and ſon of the preſent Preſident, came to tell his father that all the centries had left their poſts, and declared they would not do duty any longer, the frigate being at the wharf.—Any body might have expected the Honorable Navy-Board juſt after they heard heard of the new demeanor of Lieut. Degge to me, would have ordered by Lieutenant Warren Lieutenant Degge to be put under an arreſt, and would have tranſmitted the command to another officer:—But inſtead of ſuch juſt conduct, the Preſident ſent his ſon, Lieutenant Warren, to tell Lieutenant Degge to declare to the marines they ſhould loſe ſo much of their pay for every day they would omit to do their duty: which implied their continuing him in full command, and convinced me at once that I had no juſtice to expect from them.</p>
            <p>The Honorable Preſident Warren had in all appearance ſeveral reaſons, even if he had loved juſtice, to have it not done in this inſtance; for had it taken place, the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his intimate friend, and Lieutenant Warren, his eldeſt ſon, muſt have both ſuffered as principal; amongſt the reſt of the guilty: and beſides, he thought to gain popularity, in redeeming ſo many
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019056_0017_0FAA0D8FAB0E00D0"/>
culprits, all which had their friends, by ſacrificing me, being a foreigner, ſeen with jealouſy by all the officers in the navy; which views, I ſuppoſe, made him uſe all means to become the ſtrongeſt party againſt me; and his colleague, tho' he had but the latter of theſe inducements, followed his example.</p>
            <p>Thoſe gentlemen told me they did not underſtand well my letter, being too conciſe concerning all that had happened on board the Alliance, during her paſſage from France to Boſton. I enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated it as minutely as my memory would admit, three days ſucceſſively, for about two hours each day, tho' my official letter would have been ſufficient for them.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, on the 24th inſt. they told me a Court of Enquiry would ſit the next week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to enquire into the affair.—As I foreſaw it was deviſed by them to have the guilty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, ſhould their crime be proved ever ſo evident before ſaid court, that they might be received as witneſſes againſt me in an enſuing Court Martial, where, by their junto, and concerted falſe evidences, they muſt have me broken: and that to the contrary, had a Court Martial immediately taken place, their guilt muſt have been proved, they be condemned, and their evidence againſt me found to be falſe, and nothing but a plot, and rejected as ſuch.—I repreſented to them, that a Court of Enquiry, which was ſometimes neceſſary to find out whether there had been ſome fault in any body for an event which had happened, was unneceſſary in the preſent caſe, wherein, beſides all that I had ſaid verbally, there were already extant charges againſt the paſſengers, officers and crew, exhibited in my letter to the Navy-Board: And ſeeing they would make no allowance for my juſt repreſentations thereupon, I declared I would ſay nothing until a Court Martial ſat.</p>
            <p>All I had ſaid on that account was uſeleſs, as the Navy-Board's plan was determined; and in conſequence thereof, having choſen to be Judge Advocate a young man about 20 years old, whom they could command and direct to their will in their own way, ſaid Court of Enquiry was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſit on the 29th Auguſt.</p>
            <p>Said Court being opened that day, I gave them in writing the following declaration, viz.</p>

            <p>I do not pretend to prove all the falſehood contained in the evidences given, by the paſſengers, officers or crew, to clear themſelves and to charge me, in this court: As it is an axiom that a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of a falſehood, when it is a poſſible thing, is impracticable without witneſs to the contrary! —For example, if I was alone in a place, and a perſon, or ſeveral in a plot, having been there
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019056_0018_0FAA0D90B71987A0"/>
with me, teſtify that I then ſaid or did any poſſible thing, though I did not; having no true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which is the preſent caſe) it is impracticable to prove their falſehood, but by their own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as the two elders were proved to be perjurers againſt the chaſte Suſana.</p>
            <p>Therefore, by ſome obſervations that I will make on that court's conduct, and on the following extracts of evidences given in ſaid court, taken from the copy thereof, which the Judge Advocate ſold me, I will offer to prove to the reader, and leave him to judge, the partiality of ſaid court againſt me, in favor of theſe witneſs, in not trying to draw further the truth of their crime out of their own mouth; and in their judgment acquitting or at leaſt clearing theſe paſſengers, officers and crew, as much as they could, and charging me with all their might, though they were evidently guilty of mutiny, &amp;c. and I was innocent.</p>
            <p>To Mr. Degge, Lieutenant. "Queſtion of the court. How long was you confined?"</p>
            <p>Anſwer. "'Till the tenth of Auguſt, when I was releaſed by invitation from the officers and paſſengers, to take the command of the ſhip."</p>
            <p>Q. "What appeared to you to be their motive in giving you the command?"</p>
            <p>A. "Becauſe Capt. Landais had abdicated the command, and retired to his cabbin.</p>
            <p>OBSERVATION. The firſt anſwer of Mr. Degge implies fully that he broke his arreſt, by being releaſed by the invitation from the officers and paſſengers, to take the command of the ſhip, which implies alſo the general plot and mutiny of the paſſengers and officers. In the next anſwer he ſaid it was done becauſe I had abdicated the command, &amp;c. but he don't ſay how I had abdicated it, and the court did not aſk him how to prove it otherwiſe than by ſaying I had retired to my cabbin, which is a neceſſary thing to do when a Captain is ſick or wants to ſleep, &amp;c. No other neceſſary queſtion on that account was made, to the contrary; here follows the Judge Advocate's note, viz. "Mr. Degge being the perſon who took the command, it was improper to be too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in aſking what might involve himſelf, he gave therefore only a general hiſtory of matters, there being others who could be particular with more propriety."</p>
            <p>By this note it is eaſy to perceive that the Judge Advocate was already acquainted with the guilt of Mr. Degge and others, as, far from following the common courſe in criminal law, where the firſt queſtion is—do you plead guilty, or not guilty;—he was afraid that Lieutenant Degge might involve himſelf, and diſcover his guilt, and perhaps the guilt of others; and by the ſame principle, though the officers, paſſengers and crew were all proved guilty, he did all he could to prevent their guilt appearing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buckley, Maſter,—and acting Lieutenant. Anſwer. "The firſt appearance of any kind of diſturbance within my knowlege was Mr. Degge's confinement, upon which a general diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction aroſe againſt Captain Landais, and ſome of the men went ſo far as to ſay in my hearing, that they would relieve Mr. Degge."</p>
            <p>By this evidence it was manifeſt, that, though Mr. Degge was verily guilty, for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be under in arreſt, whether with juſtice I ordered him, ſome of the men threatened to mutiny in releaſing him, to which Mr. Buckley, by his ſilence on a matter of that nature, gave his tacit conſent.</p>
            <p>Continuation of Mr. Buckley. A. "Thomas Bailey and James Pratt came to us and aſked our opinion about ſpeaking to Captain Landais, upon altering the courſe of the ſhip, as ſhe then was ſteering weſt half ſout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;—but the people anſwered, that they themſelves would alter her courſe, if we did not, and ſaid that they would do nothing on board whilſt in her preſent courſe, and that they had rather go to York or Halifax than to Philadelphia. (N B) ſince Captain Landai's orders of the ſeventh, he never took any the leaſt command or gave an order on board to my knowlege."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:019056_0019_0FAA0A5C319FFAC0"/>Q. "Did Captain Landais ever object to Mr. Degge's command?"</p>
            <p>A. "Yes, three days after, viz. Aug. 15th, Captain Landais went upon deck, and ordered Mr. Degge to his cabbin."</p>
            <p>By this evidence it is clear that the people went to take the opinion and direction of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the ward-room, and the officers in not acquainting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e inſtantly thereof, proved to be their ſupporters.—Mr Buckley ſays, the people threatened to do this and that, but beſides his keeping it ſecret from me when it happened, he don't name or particulariſe any one to the court who did it, though there is always ſome one in thoſe mutinies which are very diſtinguiſhable. He ſays peremptorily that I gave no orders after the ſeventh (which was my order to keep the courſe to the weſt half ſouth, which not being contradicted by another, was in force and extant, and even confirmed verbally on the 10th, to all the officers when they were in the cabbin though his next anſwer is, that I gave, three days after, order to Mr. Degge to go to his cabbin;—and he don't mention his, and all the ſea and marine officers, refuſing the written orders I ſent to them on the 13th, that prove the falſehood and miſrepreſentation of his evidence, and that I had not reſigned the command.</p>
            <p>COURT. Mr. Elwood, Lieut. of marines. Q. "Pleaſe to relate all you know about the ſtores, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>A. "The wine was a preſent from the paſſengers to the officers in the ward-room, I brought it, being two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſks on board, but Capt. Landais would not ſuffer it to be put below, ſaying that I wanted to carry it to America to make my fortune by it, on which account I was obliged to bottle about two-thirds of it, and the reſt give to the ſeamen."</p>
            <p>This evidence was prevented to be given into the Court Martial, as it would have been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, and would have proved the evidence of Mr. Blodg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t about goods, to be falſe, upon which they framed the ſecond article againſt me, as will appear in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>The Honorable A. Lee ſaid, "Saturday Aug. 5th, Major Pontgibeau, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid to the Marquis de la Fayette, came into my cabbin as I was getting up, and told me that the Captain had ordered the ſails to be taken in.—When I firſt came upon deck Mr. Brown of Charleſton, South-Carolina, ſaid to me, the Captain is going to make a civil war on board, he has ordered the marines under arms."</p>
            <p>This evidence ſhews, how quick the paſſengers were to go to the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as their leader, to tell him I had ordered to ſhorten ſail, in order by all appearance that by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence he might have more ſail ſat againſt my order; but the Honorable A. Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> don't ſay that he ran inſtantly out of the cabbin and did not come back 'till James Pratt and others followed him, and theſe laſt made an open mutiny and got maſters of the ſhip: It may be obſerved alſo, how they were ready to miſrepreſent my proper orders in ſaying I was going to make a civil war, when I ordered the marines to take arms to ſtop the mutiny.</p>
            <p>Mr. Blodget ſaid, "The officers deliberated ſome time before they appointed Mr. Degge to the command, altho' they had received a letter from the paſſengers, adviſing them to appoint ſome one immediately."</p>
            <p>It appears alſo by this evidence, as by the former, that it was the paſſengers who directed the officers as well as the crew to mutiny as they did.</p>
            <p>Parts of the evidences omitted to be written down by the Judge Advocate, but which were taken in writing, during ſaid court, by an Attorney, and another perſon I had there for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, ſaid, "The officers ſaid, if the Captain would ſhew his orders for going to Philadelphia, they would chearfully obey him."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:019056_0020_0FAA0A5A12659C28"/>This evidence is omitted by the Judge Advocate, becauſe it explains poſitively that it was in the power of the officers to obey my orders to go to Philadelphia, had they been willing to do it; but they would not obey me, as I did not ſhow them my orders: Beſides, it implies that I had not abdicated ſaid command, ſince I continued to order to go to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>James Bragg, Carpenter. Q "Did you ever hear the people ſay that they were determined to go to the firſt port in America that they could make?"</p>
            <p>A. "I have heard the people ſay that they expected to be carried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Philadelphia"</p>
            <p>This is omitted, becauſe it is contradictory to Mr. L. Lee's evidence, that I had promiſed the crew to go directly to Boſton. Beſides, it implies that the crew ſubmitted by their expectation to be carried to Philadelphia, had not the paſſengers and officers taken the ſhip from me, and brought her to Boſton.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Pierce, Gunner, ſaid, "The Captain aſked me, what number of caſks of powder I thought in the way? I anſwered, four or five. He ſaid, I might ſtow them as I thought proper. I accordingly did, and informed the people they were not in ſo much danger as they imagined, provided they were not going to Philadelphia, but to Boſton."</p>
            <p>This is omitted, becauſe it proved that the gunner enticed the people againſt the Captain's going to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Lieut. Elwood, of the Marines, ſaid, "On the 10th, one <hi>Pratt</hi> told me, if I delivered the keys of the arm-cheſts up to the Captain, they would take my life."</p>
            <p>This is omitted, becauſe it proved that ſaid <hi>Pratt</hi> was the ringleader, tho' the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had made and given to the Court a dialogue, which he pretended had paſſed between ſaid <hi>Pratt</hi> and myſelf, to exculpate <hi>Pratt.</hi> 2<hi>dly.</hi> Becauſe Lieutenant Elwood was guilty for not acquainting me with the threats of ſaid <hi>Pratt.</hi> 3<hi>dly.</hi> Becauſe Lieutenant Elwood had not ſaid <hi>Pratt</hi> ſecured in irons, as ſoon as arrived in harbour, in order to be brought to trial. And for all theſe, and other reaſons, Lieutenant Elwood was prevented from giving his evidence in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Court Martial.</p>

            <p>This is omitted, becauſe it was not ſupported by the crew's evidence as was expected, which would have proved Mr. Ludwell Lee an impoſtor.</p>
            <p>Sailors of the Bon-homme Richard. Q. "Which of you was it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> applied to the Captain?"</p>
            <p>A. "The man that forced his ſpeech to the Captain is not on board.— N. B. Lieutenant Veazy (one of the members of the court) reminded them not to charge the ringleader, ſaying, you were all one."</p>
            <p>This is omitted, becauſe it would have proved clearly that I had not only the plots of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, paſſengers and crew, but that I had alſo againſt me, even in the Court, numbers that did not ſcruple to ſay openly every thing that might prevent any one of the crew from charging the guilty.</p>
            <p>Q. "Do you know any thing of the courſe of the ſhip being altered at the time of the diſpute of making ſail?"</p>
            <p>A "The courſe was never altered, and we knew of no orders for altering the courſe."</p>
            <p>This was omitted, becauſe it proved the evidence Mr Buckly had given that the people had altered the courſe on the 5th inſt. was falſe. Moreover it proved alſo, that they had no hand in altering the courſe on the 11th, and that it was purely and utterly the paſſengers and officers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without any compulſion of the ſeamen.</p>
            <p>Q "Is there any one among you that Captain Landais promiſed with his own mouth that he would carry you to Boſton?"</p>
            <p>A. "We did not hear Captain Landais with his own mouth ſay ſo, but ſome of the officers told us, that we were to ſail for the firſt port."</p>
            <p>This was omitted by the Judge Advocate; becauſe it would have proved the evidence of Mr. Ludwell Lee to be a falſehood of his own invention; and at the ſame time it would have proved that the officers had made themſelves that promiſe to the crew to diſpoſe them to mutiny, in order to go to Boſton.</p>
            <p>The Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſaid, "Upon the 10th of Auguſt, being in the cabbin, two ſailors came to the door, and mentioned that all the ſeamen were at the door without, and wanted to ſee the Captain, he ſaid, he would not ſpeak to them, but ſaying they wanted to go to Boſton, he ſaid his orders were to go to Philadelphia."</p>
            <p>Though this is miſrepreſented, as Thomas Bailey and another came to my bed-ſide, and ſaid in behalf of the crew (who were under the quarter-deck, whence they could ſee and hear me, James Pratt holding the door wide open) to tell me they wanted to go to Boſton, as being nigh their home, I anſwered, I could not, as Congreſs's order was to carry the frigate into Philadelphia; but even as the Honorable Arthur Lee gave it, it proves enough that I had effectually ſpoken to the two men ſent by the crew in their preſence, and had explained that my orders, which were in conſequence of thoſe of Congreſs, were to carry the frigate into Philadelphia, which imply all I could have ever ſaid to the crew, and that I had neither reſigned or abdicated my command.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thomas Lee ſaid, "Mr. Lynd with Mr. Livingſton waited on Captain Landais, who had retired to his bed, requeſting him to come and pacify the men, but was anſwered, he had already given his orders."</p>
            <p>Though this is miſconſtrued, there is ſomething in it, as I ſaid to Mr. Lynd I had already given my anſwer to two men ſent by and in preſence of the people, (as proved by the latter evidence) and when he aſked my orders, I told him they had them already contained in my written order
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019056_0022_0FAA0A5B76ACA888"/>
of the ſeventh inſtant, as they really had, which was to keep the courſe of the ſhip to the weſt half ſouth.</p>
            <p>Therefore by theſe two laſt evidences it is ſufficiently proved, that I ſpoke and ſaid all I could ſay to the people, and that I confirmed my former orders, in order to go to Philadelphia; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that I had not reſigned the command, but to the contrary that I gave proper anſwer to the people, and continued to give proper orders to the officers.</p>
            <p>Beſides the embittered and falſe evidences given verbally againſt me in court, the paſſengers and officers gave ſome ready wrote, which, as it was manifeſt they were in a plot and mutiny together againſt me, were probably concerted among themſelves to ſupport it, in order to be ſaved from the puniſhment they deſerved, and to ſacrifice me.</p>
            <p>But above all things they gave to the court the following prepared inſidious piece, in order to juſtify their taking the command from me and giving it to Lieutenant Degge, viz.</p>

                  <p n="4">4th. For refuſing to ſtop the ſhip for an hour to catch fiſh, according to the ordinance of Congreſs, although the total want of freſh proviſions made it neceſſary for the whole crew, and the ſurgeon repreſented to him that the ſick were numerous, and in great want of freſh proviſions, and that what he had of any kind to give them in the place of it, was nearly exhauſted.</p>

            <p>The 2d and 3d of theſe articles or charges have been ſo clearly proved falſe, and the 4th for ſtopping to fiſh on the bank of Newfoundland (the next day after the crew got maſters of the ſhip, in order to make all ſail to America) ſo inconſiſtent, that the Court of Enquiry found they could make no charge of them againſt me; the third was likely deſtroyed in the Court Martial. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then remains only the firſt of theſe articles which may be meant in the 3d article made againſt me in the Court Martial; in conſequence thereof, I will defer ſpeaking to it until I vindicate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the articles made in ſaid Court Martial.</p>
            <p>I muſt obſerve that piece of the officers being without date when, or place where it was made, has been received thus by the Court of Enquiry, which would prove their neglect to my prejudice in not aſking where and when made; or the date when, and place where made was omitted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly. But it was either made on board the frigate at ſea, or ſince ſhe arrived in Boſton, which is a very important though different caſe. If made at ſea, all theſe officers were guilty of the 27th article of the regulation for the United States navy; beſides of the falſehood contained in it.—If made ſince the arrival of the frigate, the Court of Enquiry is culpable in conniving at their plots, in receiving ſuch a colluſive piece.</p>
            <p>For was ſuch a piece admiſſible as evidence, it may be forged and ſigned by officers and crew at all times againſt a Captain, who muſt ſuffer tho' never ſo guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>But here follows their undeniable conviction, given alſo by them to the Court of Enquiry.</p>

                  <p>We did again ſend into the cabbin, to deſire to repreſent further to the Captain the increaſing confuſion of the ſhip, and he having refuſed to hear us, pleaded himſelf ſick; and we do now, in the moſt formal manner proteſt againſt the behaviour of the ſaid Captain Landais.</p>

            <p>Although the date of this preceeding piece is omitted, it is immaterial, becauſe it was deviſed, concerted, wrote and ſigned, before they took from me th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> precarious command they had left me, and ſince the crew got maſters of the ſhip on the 5th inſtant.</p>
            <p>By the bye I muſt ſay, that the paſſengers and officers, by their artful foregoing pieces given to the Court of Enquiry, tried to convince them of their ſole good intentions and dutifulneſs towards their country's ſervice, in their endeavoring to perſuade me to come upon deck and ſpeak to the people, and of my obſtinacy in not complying with it; in having prevented the people from alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe, and how they cautioned them of the dangerous conſequence thereof, and that I had abdicated the command.</p>
            <p>But they own that they, the officers, by the advice of a number of gentlemen paſſengers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Mr. Degge to aſſume the command of the frigate, and to make for the firſt port in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and really to prevent the people's mutiny in altering the courſe, of their own accord and paſſengers, without any compulſion of the people—they altered it clandeſtinely themſelves, at ten o'clock, P. M. the wind being fair for Philadelphia, where they could by their number force the people to go, knowing from me that the frigate was ordered by Congreſs to that place.</p>
            <p>As to my having abdicated the command, it was proved falſe, even by the evidence of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that on the 10th I had ſpoken to two of the men, and had told them that my orders were for Philadelphia; which anſwer, though not given in all its extent, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all I could ſay to the people: And by Mr. L. Lee's evidence, that I had already given my orders; which anſwer, though not given alſo in all its extent, comprehended all I could ſay to the officers, as they had my written order of the 7th for the courſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore the evidence given againſt me to the Court, ſo far from amounting to a proof that I had reſigned the command, as they pretended to make appear, is concluſive againſt them, and clearly proves that they had taken it clandeſtinely from me, and given it to Lieutenant Degge, in order to accompliſh their real intention of going to Boſton, as they did: By which they were evidently guilty, as proved alſo by their own inſidious writing, ſigned and acknowledged by them, given in the Court of Enquiry, of aſſembling, plotting and conſpiring againſt me, in defiance of the 27th Article of the Regulations of the American Navy, which is applicable both to officers and paſſengers—which is in theſe words, viz.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Art.</hi> 27<hi>th. Any officer, ſeaman, or marine, who ſhall begin, excite, cauſe, or join in any mutiny or ſedition in the ſhip to which</hi> he belongs, <hi>on any pretence whatſoever, ſhall ſuffer death, or ſuch other puniſhment as a Court Martial ſhall direct.—Any perſon</hi> in <hi>or belonging to the ſhip, who ſhall utter any

The latter had it contained in the evidences given by the paſſengers, officers and crew on the one hand—on the other, they had alſo authentic proofs of the paſſengers, officers and crew's plots and mutinies, contained in ſaid letter and evidences.—Nevertheleſs, the Court of Enquiry, in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the partiality they had practiſed all along in favor of thoſe offenders, and to my utter prejudice, gave the following report:

                     <p>The Court of Enquiry, whereof Daniel Water, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is Preſident, ordered for the purpoſe of enquiring into the conduct of Peter Landais, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> commander of the ſhip Alliance, and of the officers and crew of ſaid ſhip—are of opinion,</p>
                     <p>That for the ſake of juſtice to our country, and to the character of Peter Landais, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Court Martial is neceſſary for the trial of Peter Landais, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> touching his conduct during the late voyage of ſaid ſhip from L'Orient to Boſton, and immediately previous to her ſailing; for giving which opinion the ſaid Court would offer the following reaſons:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1</hi>ſt. The ſaid Peter Landais, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> has denied the juriſdiction of the ſaid Court of Enquiry, inſtituted according to the orders of the Honorable Navy-Board for the eaſtern department, and therefore ought to have the benefit of a Court Martial, whoſe juriſdiction no reaſonable man in his ſtate can doubt.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2</hi>d. If the ſaid Peter Landais, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is innocent, his reputation ought to be cleared of thoſe charges, or at leaſt popular reflections, under which it now labours, namely, a breach of thoſe orders of Dr. Franklin, which, by the expreſs injunctions of ſaid Navy-Board, he was bound to obey; alſo a continued ſeries of ill conduct to the paſſengers, officers, marines and crew of ſaid ſhip, during her ſaid voyage: Which conduct, it is ſaid, endangered ſaid ſhip, and the lives of many valuable members of ſociety; which, if not noticed, might encourage future diſorders, and injure the public ſervice.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid Court cannot but repeat, that if the ſaid Peter Landais, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is innocent as to ſuch charges, his character ought to be rendered fully undoubted by a Court Martial.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3</hi>d. Becauſe the clearance of ſaid Landais may involve the guilt of ſaid crew, or vice verſa.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid Court of Enquiry are of further opinion, that whatever the ſaid Landais's conduct has been, yet another officer, who has oppoſed him in ſaid voyage, viz. Lieutenant James Degge, likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the deciſion of a Court Martial, and upon theſe points, viz. whether ſaid Degge has or has not
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019056_0026_0FAA0A62303990D8"/>
unjuſtifiably revolted from ſaid Landais's authority, and unjuſtifiably diſobeyed ſaid Landais, and uſurped the command of the ſhip.</p>
                     <p>Touching the conduct of the crew of ſaid ſhip, the ſaid Court of Enquiry cannot but obſerve, that there too clearly appears to have been a ſpirit of diſcontent and diſobedience; but when we conſider how many inſtances of chagrine they have ſuffered, how long they have been refuſed their prize-money which they dearly purchaſed in a foreign country, and which they have never yet obtained, and how long they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from their families and connections, we allow the force of human nature, and do not at preſent recommend a Court Martial for the tried of any conduct of ſaid crew.</p>
                     <p>We conceive that a Court Martial, which to an officer is oftentimes conſidered as a benefit, to perſons of a lower order is always viewed as an evil, and we wiſh not to impoſe an evil upon thoſe whoſe errors flow not from their diſpoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, the members of ſaid Court of Enquiry, with all poſſible reſpect, ſubmit the evidence which they have collected in the preceding ſheets, with their ſentiments and deciſion thereon; and have the honor to be,</p>

            </p>
            <p>I muſt make the following remarks upon the foregoing report, that my reaſons given heretofore of the impropriety of a Court of Enquiry taking place, (after I had given official charges againſt the paſſengers, officers and crew) were good.</p>
            <p>The ſecond article was deſtroyed in the Court Martial, except ſailing without Dr. Franklin's orders, which part I will explain and vindicate hereafter.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the third article, if I underſtand it, means plainly, that the court would not clear me, becauſe if they had, the crew muſt be involved in their guilt (which is acknowledged by ſaid court, to be apparent) or vice verſa, that is to ſay, if the crew are cleared, as they were connected together in guilt, they will be alſo connected in giving their evidence to charge Peter Landais, and then partake to make him appear guilty, which appear to have been the motive of the Navy-Board in ordering that Court of Enquiry.</p>
            <p>The court recommends a Court-Martial to judge, whether Lieutenant James Degge has, or has not unjuſtifiably diſobeyed ſaid Peter Landais, and uſurped the command of the ſhip (for which he was broke.) The reaſon why it was not recommended alſo to try the paſſengers and officers, who were evidently more guilty than ſaid Degge, having petitioned, enticed and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced him to break his arreſt, and to uſurp ſaid command, is the ſame as above; that is, becauſe they muſt be ſound guilty, be condemn'd, and their evidence inadmiſſible; but it ſeems the court wanted their colluſive evidence to be given in the Court Martial, in order to have Peter Landais appear guilty and condemned.</p>
            <p>Now I have given a ſimple Idea of the Court of Enquiry's conduct againſt me, and in behalf of the guilty. I muſt continue to exhibit that of others and mine. As on my arrival I had wrote to the Admiralty Board at Philadelphia, an official letter, ſimilar to the one of the 15th Auguſt, to the Navy-Board at Boſton. I wrote again to the Admiralty-Board at Philadelphia, Sept. 13th, 1780, acquainting them with what had happened on board, ſince the 15th ult. and the Navy-Board's conduct towards me, and Lieutenant Degge; and that the Honorable Mr. Warren, ſome days after my firſt viſit to the Navy-Board had told me there was a Court of Enquiry to be held; but as I knew of no ſuch court being mentioned in the Honorable Congreſs's reſolves about ſea
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019056_0027_0FAA0A634F7ED3D0"/>
regulations, I inſiſted according to it, to have three Captains of men of war at leaſt to ſit there, or elſe I would not ſay a word; that I conceived a Court of Enquiry might be proper on diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent occaſions; but when there were capital charges laid againſt ſeveral perſons, as were in my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Navy-Board at Boſton, I thought it required a Court Martial immediately, but it was not ſo. Accordingly I ſaid nothing all the time it ſat; but if all the evidence had been fully and fairly noted, as it came from the mouths of the witneſſes, it would ſufficiently have brought the truth to light, and with the addition of a few pertinent queſtions, have diſcovered the guilty. I begged their Honors would order a Court Martial, in which I pledged myſelf to prove I deſerved the confidence they had placed in me from the beginning to the laſt.</p>
            <p>I repreſented, that in all courts martial held in the old countries, an officer is always tried by his peers; urging, that there is little probability of that Captain's being acquitted, who is to be tried by three Captains not in command, and whoſe intereſt it muſt be to have him diſplaced, the probable conſequence of which is that the command of the ſhip would devolve on one or other of them.</p>
            <p>I told them, that in the report of ſaid Court, they would find that they tried to diſcharge the crew; and indeed if the ringleader had been ſtopped and examined, I believe he would have declared the plot; but it was prevented:—And if the lawful ſupport was refuſed to the Captains of the Navy, all diſcipline muſt be ſubverted.—I begged and claimed ſeveral ſums of money owing to me by the United States, and that I was confident they would fulfil my juſt requeſt, that I remained on board the frigate Alliance until I ſhould be taken out of her by force or Court Martial and paid, as I had nothing on ſhore to live upon.</p>
            <p>I wrote the following to the Navy-Board:</p>

            <p>Since the Court of Enquiry had finiſhed, every method had been practiſed to compel me to go out of the ſhip, that if I had left her, they might have ſaid I quitted her of my own accord, and they would have never ordered a Court Martial. In that view the mizen-maſt was unſhip'd, and its apertures left wide open, to give an entry into the cabbin where I kept. I was warned by one of the men, to take care, for my life was threatened.—One evening, about 11 o'clock, P. M. when
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019056_0028_0FAA0A63AEAA4A00"/>
going on board, I was attacked by two of the Bon homme Richard's men, who began by threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were coming at me; but perceiving that I put my hand on my ſword, they deſiſted from their attempt.—A few days after, at noon, when paſſing on the quarter-deck, going on ſhore, I ſaw Mr Buckley, Lynd, Capt. Parks, Lieut. Elwood, and other officers, ſtanding on the ſtarboard ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> intended againſt my life. I was not above ten feet from the ſhip's ſide on the wharf, when a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> plank, thrown out of the main-top at me, fell within three feet of my right foot. I did not ſo much as turn my head to ſee who had thrown it, but continued to walk; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after a brick was thrown likewiſe at me, which fell ſo nigh that it made the gravel, raiſed from the ground where it ſtruck, fly on my back; I ſuddenly turned to ſee whence it came, the officers then turned their backs all at once, that they might ſay they knew not who did it.— I looked up to the main-top, where I ſaw ſome of the ſailors heads, who hid themſelves directly. I went to the Navy-Board, to acquaint them with what had happened, and repreſented the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having at leaſt a centry on the gang way, to prevent ſuch doings, which the officers appeared to encourage. Their anſwer was, that they had no ſoldiers to diſpoſe of.—In the Afternoon Mr. Vernon told me he had enquired about the matter, and Mr. Buckley had told him it was no thing but a top-maſt clit had fallen nigh me, and the brick was thrown by a journeyman of Salem, who wrought on board, but whoſe name was unknown. Thus were palliated all tranſgreſſions done againſt me.—Some days after I was at the Navy-Board, when Captain Barry and Captain Hacker, juſt arriving from Philadelphia, delivered a letter to the Honorable J. Warren, who, after reading it, told me, in their preſence, the former was appointed Captain of the Alliance, and the latter to go in her as ſecond Captain. I anſwered, Capt. Barry might take that command when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſed, and even poſſeſſion of the cabbin and ſtate-room where my bed was, which was alſo at his ſervice; and that I would lay in the other ſtate-room until I was tried and paid.— Captain Barry replied, he had a bed of his own.</p>
            <p>On the 22d of September Mr. Parks, Captain of Marines, came into the cabbin, and ſaid he had an order in writing from the Navy-Board to deliver me, which he laid on the table, and added, it was to order me immediately out of the ſhip. As I did not believe the Navy-Board would have acquitted him without being tried, being charged by me, nor give him an order to bring to me, having others by whom they might more properly have tranſmitted their orders, I did not look at the paper, thinking if I had, it would have been interpreted as my acknowledgment of his being clear of the charges I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d laid againſt him.</p>
            <p>The next day he came again to read ſome orders, he ſaid, to which I would not hearken, telling him, he could not be in activity, being accuſed by me in my letter to the Admiralty and Navy Board at Boſton. He threatened he would bring armed ſoldiers to force me out of the ſhip. I replied, if he did, being charged by me, I ſhould look upon it as an attempt to aſſaſſinate me, and in my defence would ſhoot him.</p>
            <p>I begged as a favor that one of the two new Lieutenants of the Alliance, which were preſent, would go and tell the N. B. to ſend a proper officer to declare or bring me their order, and I would ſurrender myſelf to him to do what they pleaſed with me.—Accordingly came a corporal with two ſoldiers, the former told me he had orders to carry me immediately to the Navy Board; I followed them, but when out of the ſhip, the corporal told me to go thither alone.</p>
            <p>Being there, I told the gentlemen thereof, I was come to them by the direction of the Corporal they had ſent to me, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> again, that I had wrote to the Admiralty-Board, and had claimed to be paid the ſums of money which were owing to me by the United States, but had yet no anſwer,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019056_0029_0FAA0A6722E32318"/>
and having no money left of the ſum I brought from France, as I had ſpent it all, either to have a copy written of the evidence given in the court, or buying a copy of that which the Judge Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate had wrote down, &amp;c. Moreover, that knowing no-body who kept lodgers—the night coming on, I requeſted they would let me paſs the night in the Navy-Board, even in the entry thereof. Mr. Warren went out, and (though a few days before they had told me they had no ſoldiers to diſpoſe of, when my life was attempted by the people of the ſhip) ſoon returned with an officer and two ſoldiers, whom he ordered to force me out of doors.—Reduced to deſpair by ſuch inſolent treatment, I entreated the ſoldiers to run their bayonets through me, that it might put an end to all the injuſtice I underwent; inſtead of that the two ſoldiers took hold of me to puſh me out, I told them to deſiſt, but being encouraged by Meſſrs. Warren and Vernon, they perſiſted, till they had exhauſted their ſtrength in vain, and at laſt gave up their attempt;—as ſoon as they had left me I went out, full of indignation at the Navy-Board gentlemen's baſe conduct, who did all this to provoke me to ſome exceſs, in order to make new charges againſt me.</p>
            <p>Though the officers which were charged by me, kept on board the ſhip until the Court Martial was held, I ſuppoſe to agree upon the evidence they would give, I was turned out of the ſhip, and afterwards in the ſtreet, without money, not knowing where to go, expoſed to be met in the night by ſome gang of the Alliance's crew, incited againſt my life, or to find them in the houſe where I might apply for lodging, without having even a cane to defend myſelf.—I roved thus from one houſe to another, not finding any ſhelter, till half an hour paſt ten o'clock, in the evening, when I found a negro man, who carried me to an old lady, who received me with much ado, not knowing who I was.</p>
            <p>The next morning after, my ſteward came and told me, that as ſoon as I was out of the ſhip, he went on board and found the officers in the cabbin, and a great deal of the proviſions and ſtores which were there, had been plundered and carried away, and two of my trunks were broke open. —I ſent him to fetch my trunks, where I found many things had been ſtolen out of the two which were broke open. I found alſo in one of them eleven old table cloths and twenty-five towels, which had been kept there ſince they were ſent to me before I ſailed, (having the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de la Fayette paſſenger) belonging to the ſhip. Having no pen or ink. I immediately ſent the ſteward to acquaint the Navy-Board that thoſe things, having always been kept in my trunks, were brought to my lodging in one of them, and to acquaint them at the ſame time, that the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin ſtores and proviſions were plundered, and that I would deliver the old linen as ſoon as a full diſcharge, either from the Navy-Board, or Captain Barry for the things left in the cabbin, ſhould be tranſmitted to me; but neither the Navy-Board nor Captain Barry would give me ſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, though it was one or the other fault for not ſending ſome-body to take care of thoſe ſtores and proviſions in the cabbin when I was forced out of the ſhip.</p>
            <p>I have been very particular in enumerating all that paſſed between the Navy Board and me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Meſſrs. Warren and Vernon not yet fully ſatisfied with all the conduct to my prejudice they had kept ſince my arrival at Boſton; being convinced, I ſuppoſe, I ſhould in a fair Court-Martial eaſily clear myſelf of the charges made againſt me in the Court of Enquity; and point out palpable charges of the greateſt magnitude, already known and proved againſt the paſſengers, officers and crew, in order to prepoſſeſs as much againſt me as they poſſible could, ſaid Navy-Board malignantly and baſely miſrepreſented what I had done by compoſing the following charges:</p>

               </gap> impoſſible it was for me to defend and juſtify my character, when ſuch falſe, miſrepreſented and amplified charges were made by ſuch enemies, inveſted with all the power, and judged by others who had no more delicacy, and had alſo ſelf-intereſt to deſtroy it. I ſay falſe, becauſe I never refuſed to deliver ſaid Alliance—quite the contrary. I ſaid, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Navy-Board, Captain Barry and Captain Hacker, that Captain Barry might take ſaid command whenever he pleaſed, and never ſaid a word to the contrary.—I did not refuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the cabbin ſtores, conſiſting of old table-linen, and white paper—quite the contrary; I offered to deliver it inſtantly, if they or Captain Barry would give me a full diſcharge for the ſtores and proviſions I had left on board, which was but juſt and requiſite.</p>
            <p>I ſay miſrepreſented and amplified, becauſe I never refuſed to receive letters or orders ſent me from the Navy-Board by proper perſons; but twice only I refuſed to liſten to Captain Parks, when he ſaid he had orders from them to tranſmit to me, becauſe I could not believe they would uſe ſo improper a method (he being charged by me and not tried) to ſend me their orders; which was the reaſon I did not receive their orders to quit the ſhip. When the Corporal came to tell me to go to the Navy Board, I did it directly; and my wanting to paſs the night in the Navy-Board office or entry, was owing to the diſtreſs. I was reduced to, not knowing where to go, expoſed in the night to the fury of a gang of ſeamen, who had already attempted my life; and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, of which I had before acquainted the Admiralty; which condition they might have changed with juſtice, in giving me ſome of the money due to me by the United States.</p>
            <p>I ſay malignantly and baſely, in accuſing me of robbing ſaid ſhip, in withholding ſundry arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles belonging to the cabbin; which ſaid old linen and white paper were unknowingly brought to me in one of my trunks.

            </p>
            <p>There were therefore four out of the ſeven members ſetting in the Court Martial, who had the greateſt intereſt to have me broken, as they were to ſail in the Alliance, if they could make me appear guilty; but who muſt be without employ, had I been acquitted and reſtored to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Alliance, as juſtice required.</p>
            <p>Beſides all the ſeven members of ſaid Court Martial had ſigned with all the other officers in the American navy, a petition ſent to the Admiralty againſt my commanding the Alliance before I ſailed in the Alliance January 6th 1779, by which they proved their jealouſy and prejudice againſt me.</p>
            <p>I had much reaſon to complain againſt the Judge Advocate's conduct, during the Court of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, but to whom? No-body would liſten to my juſt grievances, it would have availed me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>I therefore ſaid nothing on theſe important points; but being ſenſible, on one hand, of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage I muſt undergo being tried by ſuch court, compoſed of men declared thus againſt me out of natural prejudice, and who had ſelf-intereſt to deſtroy me, in having me condemned; and, on the other, if I objected againſt it, that another ſet of officers or Court Martial would be refuſed to me; and my challenging theſe officers might have been miſrepreſented by my enemies, as a proof that I was guilty; beſides, I muſt have remained without judgment, under the diſgraceful report of the Court of Enquiry: Therefore I was obliged to ſubmit with thoſe diſadvantages, and told them, that I could have challenged every one of the members ſitting, becauſe they had ſhewn their prejudice againſt me better than two years before, ſending a petition to Philadelphia againſt my commanding the frigate Alliance, which they had all ſigned but Captain Barry (as he had told me of it in the time.) Captain Nicholſon replied, that Captain Barry had ſigned ſaid petition one of the firſt: However I continued, and ſaid, I could have challenged Captain Barry, Captain Hacker, and two Lieutenants, out of the ſeven officers ſitting, as they were to ſhip in the Alliance, were I condemned; but that I was ſo clear in my own conſcience, of any charge whatever made againſt me, and ſo confident in the honor and equity of the officers ſitting, that I ſubmitted to their juſtice. I ſoon perceived that I had miſplaced my confidence.</p>
            <p>During the Court-Martial when there was no byſtanders, very often Captain Barry had words with the Judge Advocate, being ſure of the members prejudice againſt me, ſaying he altered, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or amplified the evidences as he pleaſed; all which I ſuppoſe was done to incenſe and make me interfere in it, which, had I done it, they would have readily impeach'd me with diſreſpect to the Court Martial, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>During ſix weeks the court laſted, Capt. Barry ſeveral times in the morning when the members were aſſembled, told me diſobliging things, to put me out of temper, and had the court opened on a ſudden, with a deſign, I ſuppoſe, that I might anſwer him ſome words in the ſame way, of which he would have took advantage. With the ſame intention he ſeveral times recommended to the court to keep the oath they had given, as if it had been a ſecret; but I was confident, it was either a ſnare laid to make me enquire what that oath could be, or it was really a ſecret reſolution againſt me tranſmitted to him before hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:019056_0032_0FAA0A68F3359A98"/>When I croſs-queſtioned Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, about the chaſe which he had given in the Alliance to a 32 gun frigate, I made him own that I having ordered him to have the driver ſat, he anſwered me, that <hi>he knew not how to rig it,</hi> upon which I called a quarter-maſter to have it done before him, that he might learn how to do it. As they had made a great ſtreſs againſt me for my ordering a quarter-maſter to ſhow an acting Lieutenant how to rig a ſail without explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why—the Court of Enquiry, having no ſolid foundation where to build had made an article thereupon, wherein I was impeached of ill uſage to the officers.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Lynd, by owning his ignorance, or unwillingneſs to obey me, juſtified my reproof thereon, and deſtroyed that part of the Court of Enquiry's report: Upon which Capt. Barry ſaid, I ſhould not croſs-queſtion thus, and moved to the court to oblige me to give them in writing the croſs-queſtions I would put to the evidence, and they would do it themſelves. I repreſented that I had an undeniable right to croſs-queſtion the evidences againſt me in ſuch manner as I thought beſt, to draw the truth from them; Captain Barry then enjoined the evidences to anſwer only yes, or no, by which it was impoſſible to draw any thing from them.</p>
            <p>I begged of the Court Martial, that they would aſk from, and have tranſmitted to them my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial letter to the Navy Board, dated Auguſt 15th, 1780; but the Navy Board denied having ſuch a letter, thinking I had nothing to prove they had it, but their receipt which was not ſigned; but after three whole weeks denial, I exhibited a letter from the Navy Board, directing me to deliver ſaid letter to Mr. Larcher, and the receipt for that letter from Mr. Larcher; at laſt it came into the court, but they took no notice of it, as it was too obvious, ſtrong and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit againſt the officers, paſſengers and crew to be confuted. I will repeat hereafter ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of it.</p>
            <p>I begged alſo, that the court would be pleaſed to order Lieutenant Elwood to come and give his evidence, but I could never obtain it, becauſe it would have proved a-new my ſtrictneſs againſt allowing any body to have any private goods on board, and that the officers kept from me the plots and threats they knew of the mutineers, but the court's intention was not to ſummon him to come, as his evidence given in the Court of Enquiry would have prevented two articles which the Court Martial made againſt me.</p>
            <p>When the court had received all the evidences they thought fit againſt me, I applied to them for a warrant to oblige Stephen Wates, Captains ſteward, to come and give his evidence, as the ſaid Stephen Wates had given me in writing that Lieutenant Livingſton, one of the paſſengers, had given to James Pratt, (the ringleader who had carried on the firſt mutiny on board) ſix guineas, and a ſuit of new cloaths, and had told me moreover, that the other paſſengers had given to ſaid James Pratt ſome money alſo; and that whenever he ſhould be ordered, he would give his evidence more extenſively thereon, and on other ſimilar material points.</p>
            <p>The Judge Advocate went himſelf to Salem, in ſearch of Stephen Wates, in order to ſpeak to him, though I objected as much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> I could againſt his going; but I ſent word to Stephen Wates by Mr. Vary, (the Salem Stage's owner) to come to the court next Monday following, to give his evidence. Mr. Vary having delivered his errand to Stephen Wates before the Judge Advocate had found him, told me after, that Stephen Wates had told him, he would come and tell the truth, for which the officers of the Alliance muſt ſuffer. But after the Judge Advocate had found and had ſpoke to Stephen Wates, the caſe was quite altered when he gave his evidence in the court; for be ſaid that the ſix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uineas and ſait of new cloaths, which Lieutenant Livingſton had given to James Pratt, were given as a reward to the latter, for landing the former's t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:019056_0033_0FAA0A69B25EF948"/>That witneſſes being thus tampered with, and evidence of the adverſaries perverted, ſuppreſſed and miſrepreſented to their advantage, it is eaſy to conceive what muſt be my ſtate.</p>
            <p>Having had no copy of the evidences given to the court during ſeven weeks againſt me, it being impoſſible for me to recollect all that had been ſaid, I made the following requeſt, viz.</p>

            <p>But the court would neither order a copy of the evidence, nor of the new charges given in it, to be given me to make my defence by. I was therefore compelled to truſt to my memory for what I recollected, and to Providence for the reſt.</p>
            <p>I began my defence by demonſtrating obviouſly that the evidences of the paſſengers and officers given againſt me were inadmiſſible. As it was conſpicuous they were proved guilty by their own inſidious inſtruments produced by them in the Court of Enquiry, which condemned them without tryal, one ſigned by the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and all the other paſſengers, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the officers to name one to take the command of the Alliance from me, though <hi>there was then extant a written order from me,</hi> which the officers aſſented to; by another they ſigned alſo, which was given likewiſe in ſaid court; and in connection of their common guilt, they gave the command to Lieutenant Degge, by which they broke his arreſt, <hi>broke the ſaid extant written order for the courſe to be kept weſt half ſouth for Philadelphia; according to the order of Congreſs;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that came to Boſton; and their pretenſions, as an excuſe of my having reſigned the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, proved falſe by my ſaid written order, as one of their own evidences had acknowledged that I had told them that I had given my orders, and by the other written orders I ſent them after, which they refuſed to receive on the 13th Auguſt, it was coroborated that I never ſhowed the leaſt inclination to reſign my command; and what proves it more ſtill, is their taking it from me clandeſtinely in the night; therefore being proved thus connectedly guilty againſt my orders, commands, and conſequently againſt me, their evidence could be look'd upon but as a ſeries of their connected guilt againſt me, conſequently could have no force, credit or validity againſt me; moreover their evidence againſt me muſt be conſidered as an expedient to palliate their crime, in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019056_0034_0FAA0A6A6F3E7B80"/>
charging me, and ſatiate their animoſity in having me condemned, by which means my evidence could not be turned againſt them.</p>
            <p>I exhibited my letters to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> previous to my reſuming the command on board the Alliance at l'Orient, and thoſe I wrote to him after, and his receipts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, the letter from the officers of the Alliance to entreat me to reſume my command on board of her, and the opinion in writing of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and of commodore Gillon of my right and duty to reſume it.</p>
            <p>I declared that the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> wanted me to have his poſt chaiſe brought in the ſhip, that being not practicable, the ſhip being too full when I reſumed my command; I told him to ſell it, and with the amount to purchaſe ſome ſilks, ſtuffs, or even a box of tea, that I thought Congreſs would not diſapprove it, but that he refuſed my offer; that there were brought on board the ſhip, three ſmall boxes, belonging to the French Miniſter at Philadelphia, whereof I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Admiralty there, and the Navy Board at Boſton as ſoon as arrived.</p>
            <p>I proteſted I never gave any permiſſion to Mr. Blodget to bring any goods in the Alliance, and that might be verified by the Maſter's book.</p>
            <p>I exhibited the letter of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to me, on the exigency of ſailing for America, and enumerated the concurring reaſons for it, and dangers the frigate underwent, which made it neceſſary, beſides Congreſs's order for her immediate return to Philadelphia, of which I had a copy; all reaſons which juſtified my ſailing in her from L'Orient, having had no order to the contrary from Dr. Franklin, though I had adviſed him of my intention to fulfil Congreſs's order, of which I had received a copy; but he would neither give me any to ſtay or to ſail, which implied his tacit approbation to ſail.</p>
            <p>I gave the reaſons why Captain Parks was put under arreſt, and that he was releaſed therefrom as ſoon as he aſſented to do his duty. I gave alſo the reaſons why Lieutenant Degge was ordered and kept under arreſt, till he broke them to uſurp the command from me.</p>
            <p>I related how the peeviſhneſs and bad humour of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (and of other paſſengers and officers by his example) began a few days after we ſailed from Europe, and progreſſively augmented diſputing with me, on account of all the victuals brought upon the table, even with the courſe and police of the ſhip, and after his quibblings and inſulting words to me at table. How he enticed me not to give chaſe to the ſails we met with, but even to avoid them— How the crew became more and more undutiful, the cauſe of which I could not prevent, nor even know, as the officers kept from me all the licentiouſneſs of the crew, which they heard, and which they have given in as their evidences to the Court of Enquiry. I ſubmitted the courſe I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be kept, to the Court's judgment, giving them the reaſons why I kept it thus, and proved I had always ordered proper ſail to be made. I related how I was not obeyed nor ſeconded by the officers in making ſail, when we chaſed a 32 gun frigate, and ſome days after a brig.</p>
            <p>I produced the certificate of the Carpenter, how the ſail was ſhortened on the 6th of Auguſt, 1780, in order to fix a lightning-rod to the main-top-royal-maſt head, when ſome of the crew aſſembled, and wanted to ſpeak to me; that I ſent them word to come five at a time in the cabbin to do it; that James Pratt, who headed about 30 of them, ſaid he would not, but they would ſpeak to me all at once on the quarter-deck; and ſaid to the other, let us go and make ſail;— that one of the foretop-men repeated the ſame words, and accordingly they went forward;—that I told my Clerk to take with him pen, ink, and paper, and the Regulation for the American Navy, and follow me on the quarter-deck, where I found the paſſengers already aſſembled together, and ſaw part of the crew forward in an open mutiny, making ſail; that the firſt word I uttered was to Mr. Elwood, Lieutenant of Marines on watch, whom I ordered to have all the marines inſtantly
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019056_0035_0FAA0CF638FC2668"/>
under arms; that he would nor do it; that there being but Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, upon watch, I ſent orders to Captain Parks and all the other officers to come upon deck; that word was brought me, that they were ſhaving, &amp;c. and they came not till long time after; that James Pratt, who commanded and directed the others how to ſet the ſails, came from the gang-way upon the quarter-deck, followed by a number of ſeamen; that I ſpoke to them in the beſt manner I could to impreſs them with a ſenſe of duty; that I told my Clerk to read to them the Regulations for the Navy; James Pratt's anſwers, and his threats to chooſe another Captain; that I ordered my Clerk to take down what he ſaid, and his unwillingneſs to do it; how ſaid Pratt went again with the other ſeamen to make more ſail, &amp;c. that Captain Parks being come at laſt, I ordered him to have all the marines under arms, and if any refuſed, to call them by their names, and if they would not obey, to write their diſobedience on the liſt before their names;—how at firſt he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to elude my order and never performed it, and that he promiſed me a copy of the marines refuſal to obey; that I went myſelf to Mr. Lynd forward, in order to lower the fore topſail; how, in fine, after I had given all poſſible and proper orders to have the mutiny ſtopped, ſeeing I was ſeconded by nobody; having heard Mr. Lynd ſay, "<hi>What can a man do againſt</hi> 300 <hi>that are of the ſame mind?</hi>"—Mr. Buckly ſay, "<hi>What, in the name of God, can a man do againſt three hundred?</hi>" which were hints that I was alone againſt all on board, which were of the ſame mind:—Not obey'd by officers of marines, as I could do no more, the crew being maſters of the ſhip, and I could not take it alone myſelf from them, I went down.</p>
            <p>I related, that when I went to obſerve the ſun at meridian, I ſaw Lieutenant Livingſton and James Pratt walking together on the ſtarboard ſide of the quarter-deck, but perceiving me, they parted; how the ſame afternoon Mr. Buckly and others came to tell me the courſe was altered, though it had not been, and they aſked my orders.</p>
            <p>How the next day after the mutiny for making more ſail, having ſoundings, I ordered Mr. Buckly to fill again; but inſtead of that I found him fiſhing, and was compelled myſelf to put the helm a-weather.</p>
            <p>I ſhowed the certificate of Mr. Pool, of the 6th of Auguſt, how I had ſent him to aſk Captain Parks to ſend me a copy, certified by him, of the liſt of the marines as they were called to take arms the day before, with their refuſal before their name, which Captain Parks refuſed to give, ſaying, he was not my clerk.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe ſhowed my letter and order to him of the ſame day, and on the ſame topic, by which I upbraided and charged him of having not done his utmoſt on the preceding day, to have the marines under arms, as I had ordered him, in order to ſtop the mutiny; and I finiſhed it by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him to have ſaid liſt made, an exact copy of the one they were called by, and their refuſal to obey wrote before their name, and thoſe who were centry then mentioned, and that it ſhould be ſigned by him and delivered to me:—Which order I ſent him by Mr. Warren, Lieutenant of Marines, whoſe receipt I produced.</p>
            <p>I exhibited my written orders, given on the 7th Auguſt 1780 to Meſſrs. Buckley, Lynd and Larcher, to have the courſe ſteered weſt half ſouth, until I ſhould order to alter it, which was the due courſe to the entry of the Delaware, and which order was extant and in force when the ſhip was taken from me. I related, that on the eleventh inſtant, being taken ſuddenly ſick at table, I aroſe in order to go to bed, that a paſſenger at the ſame time in a hurry, (though dinner was not ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>) went out of the cabbin; that ſoon after James Pratt paſſed without being oppoſed by the centry at the cabbin door, and without leave opened and held the cabbin door ſo, whilſt James Baily and another came towards my bed, and ſaid, they came in the crew's, name, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the quarter-deck, to aſk me to go to Boſton; that I anſwered I could not comply with their
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:019056_0036_0FAA0CF8014E03D0"/>
deſire, Congreſs having ordered the frigate's return to Philadelphia, that they went back, I ſaw about 30 of them under the deck,—that James Pratt ſaid, he would go to Boſton, and the top man before mentioned repeated the ſame.—That Mr. Buckley firſt came to incite me to break Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes order—that he was not gone long before he came back with the officers to bring me their opinion to the ſame intent and purpoſe, and they would obey me chearfully in going to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia if I would ſhow them my order; afterwards they told me to go on the quarter-de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck and ſpeak to the people, though I told them I was ſick and had told the people I could not break Congreſs's order, and could ſay no more; that Mr. Lynd aſked my orders, and I anſwered, they had them already in writing, which was to keep the courſe weſt half ſouth—which courſe he ſaid would not be altered during his being on deck.</p>
            <p>That afterwards all was quiet, and by all what I had ſeen and heard, I was confident to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that the people would never alter the courſe, had the officers been averſe to it, but I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected both paſſengers and officer had ſelf-intereſt to prevent the ſhip's going to Philadelphia, for fear the firſt mutiny would be ſearched thorougly into there, where they were in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſtrangers more than in Boſton; ſo that in fact, without any compulſion of the crew, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and paſſengers of their own accord having aſſembled, concerted and collectively agreed to take the command from me; and they had, at ten o'clock in the night, without any noiſe, clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely altered the courſe, and made it for Boſton; all which proved obviouſly at the ſame time my willingneſs to keep the command, and the preconcerted wilful mutiny of the paſſengers and officer and their plot to take ſaid command from me. That as ſoon as I perceived it I crawled as well as I could upon deck, found Mr. Buckly quiet in mind aſleep, lying upon a quarter-deck gun; that I called to him, and being awoke by the quarter maſter, told him to mind the courſe was altered, he anſwered very well, I told him he ſhould anſwer for it; that ſeeing plainly it was done by the officers and paſſengers, I judged it was impoſſible to recal them to any ſenſe of honor to which they were loſt and, not being able to have evident proofs how this affair was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted until next day, and ſuffering a rheumatic pain all over the body I went down.—Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſent for the log-book, which was refuſed, I could not obtain it until late in the evening, when I ſaw it I found the mutiny had heen carried on as I had foreſeen, by the paſſengers and officers connected together, who had choſen Lieutenant Degge to command the ſhip: that it was impoſſible for me to do any thing againſt paſſengers, officers and the crew, which latter were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the former; that I ſent an order to Lieutenant Degge to keep under arreſt—then I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced alſo the order of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>3th inſtant, to the three acting Lieutenants, and the order to the Captain and two Lieutenants of marines, which they all refuſed to receive.—That being ſick—ſtill no-body that would obey my orders, I kept below, as it would have been uſeleſs for me to offer to do any thing againſt every one on board, had I been well.—That on the 16th, being better, I got up and ſaw one of the ſhip's boats out, with James Pratt in her, who went and brought on board a fiſhing boat, I went upon the quarter-deck, where ſeeing Lieutenant Degge, I ordered him again under arreſt, but he would not go. I went down to ſeal my official letter to the Navy-Board of Boſton, but coming up again the fiſhing boat was off, and her people refuſed to take my letter, that ſome time after, hearing a noiſe, I looked out of one of the ports, ſaw the breakers in the winds eye by the larboard bow, went up and ordered the helm a-weather, when Lieutenant Degge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, ordered the people to obey no-body but himſelf, threatened me when on ſhore, and all the paſſengers joined with him, (in particular a French one) till I went down; that being at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in Nantaſket-Road, the barge went to Boſton with the paſſengers and officers, without my knowledge, and that I could not have my letter tranſmitted to the Navy-Board until the 18th; and I told the court, that there was even in the evidence given by men, who were connected in
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019056_0037_0FAA0CF8A4859C00"/>
the concerted plot againſt me proof enough that I had done all I could poſſibly do for the good of the ſervice; but my orders being prevented taking place by their general oppoſition, diſobedience and mutiny, I had detected them and told them all I knew about it, either in writing or verbally.</p>
            <p>As to the charges made againſt me by the Honorable Navy Board, eaſtern department, at Boſton, I ſaid that Captain Barry, who ſat then preſident in the court, knew that I had never oppoſed his commanding the Alliance, nor interfered with it by words or facts whatever; that he knew alſo, that the old table linen, which had been brought to me at my lodging in one of the trunks, I had offered to deliver him as ſoon as he, or the Navy Board would give me a general diſcharge for the ſtores and proviſions that were in the cabbin when I was ordered out of her; that I never refuſed to receive and ſubmit to their orders when conſiſtent with equity, reaſon and the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the navy; that it was proved I had received and ſubmitted to their ſuſpenſion, and had delivered ſome wine and other articles to Captain Baſs by their verbal order only, and had left the ſhip as ſoon as they had ſent me their verbal order by a proper channel—but that I had I been unwilling to ſpeak in the Court of Enquiry, it being inconſiſtent with reaſon and the regulation of the Navy, as there were real charges againſt the paſſengers, officers and crew contained in my official letter to the Navy-Board at Boſton, dated Auguſt 15, 1780; that I had refuſed their orders by Captain Parks, as he was charged by me and not try'd, conſequently not acquitted, and of courſe not till then in a capacity to act, that I earneſtly deſired paſſing a night in the Navy-Board entry, not knowing where to go, and being expoſed to the fury of a crew exaſperated againſt me, which they knew had attempted my life already, and that it was as iniquitous, cruel and diſgraceful in them, as humiliating for me, when I had no money, (though ſo much due to me by the United States) to be forced in the ſtreets in a country where I had no ſecurity for my life, nor credit, without affording me any means to be lodged and have ſubſiſtance (as ought to have been done, and the coſt thereof deducted out of the money owing to me) until I was tried.</p>
            <p>The Court roſe and parted, without being willing to ſtay till the Judge Advocate had verified ſeveral orders and other papers contained in part of my defence, or rather the confeſſion I had given the Court in writing, and I had others which I had only mentioned in the Court, that I wanted alſo to be verified by him; but being <hi>dinner-time, he ſaid he could not ſtay, ſo it ended there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not being able to learn in Boſton the judgment of the Court Martial concerning my trial, I wrote to the Admiralty, and begged from them to let me know my fate, but had no anſwer: I determined to go myſelf in May, in order to know it.—Being there, I applied to the Admiralty Board; they ſaid they could tell me nothing about it. I applied to the Secretary of Congreſs, and had it, of which this is a copy, viz.</p>

            <p>Having been condemned by the above ſentence, following four ſpecious articles, made by an unanimous Court-Martial, there remains to prove, by reſuming the reaſons given in my defence, and the parts of the evidences which juſtify my conduct, and deſtroy thoſe articles; that the ſaid Court was either wilfully unjuſt, or incapable in their judgments: And that I was clear and innocent of the charges contained in the articles preceding ſaid ſentence. I am not bound to prove negatives; but by all that I will gather from the circumſtances, and of the evidences given, I will prove the falſity of them.</p>
            <p>With regard to the firſt article,</p>
            <p>When I reſumed my command on board the Alliance frigate, in the road of Penmaneck, at L'Orient, on the 13th June, 1780, according to her officers and crew's requeſt, and the opinion of Commodore Gilion and the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of my duty and right thereon—The frigate was ready loaded, having her hold full, beſides 67 boxes of muſkets between decks. The crew was employed at that time to bend her three topſails to the yards; and Captain Jones had told the officers that very day, he was going to America as ſoon as the ſhip could be ready to ſail; which implied he had Doctor Franklin's orders ſo to do. By the letter of John Brown, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Secretary of the Admiralty, to me, I was acquainted with Congreſs's orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the Alliance's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate return to Philadelphia. In order to accompliſh which I wrote, June 15th and 16th, to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:019056_0039_0FAA0CFA023C6B10"/>
his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (which are in the firſt part of this memorial) that I had reſumed my command, would make all poſſible expedition to have the Alliance ready to ſail for America according to Congreſs's order (which I imparted to him) and aſked his in conſequence; by which conduct it is proved that though he had previouſly uſed me with manifeſt injuſtice, I did not forget my duty to him and the ſervice; but he would give me no other anſwer but <hi>leave the ſhip immediately,</hi> which was no order, but a continuation of his abuſe of power, and of courſe tyranny towards me.</p>
            <p>As he had given me no order ſince I had reſumed my command, I could not diſobey them; for where there is no order there can be no diſobedience; but to the contrary, as he had probably given orders to Captain Jones to ſail in the Alliance for America as ſoon as ready; as I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the order of Congreſs for the Alliance's immediate return to Philadelphia, and my willingneſs to fulfil them being coincident together, his ſilence, and no order to the contrary was his tacit conſent, that I ſhould ſail according to Congreſs's order, as it is an axiom incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible in that caſe, that my ſailing according to Congreſs's order not being prohibited, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Therefore if any one was guilty for my ſailing without order from France, as his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency B. Franklin could have his orders tranſmitted to me in five days time, and that I waited for them from the 14th June till the 8th of July, it was his Excellency's fault, as he would give me none, being exaſperated that in vain he had done all he was capable of to take me out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in order to place Captain Jones, knowing that had he given me any order conſiſtent with the ſervice, it would have juſtified my having reſumed the command and put me in a ſtation and ſituation, whence I might have ſhewed his previous abuſe of power towards me.</p>
            <p>But in this caſe would not any equitable court have judged, being deprived of his Excellency's order, whether it was not better to ſail for America as I did, when I knew Congreſs's order for the Alliance's return, and that it was probable his Excellency had given ſimilar orders to Captain Jones: when all circumſtances and dangers heretofore enumerated, which the frigate underwent, concurred to make her ſailing neceſſary, or to ſtay always for his orders to ſail, which in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he would never have given me.</p>
            <p>Had I ſtay'd, a court with juſtice might have ſaid, that I was guilty for ſtaying in France with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out permiſſion of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin and againſt Congreſs's order to carry the ſhip immediately to Philadelphia, which I knew and all other circumſtances which concurred to make her ſailing neceſſary,—moreover the court which condemned me, acknowledged in the ſaid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that I had motives and advice which urged me to ſail, but they could not ſay that I had any to ſtay.</p>
            <p>Therefore of the two, of which one muſt unavoidably be done, I determined on the only one juſtifiable. According to this precedent, whenever a ſuperior will have an inferior found guilty, he will be ſure of the means by giving him no orders, as the inferior muſt do ſomething, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill, in either of which caſes he will be condemn'd for having done it or remained ſtill without his ſuperior's permiſſion.</p>
            <p>With regard to the ſecond article.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, there was no goods belonging to me brought in the Alliance, and it is not probable I would have ſuffered any there belonging to others, when I had orders to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>In the Court of Enquiry, no-body had mentioned that any goods had been brought in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. But in the report of ſaid court it was ſaid, that <hi>"the clearance of Captain Landais might involve the guilt of the crew, &amp; vice verſa,"</hi> by which it may be underſtood, that I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, otherwiſe the crew muſt be involved in their own guilt; and as they knew they could

            <p>This evidence, tho' artfully contrived to make me appear guilty, ſhows its deſign and falſehood at firſt examination; for had I really given Mr. Blodget any conſent whatever to his ſhipping goods on board the Alliance, it is unnatural to ſuppoſe that of his own accord, four months after the arrival of the Alliance, he would have confeſſed his own guilt of bringing goods, which would have proved his ingratitude, without alleviating his crime.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved, that in the foregoing queſtions of the Court, which were chiefly put to the evidence by Captain Barry, or the Judge Advocate, and in the anſwers to them made by Mr. Blodget, that neither are made or anſwered directly to know or prove, 1ſt, That I was in command of the Alliance when Mr. Blodget ſpoke to me about goods. 2d. Whether or not I gave him leave to bring goods in the ſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To the contrary, the queſtions are made for the indirect anſwers given; as if they had been agreed upon, and what queſtions they would make, and what the evidence ſhould anſwer, in order to make me appear guilty: And by the addition of a few inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined words to the written evidence, prevent me of the right to croſs-queſtion on thoſe material points.</p>
            <p>(N. B.) In the 6th queſtion, if the interlined words (<hi>or knowledge</hi>) were ſuppreſſed, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains an indirect anſwer; as I may have even <hi>knowledge</hi> of a thing, and yet not <hi>conſent</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>In the 7th queſtion, if the interlined words, <hi>I depend upon bringing the reſt on board,</hi> are ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it may be underſtood, that after Mr. Blodget's goods were on board without informing me thereof, he informed me that he had, and that was his deſign in going Purſer, to bring goods on board; and that Mr. Warren told him, that if he brought no more than his birth would hold, nobody would take notice of it: Which evidence, in that ſenſe, is true, as far as he told me about a month before I reſumed the command; (and in the time that converſation paſſed, I had no certainty or even expectation of reſuming the command, as may be ſeen in the firſt part of this memorial, by the date of the invitation of the officers, and the opinions of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Commodore Gillon, about reſuming the command,) that Mr. Warren or the Navy-Board had given him leave to bring goods; but they having given me orders to the contrary, and I had ſuch an high opinion of thoſe gentlemen's integrity, that I may have anſwered to not let me know it, as he had no writing from them to juſtify what he ſaid.—But to the contrary, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the interlined words to make park of the anſwer, and taking the ſenſe Mr. Blodget wanted to be underſtood, to make it appear I gave a tacit aſſent in ſaying <hi>not to let me know it,</hi> after he had juſt let me know it, could not be taken for an anſwer, but for an abſurdity.</p>
            <p>The 8th queſtion and anſwer prove poſitively that I gave no leave whatever to bring goods on account of Mr. Lee and others.</p>
            <p>The 9th queſtion's anſwer is remarkable, as it proves that the honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had to the amount of 500 Louis in goods on his own account, in the 550 Louis in goods Mr. Blodget
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:019056_0042_0FAA0CFE28B29058"/>
had in all on board, and in ſaying it was by his advice that Mr. Lee inveſted theſe 500 Louis in goods, &amp;c. but what can be meant by his <hi>privilege that would be no damage to any one?</hi> It cannot be the abſurdity he pretends I told him, <hi>not to let me know it,</hi> for every one on board had the ſame right; but if he meant that privilege which he ſaid Mr. Warren had given him, if true, it was really a privilege to him, as nobody elſe had the ſame, and I had even orders from the Navy-Board to the contrary: Therefore, as he ſaid I gave him no leave to put Mr. Lee's and other goods on board, I was not guilty for his putting them in his privilege.</p>
            <p>If the 10th queſtion means, as it may be underſtood, "Did five trunks contain all the goods you have mentioned." The anſwer, "Yes, and more," is poſitive; and if believed as well as that all the goods Mr. Blodget had belonging to him and to others amounted but to the ſum of 550 louis, and that Mr. Lee had for his particular account for 500 louis in that ſum—remains only for the account of Mr. Blodget and others for 50 Louis of goods, which is the 11th part of the total ſum; and if all thoſe goods were about the ſame value for the ſame bulk, it may be computed that Mr. Blodget's and other goods, without thoſe of Mr. Lee, would not fill more than half a trunk; and that Mr. Blodget, being Purſer, had opportunity and place to hide ſuch ſmall quantity of goods, without acquainting me with it.</p>
            <p>The 12th queſtion, though there is a whole word and a letter omitted in its laſt ſentence, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to mean this, <hi>"Where was the ſhip when the converſation took place between you and the Captain, reſpecting his telling you not to let him know that you had goods on board?"</hi> if ſo, and the interlined words, <hi>on board ſhip,</hi> are omitted, as they muſt be, otherwiſe it would not be an anſwer to the queſtion; as it would be, Qu. <hi>Where was the ſhip,?</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. <hi>On board the ſhip,</hi> &amp;c. but if omitted, the anſwer is, <hi>In L'Orient, but before he came on board;</hi> which ſix words after the comma are relatives to <hi>In LOrient,</hi> as well as to the reſt of the anſwer; therefore it was previous to the time I went on board and reſumed my command (as the ſhip had been there three months before) as I never went on ſhore ſince; which part of the anſwer is true in that ſenſe, that the ſhip was in L'Orient; when long before I went on board, not knowing that I ſhould ever reſume my command, a tranſient converſation took place between Mr. Blodget and me, about his telling me he had leave of the Navy-Board to bring, goods, and my anſwering, I had their order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and I never ſaid otherwiſe. And what proves that I never varied from that principle, is that my firſt queries, being on board the ſhip, in the preſence of Mr. Blodget and all the officers, was, What goods were on board? upon which I was anſwered, that in the hold were cannons and barrels of powder, and between decks boxes of ſmall-arms. As his telling me that <hi>he ſuppoſed Dr. Winſhip's chief reaſon for not being in my intereſt, was for fear Captain Landais would turn out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty he had on board.</hi> This part of his anſwer, if it was true, would prove him to be an informer and accuſer againſt a friend and countryman, to be added to his other unrighteouſneſs; and proves that he anſwered ſo merely to charge me, that he had acquainted me with Doctor Winſhip's having goods on board; as in his laſt anſwer of that day he ſaid, he did not know whether I knew thoſe goods were on board.</p>
            <p>The 17th and laſt queſtion of that day made by the Court, is contrived for the anſwer, as if the queſtioner had known the falſehood of the evidences given before to charge me, and had been willing to give opportunity to Mr. Blodget to deny his evidences about goods whatever, ſo that the charges ſhould ſtand againſt me; for in the 12th anſwer, Mr. Blodget intimated that he had acquainted me that Dr. Winſhip had goods on board, therefore the queſtion cannot be for thoſe goods in particular; but if it is made in general for all the goods mentioned, the anſwer muſt alſo be general, and muſt be a denial that I knew of any goods being on board the ſhip.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:019056_0043_0FAA0CFF6EB3D750"/>The Court being met again the following Monday, there were put to Mr. Blodget on the ſame ſubject theſe queſtions, viz.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q Court.</speaker>
               <p>"What did you mean when you ſaid all the goods were conſigned to you?"</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A. Blodget.</speaker>
               <p>"I mean all thoſe that belong'd to other people that were conſign'd to me."</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Court.</speaker>
               <p>"Did not you think it moſt for your intereſt to come to Boſton?"</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Blodget.</speaker>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
            </sp>
            <p>As theſe two laſt anſwers contain nothing particular, and the reſt of Mr. Blodget's evidence related things which took no place in the articles made againſt me, I take no notice of them.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Blodget had ended his evidence, I offered to croſs-queſtion him upon theſe material points, viz. whether I had reſumed the command when he ſaid he had ſpoken to me about goods, and whether I had then given him any tacit or explicit aſſent or encouragement to have goods on board; and whether he had acquainted me that he or any body elſe had goods on board?—but the Court would not admit my queſtions, ſaying, they were already made, and the anſwers to them given: I inſiſted, and went to my writer (who I had never ſuſpected before) which had wrote down the evidence, to prove by it that the anſwers were inconſiſtent with the queſtions, and not direct to the purpoſe; but one may eaſier imagine than deſcribe my ſurpriſe and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation when I ſaw the added interlined words, which gave to the anſwers the full extent that was wanted to make me appear guilty, and prevent my croſs-queſtioning on thoſe point. Though the cheat was as obvious as groſs and black, I could not mend it, as there was no by-ſtander, or any body that I could apply to for redreſs or teſtimony, and all I ſaid availed nothing.</p>
            <p>Seeing it was in vain for me to contend with thoſe of the Court which appeared to me to have led the others all along, and whom I had ſtrong ſuſpicion were the authors of the laſt deed; I undertook another way to bring Mr. Blodget to the time of the converſation mentioned. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a letter which he had wrote to me at Paris, and made thoſe queſtions, viz.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. Landais Q.</speaker>
               <p>"Did you write to me while I was at Paris?"</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Blodget.</speaker>
               <p>"Yes?"</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. L.</speaker>
               <p>"What was your opinion as to my virtue?"</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>"I had a very favorable opinion of your virtue and humanity in general."</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. L.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <stage>(The Court hearing me aſk this queſtion)</stage>
"How could you make ſuch a propoſal, ſoon after my arrival at L'Orient, to a man of virtue, to let you bring goods againſt his orders?"</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Captain Barry did not give me time to finiſh this queſtion, but ſaid, <hi>"The Court prohibits Captain Landais from making any queries before his taking the command."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I repreſented to the Court, that the Court of Enquiry, whoſe report had made the Court Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial take place (both the warrants for the two courts prefixing the ſame time when to begin) had begun their enquiry from the time I arrived at L'Orient. Moreover, that the Court ſitting had received from Mr. Blodget evidence againſt me, alluding to time previous to my going on board to reſume my command, without mentioning how long before; and I ſhowed them the 12th anſwer, which contains it. But Captain Barry being againſt it, fearing, I ſuppoſe, I ſhould bring the truth to light that way, put it to the Court, who having deliberated on the matter, gave this anſwer:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"The opinion of the Court being taken, whether Captain Landais ſhould have liberty to aſk Mr. Blodget any queſtions previous to his taking the command at L'Orient, was determined in the negative; and Captain Landais not chooſing to aſk any queſtions unleſs he could be indulged to queſtion Mr. Blodget relative to his conduct from the time he arrived at L'Orient, Mr. Blodget was diſmiſſed."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My writer, who wrote this, did not mention my repreſentation to the Court; neither that I told them ſince they prevented my croſs-queſtioning Mr. Blodget from the time he had alluded to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019056_0044_0FAA0D0007575178"/>
in his evidence, I would not croſs-queſtion any body elſe, being uſeleſs for me; being perſuaded, by the conduct of the Court, of their intention; and ſeeing it was unneceſſary to be there, I begg'd as a favour the Court would exempt me from attending there any longer, but they would not grant my requeſt.—I diſmiſs'd and paid my writer, having experienced too much his abilities.</p>
            <p>I muſt remind the reader, that though I had aſked ſeveral times that the Court would order Lieutenant Elwood to give his evidence, he was the only one of the officers who did not; becauſe in the Court of Enquiry he had given in his evidence ſeveral depoſitions which would have proved fully againſt the articles the Court Martial deſigned to make againſt me; in particular he had ſaid, that <hi>"I would not even permit him (Mr. Elwood) to have two hogſheads of wine for the ward-room ſtowed in the hold, for fear he would bring them to America; and that he had part bottled, and the reſt given away."</hi> Which would have proved that I was ſo far from granting any private thing to be brought to America, that I oppoſed thus the officers who I muſt have ordered to receive Mr. Blod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get's goods on board, which is incompatible and incredible, as they would have depoſed my order thereabouts.</p>
            <p>Beſides, had the Court been willing to do their duty and juſtice, it was in their power, as Mr. Blodget could not put thoſe goods on board without the Lieutenant on watch knowing it, and the marine officer on guard; and the Maſter could not ſtow them without my leave, unleſs brib'd by Mr. Blodget: and if I had given leave, the Maſter would have entered it in his book, which was before the Court Martial all the time, where there was no ſuch thing mentioned. Therefore the Court Martial wilfully or ignorantly not only cleared Mr. Blodget of his evident crime, but charged me with it in making the ſecond article, though every thing concurred to evince my innocence.</p>
            <p>This will be a precedent for any one that will have his Captain condemned againſt all proofs to the contrary, to ſay he has brought goods, and that the Captain told him <hi>"not to let him know it."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have thought proper to put in this place Mr. Blodget's evidence againſt me about goods all at length, and the Court's behaviour on that ſubject, as a ſingle inſtance of the Court's conduct du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my trial; and how the Court and Evidences believed me clear of any blame whatever, ſince they were compelled to contrive and ſupport ſuch things to have me condemned.</p>
            <p>As to the 3d article;</p>
            <p>Although I was very ſedulous in all branches of my duty, it was in vain, as the paſſengers, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and crew, after the latter were alienated from me by the influence of the former, and were all ſo mutinous, ſo much of the ſame mind, ſo connected together, ſo watchful to hide one another's crimes from me, that it was impoſſible to know what plots they were about between decks, in the ward-room, or cock-pit, when I was on the quarter-deck or in the cabbin, nobody acquainting me thereof, as may be ſeen by the inſtruments in writing given by the officers and paſſengers, in the following evidences given in the Court of Enquiry, viz.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buckly ſaid, <hi>"The firſt inſtance of any kind of diſturbance within my knowledge, was Mr. Degge's confinement, upon which a general diſſatisfaction aroſe againſt Captain Landais; and ſome of the men went ſo far as to ſay in my hearing, that they would releaſe Mr. Degge."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Buckly aſſented to it, and very likely encouraged it from that time, ſince he never acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me thereof, and effectually concerted, plotted, and ſigned the inſidious piece with the other officers, given to the Court of Enquiry, for the releaſe of Mr. Degge, and taking the command of the Alliance from me, as was done.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buckly further ſaid, <hi>"Thomas Baily and James Pratt came to us in the ward-room, and aſked our opinion about ſpeaking to Captain Landais upon altering the courſe of the ſhip, as ſhe was then ſteering weſt half ſouth."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:019056_0045_0FAA0D00C271DAC0"/>Mr. Buckley, or any one of the ward-room officers, never acquainted me with this; which proves that the officers and crew concerted privately together their plot, ſince the officers put it in execution.</p>
            <p>Parts of the evidences omitted to be wrote down by the Judge Advocate:</p>
            <p>Mr. Larcher ſaid, <hi>"I enquired of ſome of the people, whether they would rather go to York than Philadelphia? They anſwered, they had rather go to York, for there they ſhould get exchanged without any great expence."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was never acquainted with this neither.</p>
            <p>Mr. Elwood, Lieut. of Marines, ſaid, <hi>"On the</hi> 10<hi>th of Auguſt one Pratt told me, if I delivered the keys of the arm-cheſt to the Captain, they would have my life."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This proves that officer, and perhaps all others, were parties, or in the plot of the crew; and I was never acquainted with this, neither with any thing whatever, relative to what preceded their open mutinies; therefore the officers were guilty for keeping ſecret thoſe things from me at leaſt, and very likely of planning and encouraging them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the paſſengers and officers depoſed in the Court of Enquiry, and owned and gave in writing there, ſigned by them (in the inſidious piece they made in order to juſtify their clandeſtine mutiny in taking the command during the night from me, and giving it to Lieutenant Degge,) that they conſulted and agreed in the ward-room together upon thoſe facts; (for which crime, upon their own depoſition, they were, by the 27th article of the regulation, proved guilty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further trial, and condemnable to ſuffer death); all which I was unacquainted with until after in was put in execution: Therefore it was impoſſible to <hi>inſpect</hi> things utterly unknown to me, though ſuch was <hi>the behaviour of the paſſengers, officers and crew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, being all in the plot againſt me alone, had they done thoſe things even in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it was out of my power to prevent or puniſh them collectively or ſeparately, and I could have done no more than I did, which was to proteſt againſt their deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I detected, and would have brought to puniſhment the offenders-on board,</hi> had the Navy Board, Court of Enquiry, or Court Martial been impartial, and willing to have juſtice done; ſince on my arrival, by my official letter dated on board, Auguſt 15, 1780, to the Hon. Navy-Board at Boſton, <hi>and which was before the Court Martial,</hi> I acquainted ſaid Navy-Board, <hi>"that I had two revolts of the crew, the firſt on the</hi> 5<hi>th inſtant, in which I was not ſupported in endeavoring to prevent it:"</hi>—By which the crew are not the only detected, but alſo the officers in general for not ſupporting me, and the officers of marines in particular, as it was in them that the executive power laid in that caſe, which I ordered in vain to be put in execution.—<hi>"The ſecond on the</hi> 11<hi>th inſtant; in this the paſſengers and officers had hands (as per log-book) for it was by them the courſe was altered, contrary to my written orders; they adviſed, requeſted, and charged with a Lieutenant to bring the ſhip here, which he has effected, though he was under arreſt."</hi> And I added, "<hi>You ſee, gentlemen, by the above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, it is to be ſuſpected that a great many are concerned in this revolt, ſome out of policy, others by adventure intereſt, and all the guilty in the firſt revolt, through fear that the occaſion of it would be better ſearched into at Philadelphia than it will be at Boſton. I was taken ill on the</hi> 11<hi>th inſtant. All that has been done ſince was without even adviſing me thereof. Here are two ringleaders of the revolt on board, but I cannot have them ſecured till I have ſome body to obey me, and I ſuppoſe the intention of every body is to exculpate them. All the officers refuſed to receive my written orders; ſome ſaid they received Mr. Degge's orders, who is the Lieutenant choſen for the purpoſe. I am, &amp;c.</hi>"</p>
            <p>By which extracts the paſſengers and officers are impeached of having altered the courſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary to my written orders; of having plotted together for taking the command from me and giving
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019056_0046_0FAA0D018ED5CA60"/>
it to a Lieutenant who was under arreſt: all which was corroborated in the Court of Enquiry by their own evidence.—I likewiſe impeached the two ringleaders of the firſt mutiny.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I likewiſe impeached the officers alſo of diſobedience, in refuſing to receive my written orders; therefore a detection, and a diſpoſition to bring the offenders to puniſhment, could not be more fully made appear than it was in that official letter which the Court Martial had before them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, in his evidence given in the Court-Martial ſaid, (ſpeaking of L'Orient) <hi>"I heard Captain Jones was coming to America, and there was a letter ſaid to be ſent on board, ordering the ſhip to ſail; which letter was ſaid to be from Congreſs, ordering the ſhip to ſail for America. I heard Mr. Elwood ſay, that the ſhip was ordered for Philadelphia."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the officers knew Congreſs's order, even by the pack of letters that Capt. Jones had directed to be tranſmitted to the crew, which were delivered to me.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, about the firſt mutiny, <hi>"I went and informed the Captain that the people wanted to ſpeak to him; he deſired me to tell them to come five at a time, and he would ſpeak to them. I went up and told them, and they anſwered, that if they could not all go none would go. They then went on the quarter-deck, in order to make more ſail. I went to acquaint the Captain—he came upon the quarter-deck, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Mr. Pool, his Clerk, holding ſeveral papers. He called the marine officers—Capt. Parks was not on deck then—The Captain deſired Mr. Elwood to call the Marines, and get them under arms—Mr. Elwood did not call the marines, that I know of—I don't recollect ſeeing the marine officers open the arm-cheſts. After Captain Parks came upon deck, I did not ſee the marines under arms. The Quartermaſter who ſpoke to the Captain, and told him to make ſail, was James Pratt; but I don't think the name he gave Captain Landais was his right name. The Captain and I went forward to let go the hallyards, and found they were rack'd aloft, and could not get the fore-topſail down. The Captain went aft and ſpoke to Mr. Buckly, and begged that he would go and take a reef in the fore topſail, and deſired him to take the officers with him for that purpoſe. I went forward with him and Mr. Larcher; we found it impoſſible to do it, as the people would not ſuffer us. Mr. Buckly aſked the Captain, in the name of God what he ſhould do, when there was ſo many againſt him?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By thoſe extracts of Mr. Lynd's evidence, though he tried to hide the truth all along, there is enough to prove that I gave proper orders neceſſary to ſtop that mutiny, which were not executed by the officers, through their fear of the crew, or diſinclination to obey me. In the part of the evidence of Mr. Lynd given in the Court Martial, relating to the plots of the paſſengers and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers againſt, and their taking the command from me and giving it to Lieutenant Degge, the truth is ſtill more hidden than all the reſt; and he tried all he could to charge me, by miſrepreſenting things in order to exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </sp>
            <p>In thoſe extracts of evidences all given, by men known to be my enemies, whoſe lives were at ſtake, there is enough that appears to prove that I had done my duty. For Mr. Lynd acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that I had given a written order to the Lieutenants, which was extant on the 10th Auguſt 1780—having never been recalled or altered by me, which was to have the ſhip ſteered weſt half ſouth. The Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> acknowledged that on the ſame day two ſailors came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cabbin to ſpeak to me, who mentioned all the ſeamen's being without door, who wanted to ſee the Captain: I ſaid I would not ſpeak to them, but ſaying that they wiſhed to go to Boſton— I ſaid my orders were for Philadelphia—The two ſailors then went out, and all the ſeamen were much diſcontended, uttering high words, to this effect, they would go themſelves. This was at 3 or 4 o'clock, and the Captain went to bed. Mr. Thomas Lee acknowledged, that on the ſame day Mr. Lynd came with Mr. Livingſton to me, that I was in my bed, requeſted me to go and pacify the men, but I anſwered I had already given my orders, (which referred to my written or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as I had given no other.) Mr. Buckly and Mr. Lynd acknowledged, that on the ſame day the people deſired them to alter the ſhip's courſe, that they anſwered, they would not, it ſhould not be altered, and Mr. Buckly even drove them from the quarter-deck, <hi>(and it is not ſaid, the people deſired or attempted to have the courſe altered after that.)</hi> Mr. Blodget acknowledged that on the ſame day he, and all the officers went into the cabbin; that I told them I had my orders to go to Philadelphia; Mr. Elwood aſked me, if I would ſhow my orders; that I ſaid I would not, for that was not cuſtomary—that there was a good deal paſſed that he could not recollect; that I ſaid I was ſick, but I did not appear to be ſo—that on the ſame day of the laſt revolt in the laſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, Mr. Blodget and the officers read a letter, ſigned by all the paſſengers, adviſing him and the officers to take the command from me and give it to ſome one elſe; but Mr. Lee, (who had ſigned it firſt) being a perſon of conſequence, was particularly attended to.</p>
            <p>Therefore, by theſe extracts it its ſufficiently proved, (though the whole truth is not contained in them, as I have heretofore related in ſpeaking of that which happened on that day) that I ſpoke to the people and told them Congreſs's order was to carry the Alliance to Philadelphia, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that I could ſay nothing ſtronger than that to them to remind them of their duty; that I ſaid the ſame to the officers, and confirmed my order to them, to have the courſe ſteered weſt half ſouth, which was the direct courſe for Philadelphia, being then at noon in 42° 12 lat. north, and 62° 51 weſt longitude, and conſequently that I did my duty as far as laid in my power, and proved a good example to the officers by my willingneſs to obey Congreſs's order. But that in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances then had I been well, and done any thing more to prevent the combined mutiny of the officers paſſengers and crew, it would have availed nothing, as the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was particularly attended to, during the plot againſt me held in the ward room, being in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance under fearful apprehenſions of going directly to Philadelphia for ſeveral reaſons, tho't Boſton was a ſafer and eaſier place to land his goods, and learn from his friends there what turn his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair with Silas Deane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had taken before Congreſs; and by theſe reaſons, his animoſity, and other views againſt me, he ſigned firſt, and after him all the paſſengers, that inſidious piece againſt me, containing his undeniable advice to the officers to take the command from me and give it to ſome other perſon; and accordingly the officers, by another ſimilar one, aſſented to it;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:019056_0049_0FAA0D049D3B6DD0"/>
and it was given in the middle of the night, (when the ſhip was going under all ſails ſat weſt half ſouth, the wind being pretty freſh, and the men very quiet) to Mr. Degge, who was under arreſt for having mutined againſt my order, who was tho't the moſt ſuitable, and he did not, nor any of the officers, offer to follow my example, in diſcharging his duty by endeavouring to obey Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs's order, to carry the Alliance to Philadelphia, (though the heavy artillery and powder ſhe was loaded with was ſuſpected to be for the ſiege of New-York) but to the contrary, followed the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> advice, altered her courſe for Philadelphia, and carried her to Boſton.</p>
            <p>I believe I have ſufficiently demonſtrated, that the Court Martial made without any foundation whatever, the 3d article againſt me, by charging me with the paſſengers and officers obvious crimes.</p>
            <p>By this precedent when the officers of a ſhip will agree together to take the command of a ſhip from their Captain, let him be never ſo dutiful, they may do it, (though it is againſt all nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick laws to do it upon any pretence whatever) and break all ſuperior orders, and the Captain muſt be condemn'd for it.</p>
            <p>As to the 4th Article.</p>
            <p>Captain Barry, who ſat preſident in the Court Martial to judge me, and who was already my ſucceſſor in the command of the Alliance, knew that I never oppoſed his taking the command of the Alliance, nor interfered in it by words or actions whatever. He knew alſo the old table linen, which had been brought to me in one of my trunks at my lodging, I had offered to deliver him as ſoon as he or the Navy Board would give me a general diſcharge for the ſtores and proviſions that were in the cabbin, when I was forced out the Alliance by the Navy Board's order, becauſe part of thoſe had been plundered, as ſoon as I was out of the ſhip, by the neglect of the Navy Board or Captain Barry, in leaving no body to take care of them.</p>
            <p>But though Captain Barry knew thoſe things, he never told it to the court, for fear I ſhould be acquitted and re-eſtabliſhed again, and he debarred from the command of the frigate Alliance, by its being reſtored to me; or the court, convinced that I was guiltle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the charges contained in the three firſt articles they had made againſt me, thought proper to make the fourth ſimilar to them.</p>
            <p>It is added in the ſame article, that ſaid court took into conſideration that I was without credit or money, &amp;c. Indeed I was without money, as I had ſpent ſince the year 1777, when I entered the United States ſervice, all my own money; and ſince my laſt arrival in Boſton I had ſpent 100 Louiſdor, that I had brought for pocket money, to pay the Judge Advocate for giving me a copy of the evidences he had wrote in the Court of Enquiry—to pay two writers I had during ſaid Court of Enquiry for taking down thoſe evidences, &amp;c. But I ought to have had credit as I was myſelf a creditor of large ſums to the United States, for which I had applied to the Admiralty Board, as there was one of thoſe ſums due to me in the year 1777, which was ordered by a third reſolve of Congreſs, in March, 1779, to be paid me; which ſums altogether, by a ſeries of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from all parts, though I have ſince repeated my application to Congreſs and their Miniſter for that purpoſe, being out of their ſervice, to be paid, it had been all in vain.</p>
            <p>In the ſupplementary article to the four made by the Court Martial, it is ſaid that I greatly ſuffered from a mutinous diſpoſition in both paſſengers and officers, and from a real mutiny in the crew of the ſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Since the Court Martial acknowledged that the paſſengers and officers were both of a mutinous diſpoſition, they muſt have had proof of it; and they could not have had proof of it, unleſs the paſſengers and officers had actually mutinied againſt me; and really, though the Court
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:019056_0050_0FAA0D060ACA7380"/>
Martial tried with as much art to exculpate the paſſengers and officers, as they did to make me appear guilty, their mutiny on the 10th Auguſt was more palpable, obvious, and undeniable to the Court (as there was my written order for the courſe to be ſteered weſt half ſouth for Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, extant, as well as the two inſidious pieces of writing, plotted, concerted, written &amp; ſigned in the ward-room, one by all the paſſengers, the other by all the officers, for taking the command of the frigate from me, which they effectually did, and broke Congreſs's order and mine, in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe, and bringing her to Boſton) than the other real mutiny of the crew on the 5th inſt. (as there was of this one no teſtified proof, ſigned and acknowledged by the authors, as there was of the other) by the Court Martial.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I ſuffered from the paſſengers and officers mutinous temper, becauſe they mutinied againſt my willingneſs to do my duty, in obeying Congreſs's order, and did quite the contrary.— Was ever his Excellency General Waſhington condemned, tried, or even impeached, when the Pennſylvania line mutinied and left the army? No; becauſe he could not prevent it.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to compare my abilities to thoſe of that Great General; but I may ſay, my intentions were ever as pure and as good as his Excellency's—and in that caſe he had all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and three quarters of the army left, and willing to obey him; and I had not a man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. How could the Court Martial admit the evidence againſt me, of men who had evidently forfeited their life and could recover it but by charging me, and whom they acknowledged had made me ſuffer from their mutinous diſpoſition when on board the ſhip; could it be expected that thoſe mutinous diſpoſed perſons, after being kept four months together on board the ſhip at Boſton, would own the truth, by which I muſt be acquitted, and they condemn'd to death? it was more natural to think the contrary, that ſince thoſe perſons being proved guilty of having made me ſuffer from their mutinous diſpoſition when on board, would continue and increaſe that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in ſubverting the truth, in order to charge me and have me condemned to ſatiate their ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, and prevent my evidence againſt them, and agree to ſay any thing to ſave their life. Thoſe things were palpable. But it appears that the court was all the time unanimouſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to have the innocent condemned, and the guilty, as much as they poſſibly could, acquitted.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. How could the Court Martial make the 2d article againſt me upon the bare evidence of Mr. Blodget, (who was one of the principal among thoſe guilty perſons by his intereſt and entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come to Boſton) againſt all the proofs given heretofore to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But it appears that the Court Martial, having no foundation to make any article againſt me, was compelled to make one upon his apparent falſehood, in order to have me condemned.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. How could the Court Martial conſtrue the 3d article againſt me, wherein it is ſaid, that I am guilty in not exerting my utmoſt abilities to inſpect the behaviour of the paſſengers, officers and crew, &amp;c. though, beſides all the proofs I have given to the contrary in the ſupplementary article, they acknowledged that I greatly ſuffered from a mutinous diſpoſition in both paſſengers, officers, and from a real mutiny in the crew of ſaid ſhip, which demonſtrates the impoſſibility I was in, having every one on board againſt me, to inſpect the behaviour and plots of the paſſengers, officers and crew, who being all of the ſame mind and diſpoſition, kept all ſecrets from me But the reaſon of the Court Martial's making the 3d article againſt me, may be aſcribed to the ſame motive which made them make the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The fourth article made againſt me by the Court Martial, though they knew that I never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in any degree, Captain Barry in his command of the Alliance, appears to have been made upon the ſame principle they had made the ſecond and third—and the firſt article proved my dutifulneſs and judgment in ſailing from L'Orient, as I knew Congreſs's orders to carry the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:019056_0051_0FAA0D06F4B65AB0"/>
directly to Philadelphia; and I had motives that urged me alſo to do it, and there was none for ſtaying, having wrote to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, as ſoon as I reſumed my command on board the Alliance at L'Orient, acquainting him with Congreſs's orders, who would give me none, and of courſe was the only perſon faulty in that caſe, as his ſilence was a tacit conſent, ſince he gave me no order to the contrary.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps proper, before I diſmiſs this ſubject, that I ſhould remind the motives which influenced me to make this appeal to the impartial wiſdom of the public. Conſcious that I have faithfully diſcharged my duty in all reſpects, through the numerous difficulties I underwent, with all poſſible diſadvantage, during my command in the American navy. I conſidered it as the laſt duty I owed to that ſervice, to expoſe to public view the artifices, malice and deſigns of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to ſhew the ſteps which led to my diſgrace—the powerful combination formed to ruin me, and the characters moſt active in this flagitious buſineſs; expoſed not only to the jealouſy and prejudice of the officers of the navy in general, which has appeared from the cicumſtance of their petitioning for my removal two years before, and in particular of the principals of my judges in the Court Martial, who had beſides ſelf intereſt to deſtroy me, in order to enſure the command of the Alliance to themſelves; I had the Navy-Board at Boſton my declared foes, and a Judge Advocate ſubſervient to their purpoſes. I have been, as ſtated, the marked object of the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and conſequently of his partiſans, particularly his all-powerful friend the Honorable Robert Morris, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> on one ſide, and the Honorable Arthur Lee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and party on the other.</p>
            <p>Guiltleſs as I am, is it to be wondered that I have fallen a ſacrifice to the malice of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? and to ſave the guilty, that I have been condemned without proof, nay contrary to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences offered in my juſtification on my trial?—my character and reputation as far as their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence extended, blaſted—that my fortune has been ruined, by having large ſums due to me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from me, ſome ſince the year 1777, by the immenſe power and influence of the Honorable Robert Morris, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and the perſons before named, to ſatisfy their inſatiable malevolence.</p>
            <p>I will now conclude this ſecond part; but in juſtice to the gentlemen of Boſton, cannot forbear to declare the graceful ſenſe I entertain of the delicacy of their conduct during my trial: Though they were generally acquainted with what had taken place on board the frigate Alliance, and though Courts Martial were uſually very crouded, yet they did not in any degree countenance this proſecution, even by their appearance in court, being confident that a ſacrifice was about to take place, and therefore forbore to attend.</p>
