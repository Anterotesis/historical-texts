            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>OF ZEBULUN SUCH AS WENT FORTH TO BATTLE, EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERT IN WAR, WITH ALL INSTRUMENTS OF WAR, FIFTY THOUSAND, WHICH COULD KEEP RANK: THEY WERE NOT OF DOUBLE HEART.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo impreſſed with the virtues and exploits of <hi>David,</hi> that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally united, upon the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the defeat of his rivals, to raiſe him to the throne. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſent to him at <hi>Hebron</hi> a choſen band out of each tribe, to teſtify their readineſs to ſupport him againſt any attempt to hinder his exaltation. Their country had long ſmarted under foreign and civil wars, and they anxiouſly expected more happy days under the adminiſtration of a Monarch wiſe, pious, and brave.</p>
            <p>THE zeal of the tribe of <hi>Zebulun</hi> was conſpicuous on the occaſion. <hi>Fifty thouſand</hi> of its citizens, with arms in their hands, marched to the capital. Theſe appear to have been the flower of the militia. They were "<hi>ſuch as went forth to battle, expert in war.</hi>" Either they had been actually tried in the ſeaſon of danger, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022576_0003_0FB984A66DBBAC10"/>
their courage and diſcipline had been proved in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; or they had paid ſuch attention to the art mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, that they were ſufficiently trained to contend with the foes of their country. They were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly prepared to fight, ſhould events require it.</p>
            <p>THEY were properly ſkilled in the duties of the ſoldier, and were expert in thoſe evolutions, which were neceſſary for the ſucceſſful conduct of war. Though the civil wars appeared to ceaſe by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all parties to acknowledge <hi>David</hi> King, and no public enemy appeared in the land, ſome foreign power, or domeſtic uſurper, might take advantage of a ſtate of general ſecurity, and attempt to ſtrike a fatal blow. They went, therefore, prepared for the worſt.</p>
            <p>THEY were completely armed, and did not ſuffer themſelves to be deficient in a ſingle article. They marched "<hi>with all inſtruments of war.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THE ſhield, the helmet, the bow, the ſling, the ſpear, and the ſword, were the arms of their age and nation. Theſe were naturally preſerved in bright and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent order by a people of ſuch military taſte. They would not allow ruſt to canker them, or duſt to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their beauty. Yet, while they took a due care of the appearance of their arms, they would be more attentive to have them fit for uſe, than for ſhew. The vain ſoldier, who preferred ornament to bravery and diſcipline, would have been an object of their juſt and

               </note> When the Perſians became e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervated with pleaſure, and relaxed in diſcipline, they were ſtrangers to that martial ſpirit, which inſpired the people of <hi>Zebulun.</hi> They deſpiſed the plain but uſeful armour of their brave anceſtors, and adorned themſelves before battle with gold and jewels. Theſe ſerved only to convince the rough Grecians of their loſs of their manly feelings, and to urge them more forcibly, to an irreſiſtible and gainful attack.</p>
            <p>THE troops of <hi>Zebulun</hi> not only poſſeſſed "<hi>all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of war,</hi>" but they knew how to uſe them to the beſt advantage. They were ſkilled in the various branches of military diſcipline. They marched in regular array, and "<hi>could keep rank</hi>" in the field. They felt the importance of order and uniformity in their movements, and of attacking or maintaining the ſhock of an enemy, with a ſteady, unbroken front. Each ſoldier carefully kept the ſtation aſſigned him, and marched, or countermarched, charged, or retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a firm and regular ſtep, according to the word of command.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred <hi>Chronicle</hi> cloſes the account with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and expreſſive delineation of their character: "<hi>They were not of double heart.</hi>"</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:022576_0005_0FB984B057DD0628"/>
THEY were ſincerely and conſcientiouſly attached to the cauſe in which they were engaged. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew phraſe, literally tranſlated, is, they had "<hi>not a heart and a heart.</hi>" They had not one heart, warm and loud in its loyal, patriotic expreſſions, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart, more concealed, ſelfiſh, inconſtant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful. They were attached, by a principle of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and love, to the late revolution in government, which placed the brave and pious <hi>David</hi> on the throne. They were not mercenary ſoldiers, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtandard of ambitious leaders, for plunder or pay. They were the freemen, the citizens of the ſtate, who viewed their religion, their wives, their children, their property, involved in the liberty, the ſafety, and the regular government of their country.</p>
            <p>THEY had not forgotten the example of their brave anceſtors, who, though a ſmall band, ranged themſelves under the ſtandard of the gallant <hi>Barak,</hi> wreſted <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> from the iron yoke of oppreſſion, and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the numerous regular troops of their tyrant, the King of <hi>Canaan.</hi> They recollected the panegyric ſtrains of the Jewiſh Propheteſs and Heroine,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the context.</note> "<hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulun</hi> and <hi>Naphtali</hi> were a people, that jeoparded their lives unto the death, in the high places of the field." They wiſhed to emulate their patriotiſm and military virtues, and welcomed fatigue and danger, if they might but perpetuate the felicity of the nation. Their generous ſouls ſpurned the idea of duplicity,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022576_0006_0FB984B5803C2A58"/>
and they were willing to ſeal their attachment to the cauſe, which they had eſpouſed, with their blood.</p>
            <p>How happy then muſt theſe loyal and virtuous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens be, to find their brethren flocking into <hi>Hebron,</hi> from the other tribes, upon the ſame deſign! How pleaſing to obſerve diſcord withdraw herſelf from the ſcene, and every eye ſparkling with joy, at the cloſe of their civil wars, and the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>firſt Magiſtrate,</hi> who poſſeſſed the happy talent of ruling in the hearts of the people!—</p>
            <p>THE intire unanimity in this vaſt military body, and the<note n="*" place="bottom">Song of <hi>Deborah.</hi>
               </note> "<hi>oneneſs of heart in all the reſt of Iſrael,</hi>" without exception, "<hi>to make</hi> David <hi>King,</hi>" exhibited him as evidently deſignated by Heaven to his high office.</p>
            <p>THEY could not forbear mutual congratulations on their preſent proſpects. Men, who were <hi>not of double heart,</hi> who ſincerely ſought the public honour and proſperity, could not but felicitate themſelves on the peaceable eſtabliſhment of their new Monarch. He became the common centre of their affections. Party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit was conſequently baniſhed, and they viewed themſelves as brethren of one great family, whoſe duty and glory it was, to imitate the virtues of their royal Sire.</p>
            <p>IT was natural for them, therefore, to keep a joyful feſtival on the occaſion—"<hi>Bread and milk, cakes of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022576_0007_0FB984B6EF1F4F08"/>
figs, and bunches of raiſins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and ſheep,</hi>" were prepared "<hi>abundantly,</hi>" for the whole multitude: "<hi>For there was joy in Iſrael.</hi> Neither need we be ſurpriſed, that <hi>"David," their late gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> notwithſtanding the difficulties with which he had ſtruggled, and the dark clouds which ſo oft ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured his horizon, "<hi>waxed greater and greater; for the Lord of hoſts was with him.</hi>"</p>
            <p>OUR text holds up to view the duties and virtues, which claim the attention of the military character.</p>
            <p>HAPPY would it be, my brethren, if reaſon or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion laid ſuch reſtraints upon the paſſions of men, that it would be unneceſſary to have any knowledge of the uſe of arms! But, as the preſent degenerate condition of human nature renders this knowledge abſolutely requiſite, to protect a country againſt bands of public robbers and murderers, who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves legally authorized by their employers, to deal deſtruction around them, and to wreſt the property and immunities of the citizens from their poſſeſſion; it is not unſuitable, to devote an anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to the ſerious conſideration of the character, and duties of a patriot ſoldier.</p>
            <p>AND when a miniſter of the goſpel reflects, on ſuch an anniverſary, that he is not addreſſing a band of mercenaries, who make war their trade, but a ſelect body of independent citizens, who are chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with the duties of civil life, and who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated to defend the land of their nativity againſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022576_0008_0FB984BA46AA5C20"/>
lawleſs invaſions, to ſeek its <hi>true glory,</hi> and to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ties of friendſhip among themſelves; he may conſider the occaſion, not wholly foreign to the buſineſs of his ſtation.</p>
            <p>IF the primitive chriſtians faithfully followed the ſtandard of their <hi>Heathen Emperors,</hi> and aſſiduouſly cultivated the profeſſion of arms, that they might teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their loyalty at the hazard of life; much more may we pay a temporary attention to military ſcience to enable us to maintain the <hi>civil and religious rights</hi> of a <hi>free chriſtian republic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>patriot, chriſtian ſoldier</hi> will cordially comply with thoſe laws of the Commonwealth, which mark out the line of his profeſſion. He will be careful, to provide himſelf with a complete military apparatus, and to be expert in the uſe of his arms, that he may "<hi>not be aſhamed to ſpeak with his enemies in the gate.</hi>" He will be diligent to make proficiency in diſcipline. He will <hi>keep rank,</hi> while peace allows him ſecurely to practice military evolutions, that he may maintain good order, and a better countenance, when the trump of war ſummons him to battle. True courage enables him to adhere to that diſcipline, in the day of trial, which he has learnt in a ſeaſon of calmneſs and leiſure.</p>
            <p>THE ſimplicity and purity, that reign in his breaſt, teach him to deſpiſe thoſe ſelfiſh arguments, which urge the ſacrifice of the public good to perſonal ſafety or intereſt. He ſhudders at the idea of a double heart, influencing his deſigns or conduct. He ſincerely
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022576_0009_0FB984BF76A666F8"/>
and ardently loves the cauſe and country, to which he has devouted himſelf. He knows, that his ſtation expoſes him to danger in the ſeaſon of war. But he remembers, that life was given, to aid him in deeds of patriotiſm and virtue. If he has military talents, he believes, that it would be ſinful <hi>to bury them in a napkin,</hi> and that he is accountable for the neglect of them, when the public honor and ſafety require their improvement. He knows, that he muſt quit this ſtage, at the moment decreed by the ſovereign Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of human life; and he is deſirous of acting his part well, till he is called to other climes and ſcenes.—He is more anxious to merit the eſteem of the virtuous and the brave, and to make a ſuitable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his powers for the promotion of the general good, than to protract the period of his preſent exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. "<hi>Save my country,</hi>" is his firſt and laſt requeſt to Heaven.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>chriſtian ſoldier</hi> affects not to derive any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the ſacking of towns, the deſolation of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or the ſhrieks of wounded and dying men. His humane heart ſighs at theſe ſcenes, and he would rejoice in an honorable opportunity for his ſword to ſleep for ever in its ſcabbard.</p>

            <p>HIS own private glory or emolument are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, in his view, to induce him to harbour a ſingle wiſh for war. He is reluctant at the thought of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſword, unleſs the liberty and ſafety of his country urge.</p>
            <p>BUT when theſe call him to the field, he cheerfully complies with the ſummons. He is willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or obey, as his duty and ſtation prompt.

            <p>THE ſoldier, therefore, who acts under the eye of his divine Commander, and is influenced by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of patriotiſm and fortitude, which the ſacred ſcriptures contain, will not fail to diſcharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his poſt. His exertions will be the reſult of firm unſhaken virtue, not of mechanical or mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principles. His country's good will be, in his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, the nobleſt reward of theſe exertions.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject will be cloſed with a few reflections, and an addreſs to the military gentlemen, at whoſe requeſt we are convened.</p>
            <p>How natural is it on ſuch an occaſion, to lament that depravity of human nature, which has rendered this globe a theatre of deſolation in every age, and neceſſitates the peaceful citizen to cultivate an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the uſe of arms, left he fall a prey to tyranny, ambition or avarice! How oft does the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022576_0013_0FB984CD4D9708D0"/>
mind turn abhorrent from the hiſtory of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while its pages appear ſtained with the blood of millions, and recount little more than a continued and awful ſucceſſion of wars and battles!</p>
            <p>
               <q>IT is agreed, ſays Mr. Rollin, that wars, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ſolely from views of intereſt or ambition, are real robberies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT an impartial ſpectator will generally perceive nations actuated by theſe views in their contentions. To enlarge the boundaries of an empire, already of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient extent for the maintenance of a peaceable and regular government—to gain ſome favorite point of honor, which, when gained, is but an empty name, or to reſent ſome affront, which is always more tolerable than the calamities of war, and which is often too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant to engage the ſerious attention of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; deſolation is commiſſioned to ſpread wide her ravages, and torrents of human blood muſt be delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſhed.</p>
            <p>How fallen, then, is man, ſelfiſh, deſtroying man, from his original perfection! "<hi>God made him upright,</hi>" and gave him the law of love for his guide. "<hi>But he hath ſought out many</hi>" wanton "<hi>inventions,</hi>" foreign to the purity and benevolence of religion.</p>
            <p>THE goſpel explicitly requires us<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. XII, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

but every man alſo on the things of others." How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant then is <hi>"the ſpirit, which is of the world" to "the ſpirit, which is of God!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE unbridled ſelfiſhneſs preſides in human councils, and nations confine their regards <hi>ſolely</hi> to themſelves, vain will be all human ſchemes, however benevolent in their orign, to baniſh war from our globe. A divine influence, powerfully impreſſed on the hearts of mankind, will alone effectually teach them genuine philanthropy, and induce them to live and love as brethren.</p>
            <p>How ſoothing then, how tranſporting the idea, to the humane, the chriſtian boſom, that the period ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly rolls on, when this influence, with concurring providential events, ſhall eſtabliſh the golden age of the world,—when "the nations ſhall not learn war any more"—when "Ephraim ſhall not envy Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim"—when "<hi>the righteous,</hi>" ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and their ſubjects, jointly under the influence of religion, "<hi>ſhall flouriſh, and abundance of peace, ſo long as the moon endureth.</hi>"</p>
            <p>BUT I haſten to cloſe the ſubject by a particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the worthy gentlemen, who compoſe the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary body before us.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>AT the requeſt of your ANCIENT AND HONORABLE SOCIETY, I have attempted to addreſs you on the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and objects of your profeſſion. A century and a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022576_0015_0FB984D10D948060"/>
half of years have revolved ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of your company by our brave and venerable anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The pureſt patriotiſm induced the meaſure of incorporating a ſociety of reſpectable citizens, who ſhould be viewed as the flower of the militia, and a ſchool for the diffuſion of military knowledge in New-England.</p>
            <p>To defend their country againſt the ravages of her enemies; to protect the civil and religious rights of the people, was their leading motive.</p>
            <p>THEY were too much under the influence of a juſt and benevolent religion, to indulge a wiſh for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to diſplay their ſkill and courage in the rough bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of war. But they believed it their duty, to uſe the beſt means in their power, for the protection of a country, in the ſettlement of which the providence of the <hi>Almighty</hi> had ſo viſibly interpoſed, and where they enjoyed thoſe immunities, that were dearer than life.</p>
            <p>UUINFLUENCED by ambition or injuſtice, and inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a zeal for the public good, they eſtabliſhed a military inſtitution, the beneficial effects of which might be felt in ſubſequent years, and ages.</p>
            <p>POSTERITY approved the plan, and the children have riſen up ſucceſſively in the room of their fathers, to proſecute it.</p>
            <p>THE faireſt names in New-England have graced your military rolls. Each ſucceeding generation has ſeen, in your number, men, inſpired with the pureſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022576_0016_0FB984D4CD07E830"/>
principles of philanthropy, men, who derived their courage from a ſincere confidence in the <hi>Lord of hoſts,</hi> and who eſteemed it their higheſt honor to approve themſelves "<hi>good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>" Each ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration has had occaſion to admire the pure republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm of your inſtitution, while officers of the firſt diſtinction have condeſcended to enter the ranks, and diſcharge the duties of a private centinel, to ſtamp a dignity on the ſtation of a <hi>patriot ſoldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH pleaſure we obſerve the preſent reſpectability of your company, and men of worth, in the various departments of life, uniting in the friendly diſcharge of the military office.</p>
            <p>YOUR appearance, on this anniverſary of your elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exhibits an agreeable epitome, and illuſtration of our text. The ſtate of your arms and diſcipline gives you an honorable reſemblance to the warlike and patriotic tribe, depicted by the ſacred hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>LIKE the military citizens of Zebulun, you profeſs to deſpiſe <hi>a double heart,</hi> to be actuated by the pureſt love of your country.</p>
            <p>WE rejoice to behold among you men, who "have jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field," whoſe courage, coolneſs, and diſcipline have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous on eminent occaſions, and who have contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed largely to the eſtabliſhment of our national military character, and the independence of the <hi>United States of America.</hi> Your company has diſcovered the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022576_0017_0FB984DA81885198"/>
attachment to thoſe tried worthies, who fought our battles, and by their valour and diſcipline, under God, have wrought out our political ſalvation. If theſe have been forgotten, <hi>after the hour of danger,</hi> by ſome, who once eyed, and invocated them as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours of the land, you have evidenced that you are <hi>not of double heart,</hi> by the fulleſt tokens of your eſteem and gratitude. While it muſt give you a generous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to teſtify your veneration, by adding ſome of their names to the bright catalogue of your leaders, they muſt be inſpired with the warmeſt affection for the ſociety: And your proficiency in diſcipline, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their eye, muſt reflect mutual honor, and ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>IT is a pleaſing circumſtance, that it is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to point you to the numerous worthies of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Rome, or to bring to your view the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing talents and virtues of a CAMILLUS, a CINCINNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS, a FABIUS, a REGULUS, the DECII, the SCIPIOS, and other eminent characters in your line. Your own hiſtory will furniſh you with heroes, who deſerve your imitation.</p>
            <p>EMULATE then the civil and religious virtues of your honorable fathers, who have trodden in the ſteps, in which you are called to follow them. Let <hi>your more noble, enlarged object</hi> ſtimulate you to preſerve, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the reſpectability, the uſefulneſs of a company, which was firſt inſtituted to defend a part of <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent territories of Britain,</hi> but is now invited and engaged to extend its aſſiſting arm in behalf of <hi>a riſing,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022576_0018_0FB984DFA217C880"/>
independent, and extenſive empire.</hi> But, while you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, with admiration, your valiant anceſtors, and the heroes, who have trodden the ſtage in the late war; while you ceaſe not to revere your exalted<note n="*" place="bottom">His Excellency <hi>John Hancock.</hi> Eſq.</note> 
               <hi>Commander in Chief,</hi> whoſe illuſtrious qualities, and engaging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent virtues, as a <hi>Patriot,</hi> a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and a <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> are too well known, to need a diſtinct enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—your boſom ſhould beat gratitude to that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> which has allowed you to contemplate the brighteſt military pattern, which, perhaps, was ever exhibited to human view. A WASHINGTON, like David of ancient days, has been placed by the unanimous voice of his country at the head of her <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>military</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Our General in war, is our Leader in peace.</p>
            <p>EAGERLY catch that military ſpirit, which ſired his early youth, and has not yet ceaſed to glow in his boſom. Ponder thoſe <hi>chriſtian virtues,</hi> which reflect the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſplendor on his character, and qualify him for that <hi>"crown of righteouſneſs," which alone can pay, and more than pay,</hi> the debt due from his country. Think of his piety and patriotiſm, which have been invariably combined with his exalted talents to bleſs it, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit an inſtructive example for the imitation of heroes in every nation and age.</p>
            <p>WHILE then, by your ſedulous improvements in diſcipline, you, with your other worthy brethren of the militia, teſtify your attention to his important obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: "The Militia of this country muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
