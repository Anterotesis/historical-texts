            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Vertuous and Honour'd FRIENDS the GENTLEWOMEN of <hi>Boſton,</hi> Who have deſir'd the Publiſhing of this SERMON.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I DESIRE</hi> thankfully to Acknowledge the <hi>Favour</hi> of GOD to Me, in the kind <hi>Acceptance</hi> which this plain &amp; faithful <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> has found with You; Praying Him to <hi>bleſs</hi> it indeed for much Spiritual and Everlaſting Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Your Selves and Others: that it may help to excite You unto, and aſſiſt you in ſuch an Exemplary holy <hi>Conduct,</hi> as may be your preſent Comfort &amp; Honour, and may end at laſt in Your Eternal Peace &amp; Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I MUST</hi> confeſs that the <hi>Singularity</hi> and <hi>Nicety</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> as well as its <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> gave me no little fears and <hi>Check</hi> in determining my Tho'ts there-unto; but I now the more readily Publiſh them, becauſe Treatiſes of this Nature ſeem <hi>wanting</hi> among us.</p>

               <hi>IT</hi> is a good Sign to ſee People pleas'd with the particular Direction of the Word to themſelves, either in way of Doctrine, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, Excitation or Warning: it gives Hopes that they will ſet themſelves to <hi>Practice,</hi> which is the Crown and End of <hi>Hearing.</hi> Yet neither is it always thus; Practice does not alwayes follow Conviction &amp; Delight; As the <hi>Prophet</hi> was to <hi>Iſrael, a very lovely Song of One that had a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Voice, and cou'd play well on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; they ſhow'd much love, they heard his Words, but they did 'em not.</hi> It is the Practice of theſe Truths that muſt Adorn &amp; Save You, render you Amiable and Heavenly, like the <hi>Kings Dau'ter, all Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious within.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> muſt be confeſs'd to the Great Honour, of Your <hi>SEX,</hi> that more of the Life &amp; Power of Religion is with You, than with <hi>Us.</hi> When I have ſometimes contemplated this, I have tho't that as it may be partly owing, under the Soverain Pleaſure &amp; Election of GOD, to a natural <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> of Spirit &amp; Your <hi>Retiredneſs</hi> from the Cares &amp; Snares of the World; ſo more eſpecially to Your <hi>Multiplied Sorrows,</hi> the Curſe pronounc'd upon our firſt Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> turn'd into the greateſt Bleſſing to Your Souls. Your frequent Returns in Your own Apprehenſion towards the <hi>Gates of Death,</hi>

by which We all receive our <hi>Life,</hi> ſuitably lead You to a returning ſerious Tho'tfulneſs for your Souls and of Your Spiritual State; and that in a more ſedate calm manner, &amp; with longer Continuance, (for divers Months together) and ſo with better Effect ordinarily, than Fits of Sickneſs are wont to have upon us; which do more ſurpriſe, &amp; terrify for the time, but are uſually ſoon over and their Impreſſions vaniſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A PECULIAR</hi> Regard is due to You, and indeed ever had, in the <hi>Labours</hi> of Your <hi>Paſtors;</hi> among which I bring my <hi>Offering;</hi> for my <hi>Ability</hi> where-unto I freely confeſs my Self <hi>Indebted,</hi> after the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> to the Wiſe Conduct, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, and Religious Diſcourſes, which with no little Admiration I have obſerv'd ſometimes Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to divers of our <hi>Gracious Mothers.</hi> So that I here return You but <hi>Your Own,</hi> what ſome of Your Selves have ſupply'd me with, and taught me. 'Tis a Pleaſant way of <hi>Learning,</hi> and thus Good People do often Inſtruct their <hi>Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I AM</hi> Senſible of the <hi>Advantage</hi> which the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> receives, from Your Reverence to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that <hi>Excellent PERSON,</hi> Whoſe Death is the ſad Occaſion of it. The <hi>Town</hi> juſtly Mourns the Awful, Sudden &amp; repeated Breaches made in that <hi>Honourable Family:</hi> While at the ſame time, It is comforted in its Expectations from the <hi>Surviving BRANCHES,</hi> and in the Diſpoſal which Providence has made of <hi>the Eſtate</hi> into ſuch Hands, from Whom the <hi>Publick</hi> Promiſes it Self ſo good a Uſe of it.</p>

               <p n="1">I. What is that Chriſtian Behaviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on <hi>Us all,</hi> &amp; becoming Holineſs?</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Why are <hi>They</hi> Eminently obliged to ſuch Behaviour?</p>
               <p n="1">I. WHAT <hi>is that Chriſtian Behaviour in General which becometh Holineſs?</hi> It is a <hi>Law</hi> to us all, Phil. i. 27. <hi>Only let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel is the Rule of Holineſs to us, in the holy Doctrines, Laws, Examples, and Motives of it. From theſe we may eaſily gather what the Behaviour is that becometh Holineſs.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be ſuch as <hi>becomes the Holy Doctrines</hi> of Chriſtianity: the Being and Holineſs of GOD; the nature of Sin, the Redemption from it, the Mediation of CHRIST, the Covenant of Grace, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, the Eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now what kind of Behaviour do theſe Doctrines imply to be pleaſing to

GOD, honourary to Him, and neceſſary to our being for Ever bleſſed in Him? <hi>Truth</hi> like the Light, is both to Irradiate and Purify: 1 Pet. i. 22. <hi>Ye have Purifyed your ſouls in Obeying the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, Our Behaviour muſt be ſuch as the <hi>Holy Laws</hi> of the Goſpel do require. What is written there? <hi>how readeſt thou?</hi> So live and <hi>do;</hi> and thy Behaviour will be as becometh Holineſs.</p>
               <p>SO likewiſe, if it becomes the holy and <hi>glorious Example,</hi> which our <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> has given us in his bleſſed Life. For here-unto are we called, to walk even as He walked, to be as He was in the World, to follow His Steps, who was Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>MOREOVER, Our Behaviour muſt be ſuch as becomes the bleſſed <hi>Promiſes</hi> and holy <hi>Motives</hi> of the Goſpel: the glorious <hi>Hopes</hi> which it wou'd beget us to: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Influence whereof is <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor vii. 1. 2 Pet i. 4. 1 Joh iii 3.</note> to put us upon Purifying our ſelves as GOD is Pure; to

               <p>TO conclude, Our Behaviour muſt be ſuch as becomes the <hi>fair Profeſſion</hi> which we make, the <hi>Vows</hi> that we are bro't under, the <hi>Means</hi> and long <hi>Day</hi> of Grace which we enjoy. We muſt adorn our Profeſſion, and walk worthy of the Vocation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are called, and conſider what manner of Perſons we ought to be, in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs under our peculiar Advantages &amp; Bonds.<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus ii. 10.

               <p>THIS is the Behaviour that we profeſs, and which Chriſtianity calls for and binds unto, as the <hi>genuine fruit</hi> of Internal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the only ſufficient <hi>Teſt</hi> of it. By theſe holy Doctrines, Laws and Motives; by this Profeſſion, bond and means of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, we muſt order our ſelves; Our looks, words, actions, garb, deportment; our friendſhips, viſits, diſcourſes and relative

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. MORE particularly let us Enquire, <hi>What is the Behaviour becoming Holineſs in Chriſtian Women?</hi> There is that which is peculiarly obliging, decent and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to them. As <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> the publick judgment of Nature and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo alſo the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and commend to them, an Eminence in Modeſty, reſerve, purity, temperance, humility, truth, meekneſs, patience, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, affability, charity, goodneſs, mercy, compaſſion: Diſcretion, prudence, Piety and Devotion, guarding, influencing, and ſhining brightly forth in all.</p>
               <p>IT is Your <hi>great Honour,</hi> that more is expected in your Behaviour, of all that is <hi>nicely</hi> Vertuous and Exemplary. How do we <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> You by expecting of You, that whatſoever things are honeſt &amp; juſt, pure and lovely, of good report and praiſe,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001497_0018_0FB383094EAFB460"/>
that you do excel in all theſe things!</p>
               <p>THE things that do not become Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or that are contrary there-unto, are doubly diſhonourable &amp; guilty in You, by the Eſtimation of the World: for <hi>Inſtance,</hi> Lightneſs in Behaviour, ſenſual luſts, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and impurity, boldneſs and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Look, Word or Geſture; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, profaneneſs, malice, railing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How <hi>Odious</hi> are theſe things juſtly held in <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men!</hi> More <hi>Scandalous,</hi> tho' not more <hi>Guilt</hi> before GOD, than in <hi>Men!</hi> Save as there may be the greater <hi>Rape</hi> committed on the Conſcience of <hi>Decency,</hi> and the Reluctance of native <hi>Shame;</hi> ſtrengthned by a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Education,</hi> and the Admonitions of the <hi>Holy Word.</hi>

Her Children riſe up and call her Bleſſed, her Husband alſo &amp; he praiſeth her. Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own Works praiſe her in the Gates.</q>

               </p>
               <p>I ANSWER, 1. All that has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid is to be ſuppoſed in <hi>Them</hi> in a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior degree,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>Examples &amp; Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns,</hi> teaching and <hi>living Rules,</hi> ſhining in all Gravity, Wiſdom &amp; Heavenlineſs; that their Preſence &amp; Words may always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Veneration, Awe &amp; reſpectful Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their <hi>Juniors,</hi> and powerfully commend the Wayes of Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to them.</p>

I will hope continually, &amp; will yet Praiſe thee more &amp; more. My Mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy Righteouſneſs, and thy Salvation all the day: for I know not the Numbers thereof.

               </p>
               <p>I ANSWER, 1. <hi>Becauſe Improvement &amp; Excellence may well be expected in Age.</hi> The Aged have had time for Growth, &amp; a <hi>long</hi> day of Grace under <hi>Means</hi> &amp; Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Suffer me alſo to ſuppoſe of them, that they were wro't upon in their Younger dayes by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD, and that they are grown Old in the Service of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> More has been <hi>done</hi> for them than for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, more <hi>Pains</hi> taken with them, more have been their <hi>Opportunities;</hi> and in ſome proportion now more ſhou'd be the ripe fruits of Holineſs brought forth by 'em, <hi>meet for the Hand</hi> that has ſo long manur'd, dreſs'd &amp; tender'd them.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. BECAUSE <hi>of the Influence of Their Example.</hi> They give a <hi>Judgment for Vice</hi> or Vanity upon Experience, if they are vicious, light or frothy. Younger People are apt eno' to learn Evil of 'em, and they invite them to do ſo. <hi>Children</hi> are very
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001497_0036_0FB383285E28D340"/>
                  <hi>nice Obſervers</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> which their <hi>Parents</hi> &amp; <hi>Superiors</hi> give themſelves, and prone to <hi>Imitate:</hi> Eſpecially from the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of thoſe whom they <hi>reverence</hi> as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Vertue &amp; Religion, to take a <hi>Licence,</hi> and juſtify themſelves therein. For, would ſo grave &amp; gracious &amp; ſtrict a <hi>Perſon</hi> do ſo, ſay <hi>they,</hi> if there were any Evil in it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Temptations of the World are paſt with the Aged,</hi> &amp; therefore Holy Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may be expected more eſpecially of <hi>them.</hi> Shall they Sin on <hi>Stupidly</hi> without Temptation? and <hi>dream</hi> on in the wayes of Sin &amp; Senſe without <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> without <hi>Taſt,</hi> and <hi>deſire failing?</hi> The World can no longer flatter them with its Promiſes &amp; <hi>Proſpects</hi> of Pleaſures, Profits &amp; <hi>Glories,</hi> as when they were Younger. Their blood is chill'd in their <hi>Veins,</hi> their <hi>Senſes</hi> &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes decay'd. <hi>Can I diſcern between</hi> (Senſitive) <hi>good &amp; evil?</hi> ſaid Aged <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillai, Can thy Servant taſt what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the Voice of Singing men and Singing women?</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. AND <hi>laſtly, Elder</hi> People ſhould Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently <hi>&amp;c. Becauſe it is the way to arm themſelves againſt the Diſadvantages &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Age, &amp; the natural Fears of Death.</hi>

and Inevitable decayes. It carries People above <hi>Expectations</hi> from this World, and raiſes 'em in the deſires and <hi>Hopes</hi> of a better. It Enables them to reſign any further <hi>Pretenſions</hi> here below, and with a <hi>Nobleneſs</hi> of Soul to leave theſe Inferior things to Others.

               </p>
               <p>LET us <hi>retain</hi> in Mind their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and <hi>bury</hi> their Infirmities; not taking our Judgment of them from their <hi>preſent Decayes,</hi> but their <hi>paſt Uſe</hi> and Services, and their abiding growing Devotion.</p>
               <p>LET us <hi>Pray</hi> for them, how much ſoever our Superiors in Gifts and Graces; and return <hi>their cries</hi> to Heaven for us, in humble Requeſts for their final <hi>Perſeverance.</hi> Let us deſire and ask the <hi>Continuance</hi> of ſuch <hi>ancient Bleſſings.</hi> Let the World ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be weary of theſe <hi>Monuments</hi> of the Preſence of GOD in it, and His <hi>Image</hi> continued on it.

Generations to come, <hi>Joſhuas</hi> and <hi>Calebs</hi> in future times, to ſit in <hi>Moſes Seat,</hi> and <hi>Shine</hi> in his Grace.

               <p>FINALLY, When GOD <hi>takes away His Aged Saints, let thoſe that Survive weep for themſelves in their Death.</hi> Tho' they die in a <hi>good Old Age,</hi> and as <hi>Corn full ripe</hi> are gather'd into the <hi>Garner;</hi> yet our <hi>Loſs</hi> is great in their Infinite <hi>Gain:</hi> the loſs of their Example, and Faith, and Prayers.
