            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All this not withstanding, <hi>some</hi> Times are more corrupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dark and miserable than can be said of all; Nor did <hi>Solomon</hi> ever say or think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. As Nebuchadnezzar's Image had a golden head, and iron feet, so there are <hi>golden</hi> and <hi>iron</hi> Ages. Albeit golden times are a coming, when <hi>Jerusalem shall be</hi> holy, <hi>&amp; strangers pass through her no more;</hi> when David shall be Prince for ever: yet are we <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> in an <hi>iron</hi> age; the Divine Oracle having told us that <hi>in the last days</hi> perilous <hi>times shall come;</hi> Yea the <hi>dreggs</hi> of those times are now at hand.

The present aspect of Providence is dismal on more accounts than one; especially in that God hath been <hi>removing the Pillars</hi> of this Generation, even <hi>those</hi> that have <hi>stood in the Gap,</hi> and would have done much towards keeping out a <hi>Deluge</hi> of overflowing Judgements. It is not eleven years since <hi>Mitchel</hi> dyed (not to speak of others whom this Generation lost at that time, for one such stroke seldome goes alone) and all New-England shook when that Pillar fell to the ground. <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still</hi>: Of late, He that holds the stars in his right hand hath caused some of our <hi>brightest Lights to set;</hi> and is not that a sign of darkness to follow? Such Rebukes of God make the Pillars of <hi>Heaven</hi> to tremble. And what shall we say, when the Lord is threatning to dry up that <hi>Fountain,</hi> whose <hi>streames have made glad the City of God</hi>! Poor <hi>New-England!</hi> Shall the day come when there will be none to guide thee, of all the sons thou hast brought forth? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Lord will not as yet wholly cast off a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that are the Posterity of his <hi>faithful Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> that forsook <hi>all</hi> for <hi>Christ,</hi> and that they might leave their <hi>Children</hi> under the Blessed wings of the Lord Jesus. Nevertheless, how low he may bring this Generation, and how long it shall <hi>continue,</hi> who can say? Only it is like to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til men shall say, <hi>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>

Several Arguments are made use of to back this Charge; one is in these words, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the benefit which would attend a <hi>sincere seeking</hi> the Lord. <hi>If thou seek him, he will be found of thee</hi>; that is to say, thou shalt then be made happy in the enjoyment of God for ever. If <hi>others</hi> seek God in sincerity of heart, they shall find him, but (saith David) it is eminently true concerning <hi>thee,</hi> because the Lord hath been thy Fathers God. Thou art a Child of a Father that had a special inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in God, and therefore if thou set thy self to seek him, know for thy encouragement, that he will be most ready to shew himself favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thee. Wherefore the Doctrine which may at present be insisted on from the words, is,</p>
                  <p>DOCT. That <hi>The Children of godly parents are under peculiar Advantages &amp; Encouragements to seek the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap>ing of this Doctrine, 2 Things may be attended. 1. To enquire what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this <hi>Seeking the Lord</hi> which the Text speaketh of, 2. How it does appear that the Children of godly parents are under peculiar Advantages and Encouragements so to doe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000393_0008_0FA5A80BB9160380"/>QUEST. 1. <hi>What is Implyed in this</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Lord</hi>?</p>
                  <p>ANSW. 1. <hi>It doth imply that men by nature are such as have lost God.</hi> The sinner hath lost himself, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.32. <hi>this thy brother was</hi> lost, <hi>and is found.</hi> Yea, and he hath lost God too, He is wandred from his Fathers house. Hence the Apostle said to the <hi>Ephesians, they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world.</hi> Yea, it is true concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children of godly parents as well as others <hi>Ephs.</hi> 2.3. <hi>we</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Children of wrath even as others.</hi> We that are Jews and descended of holy Ancestors, we that are now converted, and made A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles of Christ, by nature were Subjects of the wrath and righteous displeasure of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not but that some of the Children of godly men have Grace wrought in them whilest in a state of Infancy, as <hi>John Baptist</hi> was filled with the Holy Ghost from his mothers womb, but they do not derive that grace from their parents, and therefore it is not natural, but supernatural, when any of the Children of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men are made gracious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Seeking the Lord doth imply a sense of this lost condition.</hi> Sense of want puts men upon <hi>seeking.</hi> The Prodigal was hunger-bitten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would seek to be reconciled to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he saw that he was fain to live upon husks, and that there was no way but he
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000393_0009_0FA5A80C73C43E38"/>
must perish with hunger, except he sought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father for a supply, he would do so. If a man hath lost a thing, except he know that he hath lost it, he will not seek after it. Hence in the Parable concerning the lost peice of silver, it is said, <hi>what woman if she lose a peice of silver, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till shee find it, Luk.</hi> 15.8. So that there must be sense of Loss before there will be seeking or finding. Nor will men seek the Lord except they be by his Spirit made sensible, that they have lost his favour, and are through sin and the Fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miserable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This seeking doth imply earnest desire to find God.</hi> That which a man seeketh after he would be glad to find. When Job fought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Communion with God, he maketh enquiry, <hi>where shall I find him?</hi> Chapt. 23.3. No one will seek after that which is not an object of his desires, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I desired, that will I seek after.</hi> If thou seek him, that is to say, if thou earnestly desire to find the Lord, then so it shall be. If God be the chief Object of thy desires, if the desire of thy soul be towards the remembrance of his Name, then he will be found of thee. As it was with David himself, <hi>Psa.</hi> 63.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I seek thee; my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in a dry and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000393_0010_0FA5A80E95682210"/>
thirsty Land where no water is.</hi> How are the desires and affections of a thirsty man carried out after water, in a thirsty Land where no water is? When the desires of the soul are in like manner carried out after God, that is seeking him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Seeking the Lord does imply Diligence in the use of meanes in order to obtaining the favour of God.</hi> The end implyes the meanes which is necessary in order to obtaining that end, now the favour of God is the end of this seeking. Hence 'tis called a seeking his face, <hi>i. e.</hi> his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.4 <hi>Seek the Lord's face.</hi> and the meanes in order to obtaining that end is Repentance of former sins, Faith in the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5.) walking according to the holy Rules of the Word of God, which is therefore called <hi>a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all well pleasing before the Lord,</hi> Inasmuch as so to walk is the way to find the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Divine Favour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Seeking the Lord doth imply the worship and service of God.</hi> As they that do not worship God are said to be such as seek him not, <hi>Isai.</hi> 65.1. <hi>I am found of them that sought me not,</hi> meaning that the Gentiles who in former times did not own and worship the true God, should be brought to the knowledge of him. So to seek God is to worship him, 2. Chron. 11..16.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000393_0011_0FA5A81021F61B68"/>
It is said, <hi>that such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel</hi> i. e. to worship him, <hi>came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> It is true, that in special that great duty of prayer (which is a special part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship) is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>nded, yet not that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; all other parts of Divine Worship are comprehended under this expression, Hence it is in the Context noted by that of <hi>serving the Lord.</hi> Now to Serve GOD is to worship him aright. <hi>We</hi> (said they in Ezra) <hi>are the servants of the God of Heaven,</hi> meaning that they did worship none else but him, so that a Servant of the Lord is the same with a worshiper of him. This <hi>seeking</hi> is here set in in opposition to <hi>forsaking</hi> God. Now Forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath a special respect to that sin of Idolatry and false Worship. David was a man that was very faithful to God in the matters of his worship: As for Idols he would not so much as name them <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.4. And we read in the Sacred history of David, that when he had subdued his Enemies, he burnt their Images and Idols, in an holy indignation at the sin of Idolatry: Now he doth exhort his son Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to follow his Father's steps, in being Loyal to God in the matters of his worship. All these particulars may be intended here. <hi>If thou seek the Lord</hi> h. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. if thou art sensible of thy left estate by nature, so as to desire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God in the first place, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000393_0012_0FA5A8111B258DF0"/>
dost therefore repent of Sin and believe in Christ, and continuest to worship and serve God according to his own will, then be assured that thou shalt enjoy his favour, and be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly blessed.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the second thing propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz.</p>
                  <p>QUEST. 2. <hi>How doth it appear that the children of godly parents are under peculiar Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and Encouragements to seek the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ANSW. 1. <hi>In that the vein of Election do run through the loyns of godly Parents for the most part?</hi> Tho it be not wholly and only so, that Elect Parents have none but elect Children, or that elect children are alwaies born of elect Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <note n="[a]" place="bottom">

                     </hi> line of election so, as that generally elect Children are cast upon elect Parents. <hi>John</hi> directs one of his Epistles, To the elect Lady and her Children, whom he also found walking in the Truth: Not only the Mother but the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren did belong to God. As usually so it is, that if the Mother be elect, at least wise some of the Children are so too. There are many Scriptures which do intimate this Truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.8. <hi>He hath remembred his Covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi> Intimating both that the longer a ge-Generation
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000393_0013_0FA5A812A50A0E40"/>
does continue godly, the more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will the Lord be to the seed and posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, &amp; that there are some that in a continued succession for many generations the Lord hath chosen, Hence <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.17. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto childrens Children.</hi> Shewing that God from Eternity hath designed mercy to some Parents and to their children, and their Childrens Children, <hi>Isa..</hi> 59. ult. <hi>My Spirit which is upon thee, and any words which I have put into thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the Lord, from hence forth and for ever.</hi> To the same purpose is that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.25. What more plain can be spoken, to shew that God doth many times cast elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon elect Parents in a continued successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from generation to generation? See also <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.22, 23. <hi>Mine Elect and their</hi> off-spring <hi>with them are the blessed of the Lord.</hi> So that when Parents are Elect, usually their Children are so too. Hence it was said to Zacheus, <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is come to thy house,</hi> Luk. 19.9. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Soul but to his <hi>house.</hi> Usually if God intends to save a man, there are some of his house <hi>i. e.</hi> posterity that are heirs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation also. And therefore the Apostle said to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000393_0014_0FA5A81339E0D560"/>
his Children should be saved? was it from any special Revelation concerning those Children more than with respect unto others? no; but he knew that when God brought the Father into a state of Salvation, he was wont to save however <hi>some</hi> of his Children and Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erity. Hence also Paul said to Timothy, <hi>when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith in thee, which dwelt first in thy Grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am perswaded in thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</hi> 2. Tim. 1.5. he doth probably &amp; hopefully conclude that Timothy did belong to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the son of a godly mother and Grand-mother. Moreover, Experience and observation does confirm this Truth, that <hi>de facto</hi> it hath been so. For the Elect are not found in all places alike, but in some Nations more than in others, and that for many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations successively. And in some Families more than in others: There are some Families in the world, that God hath designed to shew peculiar mercy to them, from generation to generation. And if an account should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning all the godly men that are now alive in the world, doubtless it would be found that the greatest part of them are sprung from godly Parents. Though there may be many converted ones in the world, whose Parents did not fear God; yet for the Generality of true believers they are such as have descended from believing Parents.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:000393_0015_0FA5A81435474458"/>2. <hi>The Lord hath established his Covenant not only with Parents, but with Children also.</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.</hi> The Saints in all Ages are concerned in Abrahams Covenant, under which Children are Comprehended. To say that the Covenant was extended to Children under the Old Testament, but not under the New, is to lessen the Grace of God in these dayes of the Gospel. Yea then the Jews would have been great losers by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Christ: If they could have said, in former times our Children were interested in the gracious Covenant of God, but if we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Gospel they shall have no part in the Lord, this would have been such an objection against believing as could never have have bin answered. Wherefore, we shall find that those Scriptures which relate to Gospel times, expresly declare, That not only Believers themselves, but their Children also are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Lords gracious Covenant with his People. <hi>Isai.</hi> 61.8.9. <hi>I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant with them and their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their Off-spring among the People; all that see them shall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.</hi> And Chapt. 65, ver. 23, <hi>They are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their off-spring
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000393_0016_0FA5A814C08AFE08"/>
with them.</hi> Now this Consideration is a great encouragement to seek the Lord; So it was to them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. <hi>We come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> We are thy Covenant-people, and that does encourage us to come unto thee. And this did encourage David to seek and hope for the Lords Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ps.</hi> 86.16. <hi>Save the son of thine handmaid.</hi> And the Apostle did encourage the Jews to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and return unto the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>viz.</hi> in that they were <hi>the childr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n of the covenant</hi> Act. 3.19, 25. From thence it is Evident that the Children of godly Parents stand in a peculiar relation unto God, and that therefore he will not cast them off, except there be great cause for it: Not surely as long as they seek him, and desire to return to him and serve him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There are special promises belonging to such Children.</hi> Not only the Covenant in general which is, as it were, a <hi>Constellation</hi> of glorious Promises, but there are peculiar Promises made concerning them.

In another place, David speaking concerning the Children of God's servants, and that in the dayes of the Messiah, saith <hi>A seed shall serve him, it</hi> shall be <hi>accounted to the Lord for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Psa. 22.30. intimating that the Lord will uphold among the Children of his people a certain number that shall be owned as a race of Gods Children. And therefore we have a Promise of converting grace to be bestowed on such children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed.</hi> There is a promise <hi>for</hi> grace as well as <hi>to</hi> grace, as to those that belong to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Grace. Circumcision of heart im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth Regeneration, which is promised to the Lords servants with respect unto their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; And that was one reason why the Lord did of old appoint Circumcision to be applyed to the Children of his people, that so this promise of converting Grace in due time to be vouchsafed, might be sealed. The same thing is promised <hi>Isai.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine off-spring.</hi> And the Lord hath made a blessed promise of salvation to such children, <hi>Isai.</hi> 49.25. <hi>I will save thy Children.</hi> Hence it is. promised that <hi>the seed of the Lords servants shall inherit Sion</hi> Psa. 69.36. Which word is made good in these dayes of the Gospel, by giving Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Children of believers as their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Inheritance. Now albeit these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promises
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000393_0018_0FA5A817C65692E8"/>
do not absolutely respect all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of every godly man, only the elect among them, yet they are generally and indefinitely propounded; and that is encouragement as to Parents to pray for their children, yea for all of them, as it was to David 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 17, 3 last ver. <hi>O my God, thou hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house, therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee. And now Lord, thou art that God that hast promised this goodness to thy servant; now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it please thee to bless the house</hi> (i. e. the Family and posterity) <hi>of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever; for thou blessest O Lord and it shall be blessed for ever.</hi> So it is a wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful encouragement to the Children of holy men to seek unto the Lord for grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for themselves: The Child of a godly man may come before the Lord, and say Lord thou hast promised to bestow Grace, and give eternal blessings unto those that are the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of such as fear thy Name, my Father, my Mother thou knowest did fear thy Name, why then may not that promise belong to me?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The children of godly parents are the subjects of much faithful prayer.</hi> David prayed earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his son Solomon, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.19. &amp; 22.16.

As Isaac said of Jacob <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.33. <hi>I have blessed him and he shall be blessed</hi>; so a godly parent can sometimes say, such a child of mine, Christ hath blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed for ever.

Timothy was Intimate with Paul and therefore doubtless knew more of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way of walking and Communion with God, than was known or imagined by the world; so do children observe more of their Parents holy Course of life than others do, which is no small advantage. A Child is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Father's Zeal, Faith, Patience; he seeth that his Father is conscientious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and much in prayer to God. Now what an advantage is this? He needs not goe farr to see how he ought to walk and please God, for he seeth it before his eyes every day, by the Example and Coppy his Father sets before him. Moreover, it is a great encouragement unto the Child of a godly Parent, when he can think and say, my Father did serve God, and the Lord accepted of him, therefore if he serve God he will accept of me. My Father did repent and believe and walk in the way of holiness, God blessed him &amp; his family; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therefore

It is true, that if a Child do unfeignedly repent and turn to God, though his parents should have been never so wicked, God will accept of him; The repenting son shall not be damned meerly for his Father's iniquity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.14. But it is more rare for such Children ever to repent; and if they do not repent, they shall be punished for their Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's sins as well as for their own, because they justifie them by doing like them. How many Examples are there Recorded in the Scripture of God's punishing Children with their Parents and because of their Sin? So Achan's Children, and Dathan's and Abiram's; yea, Millions of Children that were drowned
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000393_0023_0FA5A81B9BCC7098"/>
and damned with their cursed parents in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's Flood; and when Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed, not only the parents but the Children perished, and now suffer together the vengeance of eternal fire; and was not an express Charge given Concerning the little ones of the Amalekites, Midianites &amp;c. that they should be destroyed with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Thus doth the Lord recompence the iniquity of the fathers into the bosome of their Children.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>We find in the Scripture that the Children of holy men have bin encouraged from this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, That they were so related to such as had a special interest in God.</hi> — So Jacob, Gen. 31.5. <hi>The God of my Father hath been with me.</hi> and ver. 42. <hi>except the God of my Father and Fear of Isaac had been with me,</hi> and Chapt. 32.9. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac.</hi> He was greatly encouraged in looking up to God from that very Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the Lord was the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and God of his Grand-Father. So Moses <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.</hi> and David Psa. 116.16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy Servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid:</hi> Inasmuch as his mother was a precious godly woman, he was encouraged to plead his Interest in God. So Solomon, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.15. <hi>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with

our Fathers, let him not leave us nor forsake us.</hi> Inasmuch as the Lord was their fathers God, Solomon and the Lords people with him had their hearts drawn forth to hope that he would be their God also, so as never to forsake them. And Daniel's heart was enlarged in giving praises to God, since he could say, <hi>I thank thee O thou God of my Fathers who hast given me wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Dan. 2.23.</p>
                  <p>These things then make it evident that such children are under peculiar encouragement to seek the Lord.</p>

To be under the wing of the covenant tho but as to the external dispensation of it is it self a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. To have the meanes of Grace vouchsafed, (which is ever wont to follow upon a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-interest in God) is mercy: Wherefore the Apostle having propounded that question, <hi>What advantage hath the Jew above the Gentile?</hi> maketh Answer, <hi>much every way, chiefly in that to them are committed the Oracles of God.</hi> Rom. 3.2.

It was good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for his everlasting benefit and advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Nor are the children of godly men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this benefit, Psal. 34.11. <hi>Come you child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren hearken to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi> It is a great mercy to be taught and principled in the fear of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: to be told of the evil of sin, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite danger of dying in a natural, unconverted estate, the necessity of obtaining an interest in Christ, and to be directed in the right way to salvation. Also to be the subjects of much pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is great mercy; It's mentioned concerning <hi>Solomon</hi> as a special Favour God would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.15. <hi>Prayer shall be made for him continually.</hi> Thus concerning the

children of the Lords people, the publique prayers of the Church reach them; and their godly parents are dayly praying for them; so that prayer is made for them continually. Moreover such children experience outward blessings and preservations for their parents sake. It is said concerning him that feareth God, <hi>his children shall find a place of Refuge</hi> Pro. 14.26. And the Lord said to Abraham con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ishmael <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.13. <hi>I will make a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him because he is thy seed.</hi> And God spared Solomon for his father Davids sake, — 1. <hi>King.</hi> 11.34. And as for Jehoram, all his children were destroyed save one, and that one had been cut off too, had it not been for the respect which the Lord did bear to his blessed fore-Father 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.19. Yea, &amp; such children have a greater blessing with that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state which God in his Providence shall see meet to cast upon them, than the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of wicked men usually have, tho' it may be they have not so much of the world as some others, yet since what they have was gotten in a way of righteousness, a Blessing cometh along with it. For this cause David saith, <hi>a little that a righteous man hath is better than the Riches of many wicked.</hi> Psal. 37.16.</p>
                  <p>Use. 2. <hi>Hence we ought to nourish hope concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such children, &amp; that above what can be said with respect to the Children of other parents.</hi> But some one may object &amp; say, Have not good men

bad Children? Godly men ungodly Children? How then is there Ground of Hope with respect unto such Children in Peculiarwise?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is sadly true; the Most High to shew the soveraignty of his Grace, sometimes chooseth some of the Children of a wicked parent, and refuseth some of those who are the off-spring of godly parents; Also to shew that it is not in the power of men to give grace, no not in the power of godly men, so much as to their own Children; sometimes such children prove very unlike unto their godly parents. It was therefore said to Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, <hi>thy sons do not walk in thy wayes,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like was he to his blessed Father <hi>Josiah</hi>? It is noted concerning Josiah, that when the word of God was read to him, he rent his clothes, humbled himself, and was afraid of the Lords holy displeasure; but <hi>Jehoiakim after three or four leaves were read, he took his pen-knife, and cut the Roll in peices, and burnt it in the fire, he was not afraid nor rent his Clothes,</hi> Jer. 36.23, 24. Yet this is further to be added and considered that when the Children of good men are unlike their parents in grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness it proceeds not from any unfaithfulness in the blessed God as to his Covenant with such parents, or with their children. for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Usually it is some evil in such parents (though otherwise godly) which the Lord
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000393_0028_0FA5A81F5EB363E8"/>
doth punish in their Children; either they were not so diligent in teaching and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as they ought to be; If we must judge all those parents ungodly whose Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are miserably instructed I am certain that many amongst us who have a name to live, &amp; would be thought to have the root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them, will be found among the ungodly: Or parents are sinfully indulgent towards their Children; so was Eli, indeed he instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, told them of the evil of those waies they walked in, and exhorted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form but he corrected and restrained them not: Isaac was too indulgent towards his profane Esau; So was David towards Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, that afterwards proved a Rebel, rising up in armes against his own Father: And he did sinfully indulge Adonijah, the Scripture takes notice of it, that <hi>his father had not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased him at any time, in saying why hast thou done so?</hi> 1. King. 1.6. No wonder he came to such an unhappy End, for usually such children are first or last a shame to the father that begat them, and bitterness to the mother that bare them. Or it may be parents do not pray and believe for their Children as they ought to doe; God in this case sometimes faith unto parents, according to your faith be it done unto you: If you pray much, &amp; believe much for your children, you shall obtain much Mercy from the Lord for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. <hi>ult.</hi>

In some godly families all the children thereof are made partakers of converting saving grace: So in Jacobs Family; there is reason to believe that his twelve sons did repent before they died and they are now in Heaven, considering that they were Types of the Elect of God, and their names were written upon the breast of the High Priest, when he entered into the Holy of Holies. So concerning Job's children, the Scripture saith, that after the death of his Children and the loss of his estate, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before, yet he had but ten Children after that, which was the number he had before, wherefore Interpreters probably conclude that his other Children were not lost; they might all goe to Heaven notwithstanding the sad and sudden death which befel them. And Experience confirms the truth of this, we see that in some Families God is pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow converting Grace upon all the children therein, especially if their parents be very much in prayer to God for them. I remember I once heard an holy praying man say, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had six children, and they are all either with Christ, or in Christ; and he hath given me six children, three of them are already with Christ, and the other (I bless his name) are in Christ. And I have read of one <note n="[c]" place="bottom">

much Communion with God, that once said to an intimate friend, I <hi>have this day obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God, not only for my self, but also for all mine,</hi> and evident signs of regenerating grace did afterwards appear in all his Children.</p>

It's commonly seen that as for wicked parents, though they have many children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are all ungodly, like their Parents; but it is seldom known that if a godly man hath many Children that they all prove wicked; first or last God converteth some of them. If their be an Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in Abraham's Family, there is also an Isaac: if there be an Esau in Isaac's Family, there is also a <hi>Jacob:</hi> If there be an Absalom in Davids Family, there is also a Solomon; nor ought we to doubt but that Nathan and many more of David's children are now in Heaven, albeit three of them perished.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Lord cast off the Immediate seed he remembers his Covenant to others that are more remote: Esau was hated, yet it is conceived by learned men that Job and his godly friends were of Isaacs posterity by Esau. <hi>Samuels</hi> son <hi>Joel</hi> was not like his father but his grand-child <hi>Heman</hi> was an excellent Prophet, like his blessed Grand-father; yea,

and many of Samuel's great grand-children were faithful Ministers in the House of God, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.3. and 25.5, 6. The Lord has sometimes cast off a few generations, &amp; yet at last remembers his Covenant made with blessed Ancestors, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If you that were our parents had discharged your duty towards us, we might have been in the JOYES OF HEAVEN, but now our damned souls must live for ever in these everlasting flames; Thus wilt thou hear thine own Children yelling in thine Ears, world without end. Canst thou think of this and thy heart not break? then thy heart is an Adamant, and thy heart strings made of Iron sinews.</p>
                  <p>USE. 4. Of Exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let godly Parents that are here before

the Lord this day, suffer the word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Do you endeavour to the utmost of your power, that your Children may become seekers and servants of the only true God in Jesus Christ.</hi> And indeed when you present them to the Lord in Baptism, you promise to do your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most that they may become faithful servants of that God who is Father, Son, and Spirit; take heed that you do not become guilty of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating that engagement. God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted children unto you, that so you might bring them up for him, <hi>The children which thou hast born unto me,</hi> Ezek. 16.20. If a man had the Children of a Prince or great man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Care and Charge for Education, would he not be careful about that matter? It is a solemn thing, which it may be you have not duly considered, that the great God has entrusted you with those that are his Children that so you may nurse them up for him: O then bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. It is not enough for Parents to serve the Lord themselves, but they must use utmost endeavours that after they are dead, their children may walk in the waves of God. And if they be duly careful in that matter, they have reason to expect that God will remember &amp; establish his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with their Children. For is it noted concerning Abraham, that his care was that his Family <hi>after him,</hi> (viz. after he should
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000393_0036_0FA5A82913BB48E8"/>
cease to be in the world) <hi>might keep the way of the Lord,</hi> and so did the Lord bring upon him the thing which he had spoken and graciously promised with respect to Abrahams posterity. And in special you that are mothers have a great advantage put into your hands to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling <note n="[f]" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See Mr. Firmin's Real Christian. pag.</hi> 8.</note> good principles into your child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens souls betimes. Solomon's mother taught him: We do not read that Absalom's and Adonijah's mother taught them, as Bathsheba did her son Solomon. And it is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that when children have proved thus or so, particular notice is taken in Scripture, that such or such were their mothers: Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam did not prove well, and it is noted that his mother was an Ammonitess. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, Hezekiah, Jehoshaphat, Josiah were eminent Servants of God, and the Scripture does mention who were their mothers. O then you that are mothers should endeavour that your children (as <hi>Luther</hi> speaketh) may suck in Religion from their mothers Breasts.</p>
                  <p>And let all godly parents <hi>earnestly seek unto the Lord for their poor children.</hi> You ought to doe so dayly and particularly, and by name before the Lord, and thus should you doe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day: As we read concerning <hi>Job,</hi> that he off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered burnt Offerings for his children <hi>according
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000393_0037_0FA5A829AB7EB460"/>
to the</hi> number <hi>of them all, thus did Job continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> Chapt 1.5. Remember that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der peculiar encouragement so to doe: if the Children of godly Parents have special encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to seek the Lord, then the same thing must needs be true concerning Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with respect to their children: And it is eminently true with respect to the Children of <hi>New-England,</hi> inasmuch as they are the posterity of such as have been sufferers on the account of the Name and Truth of the Lord Jesus. Are not such Parents pronounced bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice over? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12. even bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themselves, and in their posterity? Who knoweth but God may remember the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Fathers in these Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>) unto their Children after them? Plead it with the Lord; if you that be godly Parents lay up a stock of prayers for your children, it may stand them in more stead than if you should leave them never such an Inheritance as to the things of the world; when you are dead your prayers shall live. There is many a Child whose Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is now in Heaven, that fareth the better and will do so for ever, on the account of prayers made for him by his blessed Parents while they were in this world. And this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let me say for your encouragement, that if the Lord stir up your hearts to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>importunate

That famous Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of <hi>Dedham</hi> would sometimes say, <hi>If I see a Child that hath either a godly father or a godly mother, I shall have hope for him a long time, but if he hath a godly father and mother too, I'le ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave hoping for him until I see him turn'd off the Gallows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me direct my Exhortation to the Children of godly parents: There are many such that hear me this day:</p>
                  <p>Be you exhorted to know, and serve, and seek the God of your Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Consider therefore,</p>

the God of thy Father saith David. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. <hi>Forsake not thy fathers friend.</hi> And wilt thou forsake thy Fathers <hi>God,</hi> who is the best friend that ever thy Father had? Children are loth to part with other things, because they were their Fathers; As Naboth said concerning his Vineyard, <hi>God forbid that I should part with the Inheritance of my</hi> Father, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.3. The Lord was the Inheritance of thy <hi>Father,</hi> and wilt thou let goe thine Interest in <hi>Him</hi> Remember and consider that Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. <hi>The Lord is my</hi> Father's <hi>God, and I will exalt him.</hi> So say thou, the Lord is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers God, and therefore I will fear and seek and serve him.</p>

Joh. 4. Nor is there any greater Joy to a godly Father than to see truth of grace in his children; this comforts him more than to see that his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are become rich or great in the world, know also for your encouragement that, if you seek the Lord with your whole heart, He will

be found of you, yea, tho your sins and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations have been never so great. Was there ever a greater sinner than Manasseh, the son of blessed Hezekiah, <hi>yet when he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him, he was entreated of him,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13.

Yea, and God will bless you when your parents shall be taken from you, he will then be a Father to you, Psal. 27.10. <hi>When my father and my mother forsake me, the Lord will take me up.</hi> viz. as a tender-hearted Father takes his child up into his armes and beareth him in his bosome. It is therefore said concerning the just man that <hi>his Children are blessed after him, Prov.</hi> 20.7. And Jacob told his sons that tho' he died, God would be with them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.11. It is also noted concerning Isaac, that <hi>God blessed him after the death of his Father Abraham, Gen.</hi> 25.11. Not but that the Lord blessed him before that, only after his Fathers death the blessing of the Lord was upon him more then ever.</p>

The Father of a Fool hath no Joy. Alas! there is many a poor parent may say to their children as <hi>Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah</hi> upon another account spake to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.35. <hi>He rent his clothes, and said Alas my daughter. thou hast brought me very low, thou art one of them that trouble me.</hi> Why should you bring your parents down with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to their graves?

Heart of David when Absalom died and was cut off in his sins! 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>He was much moved, and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom: would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son.</hi> As if he had said, Had I died <hi>my</hi> soul had been happy, but now <hi>thou</hi> art dead, I have no other hope but that thy soul is suffering the vengeance of Eternal fire. Remember that this will aggravate your sin and condemnation That you were born of godly parents and you did not walk in their steps. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.7. <hi>They sinned against the hope of their fathers</hi>; it is mentioned as the great aggravation of their sin. Such children roll reproach upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, they cause men to say, there is nothing in being in Covenant with God, nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it any mercy to be born of parents that fear the Lord; And will not the Lord judge you for causing such a vile Reproach to be cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his holy Covenant? you will be most inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseable before the Lord another day. If a righteous man beget a son that becometh a Robber, or an Adulterer, shall he live? he shall not live but die, and his bloud shall be upon him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.10, 13. The blood of thy soul shall be upon thine own head: All the Instructions, Exhortations, Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Prayers, Examples of thy godly Parents, will be brought in as so many witnesses for thy Condemnation at the last day: yea, the

Remember Dives; in Hell he lift up his eyes being in torments, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Father Abraham have mercy on me,</hi> but all the mercy his Father Abraham would shew to him was, <hi>Son, Remember that in thy life time thou hadst thy good things</hi>; As if he had said, nay, thou art justly dealt with. So will thy parents say to thee, Remember that in thy life time we instructed thee, and thou hadst good Counsel given to thee many a time, but thou wouldst not regard it.

                  <p>Something let me speak by way of Direction: briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Be thankful to the Lord in that he hath given you to be born of godly parents</hi>: in that you
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000393_0047_0FA5A8366E7C6400"/>
have bin (as David speaketh) cast upon the Lord from the <hi>womb,</hi> &amp; he hath been your God from your mothers belly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.10. You might have been born of such Parents as would have nursed you up in ignorance, Profaness or Idolatry, and so your souls have been under a necessity of perishing for ever; but the Lord hath given you to be born of parents that have designed you for God, and for his Glory. Yea it was for your sakes especially, that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ventured their lives upon the rude waves of the vast Ocean. Was it not with respect unto Posterity that our Fathers came into this Wilderness, that they might train up a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for Christ? Bless God that ever you had such Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Plead the Lord's gracious Covenant with him,</hi> He is very willing that you should do so: <hi>Ask me concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me,</hi> Isai. 45.11. You say you cannot give grace to your own souls: True, But hath not the Lord in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace said <hi>I will give you a new heart</hi> Ezek. 36.26. Plead that promise, you espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that have had the Covenant sealed to you; why should you let your Baptism lye by you as if it were of no use? Go to God in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and say, Lord thou hast promised to give a new heart to the Children of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and thy Covenant hath been sealed

to me in my Baptism, Oh give me a new Heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Do not rest in any thing that is external:</hi> Not in your relation to godly parents, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible relation to God on that account; it is not your parents seeking unto God will save you, except you seek Him your selves also. Did not the Lord say to the children of Israel, <hi>Are ye not as the Children of Aethiopians unto me?</hi> Amos. 9.7. They vainly trusted that no Destruction should ever come upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were descended from blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors: You may be as far from eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as the Children of Ethiopians for all that, if you do not serve the God of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Therefore John Baptist said, <hi>Think not to say, We have Abraham to our father,</hi> Mat. 3.9. I have known some that have been so foolish as to think they should be saved, only because they were the Children of godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they lived in the neglect of God, and of their own souls.

                  <p>THe Title-Page prefixed to this Discourse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth the Time and Occasion of its delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I had no cause to (nor did I) expect that it would fall to my Lot to speak, before the Choice was made; if I had I would have used means to prevent that trouble from coming upon my self or <hi>others.</hi> But it may be God did it to prove me and see whether I would please men or Christ. And I hope I may (in some measure) say after the Apostle, <hi>We are bold in our God to speak. Our Exhortation was not of Deceit, but even so we speak not as pleasing</hi> men <hi>but</hi> God, <hi>which tryeth our hearts. For neither at any time used we flattering words, nor of men sought we glory.</hi> That great Reformer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when upon his Death-bed, could say with comfort, That <hi>I did forbear none of what Condition so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I did it out of the fear of my God, who hath placed me in the Function of his</hi> Ministry, <hi>and I know will bring me to an account.</hi> Even so I must confess, the awful sense of the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which the Lord put into my hands to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my Conscience, in being witness to His Name and Truth, and of the account which I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know I must give to Him, caused me to speak as I did. (And to avoid more controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal discourses) There is indeed one particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, which is now become a matter of Scruple
<pb facs="unknown:000393_0052_0FA5A83D2C5895B8"/>
and distast to some amongst us, <hi>viz.</hi> that which concerns the <hi>Magistrates power in matters of Religion.</hi> But as it was by me either intended or expressed, I know not to this hour why any one should be offended at it. I may better speak in this cause than some others, as having my self had experience what it is to have Conscience imposed on, and therefore would be loth that any truly conscientious should be burdened; and it is sufficiently known that I have a greater latitude and <hi>Indulgence</hi> in the point of <hi>Toleration,</hi> than many better than my self have. Nevertheless I judge it most unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>pretended Liberty of Conscience</hi> should be an <hi>Asylum</hi> for the profanest errors to take Sanctuary in: As though men must therefore have Liberty to profane <hi>Sabbaths</hi> or <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or set up an <hi>Altar</hi> against the Lord's <hi>Altar</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their <hi>Threshold</hi> by his <hi>Threshold,</hi> &amp; their <hi>Posts</hi> by his <hi>Posts,</hi> when and where they please: It cannot be but the <hi>Lord</hi> will be provoked at such things, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>New-England</hi> where men are not under such temptations to forsake their <hi>Assembling</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together, as in some other places: And where <hi>Zeal</hi> on the other hand hath been notorious, so that such <hi>Lukewarmness</hi> will in a People cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstanced as we are, be an evidence of <hi>Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy.</hi>

                  <p>I remember I had once the Happiness to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with an eminent Divine in another part of the world, who having an opportunity to give his Testimony against a prevailing Evil which the

greatest in that Nation were at that time too far carried away with, in his Sermon had this expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>What I have to say, if it were in a Church full of Kings I would speak it.</hi> Such a spirit I believe doth become an Embassadour of Christ, when delivering the message of his <hi>Master Jesus.</hi> I shall therefore add no more at present, only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So in this Chapter we have Davids Solemn Dying Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: words which deserve to be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet are no where else seen (at least wise not in that ample mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>) but in this Chapter. And it was in a very solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly that these words were spoken, indeed in a <hi>General Assembly,</hi> when all the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both as to Civil and Ecclesiastical order were come together for the Establishment of another Ruler amongst them; accordingly David doth here direct his Exhortation, first to the representatives of the people, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>And David assembled all the Princes of Israel, the Princes of the Tribes, and the Captains of the Companies unto themselves &amp;c.</hi> Hence they are said to be all Israel, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>in the sight of all Israel h. e.</hi> the Heads and Representatives of all Israel, and therefore are said to be <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord.</hi> Often in Scripture by the <hi>Congregation,</hi> the Heads and Rulers of the Congregations are meant.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k to know more of the mind of God. The motive whereby he urgeth this is, because the Lord had promised the good Land to them; but it was upon that condition of their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commandments, therefore it did highly concern them to be careful in that matter.
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:000393_0056_0FA5A8412C5BBE50"/>
2<hi>dly,</hi> he directs his Exhortation to him that was to be estabished as chief Ruler, <hi>scil.</hi> to his son Solomon, whom God appointed to succeed his Father in the Government: Now Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the main thing which David his Father did exhort him unto, in the beginning of this verse, <hi>And thou Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind.</hi> This is further urged from three motives,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Consideration of the divine Omnisciency, <hi>For the Lord searcheth the hearts &amp; understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the benefit and good which would follow upon seeking to the Lord, <hi>if thou seek him he will be found of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the evil that is in forsaking him; In the words now before us; which though they were spoken to Solomon, yet were they of equal Concernment unto others, being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstanced as he was, <hi>h. e.</hi> that were of the younger succeeding generation, being also the Children and posterity of godly Parents. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the words did and do concern those that are the <hi>Posterity of David,</hi> that is to say, of those that have bin eminent Servants of God in their Generation. The Doctrine which I would therefore (by the help of Christ) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on as Conceiving that it may not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unsutable for this great Audience, is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="unknown:000393_0057_0FA5A841DCDD3C88"/>Doct. <hi>That if they who are the Children and Posterity of God's eminent Servants shall forsake the Lord, he will cast them of for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the doctrinal handling of this Truth, there are four things which may be briefly enquired into. 1. When men, especially the Children of Gods servants, may be said to forsake him. 2. What is implyed in this casting off for ever? 3. What forsaking of God that is, which will be attended with such Casting off. 4. The Reason of this dreadful Procedure of the Most High towards the Posterity of His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 1. <hi>When may men be said to forsake the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. 1. <hi>When they depart from the blessed Truths of God,</hi> then <hi>they may be said to forsake him.</hi> Hence the Apostle chargeth it upon the apostatizing Galatians that they were <hi>removed from him that called them</hi> Chap. 1.6. <hi>h. e.</hi> they had forsaken God himself, because they had corrupted and forsaken the great Truths of the Gospel. All Truth is from God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is styled <hi>the God of Truth,</hi> Did. 32.4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Truth, it self,</hi> 1. Joh. 5.6. And Truth is said to be his Name. Christ said to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones in the Church of Pergamus, <hi>thou hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>st my Name.</hi> Rev. 2.13. The Truths of Christ were much opposed by the Infidels,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000393_0058_0FA5A8429D6B5F40"/>
and by the Hereticks of those dayes, only some did faithfully adhere thereunto; and these are said to hold fast his Name. so then to forsake the Truth, is to forsake the Lord's Name. Especially when there is Apostacy from great foundation-Truths in Religion, the Lord is forsaken. Albeit every truth hath the Name of God stamped upon it, yet there are some Truths which have more of his Name on them than others have, that the disowning of them is absolutely to reject the Lord, namely Fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amental Truths, which indeed are not many nor hard to be known. Moreover when those Truths are disowned by children, which their Fathers were eminently engaged in the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of, (tho' they should not be fundamental as in their natures) such Children may be said to forsake the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>When men Deifie any other Object besides the Lord.</hi> They that set up other things in God's stead, in their so doing forsake the Lord; so it is when men give religious worship to any other besides him, who <hi>alone</hi> ought to be feared. Thus the children of Israel because they did worship <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Ashtoroth,</hi> h. e. the <note n="[b]" place="bottom">

And the Apostacy of the Children of Israel did Consist partly in this, as we see in that woful instance of the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> the greatest part of whom the Lord cast off for ever. Yea, and the Antichristian Apostacy predicted in the New Testament doth consist partly in this: We know that the Antichrist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Generation (Papists I mean are generally not only (as all of them are) horribly super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and idolatrous, but of most debauched &amp; profane consciences &amp; conversations: In the <hi>Revelations</hi> were ad of their Murthers, Sorceries, Fornications, Thefts, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 9.21.

                  <p>We proceed therefore to the second Quest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, Viz.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What is imply'd in this</hi> Casting off for ever?</p>
                  <p>Answ. 1. <hi>It Implyeth a Change as to divine Dispensations.</hi> In the Scripture, when the Lord threatned to cast off his people, that is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>viz.</hi> that he would make an alteration as to the tenour of his Dispensations towards them: here it is set in opposition to <hi>finding God,</hi> if thou seek him, he will be <hi>found</hi> of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off: Now <hi>finding</hi> God doth Imply the enjoyment of his favour, and therefore in <hi>casting off</hi> is implyed the Deprivement of the Lords favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. It is indeed most true, that the special <hi>favour</hi> of God is unchangeable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>This
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000393_0064_0FA5A849243E7140"/>
Grace wherein we stand.</hi> He that hath once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess into the special grace and favour of God, stands and abideth therein for ever, in respect of that there is no casting off for ever: In the Covenant of grace the Lord hath promised say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I will not cast of the seed of Israel for all that they have done, Jer.</hi> 31.37. But then there is common favour, in respect of outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, which are the effects of common love, and that may utterly cease <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.15. <hi>I will love them no more.</hi> I have loved them, (faith the Lord, <hi>h. e.</hi> bestowed outward mercies on them, but I will do so no more. They shall have no more such dayes of peace, no more such plenty, no more such means of grace as once they did enjoy. Thus of a freind, the Lord may turn to be an enemy, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63.10. <hi>Put they Rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.</hi> Whilst a Covenant people carry it so as not to break Covenant, the Lord bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them visibly, but if they degenerate, then blessings are removed, and woful Judgements come in their room, and that's implyed in this <hi>Casting off</hi> which the Text speakes of, <hi>scil.</hi> that mercyes shall be taken away: As it was said of Saul that when God cast him off, he took away his mercy from him, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.13. because he was deprived of that great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blessing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Dignity which once he did enjoy.

                     <hi>What Forsaking of God is that, that will be attended with this Casting off?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. In two words, 1. <hi>This must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood concerning deep departures from God,</hi> and from his blessed waies, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.9. <hi>They have</hi> deeply <hi>corrupted themselves, therefore he will visit their sins.</hi> The Lord is the God of Patience, and of all grace, and thence is very slow in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting utterly a people (or their posterity) whom he hath once taken into Covenant with himself: Hence it is not lesser Departures, but high and great Offences against the Lord that provoke him to cast off his people, <hi>E. G. Idolatry</hi> is a sin that causeth the Rejection
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000393_0070_0FA5A84E6D1828B0"/>
which the text speaks of. Yea, it is true with reference unto that Idolatry which is against the Second Commandement: When the Children of Israel committed that Idolatry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the Calf in the Wilderness, they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against the Second Commandment, for they would worship the Lord still, only they would do it in such a way and by such meanes as God never appointed, and they were in great danger of being cast off for this sin. Hence the Lord said to Moses, <hi>Thy People have corrupted them selves,</hi> Exodus 32.7. The Lord doth not say <hi>my</hi> people as he was wont to do, but <hi>thy</hi> people, as if it were said; Now they have violated my Covenant, and deserve that I should for ever disown and reject them. The Asian Churches have been cast off for this sin especially; we may read the sin of those Churches written in dreadful Characters, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Forehead of that Judgment that hath destroy'd them all: God has let loose the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Turks upon them, who hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy no men so much as those that worship Images. And as for the Church of Rome, the Apostle Paul did solemnly predict that they should be cast off <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22. Now it is for this sin principally that the Lord hath cast them off.

                  <p>Wherefore Consider. 1. <hi>What Fathers and Predecessours have been,</hi> they were such as did seek the Lord.

As one of our Worthies has aptly expressed, God sifted three Nations, that so he might bring over choice Grain into this Wilderness. Let us then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what New-England hath been: It

Our Fathers have been <hi>Davids,</hi> that is to say, <hi>eminent Reformers.</hi> Let me speak freely (without offence to any) there never was a generation that did so perfectly shake off the dust of Babylon, both as to Ecclesiastical and Civil Constitution, as the first Generation of Christians that came into this Land for the Gospels sake.

                  <p>Consider, 2. <hi>How subject men are, yea the Children of blessed parents and Predecessours, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatize from God.</hi> It is possible that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>David</hi> may forsake the Lord, and that in a short time too: when Predecessors have been eminent for God, their Successours have been most degenerate, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I planted thee wholly a right seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me!</hi> Isai. 1.21. <hi>How is the faithful City become an Harlot! it</hi> was <hi>full of Judgement, Righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.</hi> It was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times said unto good Samuel, <hi>Thy sons walk not in thy waies.</hi> And it is noted Concerning <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> (a drunken Sot) that he was of the house of <hi>Caleb,</hi> 1.

The Ephraimites were the vilest Idolaters of all the apostate Children of Israel, yet they were the posterity of Joseph, the best of Jacobs twelve sons. The Perfidious and ingrateful Ziphites were also the posterity of that blessed <hi>Caleb</hi> but now mentioned. Yea, it is a sad Truth that Religion has seldome been upheld in the power of it, for above one or two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations together. Therefore it is recorded concerning the Children of Israel, <hi>they turned</hi> quickly <hi>out of the way which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Commandments of the Lord, but

they did not so,</hi> Judges 2.17.

And if we look into the Scripture and view the Story of former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, we shall see this to be true. The poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Lords Servants, the Children of the Church have in a little time so forsaken him, as that solemn Reformation has been necessary: Look beyond the Flood and we shall see it so. One of Adam's children with all his numerous posterity forsook the Lord: Cain was Excommunicate out of the Church and became the Father of an Excommunicate Race and Generation. The first Church that ever was in the world, even that in Adam's Family continued in some measure pure, about the space of <note n="[k]" place="bottom">

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:000393_0083_0FA5A85A7659B240"/>
the world grew numerous, and a multitude of sinners caused impunity in sin, so as that they that were godly and conscientious were fain in the very beginning or first Ages and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world to seperate themselves and become distinct Societies. Hence is that <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. <hi>then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> It noteth a Separation of the Church from the profane world.

                  <p>I remember it is noted concerning the learned <hi>Chytraeus,</hi> that he prevailed with the Princes of <hi>Megapol</hi> to bestow 3500 Crowns of yearly Revenue upon the University of <hi>Rostoch,</hi> by which means the interest of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was wonderfully promoved: And it was one of the usual wishes of that Excellent man, <hi>Vtinam Reges ac Potentes rerum Domini, majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Ecclesiae ac Scholarum curam susciperent.</hi> O (said he) that Magistrates would be more careful to encourage Schools of Learning, and thereby promote the good of the Church.

And that excellent Prince <hi>Cassimire</hi> did the like at <hi>Neostad,</hi> where <hi>Vrsin</hi> and <hi>Zanchi</hi> were sometimes professors. So the Senate of <hi>Grun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> erected a Colledge and chose the learned <hi>Bucholtzer</hi> to govern it.

Wherefore let what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this matter, be among the chief of your Cares and Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>Further, I entreat you let it be your Care, that none but faithful ones (as far as men can judge) be employed as Publick Preachers: Though the just Liberty of Churches should not be infringed; yet that every Plantation in the Countrey should have Allowance to choose whom they please to labour in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Dispensation of the Word, may be in time a great Inlet to ignorance, error &amp; profaness. Therefore let me humbly propound to you that you would think of some Expedient, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Approbation of such; as shall be under; a constant improvement as Publick Teachers Yea, and that there be not any Place settled

without such. No doubt but one reason why the Lord hath let loose the Heathen against us hath been, because some Plantations have been erected and yet no publique acknowledgement of God amongst them, but they have lived like <hi>Heathen,</hi> without Sabbaths, without the Word and prayer, which are moral duties that all are bound to attend: and it is therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the Magistrates to see that they do so. People are ready to run wild into the woods again and to be as Heathenish as ever, if you do not prevent it. Take care also I beseech you for the propagation of the Gospel amongst these poor Indians: You know it is expressed in the <hi>Patent,</hi> as one main end proposed by our Fathers in their coming into this Wilderness, that so they might endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Conversion of the Natives, and set up the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus among them. God by the late warr hath made way for the Gospel to be entertained amongst them, more than formerly; should not this be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered?</p>

Idolatries: and that sin of his was the reason why the Lord stirred up Adversaries against him. Do we not find that all the godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Magistrates, spoken of in Scripture, thought it their Concern to pull down false worship, as well as to set up the true Worship of God. It is a most vain objection which some have made, That we do not read in the New Testament, that the Magistrate did ever punish any, on account of transgression against the <hi>first Table</hi>: No more (saith <hi>Calvin</hi>) do we read in the New Testament that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate did ever punish men for murder, or other Crimes, does it therefore follow that he ought not so to doe? But therein it is said that they ought to punish all evil doers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.

                  <p>Moreover, sinful Toleration is an evil of exceeding dangerous consequence: Men of Corrupt minds though they may plead for Toleration, and Cry up Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp;c. yet if once they should become nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and get power into their hands, none would persecute more than they: So the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi>

The <hi>Time</hi> or Season, when this Duty ought to be attended is expressed. viz. <hi>now, in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> not that they that are past the dayes of their youth may forget God, or be exempted from this Remembrance of him, but <hi>young</hi> men are under special <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> and Advantages to remember Him.</p>

                  <p>In the Doctrinal prosecution of this Truth, there are three things to be enquired into, 1. What is implied in this Remembring. 2. How it doth appear that young men ought to remember God. 3. The Reason Why <hi>they</hi> especially should do so.</p>

                     <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.</hi> If men are bound to serve God with their strength, then they must not forget him until those dayes are come wherein their strentgh is gone, and they able to do him little service.

                  <p n="3">3. Young men as well as others owe service unto God; He is their Creator as the Text expresseth.

                  <p>REAS. I. Because Youth is the fittest season to remember God in: Wherefore it is added in the Context, <hi>before the evil dayes come, when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them.</hi> Old Age is an evil Time: And therefore (saith the <hi>Wise man</hi>) thou must remember and serve God in thy <hi>good</hi> dayes, if thou wouldest have him to remember and accept of thee in thy evil dayes: if thou neglectest God in the <hi>Spring</hi> of thy years, what reason is there to think that he will regard thee when <hi>Winter</hi>-Age is come upon thee? Moreover it is not easie to turn unto the Lord in old age: A young Plant is more easily pluck'd up than an old Tree; So are young men with less Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty transplanted and plucked up out of the Soyl of Nature. than they that are grown old in the wayes of Sin.

                  <p>Mot. 1. <hi>Consider what special Reason they that are of the younger rising generation in</hi> New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>have to remember their Creator.</hi> Now there
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:000393_0147_0FA5B7FBD6F95130"/>
is cause for it more than ever, in that there are so few that doe so. Multitudes of young men are risen up in this Land, who have been forgetting God all their dayes; unto whom the Lord may say as <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. <hi>This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyest not my voice.</hi> And as it was said concerning them of old <hi>the Children of Israel, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth</hi> Jer. 32.30. It is true, there are some young ones that are remembring and turning to the Lord, which ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to the praise of his glorious grace, yet it must be said with Lamentation, that the generality of the youth in this Land, walk in waies of Loosness, Profaness, Pride, Drinking, Gaming, or in a careless neglect of God, and of their own souls. Hence the Lord doth not seem to take pleasure in many of the youth of this Countrey O it is a sad word that is spoken Isai. 9.17. <hi>The Lord shall have no Joy in their young men.</hi> How many young men even in <hi>New-England</hi> that have been cut off either by Sword or Sickness within these two years! Now, shall the Lord have cause to complain as he doth by the Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 4.10.) <hi>Your young men have I slain with the Sword yet have you not returnd unto me.</hi> Moreover, young men in this Countrey enjoy means of Grace plentifully dispensed, God is calling from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, and striving with them in the

And we find in Scripture how the Lord blessed little children when they came to him, or were brought to him <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>They brought young children to him — and when Jesus saw it — he said, suffer little children to come unto me and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them not, — and he took them up in his armes and blessed them.</hi> You young Ones hearken, would you have the Son of God to bless you?

Now &amp; then <hi>one</hi> is converted in old age but such examples are exceeding rare especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it is true with respect unto those that have in the dayes of their youth lived under the meanes of grace, heard many Sermons; experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced frequent strivings of the Spirit of God with their hearts: if they remain unconverted until the daies of their youth are past &amp; gone, the Lord usually giveth them up to judicial hardness of heart that they shall never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, never saved. Young men think sadly of it in the fear of God.</p>

So for breaches of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandment, they are <hi>youthful Lusts</hi>: Wherefore <hi>Solomon</hi> saith that he looked out of the Window of his house, &amp; discerned among the youths a young man void of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Understanding,

and he was going to an Whore house like an Ox to the slaughter, or a fool to the correction of the Stocks, not knowing that it is for his life, nor considering that her house is the way to Hell, going down to the Chambers of Death, <hi>Prov,</hi> 7.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Young men whose natures are not changed by the regenerating grace of the Spirit of God, do usually live in some unclean lust or other. Either Fornication, or self-pollution or in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wanton pranks of darkness. You young men whose consciences accuse you of guilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in respect of these evils, I charge you in the name of God, that you hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your selves deeply in his sight for past Transgressions, and sin no more as ever you desire to escape eternal Damnation, Though these cursed lusts may be as dear to you as life and limbs, yet better to <hi>pluck out the right eye,</hi> to <hi>cut off the right hand, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell fire, where the worm dyeth not and where the fire never shall be quenched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Sabbath-breaking</hi> is a sin which Young ones are often found guilty of before the Lord. There was a <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Thomas Savage, who was executed at Ratcliffe-Cross Octob.</hi> 28. 1668.</note> young man (whom many of you have heard of) that came to an untimely end, and the sin of Sabbath-breaking made way to his ruin: when he should have been hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000393_0156_0FA5B802CFB25750"/>
the word on the Lords day, he would rather go to wicked Houses, that at last God was so provoked with him, as to leave him to commit a capital sin, upon the Sabbath day, for which he was brought to deserved executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when in prison he said to some that came to visit him, <hi>O wretch that I was, I studied how I might spend the Lords day in the Devil's work: that time which I should have served God in, I did most for Satan in it. O</hi> (said he) <hi>tell young men from me, that the breaking of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is a dangerous and costly sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore young men beware of that sin. <hi>Remember the Sabbath to keek it holy,</hi> or you will never remember your Creator as you ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Once more, Sinful <hi>Company-keeping</hi> is an evil that young men are apt to be drawn away from God their Creator by. Many an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful young man, that hath been well, instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that hath had great Convictions upon his Spirit, and friends that wished him well have been comforted in him; yet hath afterwards fallen in with bad company, &amp; that has prov'd the eternal ruin of his soul. I have known young men that upon sick-beds and death-beds, have made lamentable cries <hi>O my sinful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany-keeping hath undone me for ever!</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let young men remember what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh to them, <hi>My son, if sinners entice thee consent thou not. Walk not thou in the way
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000393_0157_0FA5B803631D1320"/>
of them, refrain thy foot from their path,</hi> Prov. 1.10, 15. Again, <hi>He that walketh with the wise shall be wise, but a Companion of fools shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed</hi> Chapt. 13.20. Young man, would'st thou not be destroyed? then be not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Fools. Remember also what Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid saith, and follow his Example, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.4, 5, — 9. <hi>I have not sate with vain persons. I have hated y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregation of evil doers &amp; will not sit with the wicked. Gather not my soul with sinners.</hi> When thou diest, thou wouldest not have thy soul to be gathered to the place where sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners must be forever; then sit not with them, hold not Familiarity with them now: for they that are thy Companions and thy Familiars here, are like to be so to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hearken to good Instruction.</hi> In the holy Scriptures God himself instructs you, and therefore let young ones be diligent in reading the Scripture, that is the way to become like unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> to whom it was said, <hi>From a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation, through the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</hi> 2. Tim. 3.15. And when David had propounded that Quest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way</hi>? The Answer given is, <hi>by taking heed thereto according to thy word,</hi> Psal. 119.9. For the most part it is so that the wayes of young men need cleansing. Youth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the unclean part of a mans Age, but
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000393_0158_0FA5B80543496288"/>
those young men that will make conscience to order their wayes &amp; walkings according to the Word of God, shall thereby be cleansed. And the Word preached and publickly dispensed, is a meanes appointed by the Lord for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of young ones that they may learn the fear of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.12, 13. <hi>Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and that their Children which have not known any thing may learn to know the Lord.</hi> And therefore mind seriously what the Ministers of God speak in his name. Mind it young men, lest you mourn at last and say <hi>How have I hated instruction, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor enclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</hi> Yea; and hearken to the good instructions which you receive from those whom God hath set over you. Have you not Masters, Fathers, Mothers, that admonish you, &amp; give you good counsel from day to day? despise them not. Doth not the Scripture say to you, <hi>Hear ye children the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of a Father.</hi> Prov. 4.1. And again, <hi>My son hear the Instruction of thy Father, and forsake not the Law of thy mother.</hi> Chapt. 1.18. Eternal woe is like to be the portion of those Children, that regard not what Father and Mother say to them. Remember Eli's sons, they were proud and head-strong; their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reproved them and exhorted them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amend
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:000393_0159_0FA5B8084C20C450"/>
their wayes, it is said, <hi>notwithstanding they hearkned not to the voice of their Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord would slay them,</hi> 1. Sam. 2.25. Art thou the young man that wilt not obey the voice of thy Father when he giveth thee good counsel? this is a sign that the Lord will <hi>slay thee</hi>: a sad sign that thou art appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for some terrible destruction at the last.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Remember those things, which if duly thought on, may cause you to remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth.</hi> e. g. Think sadly of the Preciousness of Time, that so you may pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. You Young men, are exeeding apt to mispend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hours, nay dayes in sin and vanity, but it is because you do not consider how precious time is. Are not some that were once your companions in sin, dead, &amp; (as there is cause to fear) dropp'd down into hell? they would give worlds (were it in their power) to enjoy that precious time that is lost, and can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained. Shortly your time to remember your Creator in will be past and gone for ever. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member also the worth of your own souls, <hi>What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi> If he gain the whole world and lose his own soul, what is he profited? Young men and children do you think of this? as young as you are you have immortal souls that must either be saved or damned, that when once you are dead, your souls must go to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>either
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:000393_0160_0FA5B8090525FE40"/>
in Heaven or Hell to all eternity. And <hi>REMEMBER DEATH</hi> which may be upon you ere you be aware of it. Thou knowst not but that this night thy soul may be taken from thee. It hath been truly said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>An old man hath death before his face, but a young man hath death behind his back,</hi> that may overtake him before he thinks of any such thing. Children may dye as well as others, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. <hi>I will kill her children with death.</hi> I remember, I have somewhere read of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious godly Child, that would not speak vain words, like other children, but was careful to improve his time well, and being asked the reason of his Seriousness, <hi>O</hi> (saith he) <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I must dye</hi>: When some replied to him, You are Young, and may live many a fair day, what should <hi>you</hi> think of death for? <hi>Nay</hi> (said he) <hi>I was in the Burying-place, and there I saw a grave that was shorter than I am.</hi> So Children, look into the <hi>Burying-place,</hi> and there you will see Graves that are shorter than you are: there you will see that those that have been as young as you are, and younger too have dyed and bin put into their graves, and therefore it may be so with you. O then Remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth. And remember the day of Judgement. As Solomon in this Context saith, <hi>Know, O

young man, that God will bring thee to Judgment.</hi> Young men are apt to put the Thoughts of Death and Judgment far away, and therefore they remember not their Creator. Think with thy self, I must stand before Jesus Christ the Son of God at the great day, and what shall I then say to him? and what will the Lord in that Day say unto me? will he say, <hi>Come thou blessed,</hi> or will he not say to me, <hi>Goe thou cursed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Look unto Jesus Christ.</hi> O betake your selves to Him. He calls from Heaven unto you young men and Children, that are before the Lord this day, go to <hi>Him</hi> by Prayer, and to <hi>God</hi> by Him. Some of you, when you are ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Question, <hi>Do you pray</hi>? Answer, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray</hi>: You would do it, you say, but you know not how to pray. Why, get into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place, and there lift up thine eyes and heart to the Lord Jesus, and if thou canst say nothing else, yet say, <hi>O thou Son of God have Mercy on me! O convert me and save my poor Soul!</hi> who knoweth but the Lord from on high may look upon thee, since the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus himself hath said, <hi>They that seek me early shall find me.</hi>

                  <p>EMinent Blessings do not use to be poured down upon the world, except the <hi>Church of God</hi> be first stirred up to <hi>pray</hi> for them. The Lord who is stiled <hi>Shomeang Tephillah,</hi> the <hi>Hearer of Prayer,</hi> delights to give mercy in this way. And it was never known since the world began, that the Spirit of prayer was awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Hearts of those that can cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> but some grace and blessed effect did in due time follow: <hi>He said not to the seed of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, seek ye me in vain.</hi> O that God would bow the heart of <hi>New-England,</hi> even of all his Saints in these Churches, as one man, to cry might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily to Heaven, that his Spirit may be poured on the now <hi>risen</hi> (a multitude of sinful men that are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen up in their fathers stead) and upon the after <hi>rising Generation.</hi> The Lords People have need of something to comfort them, in this day, when there are so many doleful Symptoms of approaching wrath and ruin. Now if God say unto his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones amongst us, Seek ye my face for the rising Generation, and their hearts answer again, <hi>Lord thy face we will seek for them,</hi> that will be no small encouragement to Faith, that the blessed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of our Fathers (<hi>now with Christ, beholding His glory</hi>) who transported themselves into this vast, and then waste Wilderness, in special with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Posterity, that so they might leave a Seed that shall serve him, and be accounted to the Lord for a Generation, will not be wholly frustrate.

the Lord brought them out of Egypt they were then formed to be a people for himself; The Lord moulded them up into a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable frame of Church and State: for which cause did the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> begin their Religious account, (albeit their civil account began six moneths before that) from the time of the year when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> since that then they seemed to begin their life. And then they were a <hi>Jeshurun; Thou Jeshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,</hi> h. e. a righteous People as to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and Profession, according to the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Name <hi>Jeshurun</hi>; they were wholly a right seed, under most righteous Lawes.</p>

the third &amp; highest Heaven. And this promise is further illustrated from the blessed <hi>Extent</hi> of it, in that not only Parents but Children are concerned therein: On thy Seed, <hi>i. e.</hi> thy Children, and on thine <hi>Off-spring</hi> i. e. <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erity</hi> as some render the word <hi>Hebr. [I will pour my blessing upon thy young spriggs]</hi> The Children of Gods Servants, that spring from them, and must succeed when they are dead and gone out of the world, are intended by this expression.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the fulfilment of this promise, this (as well as many other Scriptures, which are prophetical and promissory) doth admit of a Typical and partial, as also an Antitypi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and more plenary accomplishment. The Lords people whilst in <hi>Babylon</hi> were like unto dry and desolate ground, but the Lord reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them afterwards, and brought them into a flourishing estate, and there was a glorious work of the Spirit of God in that matter, <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> And there will be a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accomplishment of this Prophecy and Promise, when God shall pour out a Spirit of Converting grace upon the body of the <hi>Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itish</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the words being a special branch of the Covenant of Grace, which God hath established with his Servants, and with their Children, Gentiles are concerned therein as
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:000393_0168_0FA5B8134CB1CD38"/>
well as Jews; for upon them is come the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Abraham by Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the words have special reference unto New-Testament times, which is also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by that expression of <hi>pouring the Spirit.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See Dr. Owen of the Spirit. p.</hi> 87.</note> God is said to <hi>give</hi> his Spirit, under the Old Testament, but it is very observable, that he is not said to <hi>pour</hi> his Spirit upon men, except in the New Testament, or in Scriptures that do referr to the dayes of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine which we may take up from the words, is</p>
                  <p>Doct. That <hi>One of the greatest blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Covenant of grace,</hi> is, <hi>That the Lord will pour his Spirit upon the Children and posterity of his Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the clearing of this Doctrine, Four things may be enquired into: 1. What is here meant by the Spirit? 2. What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this <hi>pouring</hi> the Spirit? 3. How it doth appear that the Pouring of the Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Children is a great blessing: 4. The Reason why the Lord hath made such a Promise.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What is here meant by the Spirit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Spirit is not here taken in a personal sense? altho it be a glorious Truth, that the Holy Ghost himself doth dwell in the Hearts of Believers, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>v. Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons Ans. to Bayly. p.</hi> 36, 37, 36. <hi>Dr. Owen of Perseverance c.</hi> 8 &amp; <hi>Burgess on</hi> 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 207 208</note> yet he is not as to his
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:000393_0169_0FA5B813FB7442B8"/>
Person said to be poured on men for so he is equally in all the Saints: whereas this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>pouring</hi> the Spirit intimates a larger communication of him to some, than to others. Wherefore the Phrase is <hi>Metonymical,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affirmed of the Cause, which is proper to the Effect. In respect of his effects and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the Holy Ghost is poured forth upon his Servants.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then by the Spirit here is meant, the <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Spirit, All spirituall gifts, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Illumination in the Misteries of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are from the Holy Ghost: Hence they that have such gifts are said to be <hi>made partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the holy Ghost,</hi> Heb. 6.4. He that hath a gift of Knowledge or a gift of Prayer hath received it from the Holy Ghost, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is <hi>so far</hi> poured upon him. And the gifts of the Spirit, are compared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water in the Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>He that believeth on me, out of his Belly (i. e.</hi> his heart) <hi>shall flow rivers of living water: this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</hi> For as waters do refresh the bodies of men; so the gifts of the Holy Ghost do refresh their souls. When the Lord did showr down his Spirit in that plentiful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure on the Apostles, Thousands of souls were refreshed and revived thereby. This then is partly meant here, when it is said, I will pour my spirit on your seed, <hi>h. e.</hi> your Children,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:000393_0170_0FA5B815465039E8"/>
shall have gifts of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon them they shall be taught to know the Lord, from the greatest to the least.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Spirit here, <hi>Converting, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace</hi> is meant: The Spirit is put for the graces thereof. Conversion is the special work of the Holy Ghost. The Conversion of the House of David <hi>h. e.</hi> the Elect of God is intimated by that of <hi>pouring a Spirit of grace upon them,</hi> Zech. 12.10. Grace is wrought in the soul by no other hand than that of the Spirit. When God sends down his Spirit to accompany his Word and Ordinances, then converting work goeth on, but if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the efficacious influences of his Holy Spirit converting work will be at a stand, all meanes and outward Dispensations notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Wherefore Conversion or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is called, <hi>the Renewing of the Holy Ghost, Tit.</hi> 3.5. These words then, are a Promise &amp; gracious Intimation unto the Lords people, that a spirit of converting grace shall be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their Children.</p>
                  <p>We come to the second enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is implied in this pouring of the Spirit, which the Text speaks of?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This expression doth imply, that <hi>The Graces of the Spirit are fitly resembled unto Water</hi>: So much is intimated by the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of <hi>pouring,</hi> which alludeth unto the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:000393_0171_0FA5B81882BD2430"/>
Clouds pouring down rain upon the Earth. Water is of a purifying nature, so the waters of the Spirit, Sanctifying grace doth cleanse and purify the souls of men <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols will I cleanse you.</hi> The guilt of Sin is washed away in the blood of Christ; the filth of Sin is purged by those blessed waters which do Proceed from the spirit of Christ, even converting, sanctifying grace: For the same reason Grace is compared unto fire <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. Metals, Gold &amp; silver are purified unto fire, other things by water: therefore are the blessed operations of the Holy Ghost compared both to the one and to the other. Water is of a Mollifying nature; the Earth that is dry and hard is thereby softened, <hi>Psal.</hi> 67.10. <hi>Thou visitest the earth and wateredst it</hi> thou greatly enrichest it with the River of God which is full of water <hi>thou makest it soft with showers.</hi> So does converting grace soften the dry and hard hearts of the Children of men. That heart which was as hard as stone before, if once a spirit of converting grace be poured thereon, it doth become soft and plyable like water. Again, Water maketh fruitful, showers and flouds do so: thus when the Lord doth rain the waters of the spirit or, cause them to flow over the souls of men, they are
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:000393_0172_0FA5B8193B50C8B0"/>
made fruitfull in the works of Righteousness <hi>Isai.</hi> 32.15. <hi>Vntil the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the Wilderness become a fruitful field.</hi> That soul that was a desolate parched barren Wilderness, when once the Spirit from on high is poured upon it, doth become like a fruitful field, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.26, 27. Fruits of Holiness and Righteousness are the effect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watered by the Spirit of GOD; only the converted man, that hath grace in his soul is indeed fruitful, others are barren and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ground. Once more, Water is of an heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature; So are the waters of the Spirit, sin is the souls sickness, grace is the souls health, the wound received by Original corruption is in some measure healed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.9. <hi>For they shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cometh.</hi> Those words are a Prophesy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Conversion of the Gentiles, by meanes of that healing virtue which does at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the blessed waters of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Expression of <hi>pouring</hi> the Spirit does intimate, <hi>An abundant measure of the Spirit,</hi> i. e. of the gifts and graces thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pouring</hi> is something more than <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> as when there cometh a plentiful rain from heaven, enough to satisfie dry ground, it comes <hi>pouring</hi> down. As Elihu speaks <hi>Job</hi> 36.27, 28.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:000393_0173_0FA5B819E924AB48"/>
He maketh small drops of water, they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof, which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. So this pouring of the Spirit noteth a great showr of grace, hence it is said in the context that, flouds shall be poured on the dry ground: Now a floud of grace inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates a great measure thereof. There are many Scripture Expressions that confirm this, Prov. 1.23. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon you.</hi> The Hebrew word [<hi>Nabang</hi>] which is there translated <hi>pour,</hi> signifieth to <hi>spring up,</hi> intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the spirit of grace in the souls of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is like a fountain, where is an abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of water, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.15. <hi>until the spirit be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon us from on high.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Gnadah</hi> signifieth to <hi>make bare</hi>; so that the meaning is, that there shall be a Manifest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous pouring forth of the spirit that all the world shall take notice of it. and indeed when a soul is converted, there is an abundant effusion of the spirit to accomplish such a strange thing as that is, to change such a cursed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to renew such a vile heart, must needs proceed from a plentiful effusion of the Spirit. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.6. <hi>By the washing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> Wherefore when it is said, I will pour my Spirit on thy seed, and my blessing on thine
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:000393_0174_0FA5B81AF50B2D88"/>
Offspring; The Lord doth graciously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise his Servants, that their Children shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto an eminency of Spiritual gifts, and unto large measures of Grace and Holiness.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the Third Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quest. 3. <hi>How doth it appear that the</hi> pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit upon Children <hi>is a great Blessing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In that the Gift of the Holy Ghost is mentioned in the Scripture as a great and wonderful thing. It is said <hi>Act.</hi> 10.45. <hi>They were astonished because that on the Gentiles was</hi> poured out the gift <hi>of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Yea, it is mentioned as such a gift as is equivalent to all good things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Your Father which is in Heaven shall give good things to them that ask him.</hi> Now in <hi>Luke</hi> it is expressed, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Your Heavenly Father shall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Chapt. 11.13. So then the gift of the Spirit is virutally all good things. Truly if God pour his Spirit upon our Children he doth more for them, than if he bestowed all the good things in the world upon them. This is the great promise of the Gospel: As the great promise of the Old Test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was concerning the <hi>Coming of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> so the great promise of the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth respect a more plentiful Effusion of the Spirit of Grace. Hence the pouring down of the Spirit, is noted by that Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expression
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:000393_0175_0FA5B81BC00E7EF0"/>
of the promise of the Father <hi>Act.</hi> 1. And he is called <hi>the Spirit of promise,</hi> Ephes. 1.13. as being the great gift which God hath promised to bestow upon his Servants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Truth is evident in that the Blessing here spoken of, is an everlasting Blessing.</hi> Eternal good things are the Cheif: So is this bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, upon whom he is poured, upon them &amp; in them, he remaineth for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. The Hebrew word [<hi>Jatzak</hi>] which is here translated <hi>Pour,</hi> signifieth to <hi>Fasten,</hi> as well as to <hi>Pour: I will</hi> fasten <hi>my Spirit upon your children.</hi> That <hi>In-dwelling</hi> of the person of the Holy Ghost in believers, which the New-Test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament speaketh so much of, is everlasting: He abideth with them and in them forever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. And the graces of the Spirit which he doth pour upon his People are everlasting: common gifts may cease, but special grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth to Eternity. It is a seed of God that is incorruptible which liveth and abideth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. As the Holy Fire (which signified the Holy Ghost his coming down from Heaven into the Hearts of his People) it never went out; No more shall Grace dye, or be totally extinguished in a Believing soul: Hence <hi>true</hi> Grace is compared unto living (<hi>i. e. spring) water,</hi> which never runs dry: yea to <hi>great Rivers</hi> in respect of their <hi>perennity.</hi> Great Ri-Rivers
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:000393_0176_0FA5B81C19121740"/>
are alwayes running from the begining of the World to the end thereof; So is true Saving Grace of an Everlasting Nature, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41.18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A Spirit of Converting grace is such a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing as never goeth alone</hi>: That setteth forth the Greatness and eminency of it. If (saith the Apostle) God give us his Son, shall he not with him give us all things? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. So if the Lord give his holy Spirit to us, and to our children; shall he not with him give us all things? Godliness hath the promise of this life, and of that which is to come 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. We should not trouble our selves about laying up great portions, or much of the things of this world for our children, if we can but prevail with God to pour his Spirit on them, to give Grace to them, they are sure never to want as long as they live in this world. Is not pardon of Sin a rich and glorious blessing, which our poor Children because they are <hi>our</hi> Off-spring stand in need of? Now if the Lord pour a Spirit of converting Grace upon them, their sins shall be forgiven, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.12. Is not eternal Life and Glory a great bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? The pouring of the Spirit on the soul is a certain sign and evidence of one that is designed unto eternal Life in Heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture speaketh of the <hi>first fruit
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:000393_0177_0FA5B81CF2651B98"/>
of the Spirit</hi> Eph. 1.14. If the Lord give grace to our Children he will give glory too, yea he will with-hold from them no good thing <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>But why hath the Lord promised to doe thus for his Servants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reas. 1. <hi>From the Exceeding Riches of the Grace of God.</hi> That the Lord most high who hath an absolute Dominion over the works of his hands should at all deal with man in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant way, or make any promise to him, is from grace; much more that he should deal thus with fallen man: And that he should extend his Covenant not only to parents but to their Children also; that their Of-spring with them are under the wings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And moreover, that he should promise so great a Blessing as that of giving his Spirit, and yet more, that his Spirit should be <hi>poured</hi> upon them: We may well cry out as they did <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Grace! grace!</hi> None but a God of infinite Grace would have done thus.</p>
                  <p>Reas. 2. <hi>Because the Children of Gods people do many of them belong to Election,</hi> As it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the context <hi>Jesurun whom I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi>; That Election of God is mentioned as the ground of this promise in the Text. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God are the proper Subjects of this promise. The Lord in the Covenant of grace hath not only promised that whoever doth
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:000393_0178_0FA5B81DE9E21778"/>
truly believe &amp; repent, shall be saved; but as to the Elect there is a promise of the first grace, even that <hi>converting</hi> grace should be poured on them, they shall be made to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. A new heart shall be given to the house of Israel h. e. the Elect tipified by the house of Israel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. Now God hath seen meet to cast the line of Election so, as that it doth (though not wholly and only, yet) for the most part run through the loyns of godly parents. There are, it is true, Elect Children, who are not born of elect parents, but there are few (if any) Elect Parents without elect children: Sometimes all the Children belong to Election as we see in the many sons of Jacob, (however some of them) that the Lord remembers and establisheth his Covenant with. The Scripture doth frequently hint this Truth, that <hi>elect children are for the most part cast upon elect Parents.</hi> See <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.17. <hi>Isai.</hi> 59.20. and 65.22, 23. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. And Observation doth confirm it. For wee see that the Elect of God are not in all Nations alike, but in some the Lord gathers his Elect to himself from generation to Generation. And there are some Families that the Lord hath Chosen above others and therefore poureth his Spirit upon the Off-spring in such Families successively. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>Reas. 3. <hi>That so godly parents might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to</hi> pray <hi>and believe for their Children.</hi> It is marvelous pleasing unto God when his Servants pray and believe not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but for their Children also. Now a promise is an encouragement unto prayer: David found in his heart to pray that God would bless his Family forever, because the Lord had promised that it should be so 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3, <hi>ult.</hi> Men should not think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (as some do) if their Children do belong to God, then he will convert them whether they pray for it or no, but should therefore be stirred up to the more fervency in cries to Heaven, for the blessing promised. <hi>I</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>will give a new heart to you and to your Children,</hi> yet you must pray for it. <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of the house of Israel to doe it for them,</hi> Ezek. 36, 26, 37. And a promise is an encouragement to Faith, as well as unto prayer: As <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me,</hi> Act. 27.25. So a Believer may say, God hath told me that he will bless me and my Family, that he will pour his Spirit upon my poor Children, and therefore I believe God, that it shall be as he hath told me.</p>

                     <hi>To pray that a Spirit of Converting Grace may be poured down from heaven upon our Children, and the Rising Generation in New-England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would direct this Exhortation,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To Parents, 2. To Children.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To Parents, Consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>How needful a thing it is to be much in prayer on this account.</hi> Converting grace is of absolute necessity in order to Salvation, and that as to the Children of Godly parents as well as others, for they are born in Sin as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> confesseth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>I was shapen in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me</hi>: yet his mother was a precious godly woman; and for ought that doth appear to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his father was a good man too: wherefore such Children dying in a natural unconverted estate, are lyable to Wrath and Death and Curse and Hell Eph. 2.3. <hi>We also,</hi> even we that are Jews, and not Gentiles only, we that are the Elect of God: yea, we that are chosen to be Apostles and ministers of Christ, <hi>wereby nature the Children of wrath even as others.</hi> So that except the Lord send forth his Spirit and renew the souls, change the Natures of our poor Children, they are never like to see Heaven. <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you except

a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdome of God,</hi> Joh, 3.3. You that are Parents, are you willing that the Children of your own Bowells should be miserable throughout the dayes of Eternity? that they should ly burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a fiery Ocean as long as God shall be God? yet so it must be except the Lord in Mercy look upon them so as to pour down of his spirit from on high upon them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Prayer is needful upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in that Conversions are become rare in this age of the world. They that have their thoughts exercised in discerning things of this nature, have sad apprehensions with reference unto this matter: That the work of Conversion hath been at a great stand in the world: In the last age, in the dayes of our Fathers, in other parts of the world, scarce <note n="*" place="bottom">

Clear sound Conversions are not frequent in some Congregations. The body of the rising Generation is a poor perishing, unconverted, and (except the Lord pour down his spirit) an undone Generation. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are Profane, Drunkards, Swearers, lascivious, Scoffers at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of godliness, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisers of those that are good, proud, disobedient

Creatures, God from heaven pitty them! O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are only civil, and outwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to good order, by reason of their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but never knew what the New birth meanes; pray for them that they may not only come <hi>near,</hi> but enter <hi>into</hi> the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Consider. 2. <hi>That Prayer is a notable means to obtain this mercy.</hi> Prayer opens the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Heaven, <hi>Elias</hi> prayed that it might rain, and Heaven gave showrs: Prayer brings down the showrs of Blessing in a proper literal sense: but especially these spiritual showrs which the Text speaketh of, wherein the Lord promiseth to showr down his spirit upon our poor Children. Assuredly if there be Prayers &amp; tears before the Lord on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they will come pouring down again in showrs of grace at last. I have read of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Minister of Christ, that having prayed fervently with some Christian Friends, they in the next room felt strange illapses of the Spirit upon their hearts, so as that one said, <hi>O what a man is this that can knock down the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God into all our hearts!</hi> Who knows but that wee may pray down the spirit of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the souls of our Children, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Knock and it shall be opened to you, ask, and it shall be given you.</hi> What shall then be given? even the holy Spirit to them that ask him, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:000393_0183_0FA5B8285C527530"/>
O then Let us knock hard at Heaven gates this day; certainly such requests are welcome to Heaven, yea, to <hi>God</hi> in Heaven, He hath shewed how acceptable such requests are to Him by gracious answers: Christ said unto his Disciples, <hi>Behold I send the promise of my Father,</hi> (meaning the spirit of Promise,) <hi>upon you, but tarry ye in the City Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high</hi> Luk. 24.49. And what were they to doe at Jerusalem in the mean time? no question but (as some have noted) they were much in fasting and Prayer that this Promise of the Father might come upon them. And not long after there was a most gracious and glorious effusion of the Spirit. And of latter times, God has been entreated to send down his spirit abundantly for the Conversion of souls, Not fifty years agoe, at a place in Scotland, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Idem eodem Libro. pag.</hi> 417.</note> a great number of praying christians met together, when a Sermon was to be preached the next day, and they spent the night afore in Prayer that the Lord would own the word then to be spoken for the Conversion of souls, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord went forth with his Word, so that near upon Five Hundred Souls were wrought upon and Converted by that one Sermon. I have been told of a Church
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:000393_0184_0FA5B828C44619D8"/>
in <hi>New-England</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note> that set apart a day for this end, that they might by Fasting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er beg converting grace for their Children; &amp; that since the gospel has bin made successful in that Congregation so as that a day of <hi>publick</hi> Thanksgiving hath been attended, in that so many of the younger, rising generation have been brought home to Christ. Now if the Lord awaken a spirit of Prayer concerning this thing in these Churches generally, there will doubtless be some blessed effect of it, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Rising generation: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God hath put it into our hearts to set apart this day, thus to seek unto him, I am Perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it shall not be in vain but that there are a number of souls belonging to this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that must have the Spirit of the Lord Poured down on them; sheep that are not yet brought home into the Lords Fold, that must <hi>hear the voice of the Son of God and live.</hi> Since the Time that we agreed thus to set apart this day, God hath sent down plentiful showrs whereby the dry &amp; thirsty ground is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refreshed: And is not that a token for good that those blessed showrs which we are <hi>fasting</hi> &amp; <hi>praying</hi> for this day, shall in due time come down upon the <hi>souls</hi> of our poor children?</p>
                  <p>Consider. 3. <hi>What encouragement we have to be at this work.</hi> The success which such Pray-Prayers
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:000393_0185_0FA5B82A19FFD688"/>
have had (of which something hath been mentioned) and much more might be spoken) should encourage us. As for some of us, our Fathers &amp; Mothers now in glory, did pray for us when they were in the world, and God heard them: Did they whom we are sprung from pray for us? and hath God heard them? will he not hear us, if we goe and <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>our</hi> Off-spring, and have we not already seen some answers? If we look into our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies do we not discern that as to some of our Children, the fear of God is put into their hearts? And why should we not look upon that as a first fruits, that all the rest of our Children shall be converted in due Time? Moreover, the consideration of the Covenant, and Promises of God respecting Children, are a great encouragement to pray for them. This is his <hi>everlasting</hi> Covenant, <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</hi> Gen. 17.7. This promise is expressed indefinitely, and Therefore doth encourage godly Parents to plead with the Lord for mercy and Grace for <hi>ALL</hi> their Children: As an Holy man once said, (and it was a great word of faith in him) <note n="†" place="bottom">

And why should it not be so, since the Lord himself hath said, <hi>ALL thy children shall be taught of God,</hi> Isai. 54.13. And the Script<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure doth abound with particular promises re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the Conversion and Salvation of the Children of godly Parents. When thou doest that which is good &amp; right in the sight of God, it shall go well with <hi>thy Children after thee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> Deut. 12.28. There is <hi>special</hi> mercy belonging to those that are the seed of the <hi>Blessed of the Lord,</hi> and to their Offspring with them <hi>Isai.</hi> 65.23.

shall be Comforts and Ornaments to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; Yea that they shall be adorned with gifts and graces of the Spirit of God. And in special, there is a promise of this Blessing with respect to Children in the Times of the Gospel, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>It shall come to pass after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> h. e. <hi>in the last dayes or times of the Gospel,</hi> as the Apostle doth expound the words <hi>I will pour my spirit upon your Children.</hi> Now these dayes wherein we live, come under the last dayes, we therefore should plead that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise before the Lord, and say, These are the last dayes, Lord, and thou hast said that in the last dayes thou wilt <hi>pour thy spirit upon the Children of thy servants.</hi> And indeed that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Promise which our eyes have seen is ground of Encouragement to Pray, and plead, and believe for more. Some of <hi>New-Englands</hi> Children have been eminently blessed by the Lord, He hath poured his spirit upon them richly, <hi>Plants of Renown</hi> have sprung up here, that have been the glory of the Land where they have had there Education: Yea, some that whole Nations have fared the better for them: Rivers of water have flowed out of their souls, whereby Thousands have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed; and there is a blessed Sprinkling in most Churches, though not that General pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Spirit that is to be desired, yet a Sprinkling which we should take notice of, for the encouragement of Faith and Prayer.
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:000393_0188_0FA5B82CB73FEBC0"/>
I shall only mention that which I have most reason to know; In this poor Congregation, within this few late years, there have been of Children born in New-England, near upon fourscore Persons that have come before the Church and declared what God hath done for their souls, and in that way subscribed their names to the God of Israel; besides many that have come out of other Lands, and when they have been here, the Lord hath Poured his Spirit upon them. I speak it that God might have the glory of his grace, and that Ministers may be encouraged to preach, and the Lords People to pray for the Conversion of souls. Moreover, the consideration of what Parents the Children of this Land are (many of them) sprung from, doth afford matter of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Paul</hi> was induced the rather to hope well concerning <hi>Timothy,</hi> because he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of such a stock; he had a Gracious Mother and a gracious grand-Mother also, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. So, many Children with us, are the Off-spring of such Parents, (<hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Grand-Fathers</hi>) as have been eminent for God in their time, eminent for Holiness, yea and for Sufferings, on account of Bearing witness to the Name and truth of Christ, Now a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Blessing is wont to follow the Children of such as have been sufferers for Christ. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were (some of them) eminent Confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and in a degree <hi>Martyrs of Jesus,</hi> who
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:000393_0189_0FA5B82D77FE0BA0"/>
left a pleasant Land and Fathers houses to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord into a Wilderness, in a Land which was not sown. Yea and they came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partly with respect unto their Off-spring that they might leave their Children under the special Blessing of God in Christ Jesus. Hath not the Lord peculiar Blessings in store for such Children? Let us <hi>pray them down</hi> from Heaven above.</p>
                  <p>Consider, 4. <hi>What a blessed thing it will be if we prevail in Heaven for this Mercy.</hi> We cannot pray for a more desirable thing than this Blessing. <note n="*" place="bottom">

continue to pray for us whilest we are with them in the world.

                  <p>A few things by way of <hi>Direction.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let Parents be sure that they be converted themselves.</hi> Deut. 30.6. <hi>I will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy Seed.</hi> If our own hearts be circumcised, we may pray in faith that the Lord will circumcise the hearts of our Children otherwise we cannot do it.

An Hypocrite, or unconverted man cannot act faith for his Child's soul, who never yet did believe for his own soul. Nor doth this promise in the Text belong to other than godly Parents, Psal. 128.4. <hi>Behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.</hi>

ought to walk and please God: that if they will but <hi>be</hi> and <hi>doe</hi> like to their Parents they shall certainly be blessed for ever.

Death waits for you, there is now a mortal and contagious disease in many houses: The Sword of the Lord is drawn, and young men fall down apace slain under it: don't you see the Arrows of death come flying over your heads? Why then, Awake, awake, and turn to God in Jesus Christ whilst it is called to day, and know for certain that if you dye in your sins, you will be the most miserable of any poor creatures in the Bottom of Hell: O consider of it; to be prayed, wept, preach'd, Fasted down to HELL! what an Amazing Thing will it be!
