            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ALL that has been ſaid by the greateſt ſaints and dying men, when the fulleſt of light and divine knowledge, of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of piety, of the excellency of virtue, of our duty to God, of the vanity of worldly enjoyments; and all the maxims of the wiſeſt philoſophers, when in their higheſt ſtate of wiſdom, are proper objects of meditation for the ſerious minded, and ought, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, to conſtitute the daily leſſons of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful minds. Such was the education of the youth who attended Plato and Socrates; their every day's inſtruction were ſo many lectures upon the nature of man, his true end, and the right uſe of his faculties. Now as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity has ſet every thing that is reaſonable, wiſe, holy and deſirable, in its true point of light, ſo it might well be expected, that the education of the youth ſhould be as much bettered and amended by Chriſtianity, as the faith and doctrines of religion are. But, alas, our modern education is not of this kind, whatever way of life we intend the youth for, we apply to the fire of their minds, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to improvement from corrupt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. We generally ſtir them to action from principles of covetouſneſs, or a deſire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that they may accumulate wealth, excel others, and ſhine in the eyes of the world. We repeat and inculcate theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives upon them, till they think it a part of their duty to make gain and worldly diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the chief object of their deſire. That
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011175_0003_0F862BA0264AFE68"/>this is generally the nature of the education of our ſons, is too plain to need any proof. And it is much to be lamented that our daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe right education is of the utmoſt importance to human life, ſhould not only be brought up in pride, but in the loweſt and moſt contemptible part of it; ſuch as a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their perſons, a deſire of beauty, and a love of dreſs; and indeed almoſt every thing they meet with ſeems to conſpire to make them think of little elſe. And after all this we complain of the pernicious effects that pride and covetouſneſs have in the world; we wonder to ſee grown perſons actuated and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by theſe pernicious principles, not conſidering that they were all the time of their youth called upon to form their actions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry upon the ſame principles. An educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Plato and Socrates had no other end, but to teach youth to think, judge, act and follow ſuch rules of life as Plato and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates uſed, and is it not our indiſpenſable duty to uſe our beſt endeavour that the end of a chriſtian education, may be to teach our youth how to think and judge, and act, and live agreeable to the precepts and practice of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <head>The Uncertainty of a DEATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BED REPENTANCE, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated under the Character of PENITENS.</head>
            <p>PENITENS was a buſy notable tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and very proſperous in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but died in the <hi>thirty-fifth</hi> year of his age.</p>
            <p>A little before his death, when the doctors had given him over, ſome of his neighbours came one evening to ſee him; at which time he ſpake thus to them:</p>
            <p>I ſee, ſays he, my friends, the tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you have for me, by the grief that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in your countenances, and I know the thoughts that you now have about me. You think how melancholy a caſe it is, to ſee ſo young a man, and in ſuch flouriſhing buſineſs, deliver'd up to death. And, perhaps, had I viſited any of you in my condition, I ſhould have had the ſame thoughts of you.</p>
            <p>But now, my friends, my thoughts are no more like your thoughts, than my condition is like yours.</p>
            <p>It is no trouble to me now to think, that I am to die young, or before I have rais'd an eſtate.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are now ſunk into ſuch meet <hi>nothings,</hi> that I have no name little enough to call them by. For if in a few days, or hours, I am to leave this carcaſe to be buried in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011175_0005_0F862BA22AC29438"/>earth, and to find myſelf either for ever happy in the favour of God, or eternally ſeparated from all light and peace, can any words ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſs the littleneſs of every thing elſe?</p>
            <p>Is there any dream like the dream of life, in which we are amuſed with vain and empty things? whilſt we are neglecting and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding that which is ſubſtantially valuable. Is there any folly like the folly of moſt men and women, who think themſelves too wiſe, and are too buſy to hearken to the voice of Jeſus Chriſt calling in the heart? which, if carefully attended to, would occaſion theſe ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; but for want of attending to this divine inſtructor, that enemy of mankind the Devil, is ſuffered to fill our minds with unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable affections and fooliſh opinions; ſo that when we conſider death as a miſery, we only think of it as a miſerable ſeparation from the enjoyments of this life. We ſeldom mourn over an old man that dies rich, but we lament the young, that are taken away in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of their fortune. You yourſelves look upon me with pity, not that I am going un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepar'd to meet the Judge of the quick and the dead, but that I am to leave a proſperous trade in the flower of my life.</p>
            <p>This is the wiſdom of our manly thoughts. And yet what folly of the ſillieſt children is ſo great as this?</p>
            <p>For what is there miſerable or dreadful in death, but the conſequences of it? When a man is dead, what does any thing ſignify to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011175_0006_0F862BA267E8DBA0"/>him, but the ſtate he is then in?</p>
            <p>Our poor friend <hi>Lepidus</hi> dy'd, you know, as he was dreſſing himſelf for a <hi>feaſt;</hi> do you think it is now part of his trouble, that he did not live till that entertainment was over? <hi>Feaſts,</hi> and <hi>buſineſs,</hi> and <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>enjoyments,</hi> ſeem great things to us, whilſt we think of nothing elſe; but as ſoon as we add death to them, they all ſink into an equal littleneſs; and the ſoul, that is ſeparated from the body, no more laments the loſs of <hi>buſineſs,</hi> than the loſing of a <hi>feaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I am now going into the joys of GOD, could there be any reaſon to grieve, that this happen'd to me before I was forty years of age? could it be a ſad thing to go to Heaven, before I had made a few more bargains or ſtood a little longer behind a counter?</p>
            <p>And if I am to go amongſt loſt ſpirits, could there be any reaſon to be content, that this did not happen to me till I was old, and full of <hi>riches?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If good Angels were ready to receive my ſoul, could it be any grief to me, that I was dying upon a <hi>poor bed</hi> in a <hi>garret?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if GOD has delivered me up to evil ſpirits, to be dragg'd by them to places of torments, could it be any comfort to me, that they found me upon a <hi>bed of ſtate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you are as near death as I am, you will know, that all the different ſtates of life, whether of youth or age, <hi>riches</hi> or <hi>poverty, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>meaneſs,</hi> ſignify no more to you, than
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011175_0007_0F862BA335D697C0"/>whether you die in a <hi>poor</hi> or <hi>ſtately</hi> apartment.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of thoſe things which follow death, makes all that goes before it ſink into <hi>nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that <hi>judgment</hi> is the next thing that I look for, and everlaſting happineſs or miſery is come ſo near me, all the enjoyments and proſperities of life ſeem as vain and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, and to have no more to do with my happineſs, than the cloaths that I wore before I could ſpeak.</p>
            <p>But, my friends, how am I ſurpriz'd, that I have not always had theſe thoughts? How an I ſurpriz'd to find, that for want of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience, to that degree of light and grace, with which God hath enlightened? the words of our bleſſed Saviour have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in me, darkneſs has been ſuffered to come over me, and theſe great things have been hid from me; for what is there in the terrors of death, in the vanities of life, or the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of piety, but what I might have as eaſily and fully ſeen in any part of my life?</p>
            <p>What a ſtrange thing is it, that a little <hi>health,</hi> or the poor buſineſs of a <hi>ſhop,</hi> ſhould keep us ſo ſenſeleſs of theſe great things, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo faſt upon us!</p>
            <p>Juſt as you came into my chamber, I was thinking with myſelf, what numbers of ſouls there are now in the world, in my condition at this very time, ſurpriz'd with a ſummons to the other world; ſome taken from their <hi>ſhops</hi> and <hi>farms,</hi> others from their <hi>ſports</hi> and <hi>pleaſures,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011175_0008_0F862BA3E4B8E100"/>theſe at <hi>ſuits at law,</hi> thoſe at <hi>gaming-tables,</hi> and all ſeiz'd at an hour when they thought nothing of it; frighted at the approach of death, confounded at the vanity of all their labours, deſigns and projects, aſtoniſh'd at the folly of their paſt lives, and not knowing which way to turn their thoughts, to find any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Their conſciences flying in their faces, bringing all their ſins to their remembrance, tormenting them with the deepeſt convictions of their own folly, preſenting them with the ſight of the angry Judge, the worm that never dies, the fire that is never quench'd, the gates of hell, the powers of darkneſs, and the bitter pains of eternal death.</p>
            <p>Oh my friends! bleſs God that you are not of this number, that you have time and ſtrength to employ yourſelves in ſuch works of piety, as may bring you peace at the laſt.</p>
            <p>And take this along with you, that there is nothing but a life of great piety, or a death of great ſtupidity, that can keep off theſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
            <p>Had I now a thouſand worlds, I would give them all for one year more, that I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto God, one year of ſuch devotion and good works, as I never before ſo much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>You perhaps, when you conſider that I have liv'd free from ſcandal and debauchery, and in the communion of the Church, wonder to ſee me ſo fall of remorſe and ſelf-condemnation at the approach of death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011175_0009_0F862BA6769436B8"/>
But, alas! what a poor thing is it, to have liv'd only free from <hi>murder, theft</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> which is all that I can ſay for myſelf.</p>
            <p>You know indeed, that I have never been reckon'd a <hi>ſot,</hi> but you are at the ſame time witneſſes, and have been frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of my <hi>intemperance, ſenſuality,</hi> and great <hi>indulgence.</hi> And if I am now going to a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where nothing will be rewarded but <hi>good works,</hi> I may well be concern'd, that tho' I am no <hi>ſot,</hi> yet I have no <hi>Chriſtian ſobriety</hi> to plead for me.</p>
            <p>It is true, I have liv'd in the communion of the Church, and generally frequented its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice on <hi>Sundays,</hi> when I was neither too <hi>idle,</hi> or not otherwiſe diſpos'd of by my <hi>buſineſs</hi> and <hi>pleaſures.</hi> But then my confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the publick worſhip has been rather a thing of courſe, than any real intention of doing that which the ſervice of the Church ſuppoſes; had it not been ſo, I had been oftner at Church, more devout when there, and more fearful of ever neglecting it.</p>
            <p>But the thing that now ſurprizes me above all wonders, is this, that I never had ſo much as a <hi>general intention</hi> of living up to the piety of the Goſpel. This never ſo much as enter'd into my heart. I never once in my life conſider'd whether I was living as the laws of Religion direct, or whether my way of life was ſuch, as would procure me the mercy of God at this hour.</p>
            <p>And can it be thought, that I have kept the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011175_0010_0F862BA70AA3C528"/>Goſpel terms of ſalvation, without ever ſo much as <hi>intending</hi> in any ſerious deliberate manner either to know them, or keep them? Can it be thought, that I have pleaſed God with ſuch a life as he requires, tho' I have liv'd without ever conſidering, what he requires, or how much I have perform'd? How eaſy a thing would ſalvation be, if it could fall into my careleſs hands, who have never had ſo much ſerious thoughts about it, as about any one common bargain that I have made?</p>
            <p>In the buſineſs of life I have uſed prudence and reflection, I have done every thing by rules and methods. I have been glad to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men of experience and judgment, to ſind out the reaſons why ſome fail, and others ſucceed in any buſineſs. I have taken no ſtep in trade but with great care and caution, conſidering every advantage or danger that attended it. I have always had my eye upon the main end of buſineſs, and have ſtudy'd all the ways and means of being a gainer by all that I undertook.</p>
            <p>But what is the reaſon that I have brought none of theſe tempers to Religion? What is the reaſon that I, who have ſo often talk'd of the neceſſity of <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>methods,</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> in worldly buſineſs, have all this while never once thought of any rules, or methods, or managements, to carry me on in a life of piety?</p>
            <p>Do you think any thing can aſtoniſh, and confound a dying man like this? What pain do you think a man muſt feel, when his conſcience
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011175_0011_0F862BA7AEAEA348"/>lays all this folly to his charge when it ſhall ſhew him how regular, exact, and wiſe he has been in ſmall matters, that are paſſed away like a dream, and how ſtupid and ſenſeleſs he has liv'd, without any reflection, without any rules, in things of ſuch eternal moment, as no heart can ſufficiently conceive them!</p>
            <p>Had I only my <hi>frailties</hi> and <hi>imperfections</hi> to lament at this time, I ſhould lye here humbly truſting in the mercies of God. But alas! how can I call a general diſregard, and a thorough neglect of all religious improvement, a <hi>frailty</hi> or <hi>imperfection;</hi> when it was as much in my power to have been exact, and careful, and diligent in a courſe of piety, as in the buſineſs of my <hi>trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could have call'd in as many helps, have practiſed as many rules, and been taught as many certain methods of holy living, as of thriving in my ſhop, had I but ſo <hi>intended</hi> and <hi>deſir'd</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Oh my friends! a careleſs life, unconcern'd and unattentive to the duties of Religion, is ſo without all excuſe, ſo unworthy of the mercy of God, ſuch a ſhame to the ſenſe and reaſon of our minds, that I can hardly conceive a greater puniſhment, than for a man to be thrown into the ſtate that I am in, to reflect upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penitens</hi> was here going on, but had his mouth ſtopp'd by a <hi>convulſion,</hi> which never ſuffer'd him to ſpeak any more. He lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuls'd about twelve hours, and then gave up the ghoſt.</p>

Now if every <hi>reader</hi> would imagine this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitens</hi> to have been ſome particular acquaintance or relation of his, and fancy that he ſaw and heard all that is here deſcrib'd, that he ſtood by his bed-ſide when his poor friend lay in ſuch diſtreſs and agony, lamenting the folly of his paſt life, it would in all probability teach him ſuch wiſdom as never enter'd into his heart before.

               <p>THE little time that you have been in the world, my children, you have ſpent wholly with me; and my love and tenderneſs to you, has made you look upon me as your only friend and benefactor, and the cauſe of all the comfort and pleaſure that you enjoy. But, my children, you are now in the hands, and under the tender care of a much greater father and friend than I am, whoſe love to you is far greater than mine, and from whom you receive ſuch bleſſings as no mortal can give.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011175_0013_0F862BA9B81934C0"/>
That God whom I daily call upon to bleſs both you and me, and all mankind; whoſe wonderous acts are recorded in thoſe ſcriptures which you conſtantly read.</p>
               <p>That God who created the heavens and the earth, who brought a flood on the old world; who ſaved Noah in the ark; who was the God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, whom Job bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and praiſed in the greateſt afflictions; who delivered the Iſraelites out of the hands of the Egyptians; who was the protector of righteous Joſeph, Moſes, Joſhua and holy Daniel; who ſent his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, to redeem mankind; and gave his holy ſpirit to be our leader, our comforter and director in the path of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth.</p>
               <p>This God who has done all theſe great things; who has created ſo many millions of men; who lived and died before you were born, with whom the ſpirits of good men that are departed this life now live, whom infinite numbers of angels now worſhip in Heaven; this great God is your loving father and friend, your good creator and nouriſher, from whom, and not from me, ye receive your being.</p>
               <p>You ſee, my children, this wide and large firmament over our heads, where the ſun and moon, and all the ſtars appear in their turns: If you were to be carried up to any of theſe bodies at this vaſt diſtance from us, you would ſtill diſcover others as much above you, as the ſtars that you ſee here are above the earth. Were you to go up or down, Eaſt or Weſt,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011175_0014_0F862BA9EED3F5F8"/>North or South, you would find the ſame height without any top, and the ſame depth without any bottom.</p>
               <p>And, my children, ſo great is God, that all thoſe bodies added together, are but as a grain of ſand in his ſight. And yet you are as much the care of this great God and father of all worlds, and all ſpirits, as if he had no other children but you.</p>
               <p>He numbers the hairs of your heads, watches over you ſleeping and waking, and has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you from a thouſand dangers, which neither you nor I know any thing of.</p>
               <p>Therefore, my children, fear and worſhip and love God. Your eyes indeed cannot ſee him, but every thing you ſee, are ſo many marks of his power and preſence, and he his nearer to to you, than any thing that you can ſee.</p>
               <p>Take him for your Lord, and father, and friend; look upon him as the fountain and cauſe of all the good that you have received through my hands, and reverence me only as the bearer and miniſter of God's good things unto you. And he that bleſſed my father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was born, will bleſs you when I am dead.</p>
               <p>Your youth and little minds are only yet acquainted with my family, and therefore you think there is no happineſs out of it. But, my children, you belong to a greater family than mine, you are members of the family of this almighty father of all nations, who has created infinite orders of angels, and numberleſs
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011175_0015_0F862BAAAA071C08"/>generations of men, to be fellow-members of one and the ſame ſociety in heaven.</p>
               <p>You do well to reverence and obey my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe God has given me power over you, to bring you up in his fear, and to do for you, as the holy fathers recorded in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did for their children, who are now in reſt and peace with God.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in a ſhort time die, and leave <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

               <p>Let your thoughts often leave theſe gardens, theſe fields and farms, to contemplate upon God and heaven; to conſider upon angels and the ſpirits of good men living in light and glory.</p>
               <p>God keepeth a book of life wherein all the actions of all men are written; your names are there my children, and when you die, this book will be laid open before men and angels, and according as your actions are there found, you will either be received to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of thoſe holy men who have died before you, or be turned away amongſt wicked ſpirits, that are never to ſee God any more.</p>
               <p>Never forget this book my children, for it is written, and it muſt be open'd, you muſt ſee it, and you muſt be try'd by it: Strive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to fill it with your good deeds, that the hand-writing of God may not appear againſt you.</p>
               <p>God, my children, is all love, and wiſdom,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011175_0016_0F862BAB6E8B2170"/>and goodneſs; and every thing that he has made, and every action that he does, is the effect of them all. Therefore you cannot pleaſe God, but ſo far as you ſtrive to walk in love, wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>When you love that which God loves, you act with him, you join yourſelves to him; and when you love what he diſlikes, then you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and ſeperate yourſelves from him. This is the true and the right way, think what God loves, and do you love it with all your heart.</p>
               <p>Next to this, love your neighbour, which is all the world, with ſuch tenderneſs and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you love yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Think how God loves all mankind, how merciful he is to them, how tender he is of them, how careful he preſerves them, and then ſtrive to love the world as God loves it. God would have all men to be happy, therefore do you will, and deſire the ſame.</p>
               <p>As God has created all things for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of all men, ſo let that part of them, which falls to your ſhare, be employed as God would have all employed, for the common good of all.</p>
               <p>Therefore do good my children, firſt of all to thoſe that moſt deſerve it, but remember to do good to all. The greateſt ſinners receive daily inſtances of God's goodneſs towards them, he nouriſhes and preſerves them, that they may repent, and return to him; do you therefore imitate God, and think no one too bad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your relief and kindneſs, when you ſee that he wants it.</p>
               <p>

And my children conſider, this as a moſt principal thing which I ſhall remember you of, as long as I live with you; hate and deſpiſe all human glory, for it is nothing elſe but human folly. It is the greateſt ſnare, and the greateſt betrayer, that you can poſſibly admit into your heart.</p>
               <p>Love humility in all its inſtances, practiſe it in all its parts; for it is the moſt noble ſtate of the ſoul of man; it will ſet your heart and affections right towards God, and fill you with every temper that is tender and affectionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</p>
               <p>And above all, mark this, never do any thing through ſtrife, or envy, or emulation, or vain glory. Never do any thing in order to excel other people, but in order to pleaſe God, and becauſe it is his will, that you ſhould do every thing in the beſt manner that you can.</p>
               <p>When you come to be more converſant with the world, and ſee what cuſtoms, and pleaſures, and troubles and projects, employ the hearts and time of mankind, you will ſcarce believe that things can be as I have told you. But don't let this affect you, for the devil the god of this world has ſo blinded the eyes of thoſe who refuſe to comply with the calls of grace, that it may, indeed, be ſaid that the world is in a dream, and that few people are awake in it: We fancy that we fall into darkneſs when we die; but, alas, we are moſt of us in the dark till then; and the eyes of our ſouls only begin to ſee when our bodily eyes are cloſing.</p>

For this reaſon, my diſcourſes with you have been to acquaint you with yourſelves, and to accuſtom you to ſuch books and devotion as may beſt inſtruct you in this greateſt of all knowledge.</p>
               <p>When I tell you that you are all of you ſpirits: I don't mean that you have not bodies that want meat and drink, and ſleep and cloathing, but that all that deſerves to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, is nothing elſe but ſpirit.</p>
               <p>A being, ſpiritual and rational in its nature, that is made in the image of God to live for ever, never to ceaſe any more, but to enjoy life, and reaſon, and knowledge and happineſs in the preſence of God, and the ſociety of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and glorious ſpirits to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Every thing that you call yours, beſides this ſpirit, is but like your cloathing; ſomething that is only to be uſed for a while, and then to end, and die, and wear away, and to ſignify no more to you, than the cloathing and bodies of other people.</p>
               <p>You are not only in this manner ſpirits, but you are fallen ſpirits, that began your life in a ſtate of corruption and diſorder, full of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and paſſions, that blind and darken the reaſon of your minds, and incline you to that which is hurtful.</p>
               <p>And obſerve this, my children, as a moſt ſolemn conſideration, That in this fallen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you are utterly unable, by any power of your own, to reſtore yourſelves. It is God alone, by his almighty power, who can, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011175_0019_0F862BADA4BEB918"/>who is deſirous to, perfect this great work in you.</p>
               <p>Your bodies are not only poor and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like your cloaths, but they are like infected cloaths, that ſill you with ill diſeaſe and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which oppreſs the ſoul with ſickly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and vain cravings. So that all of us are like two beings, that have as it were two hearts within us: With the one we ſee, and taſte, and admire reaſon, purity and holineſs; with the other we incline to pride, vanity and ſenſual delights.</p>
               <p>This internal war we always feel within us more or leſs, and if you would know the one thing neceſſary to all the world, it is this, that by a conſtant and fervent application to God for divine help, we may thro' the effectual workings of the redeeming power of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt in our hearts, be enabled to preſerve and perfect all that is rational, holy and divine within us, and mortify, remove and deſtroy all that vanity, pride and ſenſuality, which ſprings from the corruption of our nature.</p>
               <p>You ſee then your ſtate my children; you are by the help of divine grace, to honour, improve and perfect the ſpirit that is within you; to preſerve it from the errors and vanities of the world; to ſave it from thoſe falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and ſenſual tempers which the body tempts it with: That you may taſte, and reliſh and deſire that eternal ſtate, which is to begin when this life ends.</p>

               <p>Contract no fooliſh friendſhips, or vain fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for particular perſons; but love them moſt that moſt turn your love towards God, and your compaſſion towards all the world.

               <p>Never conſider yourſelves, as perſons that are to be ſeen, admired and courted by men; but as poor ſinners, that are to ſave yourſelves from the vanities and follies of a miſerable world, by watching and prayer, by humility and ſelf-denial. Think upon the vanity and ſhortneſs of human life, and let death and eternity be often in your minds, for theſe thoughts will ſtrengthen and exalt your minds, make you wiſe and judicious and truly ſenſible of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of all human things.</p>
               <p>Strive to do every thing that is praiſe worthy, but do nothing in order to be praiſed; nor think of any reward for all your labour of love and virtue, till Chriſt cometh with all his holy angels.</p>
               <p>And above all, my children, have a care of vain and proud thoughts of your own virtue: For as ſoon as ever people live different from the common way of the world, and deſpiſe its vanities, the devil repreſents to their minds the height of their own perfections, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould excel in good works, provided that he can make them proud of them.</p>
               <p>The time of practiſing theſe precepts, my children, will ſoon be over with you; the world will ſoon ſlip through your hands, or rather you will ſoon ſlip through it: It ſeems

               <p>This is the language of the whole new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You are to be dead to the world, and to live a new life in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. But notwithſtanding the clearness and plainneſs of theſe doctrines by which believers in Chriſt are required thus to renounce the world, yet great part of the chriſtians live and die ſlaves to the cuſtoms and tempers of the world. <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls.</hi> Matth. xi. 29. Now this meek, this lowly ſtate, that conſtitutes the true reſt of the ſoul, cannot ſubſiſt in any mind, but ſo far as it is thus dead to the world, and has parted with the deſires of enjoying its riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and honours. So that in order to be truly humble, you muſt unlearn all theſe notions, which you have been all your life learning from this corrupt ſpirit of the world. You can make no ſtand againſt the aſſaults of pride, the meek affections of humility can have no place in your ſouls, till you ſtop the power of the world over you, and reſolve againſt a blind obedience to its laws. And when you are once advanced thus far, as to be able to ſtand ſtill in the torrent of worldly faſhions, and opinions and examine the worth and value of things, which are moſt admired and valued in the world, you have gone a great way in the gaining of your freedom, and have laid a good foundation for the amendment of your heart. Think upon
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011175_0025_0F862BB48A2B2258"/>the rich, the great, and the learned perſons, that have made great figures, and been high in the eſteem of the world, many of them died in your time, and yet they are ſunk, and loſt and gone, and as much diſregarded by the world, as if they had been only ſo many bubbles of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And is it worth your while to loſe the ſmalleſt degree of virtue, for the ſake of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo bad maſter, and ſo falſe a friend as the world is. Is it worth your while to bow the knee to ſuch an idol, as this, that ſo ſoon will have neither eyes, nor ears, nor a heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard you; inſtead of ſerving that great, and holy, and mighty God, that will make all his ſervants partakers of his own eternity.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil world.</hi> Gal. i. 4. Chriſtianity therefore implieth a deliverance from this world; and he that profeſſeth it, profeſſeth to live contrary to every thing, and every temper, that is peculiar to this evil world. The apoſtle John declareth this oppoſition to the world in this manner: <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them: We are of God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 John iv. 5. This is the deſcription of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt; and it is proof enough, that no people are to be reckon'd chriſtians in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who in their hearts and tempers belong to this world. <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith the ſame apoſtle, <hi>that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs.</hi> Chap. v. 19. Chriſtians therefore can no farther know that they are of God, than
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011175_0026_0F862BB53102F388"/>ſo far as they know they are not of the world, that is, that they don't live according to the ways and ſpirit of the world. And he is only of God, or born of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, who has overcome this world, that is, who has choſen to live by faith, and govern his actions by the principles of a wiſdom revealed from God, by Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>They are not of this World, as I am not of this World,</hi> ſays our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. This is the ſtate of Chriſtianity with regard to this world, the profeſſion of Chriſtians requiring them to live as citizens of the new Jeruſalem, and to have their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven. If you are not thus out of, and contrary to the world, you want the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing mark of Chriſtianity; you don't belong to Chriſt, but by being out of the world, as he was out of it. We may deceive ourſelves, if we pleaſe, with vain and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comments upon theſe words; but they are, and will be underſtood in their firſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and plainneſs, by every one that reads them in the ſame ſpirit, that our bleſſed Lord ſpoke them. And to underſtand them in any lower, leſs ſignificant meaning, is to let carnal wiſdom explain away that doctrine, by which itſelf was to be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour ſuffered, and was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to make our ſuffering, and ſacrifice of ourſelves fit to be received by God. And we are to ſuffer, to be crucified, to die, and to riſe with Chriſt; or elſe his crucifixion, death, and reſurrection will profit us nothing. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011175_0027_0F862BB6739C5F30"/>of this conformity to all that Chriſt did, and ſuffered upon our account is very plain from the whole tenor of ſcripture. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to his ſufferings, this is the only condition of our being ſaved by them. <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 11. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> As to his crucifixion, <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him.</hi> Rom. vi. 6. Here you ſee Chriſt is not crucified in our ſtead; but unleſs our old man be really cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him, the croſs of Chriſt will profit us nothing. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the death of Chriſt, the conditions is this: <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt, we believe that we ſhall alſo live with him,</hi> ver. 8. If therefore Chriſt be dead alone, if we are not dead with him, we are as ſure from this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we ſhall not live with him. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to the reſurrection of Chriſt, the ſcripture ſheweth us, how we are to partake of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it: <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God.</hi> Col. iii. 1. It was for this reaſon, that the holy Jeſus ſaid of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and in them of all true believers, <hi>They are not of this world, as I am not of this world.</hi> Becauſe all true believers conforming to the ſufferings, crucifixion, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt, live no longer after the ſpirit and temper of this world, but their life is hid with Chriſt in God. This is the ſtate of ſeperation from the world, to which all orders of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are called. They muſt ſo far renounce all worldly tempers, be ſo far governed by the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011175_0028_0F862BB7246801E0"/>things of another life, as to ſhew, that they are truly and really crucified, dead, and riſen with Chriſt. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 17.</p>
               <p>Even the ancient Philoſophers began all their virtue in a total renunciation of the ſpirit of this world; they ſaw with the eyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that darkneſs was not more contrary to light, than the ſpirit and wiſdom of this world was contrary to divine wiſdom: Therefore they allowed of no progreſs in virtue, but ſo far as a man had overcome himſelf, and the ſpirit of this world. This gave a true ſolidity to all their inſtructions, and proved them to be maſters of true wiſdom. But the doctrine of the croſs of Chriſt, the laſt, the higheſt, the moſt finiſhing ſtroke given to the ſpirit of this world, that ſpeaks more in one word, than all the philoſophy of volumnious writers, is yet profeſſed by thoſe, who are in more friendſhip with the world, than was allowed to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato or Epictetus. Nay, if thoſe ancient ſages were to ſtart up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us with their enlightened wiſdom, they would bid fair to be treated by the ſons of the goſpel, if not by ſome fathers of the church, as dreaming Enthuſiaſts. But, this is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth, the world can only love its own, and wiſdom can only be juſtified of her children. The heaven-born Epictetus told one of his ſcholars, <hi>That then he might firſt look upon himſelf as having made ſome true proficiency in virtue,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011175_0029_0F862BB765D929C8"/>when the world took him for a fool;</hi> an oracle like that, which ſaid, the wiſdom of this world is fooliſhneſs with God.</p>
               <p>If you aſk what is the apoſtaſy of theſe laſt times, or whence is all the degeneracy of the preſent chriſtian church, it muſt be placed to a wordly ſpirit. If here you ſee open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there only form of godlineſs, if here ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſicial holineſs, political piety, there haughty ſanctity, partial zeal, if almoſt every where, you ſee a Jewiſh blindneſs, and hardneſs of heart, and the church trading with the goſpel, as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as the old Jews bought and ſold beaſts in their temple, all this is only ſo many forms, and proper fruits of the worldly ſpirit. This is the great net, with which the devil becomes a fiſher of men; and be aſſured of this, that every ſon of man is in this net, till through and by the ſpirit of Chriſt he breaks out of it. I ſay the ſpirit of Chriſt, for nothing elſe can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from it. If you truſt to any kind or form of religious obſervances, to any kind of learning, or effort of human prudence, then I will tell you what your caſe will be, you will overcome one temper of the world, only and merely by cleaving to another: For nothing can overcome or renounce the world, but ſingly and ſolely the ſpirit of Chriſt. Hence it is, that many learned men, with all the rich furniture of their brain, live and die ſlaves to the ſpirit of this world, the ſpirit of Chriſt is not the only thing that is the deſire of their hearts, and therefore their learning only works in and with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011175_0030_0F862BB8782AB538"/>the ſpirit of this world, and becomes itſelf no ſmall part of the vanity of vanities.</p>
               <p>Would you know the evil nature and effect of a ſpirit given up to the world, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the ſpirit of grace, you need only look at the bleſſed effect of a continual ſtate of watching, a continual humble application to God in the true ſpirit of prayer, for the one goes downwards with the ſame ſtrength, as the other goes upwards, the one betroths, and weds to an earthly nature, with the ſame cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as the other eſpouſes, and unites to Chriſt. The ſpirit of continual watchings and prayer, is a preſſing forth of the ſoul out of this earthly life, it is a ſtretching with all its deſire after the life of God, it is a leaving as far as it can, all its own ſpirit, to receive a ſpirit from above, to be one life, one love, one ſpirit with Chriſt in God. This prayer, which is an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying itſelf of all its own luſts and natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and an opening itſelf for the light and love of God to enter into it, is the prayer in the name of Chriſt, to which nothing is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the love which God bears to the ſoul, is an eternal never ceaſing deſire to open the birth of his holy word and ſpirit in it, and ſtays no longer than till the door of the heart open for him; and nothing does or can keep God out of the ſoul, or hinder his union with it, but the deſire of the heart turned from it. What the ſoul deſireth, that is the fewel of its ſire, and as its fewel is, ſo is the flame of its life. As we ſow we ſhall reap; if to the ſpirit, we
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011175_0031_0F862BB8F8E867B8"/>ſhall reap life and peace; if to the fleſh, we ſhall of the ſleſh reap corruption. Wherever and in whatſoever the will chuſeth to dwell and delight, that becometh the ſoul's food, its cloathing and habitation. Since this is the caſe, let us ſtop a while, let our hearing be turned into feeling. Let us conſider, whether there is any thing in life, that deſerves a thought, but how to keep in a continual ſtate of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer, that we may attain to that purity of heart, which alone can ſee, find and poſſeſs God.</p>

            <div type="account_of_plague">
               <head>A ſhort account of the progreſs and effects of the Plague, the laſt time it ſpread in the city of London, viz. in the year 1665.</head>
               <p>AMONGST the many calamities with which the Almighty is pleaſed to viſit the children of men, in order to reduce them to a juſt ſenſe of their own weakneſs and entire dependence upon him, there is ſcarce any that are more productive of true penitent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and of a ſight of what is really good and truly evil, than thoſe contagious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which an offended God ſometimes ſuffers to rage amongſt the people. In the year 1665 the city of <hi>London</hi> was ſorely viſited by the plague: An account of the progreſs and effects of that viſitation was kept by a citizen who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there during the whole time of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011175_0032_0F862BB9AE6CF6C8"/>ſickneſs, and appears to have been candid and judicious in his remarks thereon. I truſt my readers may, in a ſhort deſcription of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable judgment, meet with ſuch leſſons of beſt wiſdom, which nothing can ſo effectually produce, as a cloſe and ſerious converſe with death and the grave. The introduction of this contagion in <hi>London</hi> was by ſome goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Holland,</hi> which had been brought thither from the <hi>Levant.</hi> It firſt broke out in the houſe where thoſe goods were opened, from whence it ſpread to other houſes. In the firſt. houſe that was infected there died four perſons: A neighbour who went to viſit them returning home, gave the diſtemper to her family, and died with all her houſhold. The pariſh officers who were employed about the ſick perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo infected, the phyſicians perceived the danger, and, upon narrow inſpection, aſſured, that it was indeed the plague with all its terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying particulars, and that it threatened a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral infection. The people began now to be alarmed all over the town; the uſual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week were generally about 240 to 300, but from the 17th to the 24th Jan. the printed bill was 474. However this went off again, and the froſt continuing very ſevere till near the end of February, the bills decreaſed again, and people began to look upon the danger as good as over; but in May the bills greatly increaſed, and the weather becoming hot, the infection ſpread again, in a dreadful manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:011175_0033_0F862BBAA769DFD0"/>
I lived, ſays the author, without Aldgate, and as the diſtemper had not reached to that ſide of the city, our neighbourhood continued eaſy; but at the other end of the town the conſternation was very great, and the nobility and gentry thronged out of the town with their families in an unuſual manner; nothing was to be ſeen but waggons, carts and coaches with goods and people, and horſe-men attending them, hurrying away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, who were apparently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to fetch more people, beſides innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able numbers of people on horſeback, fitted out for travelling. This was a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proſpect; indeed there was nothing elſe of moment to be ſeen; it filled my mind with very ſerious thoughts of the miſery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe that would be left in it. By the end of July the contagion had ſpread and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a great degree: Sorrow and ſadneſs ſat upon every face; and though ſome parts were not yet overwhelmed, all looked deeply concerned. <hi>London</hi> might well be ſaid to be all in tears, the mourners did not go about the ſtreets, for nobody made a formal dreſs of mourning for their neareſt relations, but the voice of mourning was indeed heard in the ſtreets; the ſhrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their houſes where their deareſt relations were dying, were ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to be heard as we paſſed the ſtreets, that it was enough to pierce the ſtouteſt heart in
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011175_0034_0F862BBB26C264D0"/>the world. Tears and lamentations were ſeen almoſt in every houſe, eſpecially in the firſt part of the viſitation; for towards the latter end people did not ſo much concern themſelves for the loſs of their friends, expecting that themſelves ſhould be ſummoned the next hour.</p>
               <p>It was a time of very unhappy breaches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; in matters of religion, diviſions and ſeperate opinions prevailed; the Church of <hi>England</hi> was lately reſtored, and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and other profeſſions had ſet up their meetings for worſhip, apart, in which they were frequently diſturbed, the government endeavouring to ſuppreſs their meetings. But this dreadful viſitation reconciled the different parties, and took away all manner of prejudice and ſcruple from the people. But after the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was over, that ſpirit of charity ſubſided, and things returned to their own channel again. Here we may obſerve, that a nearer view of death would ſoon reconcile men of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to one another, and that it is chiefly owing to our eaſy ſituations in life, and our putting theſe things far from us, that our breaches are formented, and that there is ſo much prejudice and want of chriſtian charity and union amongſt us. A cloſe view and converſe with death, or with diſeaſes that threaten death, would ſcum off the gall of our temper, remove our ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and bring us to ſee with different eyes. On the other ſide of the grave we ſhall all be brethren again.</p>
               <p>The inns of court were now all ſhut up,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011175_0035_0F862BBBE9BAFFA8"/>there was but few lawyers to be ſeen in the city, indeed there was no need of them, for quarrels and diviſions about intereſt had ceaſed; every body was at peace.</p>
               <p>It was alſo worthy of obſervation, as well as fruitful of inſtruction, to obſerve with what alacrity the people of all perſuaſions embraced the opportunities they had of attending upon the publick worſhip, and other appointed times of devotion, as humiliations, faſtings and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick confeſſions of ſins, to implore the mercy of God, and avert the judgment which hung over their heads. The churches were ſo thronged, that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very door of the largeſt churches. There was alſo daily prayers appointed morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, at which the people attended with uncommon devotion.</p>
               <p>All plays and interludes which had lately began to increaſe amongſt us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, publick dancing-rooms and muſick-houſes, which multiplied and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to debauch the manners of the people, were ſhut up and ſuppreſſed, finding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were generally humbled and agitated with other things, death was before their eyes, and every body began to think of their graves.</p>
               <p>The infection ſtill gradually increaſed till the middle of Auguſt, when there died a thouſand a day, by account of the weekly bills, though they never gave a full account by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; many of the pariſh officers were taken
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011175_0036_0F862BBCF3F94088"/>ſick themſelves and died when their account was to be given in. The pariſh of Stepney alone had within the year, one hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſextons, grave-diggers and carriers of the dead, &amp;c. Indeed the work was not of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to allow them leiſure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which were all thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the dark in a pit, to which no man could come near without the utmoſt peril.</p>
               <p>I had, ſays the author, the care of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, which obliged me ſometimes to go abroad. In theſe walks I had diſmal ſcenes before my eyes, as, particularly, of perſons falling dead in the ſtreets, terrible ſhrieks of women, who in their agonies would throw open their chamber-windows, and cry out in a diſmal ſurpriſing manner; it is impoſſible to deſcrible the varicty of poſtures in which the paſſions of the poor people would expreſs themſelves. Paſſing through Token-Houſe yard, of a ſudden a caſement violently opened juſt over my head, and a woman gave three frightful ſcreeches, and then cry'd: <hi>Oh! Death, Death, Death,</hi> which ſtruck me with horror and a chilneſs in my very blood. There was nobody to be ſeen in the whole ſtreet, neither did any window open, for people had no curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity now in any caſe. I went on to paſs into <hi>Bell-Alley,</hi> where there was a greater cry than that; I could hear women and children run ſcreaming about the rooms like diſtracted, when a garret-window opened, and ſomebody from a window on the other ſide aſked, <hi>What
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011175_0037_0F862BBD6473C1B0"/>is the matter?</hi> Upon which it was anſwered, <hi>Oh Lord! my old maſter has hanged himſelf.</hi> The other aſked again, <hi>Is he quite dead?</hi> And the firſt anſwered, <hi>Ay, ay quite dead and cold.</hi> This perſon was a Deputy-Alderman and very rich. But this is but one inſtance; it is ſcarce credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what dreadful caſes happened in particular families every day. People in the rage of the diſtemper or in the torment of the ſwelling, which was indeed intolerable, becoming raving and diſtracted, oftentimes laid violent hands upon themſelves, throwing themſelves out of windows, or breaking out of the houſes, would dance naked about the ſtreets, not knowing one extaſy from another; others, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, would run directly down to the river, and plunge into the water. Some dying of mere grief as a paſſion, and ſome of fright and ſurprize, without having received the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It often pierced my very ſoul, to hear the groans and cries of thoſe who were thus tormented; but this of the ſwellings was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt promiſing particular in the whole infection; for if theſe ſwellings could be brought to break and run, the patient generally recovered. Whereas thoſe who were ſtruck with death at the beginning of the diſtemper, and had ſpots come upon them, often went about indifferent eaſy, till a little before they died, and ſome till the moment they dropt down; ſuch would be taken ſuddenly very ſick, and would run to ſome convenient place, or to their own houſes if poſſible, and there ſit down, grow faint and die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011175_0038_0F862BC046A310F0"/>
Death did not now hover over every one's head only, but looked into their houſes and chambers, and even ſtared in their very faces; and though there was ſome ſtupidity and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, yet there was a great deal of juſt alarm ſounded in the inmoſt ſoul: Many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences were awakened; many hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confeſſion was made of crimes long concealed. People might be heard even in the ſtreets as we paſſed along calling upon God for mercy, through Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaying: I have been a thief; I have been an adulterer; I have been a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and the like; and none durſt ſtop to make inquiry into ſuch things, or to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter comfort to the poor creature, who in the anguiſh both of ſoul and body thus cried out. Many were the warnings that were then given by dying penitents to others, not to put off and delay their repentance to a day of diſtreſs, that ſuch a time of calamity as this was no time for repentance. I wiſh ſays the author, I could repeat the very ſound of thoſe groans and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations that I heard from ſome poor dying creatures, when in the height of their agonies and diſtreſs, and that I could make him that reads this; hear as I imagine, I now hear them, for the ſound ſeems ſtill to ring in my ears. In the beginning of September the number of burials increaſing, the church-wardens of Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate pariſh ordered a large pit to be dug, to hold all the dead which might die in a month, it was about forty feet long and ſixteen broad;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011175_0039_0F862BC1890CD178"/>ſome blamed the church-wardens for ſuffering ſuch a frightful gulf to be dug; nevertheleſs in two weeks they had thrown more than eleven hundred bodies into it, when they were obliged to ſill it up, as the bodies were come within 6 feet of the ſurface. My curioſity drove me to go and ſee this pit, when there had been near four hundered people buried in it. I got admittance into the church-yard, by means of the ſexton, who was a ſenſible, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man. He would have perſuaded me not to go, ſaying, <hi>That it was indeed their duty to venture, and in it they might hope to be preſerved; but that, as I had no apparent call, he thought, my curioſity could not juſtify my running that hazard.</hi> I told him, <hi>I had been preſſed in my mind to go, and that perhaps it might be an inſtructing ſight. Nay,</hi> ſays the good man, <hi>if you will venture upon that ſcore, in the name of</hi> God <hi>go in; it will be a ſermon to you, it may be the beſt you ever heard in your life.</hi> His diſcourſes had ſhock'd my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and I ſtood wavering for a good while; but juſt then I heard the bell-men, and the cart, loaded with dead bodies, appearing, I went in. There was nobody, as I could perceive, at firſt with the cart but the buriers, and the man that led the cart; but when they came to the pit, they ſaw a man muffled in a cloak who appeared in great agony; the buriers immediately gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, ſuppoſing he was one of thoſe poor delirious or deſperate creatures, that would ſometimes run to the pit, wrapt in blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and throw themſelves in, and as they
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011175_0040_0F862BC2A0EB1FC0"/>ſaid bury themſelves. When the buriers came to him, they ſoon found he was neither deſperate nor diſtempered in mind, but one oppreſſed with a dreadful weight of grief, having his wife and ſeveral children all in the cart, that was juſt come in with him, and he followed in agony and exceſs of ſorrow. He calmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the buriers to let him alone, ſaid he would only ſee the bodies thrown in, and go away; ſo they left importuning him. But no ſooner was the cart turned round, and the bodies ſhot into the pit promiſcouſly, which was a ſurpriſe to him, for he at leaſt expected, they would have been decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, I ſay, no ſooner did he ſee the ſight, out he cryed out aloud, unable to contain himſelf, and fell down in a ſwoon; the buriers ran to him, and took him up, and when he was come to himſelf, led him to a place where he was taken care of. He looked into the pit again, as he went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies ſo immediately with throwing earth, that nothing could be ſeen. The cart had in it ſixteen or ſeventeen bodies. Some were wrapt up in linen ſheets, ſome in rugs, ſome little other than naked, or ſo looſe, that what covering they had fell from them, in the ſhooting out of the cart, and they ſell quite naked among the reſt; but the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one elſe, ſeeing they were to be huddled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the common grave of mankind;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011175_0041_0F862BC2ABB97758"/>for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no other way of burials, neither was it poſſible there ſhould.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Hayward,</hi> under-ſexton, that is, grave digger and bearer of the dead, never had the diſtemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it. His wife was employed to nurſe the infected people; yet ſhe herſelf never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The only preſervative he uſed againſt the infection, was holding garlick and rue in his mouth, and ſmoaking tobacco; this I had from his own mouth. His wife's remedy was waſhing her head in vinegar, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her head-clothes ſo with vinegar, as to keep them always moiſt; and if the ſmell of any of thoſe ſhe waited on was more than ordinary offenſive, ſhe ſnuffed vinegar up into her noſe, ſprinkled her head-clothes and held a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief wetted with vinegar to her mouth.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt not omit mentioning the diſpoſition of the people of that day, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their charity to the poor, which indeed was very large both in a publick and a private way. Some pious ladies were ſo zealous in this good work, and ſo conſident in the protection of providence in the diſcharge of this great duty, that they went about themſelves diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting alms, and viſiting the poor families that were infected, in their very houſes, appointing nurſes and apothecaries to ſupply them with what they wanted; thus giving their bleſſings to the poor in ſubſtantial relief, as well as hearty prayers for them. I will not undertake
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011175_0042_0F862BC3703C28E8"/>to ſay, that none of theſe charitable people were ſuffered to die of the plague, but this I may ſay, that I never knew any of them miſcarried, which I mention for the encouragement of others in caſe of like diſtreſs; and doubtleſs, if they, <hi>that give to the poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay it,</hi> thoſe that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and aſſiſt them in ſuch a miſery as this, may hope to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected therein.</p>
               <p>From the middle of Auguſt to the middle of September the infection ſtill increaſed and ſpread itſelf, with an irreſiſtible fury; it was reckoned, that during that time there died no leſs than ſixteen hundred a day, one day with another. It was then that the confuſion and terror was inexpreſſible; the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead, began to fail them; the vigilance of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates was now put to the utmoſt trial. At laſt the violence of the diſtemper came to ſuch a height that the people ſat ſtill looking at one another, and ſeemed quite abandoned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. In a word, people began to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to fear, that there was nothing to be expected but a univerſal deſolation. This deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair made people bold and adventurous, they were no more ſhy of one another, as expecting there was now no avoiding the diſtemper, but that all muſt go, this brought them to crowd into the churches, they inquired no more what condition the people who ſat near them, were
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011175_0043_0F862BC42F33C550"/>in, but looking upon themſelves alſo as ſo many dead corps, they came to the churches without the leaſt caution, and crowded together, as if their lives were of no conſequence, compared to the work which they were come about: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, their zeal in coming, and the earneſtneſs and affectionate attention they ſhewed to what they heard, made it manifeſt what value peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would put upon the worſhip of God, if they thought, every day they attended at the church, would be their laſt. It was in the height of this deſpair, that it pleaſed God to ſtay his hand, and to ſlacken the fury of the contagion, in a manner as ſurpriſing as that of its beginning, and which demonſtrated it to be his own particular hand above the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of means; nothing but omnipotent power could have done it; the contagion, deſpiſed all medicine; death raged in every corner, and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. In that very moment when thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were dead in three weeks, nay, when it was reported three thouſand died in one night, and an hundred thouſand more were taken ſick, when we might well ſay, <hi>Vain was the help of man,</hi> it pleaſed God to cauſe the fury of it to abate, and by his immediate hand to diſarm the enemy. It was wonderful! The phyſicians were ſurpriſed, wherever they viſited, to find their patients better, and in a few days every body was recovering: Nor was this by any
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011175_0044_0F862BC50FF68C40"/>medicine found out, or any new method of cure diſcovered, but it was evidently from the ſecret inviſible hand of him that had at firſt ſent this diſeaſe, as a judgment upon us. Let the philoſophers ſearch for reaſons in nature to account for it, and labour as much as they will to leſſen the debt they owe to their maker; thoſe phyſicians who had the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhare of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in them, were obliged to acknowledge, that it was all ſupernatural. The ſtreets were now full of poor recovering creatures, who appeared very ſenſible and thankful to God for their unexpected deliverance: Yet I muſt own, that as for the generality of the people, it might too juſtly be ſaid of them, as was ſaid of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the hoſt of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that <hi>they ſung his praiſe, but they ſoon forgot his works.</hi>

               <p>The author, who was preſerved unhurt with his whole family, during the time of the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gives in his memoirs a particular account of the many reaſonings and fears which affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind, before he could come to a fixed concluſion, whether to ſtay, and take his lot in the ſtation in which God had placed him, or by leaving the city, run the hazard of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettling himſelf, and loſe his effects which lay ſcattered among the merchants. At the earneſt ſolicitations of his brother he had concluded to go; but being always croſſed in this deſign by ſeveral accidents, it came one morning, as he expreſſes it, very warmly in his mind, whether theſe repeated diſappointments were
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011175_0045_0F862BC5D209FB20"/>not intimations to him, that it was the will of heaven he ſhould not go, which was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a further thought, that if this ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was from God, he was able effectually to preſerve him in the midſt of all deaths and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that would ſurround him, and that if he attempted to ſecure himſelf, by fleeing from his habitation, and acted contrary to theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations, which he believed to be divine, it was a kind of flying from God, who could cauſe his juſtice to overtake him, when and where he thought fit.</p>
               <p>But what finally fixed him in a reſolution to ſtay, and caſt himſelf entirely upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and good pleaſure of the Almighty, was, that at a time, when his thoughts were more than commonly ſeriousupon this weighty ſubject, turning over the bible which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he cryed out, <hi>Well, I know not what to do, Lord direct me!</hi> at that juncture happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtop and caſting his eye on the ſecond verſe of the 91ſt Pſalm, he read to the 10th, as follows, viz. <hi>I will ſay of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortreſs, my God, in him will I truſt. Surely he ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the fowler, and from the noiſom peſtilence. He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt: His truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler. Thou ſhalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day, nor for the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, nor for the deſtruction that waſteth at noon-day. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011175_0046_0F862BC66D87DE58"/>right hand; but it ſhall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes ſhalt thou behold and ſee the reward of the wicked. Becauſe thou haſt made the Lord which is thy refuge, even the moſt high thy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: There ſhall no evil befall thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>AN eminent ſervant of God, who had known deliverance from the dark pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and experimentally felt the powers of the world to come, a few hours before his death, expreſſed himſelf in the following words: <q>There is a ſpirit which I feel, that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things, in hopes to enjoy its own in the end; its hope is to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live all wrath and contention, and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty, or whatſoever is of a nature contrary to itſelf; it ſees to the end of all temptations; as it bears no evil in itſelf, ſo it conceives none in thought to any other; for its ground and ſpring is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and forgiveneſs of God; its crown is meekneſs; its life is everlaſting love unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and takes its kingdom with intreaty, and not with contention, and keeps it by lowlineſs of mind; in God alone it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, though none elſe regard it, or can own its life; 'tis conceived in ſorrow, and brought forth without any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at grief and oppreſſions; it never rejoiceth but through ſufferings, for with the world's joy it is murdered. I found

               <p>A Strong teſtimony to the ſuperior excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of goſpel-love, and to the vanity and emptineſs of worldly enjoyments, is given by Sir John Maſon, who tho' but 63 years old at his death, yet had lived and flouriſhed in the reign of 4 princes, viz. Henry 8th, Edward the 6th, Queen Mary and Elizabeth; and was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-counſellor to them all, and an eye-witneſs of the various revolutions and viciſſitudes of thoſe times. Towards his latter end, being on his death-bed, he called his clark and ſteward, and ſpoke thus to them,—Lo! here have I lived to ſee five princes, and have been privy-counſellor to four of them. I have ſeen the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables in foreign parts, and have been preſent at moſt tranſactions for 30 years together, and I have learned this after ſo many years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſeriouſneſs is the greateſt wiſdom, temperance the beſt phyſic, and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the beſt eſtate; and were I to live again, I would change the court for a cloiſter, my privy-counſellor's buſtle, for an hermit's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and the whole life I have lived in the palace for an hour's enjoyment of God in the chapel. All things elſe forſake me, beſide my God, my duty, and my prayers."</p>
               <p>SECRETARY Walſingham, is alſo a remarkable inſtance of the ſame kind. He was a man
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011175_0048_0F862BC7E9403228"/>of very great note, in Queen Elizabeth's days. In a letter to his fellow-ſecretary, Burleigh, then lord treaſurer of England, he writes thus, <q>We have lived enough to our country, our fortunes, our ſovereign: It is high time we begin to live to ourſelves, and to our God:</q> Which giving occaſion for ſome court-droll to viſit and try to divert him. <q>Ah, ſaid he, while we laugh, all things are ſerious round about us, God is ſerious, when he preſerveth us, and hath patience towards us; Chriſt is ſerious when he dieth for us; the Holy Ghoſt is ſerious when he ſtriveth with us; the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is ſerious in ſerving God and us: they are ſerious in hell and in heaven. And ſhall a man that hath one foot in the grave, jeſt and laugh?</q>
