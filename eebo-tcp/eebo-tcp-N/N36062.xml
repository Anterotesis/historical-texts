            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

muſt have a handkerchief tied over your eyes to catch your tears; but if you tell fibs you muſt be whipped very hard indeed, and ſhook, and have your mouth tied up, that you may not ſpeak at all. And you muſt go without your dinner; for when your mouth is tied up you cannot eat, you know. It would be a ſad thing to be ſo puniſhed: beſide, I ſhould never know how to believe any thing you ſaid, if you did not always ſpeak the truth; ſo I hope you will never be ſo naughty as to tell fibs; and then I ſhall never be angry with you: Shall I tell you a ſtory of a naughty girl who told fibs?</p>

Only think what a ſad thing that was; but it was her own fault, and ſhe deſerved it, you know, for telling a fib, and not keeping her word, going to the window when ſhe told her

                  <p>Yes, becauſe laſt night you were very good, but the night before, when you were at Miſs <hi>Pippin'</hi>s, you were very naughty. If you remember, you behaved like a very ſilly child, and cried when you were in the garden.</p>

                  <p>So I do, and I ſay too that little girls ſhould turn out their toes, and make pretty courteſies; and that ſhe does much better than you indeed. And ſhe oftener ſays <hi>Sir,</hi> and <hi>Madam,</hi> when ſhe ſpeaks to any body, than you do; ſo that

                  <speaker>MAMMA.</speaker>
                  <p>O, my dear, you ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſay ſo: people ſhould never praiſe themſelves, that looks very fooliſh indeed; if you <hi>are</hi> good, every body will ſee it, and you ſhould leave it for them to ſay ſo; though I am afraid if people knew how often you are naughty and cry, they would not think you very good; and as you do know yourſelf, if you will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that, I fancy you cannot think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a very good girl. Do not you know that you cry ſometimes and fret, becauſe you have not your pudding given to you
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:047092_0043_1022A9CB3B4606C8"/>
at dinner juſt at the time you want it; or becauſe you want to ſit up in the window, or go into the garden; and ſometimes you do not do as you are bid, and do not ſpeak
<figure/>
as you ſhould do when you are ſpoken to. Only recollect all theſe things, and I think you will not call yourſelf good; for indeed

till you leave off being ſo ſilly, nobody will think you ſo.</p>

                  <p>I tell you my dear, people <hi>never</hi> call themſelves good; it does not ſound pretty at all; but if ever you ſhould like to have other people <hi>think</hi> you ſo, you muſt leave off every thing that is ſilly; and always do every thing that is quite right; and if ever you ſhould come to be <hi>ſo</hi> good, we will talk about it again;—but I am in a hurry now, and muſt go up ſtairs.</p>

                  <p>LOOK here Papa, ſee what a nice wheelbarrow I have made with cards, <figure/>

have not I? I have made the wheel of cork. Is it not a very nice one, Sir?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>PAPA.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, it is a very good one, did you cut the cards yourſelf? Did not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body help you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
                  <p>No, nobody helped me. I did it all myſelf. Do not you think I am a clever boy; and that when I grew up, I ſhall be a clever man?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>PAPA.</speaker>
                  <p>O! I do not know what to ſay to that; you muſt learn a great many things indeed, before you will be either a clever boy, or clever man. This wheelbarrow is very well made, and the cards are cut ſmooth and even, but many people can do ſome few things well, who yet are not <hi>clever.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:047092_0047_1022A9D4C26DC3E0"/>
Billy Blue</hi> can make nice boxes of paper, and cut out horſes, and cows; but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read or ſpell a word, and I am ſure that is not being a clever boy. <hi>Tom Wright</hi> draws houſes, and trees, and makes very pretty carts, but then he cannot read; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does he come when he is called, or do as he is bid, but ſtands with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in his mouth, and looks ſo ſilly and croſs, that I am ſure he is not clever at all. Neither, <hi>Philip,</hi> will you be a clever boy, unleſs you take great pains to learn to read, and write, and every thing that you are taught, and are always good humoured, and do not cry as you did this morning, becauſe your ſiſter took away your ball; you never will be thought clever till you

                  <speaker>PAPA.</speaker>
                  <p>When you do not do as you are bid the moment you are ſpoken to; and when you fret, and cry, and do not eat your

bread, becauſe it is not cut in the ſhape you want it: do not you remember crying the other day, when your bread was cut thicker than you happened to wiſh it ſhould be, becauſe you wanted to call it bread and butter? Do not you remember it <hi>Philip?</hi>

                  <p>MY dear little <hi>Eliza</hi> you are a very good girl indeed, and I love you dearly.

                  <p>Yes, indeed Madam I do; for I am ſure you are very kind to me, and take great care of me, and put yourſelves to a great deal of trouble to teach me to read, and write, and work, and to give me victuals, and to make my cloaths. I am ſure I ought to be very good indeed, for that is all that I can do to pleaſe you. I am too little to take any care of you, and as I have got no money to buy victuals or drink for you, nor can make your cloaths, ſo I ſhould be very good that I may give you as little trouble as poſſible. When I am older and have money of my own, I will buy things for you, and then I will make all <hi>your</hi> cloaths, Mamma, as you <hi>now</hi>

any thing for good girls. But, my love, when you and your ſiſter are big enough to work for your Papa, and me, we ſhall not want to play with your dolls, we ſhall never be children again.</p>

                  <p>I hope ſo. All good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren always love their parents; and then when they grow up, and have little boys and girls of their own, they are beloved by them. Shall I tell you a hiſtory of a good girl and a naughty girl?</p>

                  <p>There were two little girls, one's name was <hi>Ann</hi> and the other <hi>Clara.</hi>

Miſs <hi>Ann</hi> was always very good, and took great pains to do every thing that ſhe was deſired; and tried to pleaſe her Papa and Mamma, and make all her friends happy. She uſed often to think how much care her parents took, to teach her to write, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to every thing which was proper for her to learn; and if ſhe did not mind them, ſhe knew it was only troubling them for nothing. So if they deſired her to hold up her head, or put back her ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or turn out her toes, or do any thing elſe, ſhe always did it directly, to ſave them the trouble of ſpeaking again. You may be ſure ſhe was ſo very good, every body loved her, and did all they could to pleaſe her; and ſhe was very happy, for ſhe was
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:047092_0057_1022A9EFF15E5228"/>
quite good-humoured, and never cried. And when ſhe grew up ſhe was a very good woman, and becauſe her Papa was
<figure/>
lame, ſhe uſed to take him by the hand, and lead him to his chair, and ſaid, let <hi>me</hi> lead you now you are lame; for when I
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:047092_0058_1022A9F294C3C3F0"/>
was a little girl, and could not go alone, <hi>you</hi> uſed to lead <hi>me,</hi> and take great care that I ſhould not fall down; ſo now I am able to help <hi>you,</hi> pray give me leave to lead you about. Her Mamma's eyes were very bad, and ſhe could hardly ſee, ſo <hi>Ann</hi> uſed to ſay, Pray, Madam, let me cut your victuals for you. When I was a little girl, and could not do it for myſelf, you every day took great care to cut mine; ſo pray give me leave to cut it for you now, I being able to help you; nothing gives me ſo much pleaſure as to aſſiſt you, and work for you, and take care of you, now your eyes are bad and you cannot help yourſelf. In
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:047092_0059_1022A9F568F2F4B8"/>
this manner <hi>Ann</hi> always behaved to her Papa and Mamma, when they were grown old; and ſo they always loved her dearly, and every body loved her who knew her, and uſed to ſay, See what a good woman Miſs <hi>Ann</hi> is! And when ſhe had children of her own, ſhe taught <hi>them</hi> to be good, as <hi>her</hi> parents had taught <hi>her;</hi> and then when <hi>ſhe</hi> grew old, and was lame, and had bad eyes, <hi>they</hi> uſed to take care of her, and love her, as ſhe had loved <hi>her</hi> father and moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This, my dear, is the hiſtory of Miſs <hi>Ann.</hi> But Miſs <hi>Clara</hi> was not half ſo good, and therefore nobody loved her. When ſhe was little ſhe never minded what was ſaid to her; but troubled her Papa and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:047092_0060_1022A9F7FA6AE138"/>
to ſpeak about the ſame thing a great many times, which was very naughty. She had a ſilly trick of putting her fingers in her mouth, and when her friends were ſo kind, as to trouble themſelves to tell her not to do ſo, ſhe would not mind them, but ſtill kept them in her mouth, and looked very croſs and fooliſh; as all children do, who ſuck their fingers or thumbs. And if they told her any thing elſe, ſhe did not mind what was ſaid to her; but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a naughty girl. And ſo when ſhe grew up ſhe was only a naughty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and when her Papa and Mamma grew old and lame, ſhe would take no care of them; but ran away and left them

                     <figure/>
to creep after her as well as they could. Only think what a ſhocking naughty thing that was! not to help her poor Papa and Mamma who had been ſo very good and kind to her, and taken ſo much care of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:047092_0062_1022A9FD0EDAEEC8"/>
her, when ſhe was little and could not help herſelf. If, when ſhe was little, <hi>they</hi> had left <hi>her,</hi> as <hi>ſhe</hi> left <hi>them</hi> when they were old, ſhe would have been frozen with cold, and ſtarved with hunger. O! what a ſad naughty woman ſhe was. And ſo when ſhe had little children of her own, ſhe did not know how to teach them to be good, becauſe ſhe was naughty herſelf, therefore they were naughty too; and when they grew to be men and women, were as croſs to <hi>her,</hi> as <hi>ſhe</hi> was to her poor old Papa and Mamma. Now, my dear, I have told you the hiſtory of a good girl, and a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty girl: which do you think you ſhall chuſe to be like?</p>

                     </hi> I ſhould not chuſe to be like her. I love you Mamma, and if you were blind or lame, I am ſure I would take great care of you. Though I am but little, I could lead you about now if you were lame; and I could put the victuals into your mouth, when ſomebody had cut it; and I could break the bread <hi>myſelf</hi> for you.</p>
