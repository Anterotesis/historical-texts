            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE General-Aſſembly of this State was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, never convened at a ſeaſon that called louder for the wiſdom of the wiſe, the underſtanding of the aged, the ſpeech of the truſty, or the guidance of him who is wonderful in counſel and excellent in working.—No, not in thoſe trying hours, when, in the face of the hoſtile power of Britain, the arm of America was lifted to Heaven, and ſhe declared ſovereign and independent. If to recover the bewildered traveller is as intereſting as to point him his way at firſt—if to extricate from embarraſſments require as much wiſdom as to prevent them—and if to ſave a kingdom is as important as to found one, the truth of thoſe declarations will be readily conceded.</p>
            <p>THE fair morning that dawned over this infant empire, promiſing a ſerene and glorious day, is ſoon changed: the curtains of the heavens are ſpread, murmurs are heard in every region, "dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs covers the land, and groſs darkn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, the people."</p>
            <p>UNDER theſe circumſtances, it is matter of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar regret, that you are denied the learning, wiſdom, and piety, of that aged maſter of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev.

who was to have led you, this morning, to the altar of God, and brought you the meſſage from his ſacred word; and by this diſappointment you are called to attend upon one, who is but a Son in the Goſpel, who would not have been ſo early choſen to this ſervice, could ſuch a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment have been ſuppoſed probable. But taught to obey every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake, "being called I came without gain-ſaying, and would now aſk for what intent you have ſent for me?" Educated in the ſchool of the Prophets, with which politics are not neceſſarily connected, you muſt expect no direction in your civil police. It would be almoſt preſumption in any of this deſcription, and would be arrogance in me, in our preſent deranged and diſtracted ſtate, when the wiſeſt Palinurus ſcarce knows which way to ſteer, to dictate to thoſe who have made politics their ſtudy.</p>
            <p>I APPEAR, brethren, as a meſſenger from the Lord of Hoſts, and as a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt,

            <p>THERE is a GOD—and MAN is his creature.—The ſovereign, independent, and all-perfect character of GOD, and the weak, dependant, and imperfect character of MAN, are clearly ſeen from the light of nature, reaſon, and experience. He muſt be a fool and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, who ſaith in his heart, there is no God; or boaſts of his own powers and faculties, as though he had not received them.</p>
            <p>WHEREVER we go, though among the moſt barbarous of the earth, we ſee the Temple and the Altar, the ſacrifice and the oblation, tokens of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged dependance upon an unſeen Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:020253_0008_0FAE9CB4759698F0"/>
WHAT the light of nature dictates, revelation confirms, and teaches us, that though God made man after his own image, and gave him diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed powers and capacities to be his ſubordinate guides and directors, in the duties of his elevated ſtation; yet he communicated but his image, not his nature. He retained man dependant upon himſelf, and in his beſt ſtate man needed habitual inſtruction and direction from his all-wiſe Creator.</p>
            <p>THIS golden age is paſt, the powers of man have ſuffered an humiliating ſhock in the ſad apoſtacy of our race from God. "The underſtanding is darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in us, by reaſon of the blindneſs of our hearts," and though man would be wiſe, he is born with very little preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the exalted character.</p>
            <p>MANY are the inſtances, in private life, in mere perſonal concerns, where the wiſdom of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fails him, and he knows not what to do; well may we ſuppoſe it will not be more adequate to the complicated affairs of civil government, which involve the duty and intereſt of many indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, or that thoſe who are honored with the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020253_0009_0FAE9CB530C219F8"/>
important charge of guiding and directing theſe will feel themſelves in leſs need of a ſuperior influence.</p>
            <p>THERE is an inſtinctive propenſity in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in ſcenes of perplexity and diſtreſs, eſpecially if they are become ſufficiently preſſing, to look out for foreign aid; and the light of reaſon leads us ultimately to him who teacheth man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and giveth him underſtanding.</p>
            <p>PRAYER to God for wiſdom is a duty of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral religion; and perhaps no nation can be named that has not ſought, in ſome expreſſive way, to the Deity it acknowledged, for help in trouble, and guidance in important affairs of government. The Heathen mariners, with whom Jonah fled to Tarſhiſh, applied to this duty in the hour of their diſtreſs, and thought him a miracle of ſtupidity that he could ſleep and neglect it. The Romans, no leſs renowned for their wiſdom than their valor, paid a very aſſiduous attention to this duty; they conſulted their auſpices at the appointment of their civil and military officers, and at the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every deſign of conſequence. What they did from the unaſſiſted light of nature, we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020253_0010_0FAE9CB79FA2A200"/>
to do by the light of divine revelation, and that glorious Being from whom alone help comes, ſays, "If any man lack wiſdom, let him aſk of God." And he not only points us our duty, but enjoins it under the higheſt encouragement; for he aſſures us, <hi>he gives liberally.</hi> He is the all-wise and infinitely good God, and never ſaid to any, ſeek ye me in vain.</p>
            <p>THE words of the text ſeem to be deſigned for the direction and encouragement of an individual in his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ate concerns, but they apply with higher energy and encouragement to thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the concerns of thouſands of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, in proportion to the greater dignity of their ſtation, the more intricate perplexity of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the more extenſive influence of their meaſures. And he not only gives liberally, but <hi>he upbraideth not:</hi> he does not, as is too often the caſe with human counſellors, cenſure the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ignorance of his ſupplicants, the trifling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the occaſions upon which they apply, or their paſt neglect of him. He is not wearied with the frequency of their addreſſes, nor with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and perſeverance with which they purſue them. <hi>He upbraideth not,</hi> but cloſes his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020253_0011_0FAE9CB870509B48"/>
with a promiſe of ſucceſs to him who aſks aright, it ſhall be given him. The meek he will guide in judgment; the meek he will teach his way.</p>
            <p>THEY who are unacquainted with the great truths of the Goſpel, may be accepted in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate application to the throne of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; but they who have heard of Jeſus the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, is advocate and interceſſor at the right hand of God, muſt approach in his name as they would hope for audience and acceptance; for no man cometh to the Father but by him, and there is no other name in which we can be heard. The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſuggeſts as much in the words immediately following the text, when he ſays, "Let him aſk in faith nothing wavering," for Chriſt is the author, the object, and the medium of faith; and "what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we aſk the father in his name, believing, we ſhall receive."</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible there are thoſe who, from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perfections of the Deity, endeavor to derive an argument againſt prayer; and improve the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the divine character as a reaſon for withold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all explicit homage. Their argument is, that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020253_0012_0FAE9CB949F73560"/>
as God is an omniſcient and infinitely benevolent Being, he muſt know all our wants, and be ready to ſupply them; and as he is the unchanging God, the moſt fervent addreſſes can be of no efficacy. But the argument miſtakes the end and deſign of prayer, which is not to inform God, or influence him to change, but to render us proper objects of divine mercies, and fit us to receive them; and nothing can be plainer, from the word of God, than that prayer is the enjoined duty of thoſe that need mercies, and the uſual pre-requiſite of Heaven to their beſtowal. "Aſk and ye ſhall receive, I will be inquired of to do it for them. If any of you lack wiſdom, let him aſk of God." If this be true, the omniſcience and unchangableneſs of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the ſtrongeſt arguments for prayer; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it he muſt, in an ordinary way, ſee us unfit to receive mercies, and muſt change his uſual method to beſtow them.</p>
            <p>IN anſwer to our prayers for wiſdom and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are not to expect any oracular reſponſes, or miraculous communications; but a ſecret divine energy attending the exerciſe of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that heaven has given us to improve, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their uſe, ſtrengthening them in exerciſe,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020253_0013_0FAE9CB9C0D3F9A0"/>
removing darkneſs and difficulties out of the way, and fixing in thoſe reſolves which he will approve, whoſe counſel ſhall ſtand, and who will do all his pleaſure. Shall ſuch communications be thought impoſſible or improbable, from him who is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Who is the Father of our ſpirits, acquainted with all their powers and principles, and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have intimate acceſs to them? Are they not communications that are conſentaneous to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious character of God, as the all-perfect ſpirit, and to the character of man as a rational, moral, and yet dependant creature? "Man's heart deviſeth his way, but the Lord directeth his ſteps. He giveth underſtanding to the ſimple, and taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs." The objections to this duty, the ſcruples concerning it, originate in infidelity and ignorance of God.</p>
            <p>I HAVE already ſuggeſted the ſupplications and ſacrifices of the Romans for wiſdom in the faireſt era of their commonwealth; farther to inforce the duty, as incumbent upon thoſe that are intruſted with the affairs of ſtates and empires, let me call your recollection to the attention paid to it by the renowned leaders of that people whoſe hiſtory is handed down in the ſacred pages. Moſes, their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020253_0014_0FAE9CBA868D3F00"/>
lawgiver and deliverer, was a man of prayer, and though he had the ſpecial tokens of the divine preſence with him, in the pillars of cloud and fire, to be his general directors; yet, on various emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, we find him proſtrate before Jehovah, ſeeking ſpecial guidance and direction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precating evils that impended his people, and the effect of his prayers, not once nor twice, was the averting of thoſe evils, and proved the lengthening of their tranquility. David, no leſs diſtinguiſhed for his valor than his piety, aſked counſel of the Lord in a great variety of inſtances. Solomon, his ſon, the wiſeſt of men, when he was about ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his father in the throne of Iſrael, moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſought the Lord for a wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, to guide him in his kingdom. And in what attitude did he ever appear more dignified and exalted! God granted him his requeſt, and what nation ever enjoyed greater power and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, or roſe to more exalted heights of national glory, than this, under his adminiſtration, 'till he forſook the Lord, and called upon Gods that could not ſave? Hezekiah beſought the Lord for a way of eſcape, in a moſt critical and threatening ſituation, and the Lord opened it for him, and reſtored proſperity. Jehoſaphat, in like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020253_0015_0FAE9CB48A9AAA8"/>
fell proſtrate before the Lord, and in theſe expreſſive laconic terms, poured forth his heart: Our God—we know not what to do: but our eyes are upon thee. And he ſtood ſtill, and ſaw the ſalvation of God. What need I more ſay?—the time would fail me to mention the inſtances that might be adduced from the rulers of Iſrael and Judah. Let it ſuffice to obſerve, that in them was verified that obſervation of the wiſeſt of their kings, that when the righteous were in authority, the people rejoiced; but when the wicked bore rule, the people mourned.</p>
            <p>As we have examples of attention to this duty in the wiſeſt and beſt characters, and of ſucceſs following it, ſo we are not deſtitute of inſtances of unwiſe adminiſtration, and fooliſh reſolves, aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the neglect of this duty. The children of Iſrael, impoſed upon by the craft and ſubtilty of the Gibeonites, entered into a league with them, which was injurious to their intereſts, and led them to violate the expreſs injunctions of Jehovah; and this their raſh and unwiſe procedure is aſcribed to their neglect to aſk counſel of the Lord. They that honor God he will honor, and they that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe him he will lightly eſteem. The moral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

IN a dark and threatening day, you are called to an high and honorable ſtation. You have the moſt flattering teſtimonies to your wiſdom and abilities in thoſe ſuffrages of freemen, which have placed in your hands their moſt important temporal concerns, in their preſent perplexed and embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate. Yet I ſhould pay but an ill compliment to your heads or your hearts, to ſuppoſe you felt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves equal to the arduous taſk; or were uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of your needing ſuperior inſtruction and guidance. Unable to afford any direction my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I have endeavored to point you to him who teacheth man knowledge, and giveth him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and to refreſh your memories with a direction that he has given to them that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed. His miniſters you are, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of freemen: all civil rulers ſtand in this elevated ſtation, and are clothed with a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated power from the King of Kings. This is an additional reaſon why they ſhould wait on God for inſtruction. The foreign miniſter of an earthly monarch, would ſoon meet the frowns of his royal maſter, who, in affairs important and perplexed, ſhould neglect to aſk inſtruction, when there was an opportunity of obtaining it.

It is only to be regretted that you have not had a more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful maſter of aſſemblies to lead your devotions.—You will, doubtleſs, commence the buſineſs of every day with humble prayer to God, and in thoſe addreſſes be careful not to repeat the folly of God's ancient people, of drawing nigh with the lip and honoring with the mouth, while the heart is far from him.

This heightens the importance of the offices that are to be filled by your ſuffrages, and ſhews your need of a divine influence to guide you in your choice. Let nothing be done through prejudice or partiality, and remember that thoſe are not, in general, moſt worthy of offices who ſeek them, but thoſe who are ſought by them. If you lack wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, aſk it of God: imitate the example of the Apoſtles, who, though poor in this world, were under a divine guidance, and ſay, "Thou, Lord, who knoweſt the hearts of all, ſhew whether of theſe thou haſt choſen."</p>

THE embarraſſed ſtate of our finances; the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of public and private debts; and ways and means of relief; will, probably, employ many of your hours; and it is not impoſſible that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of paper-money will again call up your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And will you not need wiſdom to guide you in this labyrinth? If the circulating medium could be increaſed, it would probably afford ſome relief in our preſent exigencies; and, if the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of New-Hampſhire are in poſſeſſion of the fancied philoſopher's ſtone, or the fabled tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting touch of Midas, they might liſten to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of paper-money; but if they are not, reaſon and experience reprobate the meaſure, as having a direct tendency to put out of circulation every ſhilling of hard money, as a mean of further em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, and an engine of oppreſſion, fraud, and cruelty, and no wiſdom, human or divine, can dictate a meaſure that leads to ſuch evils.

            <p>THE only probable way of increaſing the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating medium, to the benefit of the public, is by giving up, forever, the idea of paper-money; and by a ſtrict regard to juſtice in all public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, reſtoring to men of property in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a confidence, that when they have parted

This habitual application to God, for guidance and direction, will not only ſecure you the ſecret influence you need, as it is God's appointed method of beſtowing it, but it will have a natural tendency to bring coolneſs and candor into your debates, to form your minds to that ſerene and placid ſtate, which, like the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled ſurface of the water, reflects the images of objects juſt as they are, and it will ſuppreſs that prejudice and partiality, thoſe heated paſſions and prepoſſeſſions from which the greateſt minds are not free, but which form as falſe a medium of viſion as the agitated ſurface of the troubled deep.
