            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>IT is ſuppoſed that a collection of the papers which have made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Gazettes of this City, under the Title of the FEDERALIST, may not be without effect in aſſiſting the public judgment on the momentous queſtion of the Conſtitution for the United States, now under the conſideration of the people of America. A deſire to throw full light upon ſo intereſting a ſubject has led, in a great meaſure unavoidably, to a more copious diſcuſſion than was at firſt intended. And the undertaking not being yet completed, it is judged adviſeable to divide the collection into two Volumes, of which the enſuing Numbers conſtitute the firſt. The ſecond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The particular circumſtances under which theſe papers have been written, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it impracticable to avoid violations of

method and repetitions of ideas which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but diſpleaſe a critical reader. The latter defect has even been intentionally indulged, in order the better to impreſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular arguments which were moſt material to the general ſcope of the reaſoning. Reſpect for public opinion, not anxiety for the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary character of the performance, dictates this remark. The great wiſh is, that it may promote the cauſe of truth, and lead to a right judgment of the true intereſts of the community.</p>

                     <p>AFTER an unequivocal experience of the ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the ſubſiſting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new conſtitution for the United States of America. The ſubject ſpeaks its own importance; comprehending in its conſequences, nothing leſs than the exiſtence of the UNION, the ſafety and welfare of the parts of which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the fate of an empire, in many reſpects, the moſt intereſting in the world. It has been frequently remarked, that it ſeems to have been reſerved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important queſtion, whether ſocieties of men are really capable or not, of eſtabliſhing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever deſtined to depend, for their political conſtitutions, on accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the criſis, at which we are arrived, may with propriety be regarded as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:021127_0007_0FB23B7C4C00D0A0"/>
that deciſion is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we ſhall act, may, in this view, deſerve to be conſidered as the general misfortune of mankind.</p>
                     <p>This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to thoſe of patriotiſm to heighten the ſolicitude, which all conſiderate and good men muſt feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice ſhould be directed by a judicious eſtimate of our true intereſts, unperplexed and unbiaſſed by conſiderations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wiſhed, than ſeriouſly to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations, affects too many particular intereſts, innovates upon too many local inſtitutions, not to involve in its diſcuſſion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, paſſions and prejudices little favourable to the diſcovery of truth.</p>
                     <p>Among the moſt formidable of the obſtacles, which the new conſtitution will have to encounter, may readily be diſtinguiſhed the obvious intereſt of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain claſs of men in every ſtate to reſiſt all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument and conſequence of the offices they hold under the ſtate-eſtabliſhments—and the perverted ambition of another claſs of men, who will either hope to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandiſe themſelves by the confuſions of their country, or will flatter themſelves with fairer proſpects of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the ſubdiviſion of the empire into ſeveral partial confederacies, than from its union under one government.</p>
                     <p>It is not, however, my deſign to dwell upon obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be diſingenuous to reſolve indiſcriminately the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of any ſet of men (merely becauſe their ſituations might ſubject them to ſuſpicion) into intereſted or ambitious view<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hereafter make its appearance, will ſpring from ſources, blameleſs at leaſt, if not reſpectable, the honeſt errors of minds led aſtray by preconceived jealouſies and fears. So numerous indeed and ſo powerful are the cauſes, which ſerve to give a falſe bias to the judgment, that we upon many occaſions, ſee wiſe and good men on the wrong as well as on the right ſide of queſtions, of the firſt magnitude to ſociety. This circumſtance, if duly attended to, would furniſh a leſſon of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to thoſe, who are ever ſo thoroughly perſuaded of their being in the right, in any controverſy. And a further reaſon for caution, in this reſpect, might be drawn from the reflection, that we are not always ſure, that thoſe who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagoniſts. Ambition, avarice, perſonal animoſity, party oppoſition, and many other motives, not more laudable than theſe, are apt to operate as well upon thoſe who ſupport as upon thoſe who oppoſe the right ſide of a queſtion. Were there not even theſe inducements to modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing could be more ill judged than that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerant ſpirit, which has, at all times, characteriſed political parties. For, in politics as in religion, it is equally abſurd to aim at making proſelytes by fire and ſword. Hereſies in either can rarely be cured by perſecution.</p>
                     <p>And yet however juſt theſe ſentiments muſt appear to candid men, we have already ſufficient indications, that it will happen in this as in all former caſes of great national diſcuſſion. A torrent of angry and malignant paſſions will be let looſe. To judge from the conduct of the oppoſite parties, we ſhall be led to conclude, that they will mutually hope to evince the juſtneſs of their opinions, and to increaſe the number of their converts by the loudneſs of their declamations, and by the bitterneſs of their invectives. An enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be ſtigmatiſed, as the off-ſpring of a temper fond of deſpotic power and hoſtile to the principles of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

An overſcrupulous jealouſy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be repreſented as mere pretence and artifice; the ſtale bait for popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity at the expence of public good. It will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, on the one hand, that jealouſy is the uſual concomitant of violent love, and that the noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm of liberty is too apt to be infected with a ſpirit of narrow and illiberal diſtruſt. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten, that the vigour of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eſſential to the ſecurity of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a ſound and well informed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their intereſts can never be ſeparated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the ſpecious maſk of zeal for the rights of the people, than under the forbidding appearances of zeal for the firmneſs and efficiency of government. Hiſtory will teach us, that the former has been found a much more certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It may perhaps be thought ſuperfluous to offer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be imagined has no adverſaries. But the fact is, that we already hear it whiſpered in the private circles of thoſe who oppoſe the new conſtitution, that the Thirteen States are of too great extent for any general ſyſtem, and that we muſt of neceſſity reſort to ſeparate confederacies of diſtinct portions of the whole.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame idea, tracing the arguments to their conſequences, is held out in ſeveral of the late publications againſt the new conſtitution.</note> This doctrine will, in all probability, be

                     <p>WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to decide a queſtion, which, in its conſequences, muſt prove one of the moſt important, that ever engaged their attention, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their taking a very comprehenſive, as well as a very ſerious view of it, will be evident.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is more certain than the indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of government; and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is inſtituted, the people muſt cede to it ſome of their natural rights, in order to veſt it with requiſite powers. It is well worthy of conſideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the intereſt of the people of America, that they ſhould, to all general purpoſes, be one nation, under one federal government, than that they ſhould divide themſelves into ſeparate confederacies, and give to the head of each, the ſame kind of powers which they are adviſed to place in one national government.</p>
                     <p>It has until lately been a received and uncontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted opinion, that the proſperity of the people of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021127_0012_0FB23B83454522E8"/>
America depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wiſhes, prayers and efforts of our beſt and wiſeſt citizens have been conſtantly directed to that object. But politicians now appear, who inſiſt that this opinion is erroneous, and that inſtead of looking for ſafety and happineſs in union, we ought to ſeek it in a diviſion of the ſtates into diſtinct confederacies or ſovereignties. However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheleſs has its advocates; and certain characters who were much oppoſed to it formerly, are at preſent of the number. Whatever may be the arguments or inducements, which have wrought this change in the ſentiments and declarat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>emen, it certainly would not be wiſe in the people at large to adopt theſe new political tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded in truth and ſound Policy.</p>
                     <p>It has often given me pleaſure to obſerve, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent America was not compoſed of detached and diſtant territories, but that one connected, fertile, wide ſpreading country, was the portion of our weſtern ſons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner bleſſed it with a variety of ſoils and productions, and watered it with innumerable ſtreams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A ſucceſſion of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together; while the moſt noble rivers in the world, running at convenient diſtances, preſent them with highways for the eaſy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of friendly aids, and the mutual tranſportation and exchange of their various commodities.</p>
                     <p>With equal pleaſure I have as often taken notice, that Providence has been pleaſed to give this one connected country, to one united people, a people deſcended from the ſame anceſtors, ſpeaking the ſame language, profeſſing the ſame religion, attached to the ſame principles of government, very ſimilar in their manners and cuſtoms, and who, by their joint counſels, arms and efforts, fighting ſide by ſide
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021127_0013_0FB23B84C7A71B40"/>
throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their general liberty and independence.</p>
                     <p>This country and this people ſeem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the deſign of Providence, that an inheritance ſo proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the ſtrongeſt ties, ſhould never be ſplit into a number of unſocial, jealous and alien ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties.</p>
                     <p>Similar ſentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and denominations of men among us. To all general purpoſes we have uniformly been one people—each individual citizen every where enjoying the ſame national rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made peace and war—as a nation we have vanquiſhed our common enemies—as a nation we have formed alliances and made treaties, and entered into various compacts and conventions with foreign ſtates.</p>
                     <p>A ſtrong ſenſe of the value and bleſſings of Union induced the people, at a very early period, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a federal government to preſerve and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate it. They formed it almoſt as ſoon as they had a political exiſtence; nay at a time, when their habitations were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progreſs of hoſtility and deſolation left little room for thoſe calm and mature enquiries and reflections, which muſt ever precede the formation of a wiſe and well balanced government for a free people. It is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at that a government inſtituted in times ſo inauſpicious, ſhould on experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpoſe it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to anſwer.</p>
                     <p>This intelligent people perceived and regretted theſe defects. Still continuing no leſs attached to union, than enamoured of liberty, they obſerved the danger, which immediately threatned the former and more remotely the latter; and being perſuaded that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021127_0014_0FB23B86479EC288"/>
ample ſecurity for both, could only be found in a national government more wiſely framed, they, as with one voice, convened the late Convention at Philadelphia, to take that important ſubject under conſideration.</p>
                     <p>This Convention, compoſed of men who poſſeſſed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly diſtinguiſhed by their patriotiſm, virtue and wiſdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men, undertook the arduous taſk. In the mild ſeaſon of peace, with minds unoccupied by other ſubjects, they paſſed many months in cool uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and daily conſultations: And finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any paſſions, except love for their country, they preſented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous counſels.</p>
                     <p>Admit, for ſo is the fact, that this plan is only <hi>recommended,</hi> not impoſed, yet let it be remembered, that it is neither recommended to <hi>blind</hi> approbation, nor to <hi>blind</hi> reprobation; but to that ſedate and candid conſideration, which the magnitude and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſubject demand, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch it certainly ought to receive. But, as has been already remarked, it is more to be wiſhed than expected that it may be ſo conſidered and examined. Experience on a former occaſion teaches us not to be too ſanguine in ſuch hopes. It is not yet forgotten, that well grounded apprehenſions of imminent danger induced the people of America to form the memorable Congreſs of 1774. That body recommended certain meaſures to their conſtituents, and the event proved their wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dom; yet it is freſh in our memories how ſoon the preſs began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers againſt thoſe very meaſures. Not only many of the officers of government who obeyed the dictates of perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but others f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not correſpond with the public good, were indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable in their endeavours to perſuade the people to reject the advice of that patriotic Congreſs. Many indeed were deceived and deluded, but the great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the people reaſoned and decided judiciouſly; and happy they are in reflecting that they did ſo.</p>
                     <p>They conſidered that the Congreſs was compoſed of many wiſe and experienced men. That being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened from different parts of the country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety of uſeful information. That in the courſe of the time they paſſed together in enquiring into and diſcuſſing the true intereſts of their country, they muſt have acquired very accurate knowledge on that head. That they were individually intereſted in the public liberty and proſperity, and therefore that it was not leſs their inclination, than their duty, to recommend only ſuch meaſures, as after the moſt mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they realy thought prudent and adviſable.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſimilar conſiderations then induced the people to rely greatly on the judgment and integrity of the Congreſs; and they took their advice, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the various arts and endeavours uſed to deter and diſſuade them from it. But if the people at large had reaſon to confide in the men of that Congreſs, few of whom had then been fully tried or generally known, ſtill greater reaſon have they now to reſpect the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and advice of the Convention, for it is well known that ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed members of that Congreſs, who have been ſince tried and juſtly approved for patriotiſm and abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political information, were alſo members of this Convention, and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.</p>
                     <p>It is worthy of remark that not only the firſt, but every ſucceeding Congreſs, as well as the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the proſperity of America depended on its Union. To preſerve and perpetuate it, was the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021127_0016_0FB23B89456FEC08"/>
great object of the people in forming that Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is alſo the great object of the plan which the Convention has adviſed them to adopt. With what propriety therefore, or for what good purpoſes, are attempts at this particular period, made by ſome men, to depreciate the importance of the Union? or why is it ſuggeſted that three or four confederacies would be better than one? I am perſuaded in my own mind, that the people have always thought right on this ſubject, and that their univerſal and uniform at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the cauſe of the Union, reſts on great and weighty reaſons, which I ſhall endeavour to develope and explain in ſome enſuing papers. They who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the idea of ſubſtituting a number of diſtinct confederacies in the room of the plan of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeem clearly to foreſee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the Union in the utmoſt jeopardy—that certainly would be the caſe, and I ſincerely wiſh that it may be as clearly foreſeen by every good citizen, that whenever the diſſolution of the Union arrives, America will have reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim in the words of the Poet,

                     <p>IT is not a new obſervation that the people of any country (if like the Americans intelligent and well informed) ſeldom adopt, and ſteadily perſevere for many years, in an eroneous opinion reſpecting their intereſts. That conſideration naturally tends to create great reſpect for the high opinion which the people of America have ſo long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly united under
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021127_0017_0FB23B8AC5B7E1E8"/>
one federal government, veſted with ſufficient powers for all general and national purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The more attentively I conſider and inveſtigate the reaſons which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced that they are cogent and concluſive.</p>
                     <p>Among the many objects to which a wiſe and free people find it neceſſary to direct their attention, that of providing for their <hi>ſafety</hi> ſeems to be the firſt. The <hi>ſafety</hi> of the people doubtleſs has relation to a great variety of circumſtances and conſiderations, and conſequently affords great latitude to thoſe who wiſh to define it preciſely and comprehenſively.</p>
                     <p>At preſent I mean only to conſider it as it reſpects ſecurity for the preſervation of peace and tranquility, as well againſt dangers, from <hi>foreign arms and influence,</hi> as from dangers of the <hi>like kind</hi> ariſing from domeſtic cauſes. As the former of theſe comes firſt in order, it is proper it ſhould be the firſt diſcuſſed. Let us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in their opinion, that a cordial Union under an efficient national Government, affords them the beſt ſecurity that can be deviſed againſt <hi>hoſtilities</hi> from abroad.</p>
                     <p>The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world, will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the cauſes, whether <hi>real</hi> or <hi>pretended,</hi> which <hi>provoke</hi> or <hi>invite</hi> them. If this remark be juſt, it becomes uſeful to inquire, whether ſo many <hi>juſt</hi> cauſes of war are likely to be given by <hi>united</hi> America, as by <hi>diſunited</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; for if it ſhould turn out that united America will probably give the feweſt, then it will follow that, in this reſpect, the Union tends moſt to preſerve the people in a ſtate of peace with other nations.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>juſt</hi> cauſes of war for the moſt part ariſe either from violations of treaties, or from direct violence. America has already formed treaties with no leſs than ſix foreign nations, and all of them, except Pruſſia,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021127_0018_0FB23B8C45E8D140"/>
are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us: She has alſo extenſive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and with reſpect to the two latter, has in addition the circumſtance of neighbourhood to attend to.</p>
                     <p>It is of high importance to the peace of America, that ſhe obſerve the laws of nations towards all theſe powers, and to me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national government than it could be either by thirteen ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtates, or by three or four diſtinct confederacies. For this opinion various reaſons may be aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>When once an efficient national government is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the beſt men in the country will not only conſent to ſerve, but alſo will generally be appointed to manage it; for although town or county, or other contracted influence may place men in ſtate aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, or ſenates, or courts of juſtice, or executive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments; yet more general and extenſive reputation for talents and other qualifications, will be neceſſary to recommend men to offices under the national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, eſpecially as it will have the wideſt field for choice, and never experience that want of proper perſons, which is not uncommon in ſome of the ſtates. Hence it will reſult, that the adminiſtration, the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical counſels, and the judicial deciſions of the national government will be more wiſe, ſyſtematical and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, than thoſe of individual ſtates, and conſequently more ſatisfactory with reſpect to other nations, as well as more <hi>ſafe</hi> with reſpect to us.</p>
                     <p>Under the national government, treaties and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in one ſenſe, and executed in the ſame manner—whereas adjudications on the ſame points and queſtions, in thirteen ſtates, or in three or four confederacies, will not always accord or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent; and that as well from the variety of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent courts and judges appointed by different and independent governments, as from the different local
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021127_0019_0FB23B8DC531BA28"/>
laws and intereſts which may affect and influence them. The wiſdom of the Convention in commiting ſuch queſtions to the juriſdiction and judgment of courts appointed by, and reſponſible only to one national government, cannot be too much commended.</p>
                     <p>The proſpect of preſent loſs or advantage, may often tempt the governing party in one or two ſtates to ſwerve from good faith and juſtice; but thoſe temptations not reaching the other ſtates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently having little or no influence on the national government, the temptations will be fruitleſs, and good faith and juſtice be preſerved. The caſe of the treaty of peace with Britain, adds great weight to this reaſoning.</p>
                     <p>If even the governing party in a ſtate ſhould be diſpoſed to reſiſt ſuch temptations, yet as ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may, and commonly do reſult from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances peculiar to the ſtate, and may affect a great number of the inhabitans, the governing party may not always be able if willing to prevent the injuſtice meditated, or to puniſh the agreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>So far therefore as either deſigned or accidental violations of treaties and of the laws of nations afford <hi>juſt</hi> cauſes of war, they are leſs to be apprehended under one general government, than under ſeveral leſſer ones, and in that reſpect, the former moſt favors the <hi>ſafety</hi> of the people.</p>
                     <p>As to thoſe juſt cauſes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me, that one good national government affords vaſtly more ſecurity againſt dangers of that ſort, than can be derived from any other quarter.—</p>
                     <p>Such violencies are more frequently occaſioned by the paſſions and intereſts of a part than of the whole, of one or two ſtates than of the union.—

Not a ſingle Indian war has yet been produced by aggreſſions of the preſent federal government, feeble as it is, but there are ſeveral inſtances of Indian hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual ſtates, who either unable or unwilling to reſtrain or puniſh offences, have given occaſion to the ſlaugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The neighbourhood of Spaniſh and Britiſh terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, bordering on ſome ſtates, and not on others, naturally confines the cauſes of quarrel more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the borderers. The bordering ſtates, if any, will be thoſe who, under the impulſe of ſudden irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a quick ſenſe of apparent intereſt or injury, will be moſt likely by direct violence, to excite war with thoſe nations; and nothing can ſo effectually obviate that danger, as a national government, whoſe wiſdom and prudence will not be diminiſhed by the paſſions which actuate the parties immediately intereſted.</p>
                     <p>But not only fewer juſt cauſes of war will be given by the national government, but it will alſo be more in their power to accommodate and ſettle them ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably. They will be more temperate and cool, and in that reſpect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act with circumſpection than the offending ſtate. The pride of ſtates as well as of men, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diſpoſes them to juſtify all their actions, and oppoſes their acknowleging, correcting or repairing their errors and offences. The national government in ſuch caſes will not be affected by this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candour to conſider and decide on the means moſt proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations and compenſations are often accepted as ſatisfactory from a ſtrong united nation, which would be rejected as unſatisfactory if offered by a ſtate or confederacy of little conſideration or power.</p>

                     <p>MY laſt paper aſſigned ſeveral reaſons why the ſafety of the people would be beſt ſecured by Union againſt the danger it may be expoſed to by <hi>juſt</hi> cauſes of war given to other nations; and thoſe reaſons ſhew that ſuch cauſes would not only be more rarely given, but would alſo be more eaſily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated by a national government, than either by the ſtate governments, or the propoſed confederacies.</p>
                     <p>But the ſafety of the people of America againſt dangers from <hi>foreign</hi> force, depends not only on their forbearing to give <hi>juſt</hi> cauſes of war to other nations, but alſo on their placing and continuing themſelves in ſuch a ſituation as not to <hi>invite</hi> hoſtility or inſult; for it need not be obſerved, that there are <hi>pretended</hi> as well as juſt cauſes of war.</p>
                     <p>It is too true, however diſgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a proſpect of getting any thing by it, nay that abſolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for purpoſes and objects merely perſonal, ſuch as, a thirſt for military glory, revenge for perſonal affronts, ambition or private compacts to aggrandize or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their particular families, or partizans. Theſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021127_0022_0FB23B92CD5CBEF0"/>
and a variety of motives, which affect only the mind of the ſovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not ſanctified by juſtice, or the voice and intereſts of his people. But independent of theſe inducements to war, which are moſt prevalent in abſolute monarchies, but which well deſerve our attention, there are others which affect nations as often as kings; and ſome of them will on examination be found to grow out of our relative ſituation and circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>With France and with Britain we are rivals in the fiſheries, and can ſupply their markets cheaper than they can themſelves, notwithſtanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own, or duties on foreign fiſh.</p>
                     <p>With them and moſt other European nations, we are rivals in navigation and the carrying trade; and we ſhall deceive ourſelves if we ſuppoſe that any of them will rejoice to ſee it flouriſh: for as our carrying trade cannot increaſe, without in ſome degree dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their's, it is more their intereſt and will be more their policy, to reſtrain, than to promote it.</p>
                     <p>In the trade to China and India, we interfere with more than one nation, inaſmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which they had in a manner monopolized, and as we thereby ſupply ourſelves with commodities which we uſed to purchaſe from them.</p>
                     <p>The extenſion of our own commerce in our own veſſels, cannot give pleaſure to any nations who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs territories on or near this continent, becauſe the cheapneſs and excellence of our productions, added to the circumſtance of vicinity, and the enterprize and addreſs of our merchants and navigators, will give us a greater ſhare in the advantages which thoſe territories afford, than conſiſts with the wiſhes or policy of their reſpective ſovereigns.</p>
                     <p>Spain thinks it convenient to ſhut the Miſſiſippi againſt us on the one ſide, and Britain excludes us from the St. Lawrence on the other; nor will either of them permit the other waters, which are between
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021127_0023_0FB23B93C521E760"/>
them and us, to become the means of mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and traffic.</p>
                     <p>From theſe and ſuch like conſiderations, which might if conſiſtent with prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is eaſy to ſee that jealouſies and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſſes may gradually ſlide into the minds and cabinets of other nations; and that we are not to expect they ſhould regard our advancement in union, in power and conſequence by land and by ſea, with an eye of indifference and compoſure.</p>
                     <p>The people of America are aware that inducements to war may ariſe out of theſe circumſtances, as well as from others not ſo obvious at preſent; and that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch inducements may find fit time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for operation, pretences to colour and juſtify them will not be wanting. Wiſely therefore do they conſider union and a good national government as neceſſary to put and keep them in <hi>ſuch a ſituation</hi> as inſtead of <hi>inviting</hi> war, will tend to repreſs and diſcourage it. That ſituation conſiſts in the beſt poſſible ſtate of defence, and neceſſarily depends on the government, the arms and the reſources of the country.</p>
                     <p>As the ſafety of the whole is the intereſt of the whole, and cannot be provided for without govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either one or more or many, let us inquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in queſtion, more competent than any other given number whatever.</p>
                     <p>One government can collect and avail itſelf of the talents and experience of the ableſt men, in whatever part of the union they may be found. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize, aſſimilate, and protect the ſeveral parts and members, and extend the benefit of its foreſight and precautions to each. In the formation of treaties it will regard the intereſt of the whole, and the particular intereſts of the parts as connected with that of the whole. It can apply the reſources and power of the whole to the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021127_0024_0FB23B954572DA08"/>
defence of any particular part, and that more eaſily and expeditiouſly than ſtate governments, or ſeparate confederacies can poſſibly do, for want of concert and unity of ſyſtem. It can place the militia under one plan of diſcipline, and by putting their officers in a proper line of ſubordination to the chief magiſtrate, will in a manner conſolidate them into one corps, and thereby render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into three or four diſtinct indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent bodies.</p>
                     <p>What would the militia of Britain be, if the Engliſh militia obeyed the government of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the government of Scotland, and if the Welch militia obeyed the government of Wales! Suppoſe an invaſion, would thoſe three go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments (if they agreed at all) be able with all their reſpective forces, to operate againſt the enemy ſo effectually as the ſingle government of Great Britain would?</p>
                     <p>We have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may come, if we are wiſe, when the fleets of America may engage attention. But if one national government had not ſo regulated the navigation of Britain as to make it a nurſery for ſeamen—if one national government had not called forth all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional means and materials for forming fleets, their proweſs and their thunder would never have been cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. Let England have its navigation and fleet— let Scotland have its navigation and fleet—let Wales have its navigation and fleet—let Ireland have its navigation and fleet—let thoſe four of the conſtituent parts of the Britiſh empire be under four independent governments, and it is eaſy to perceive how ſoon they would each dwindle into comparitive inſignificance.</p>
                     <p>Apply theſe facts to our own caſe. Leave America divided into thirteen, or if you pleaſe into three or four independent governments, what armies could they raiſe and pay, what fleets could they ever hope to have? If one was attacked would the other fly to its ſuccour, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021127_0025_0FB23B96C4C8EA20"/>
ſpend their blood and money in its defence? would there be no danger of their being flattered into neutrality by ſpecious promiſes, or ſeduced by a too great fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for peace to decline hazarding their tranquility and preſent ſafety for the ſake of neighbours, of whom perhaps they have been jealous, and whoſe importance they are content to ſee diminiſhed? Although ſuch conduct would not be wiſe it would nevertheleſs be natural. The hiſtory of the ſtates of Greece, and of other countries abound with ſuch inſtances, and it is not improbable that what has ſo often happened, would under ſimilar circumſtances happen again.</p>
                     <p>But admit that they might be willing to help the invaded ſtate or confederacy. How and when, and in what proportion ſhall aids of men and money be afforded? who ſhall command the allied armies, and from which of them ſhall he receive his orders? Who ſhall ſettle the terms of peace, and in caſe of diſputes what umpire ſhall decide between them, and compel acquieſcence? Various difficulties and inconveniences would be inſeparable from ſuch a ſituation; whereas one government watching over the general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſts, and combining and directing the powers and reſources of the whole, would be free from all theſe embarraſſments and conduce far more to the ſafety of the people.</p>
                     <p>But whatever may be our ſituation, whether firmly united under one national government, or ſplit into a number of confederacies, certain it is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is; and they will act towards us accordingly If they ſee that our national government is efficient and well adminiſtred—our trade prudently regulated—our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia properly organized and diſciplined—our reſources and finances diſcreetly managed—our credit re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed—our people free, contented, and united, they will be much more diſpoſed to cultivate our friendſhip, than provoke our reſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How liable would ſhe become not only to their contempt, but to their outrage; and how ſoon would dear bought experience proclaim, that when a people or family ſo divide, it never fails to be againſt themſelves.</p>

<q>An entire and perfect union will be the ſolid foundation of laſting peace: It will ſecure your religion, liberty, and property, remove the animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities amongſt yourſelves, and the jealouſies and differences betwixt our two kingdoms.

                        <q>We moſt earneſtly recommend to you calmneſs and unanimity in this great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy concluſion, being the only <hi>effectual</hi> way to ſecure our preſent and future happineſs; and diſappoint the deſigns of our and your enemies, who will doubtleſs, on this

occaſion, <hi>uſe their utmoſt endeavours to prevent or delay this union.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was remarked in the preceding paper, that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diviſions at home, would invite dangers from abroad, and that nothing would tend more to ſecure us from them than union, ſtrength, and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within ourſelves. This ſubject is copious and cannot eaſily be exhauſted.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of Great-Britain is the one with which we are in general the beſt acquainted, and it gives us many uſeful leſſons. We may profit by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, without paying the price which it coſt them. Although it ſeems obvious to common ſenſe, that the people of ſuch an iſland ſhould be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages divided into three, and thoſe three were almoſt conſtantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their true intereſt, with reſpect to the continental nations, was really the ſame, yet by the arts and policy and practices of thoſe nations, their mutual jealouſies were perpetually kept enflamed, and for a long ſeries of years they were far more inconvenient and troubleſome, than they were uſeful and aſſiſting to each other.</p>
                     <p>Should the people of America divide themſelves into three or four nations, would not the ſame thing happen? Would not ſimilar jealouſies ariſe; and be in like manner cheriſhed? Inſtead of their being
<q>joined in affection and free from all apprehenſion of different intereſts,</q>
envy and jealouſy would ſoon extinguiſh confidence and affection, and the partial intereſts of each confederacy inſtead of the general intereſts of all America, would be the only objects of their policy and purſuits. Hence like moſt other <hi>bordering</hi> nations, they would always be either involved in diſputes and war, or live in the conſtant apprehenſion of them.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ſanguine advocates for three or four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies, cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe that they would
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021127_0028_0FB23B9B45DBE0C0"/>
long remain exactly on an equal footing in point of ſtrength, even if it was poſſible to form them ſo at firſt—but admitting that to be practicable, yet what human contrivance can ſecure the continuance of ſuch equality? Independent of thoſe local circumſtances which tend to beget and encreaſe power in one part, and to impede its progreſs in another, we muſt advert to the effects of that ſuperior policy and good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which would probably diſtinguiſh the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one above the reſt, and by which their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive equality in ſtrength and conſideration, would be deſtroyed. For it cannot be preſumed that the ſame degree of ſound policy, prudence, and foreſight, would uniformly be obſerved by each of theſe confederacies, for a long ſucceſſion of years.</p>
                     <p>Whenever, and from whatever cauſes, it might happen; and happen it would, that any one of theſe nations or confederacies ſhould riſe on the ſcale of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical importance much above the degree of their neighbours, that moment would thoſe neighbours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her with envy and with fear: Both thoſe paſſions would lead them to countenance, if not to promote, whatever might promiſe to diminiſh her importance; and would alſo reſtrain them from meaſures calculated to advance, or even to ſecure her proſperity. Much time would not be neceſſary to enable her to diſcern theſe unfriendly diſpoſitions. She would ſoon begin, not only to loſe confidence in her neighbours, but alſo to feel a diſpoſition equally unfavorable to them: Diſtruſt naturally creates diſtruſt, and by nothing is good will and kind conduct more ſpeedily changed, than by invidious jealouſies and uncandid imputations, whether expreſſed or implied.</p>
                     <p>The North is generally the region of ſtrength, and many local circumſtances render it probable, that the moſt Nor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ſame ideas and ſenſations in the more Southern parts of America, which it formerly did in the Southern parts of Europe: Nor does it appear to be a raſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that its young ſwarms might often be tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air of their luxurious and more delicate neighbours.</p>
                     <p>They who well conſider the hiſtory of ſimilar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and confederacies, will find abundant reaſon to apprehend, that thoſe in contemplation would in no other ſenſe be neighbours, than as they would be borderers; that they would neither love nor truſt one another, but on the contrary would be a prey to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, jealouſy and mutual injuries; in ſhort that they would place us exactly in the ſituation in which ſome nations doubtleſs wiſh to ſee us, viz. <hi>formidable only to each other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From theſe conſiderations it appears that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are greatly miſtaken, who ſuppoſe that alliances offenſive and defenſive might be formed between theſe confederacies, and would produce that combination and union of wills, of arms, and of reſources, which would be neceſſary to put and keep them in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable ſtate of defence againſt foreign enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When did the independent ſtates into which Britain and Spain were formerly divided, combine in ſuch alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, or unite their forces againſt a foreign enemy? The propoſed confederacies will be <hi>diſtinct nations.</hi> Each of them would have its commerce with foreigners to regulate by diſtinct treaties; and as their produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and commodities are different, and proper for different markets, ſo would thoſe treaties be eſſentially different.

Hence it might and probably would happen, that the foreign nation with whom the <hi>Southern</hi> confederacy might be at war, would be the one, with whom the <hi>Northern</hi> confederacy would be the moſt deſirous of preſerving peace and friendſhip. An

                     <p>Nay it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe, neighbouring nations, acting under the impulſe of oppoſite intereſts, and unfriendly paſſions, would frequently be found taking different ſides. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our diſtance from Europe, it would be more natural for theſe confederacies to apprehend danger from one another, than from diſtant nations, and therefore that each of them ſhould be more deſirous to guard againſt the others, by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard againſt foreign dangers by alliances between themſelves. And here let us not forget how much more eaſy it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to perſuade or compel them to depart. How many conqueſts did the Romans and others make in the character of allies, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations did they under the ſame character introduce into the governments of thoſe whom they pretended to protect?</p>
                     <p>Let candid men judge then whether the diviſion of America into any given number of independent ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties would tend to ſecure us againſt the hoſtilities and improper interference of foreign nations.</p>

                     <p>The cauſes of hoſtility among nations are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. There are ſome which have a general and almoſt conſtant operation upon the collective bodies of ſociety: Of this deſcription are the love of power, or the deſire of pre-eminence and dominion—the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of power, or the deſire of equality and ſafety. There are others which have a more circumſcribed, though an equally operative influence, within their ſpheres: Such are the rivalſhips and competitions of commerce between commercial nations. And there are others, not leſs numerous than either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which take their origin entirely in private paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; in the attachments, enmities, intereſts, hopes and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members. Men of this claſs, whether the favourites of a king or of a people, have in too many inſtances abuſed the confidence they poſſeſſed; and aſſuming the pretext of ſome public motive, have not ſcrupled to ſacrifice the national tranquility to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal advantage, or perſonal gratification.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER VII. The Subject continued and particular Cauſes enumerated.</head>
                     <p>IT is ſometimes aſked, with an air of ſeeming tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, what inducements could the ſtates have, if diſunited, to make war upon each other? It would be a full anſwer to this queſtion to ſay—preciſely the ſame inducements which have, at different times, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luged in blood all the nations in the world. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for us, the queſtion admits of a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular anſwer. There are cauſes of difference within our immediate contemplation, of the tendency of which, even under the reſtraints of a federal conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have had ſufficient experience to enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected, if thoſe reſtraints were removed.</p>
                     <p>Territorial diſputes have at all times been found one of the moſt fertile ſources of hoſtility among nations. Perhaps the greateſt proportion of the wars that have deſolated the earth have ſprung from this origin.— This cauſe would exiſt, among us, in full force. We have a vaſt tract of unſettled territory within the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of the United States. There ſtill are diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and undecided claims between ſeveral of them; and the diſſolution of the union would lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſimilar claims between them all. It is well known, that they have heretofore had ſerious and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated diſcuſſions concerning the right to the lands which were ungranted at the time of the revolution, and which uſually went under the name of crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. The ſtates within the limits of whoſe colonial governments they were compriſed, have claimed them as their property; the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this article devolved upon the union; eſpecially as to all that part of the Weſtern territory which, either by actual poſſeſſion, or through the ſubmiſſion of the Indian proprietors, was ſubjected
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021127_0039_0FB23BABC60438E0"/>
to the juriſdiction of the King of Great-Britain, till it was relinquiſhed in the treaty of peace. This, it has been ſaid, was at all events an acquiſition to the confederacy by compact with a foreign power. It has been the prudent policy of Congreſs to appeaſe this controverſy, by prevailing upon the ſtates to make ceſſions to the United States for the benefit of the whole. This has been ſo far accompliſhed, as under a continuation of the union, to afford a decided proſpect of an amicable termination of the diſpute. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberment of the confederacy however would revive this diſpute, and would create others on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. At preſent, a large part of the vacant Weſtern territory is by ceſſion at leaſt, if not by any anterior right, the common property of the un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>on. If that were at an end, the ſtates which have made ceſſions, on a principle of federal compromiſe, would be apt, when the motive of the grant had cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſtates would no doubt inſiſt on a proportion, by right of repreſentation. Their argument would be that a grant, once made, could not be revoked; and that the juſtice of their participating in territory acquired, or ſecured by the joint efforts of the confederacy, remained undimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. If contrary to probability it ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the ſtates, that each had a right to a ſhare of this common ſtock, there would ſtill be a difficulty to be ſurmounted, as to a proper rule of apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Different principles would be ſet up by different ſtates for this purpoſe; and as they would affect the oppoſite intereſts of the parties, they might not eaſily be ſuſceptible of a pacific adjuſtment.</p>
                     <p>In the wide field of Weſtern territory, therefore, we perceive an ample theatre for hoſtile pretenſions, without any umpire or common judge to interpoſe between the contending parties. To reaſon from the paſt to the future we ſhall have good ground to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that the ſword would ſometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021127_0040_0FB23BAD49049418"/>
of the diſpute between Connecticut and Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, reſpecting the lands at Wyoming, admoniſh us, not to be ſanguine in expecting an eaſy accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſuch differences. The articles of confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration obliged the parties to ſubmit the matter to the deciſion of a federal court. The ſubmiſſion was made, and the court decided in favour of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. But Connecticut gave ſtrong indications of diſſatisfaction with that determination; nor did ſhe appear to be intirely reſigned to it, till by negotiation and management ſomething like an equivalent was found for the loſs ſhe ſuppoſed herſelf to have ſuſtained. Nothing here ſaid is intended to convey the ſlighteſt cenſure on the conduct of that State. She no doubt ſincerely believed herſelf to have been injured by the deciſion; and ſtates, like individuals, acquieſce with great reluctance in determinations to their diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who had an opportunity of ſeeing the inſide of the tranſactions, which attended the progreſs of the controverſy between this ſtate and the diſtrict of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, can vouch the oppoſition we experienced, as well from ſtates not intereſted as from tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m; and can atteſt the danger to which the peace of the confederacy might have been expoſed, had this ſtate attempted to aſſert its rights by forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Two motives preponderated in that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition—one a jealouſy entertained of our future power— and the other, the intereſt of certain individuals of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the neighbouring ſtates, who had obtained grants of lands under the actual government of that diſtrict. Even the ſtates which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours, ſeemed more ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to diſmember this ſtate, than to eſtabliſh their own pretenſions. Theſe were New-Hampſhire, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts and Connecticut. New-Jerſey and Rhode-Iſland, upon all occaſions, diſcovered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland, until alarmed by the appearance of a connection between
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021127_0041_0FB23BAF4A0CDC58"/>
Canada and that place, entered deeply into the ſame views. Theſe being ſmall ſtates, ſaw with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly eye the perſpective of our growing greatneſs. In a review of theſe tranſactions we may trace ſome of the cauſes, which would be likely to embroil the ſtates with each other, if it ſhould be their unpropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſtiny to become diſunited.</p>
                     <p>The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful ſource of contention. The ſtates leſs favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably circumſtanced would be deſirous of eſcaping from the diſadvantages of local ſituation, and of ſharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbours. Each ſtate, or ſeparate confederacy, would purſue a ſyſtem of commercial polity peculiar to itſelf. This would occaſion diſtinctions, preferences and excluſions, which would beget diſcontent. The habits of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, on the baſis of equal privileges, to which we have been accuſtomed from the earlieſt ſettlement of the country, would give a keener edge to thoſe cauſes of diſcontent, than they would naturally have, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of this circumſtance. <hi>We ſhould be ready to denominate injuries thoſe things which were in reality the juſtifiable acts of independent ſovereignties conſulting a diſtinct intereſt.</hi> The ſpirit of enterpriſe, which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſes the commercial part of America, has left no occaſion of diſplaying itſelf unimproved. It is not at all probable that this unbridled ſpirit would pay much reſpect to thoſe regulations of trade, by which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtates might endeavour to ſecure excluſive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to their own citizens. The infractions of theſe regulations on one ſide, the efforts to prevent and repel them on the other, would naturally lead to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and theſe to repriſals and wars.</p>
                     <p>The opportunities, which ſome ſtates would have of rendering others tributary to them, by commercial regulations, would be impatiently ſubmitted to by the tributary ſtates. The relative ſituation of New-York, Connecticut and New-Jerſey, would afford an example of this kind. New-York, from the neceſſities
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021127_0042_0FB23BB0453FD770"/>
of revenue, muſt lay duties on her importations. A great part of theſe duties muſt be paid by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the two other ſtates in the capacity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers of what we import. New-York would neither be willing nor able to forego this advantage. Her citizens would not conſent that a duty paid by them ſhould be remitted in favour of the citizens of her neighbours; nor would it be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to diſtinguiſh the cuſtomers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New-Jerſey long ſubmit to be taxed by New-York for her excluſive benefit? Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undiſturbed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a metropolis, from the poſſeſſion of which we derived an advantage ſo odious to our neighbours, and, in their opinion, ſo oppreſſive? Should we be able to preſerve it againſt the incumbent weight of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut on the one ſide, and the co-operating preſſure of New-Jerſey on the other? Theſe are queſtions that temerity alone will anſwer in the affirmative.</p>
                     <p>The public debt of the Union would be a further cauſe of colliſion between the ſeparate ſtates or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies. The apportionment, in the firſt inſtance, and the progreſſive extinguiſhment, afterwards, would be alike productive of ill humour and animoſity. How would it be poſſible to agree upon a rule of apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſatisfactory to all? There is ſcarcely any, that can be propoſed, which is intirely free from real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. Theſe, as uſual, would be exaggerated by the adverſe intereſts of the parties. There are even diſſimilar views among the ſtates, as to the general principle of diſcharging the public debt. Some of them, either leſs impreſſed with the importance of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional credit, or becauſe their citizens have little, if any, immediate intereſt in the queſtion, feel an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, if not a repugnance to the payment of the domeſtic debt, at any rate. Theſe would be inclined to magnify the difficulties of a diſtribution. Others of them, a numerous body of whoſe citizens are credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021127_0043_0FB23BB1C60365F0"/>
to the public, beyond the proportion of the ſtate in the total amount of the national debt, would be ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous for ſome equitable and effectual proviſion. The procraſtinations of the former would excite the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the latter. The ſettlement of a rule would in the mean time be poſtponed, by real differences of opinion and affected delays. The citizens of the ſtates intereſted, would clamour, foreign powers would urge, for the ſatisfaction of their juſt demands; and the peace of the ſtates would be hazarded to the double contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of external invaſion and internal contention.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and the apportionment made. Still there is great room to ſuppoſe, that the rule agreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon ſome ſtates than upon others. Thoſe which were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers by it would naturally ſeek for a mitigation of the burthen. The others would as naturally be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined to a reviſion, which was likely to end in an increaſe of their own incumbrances. Their refuſal would be too plauſible a pretext to the complaining ſtates to withhold their contributions, not to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with avidity; and the non compliance of theſe ſtates with their engagements would be a ground of bitter diſſention and altercation. If even the rule adopted ſhould in practice juſtify the equality of its principle, ſtill delinquencies in payment, on the part of ſome of the States, would reſult from a diverſity of other cauſes—the real deficiency of reſources—the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management of their finances, accidental diſorders in the adminiſtration of the government—and in addition to the reſt the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purpoſes, that have outli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d the exigencies which produced them, and interfere with the ſupply of immediate wants. Delinquencies from whatever cauſes would be productive of complaints, recriminations and quarrels. There is perhaps nothing more likely to diſturb the tranquillity of nations, than their being bound to mutual contributions for
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021127_0044_0FB23BB3459CC868"/>
any common object, which does not yield an equal and coincident benefit. For it is an obſervation as true, as it is trite, that there is nothing men differ ſo readily about as the payment of money.</p>
                     <p>Laws in violation of private contracts as they amount to aggreſſions on the rights of thoſe ſtates, whoſe citizens are inju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed by them, may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as another probable ſource of hoſtility. We are not authoriſed to expect, that a more liberal or more equitable ſpirit would preſide over the legiſlations of the individual ſtates hereafter, if unreſtrained by any additional cheeks, than we have heretofore ſeen, in too many inſtances, diſgracing their ſeveral codes. We have obſerved the diſpoſition to retaliation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in Connecticut, in conſequences of the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities perpetrated by the legiſlature of Rhode-Iſland; and we may reaſonably infer, that in ſimilar caſes, under other circumſtances, a war not of <hi>parchment</hi> but of the ſword would chaſtiſe ſuch atrocious breaches of moral obligation and ſocial juſtice.</p>
                     <p>The probability of incompatible alliances between the different ſtates, or confederacies, and different foreign nations, and the effects of this ſituation upon the peace of the whole, have been ſufficiently unfolded in ſome preceding papers. From the view they have exhibited of this part, of the ſubject, this concluſion is to be drawn, that America, if not connected at all, or only by the feeble tie of a ſimple league offenſive and defenſive, would by the operation of ſuch oppoſite and jarring alliances be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of European politics and wars; and by the deſtructive contentions of the parts, into which ſhe was divided, would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them all. <hi>Divide et impera</hi>

                     <p>ASSUMING it therefore as an eſtabliſhed truth that the ſeveral ſtates, in caſe of diſunion, or ſuch combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general confederacy, would be ſubject to thoſe viciſſitudes of peace and war, of friendſhip and enmity with each other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighbouring nations not united under one government, let us enter into a conciſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of ſome of the conſequences that would attend ſuch a ſituation.</p>
                     <p>War between the ſtates, in the firſt periods of their ſeparate exiſtence, would be accompanied with much greater diſtreſſes than it commonly is in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where regular military eſtabliſhments have long obtained. The diſciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aſpect to liberty and economy, have not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding been productive of the ſignal advantage of rendering ſudden conqueſts impracticable, and of preventing that rapid deſolation, which uſed to mark the progreſs of war, prior to their introduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the ſame ends. The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places, which mutually obſtruct invaſion. Campaigns are waſted in reducing two or three fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier garriſons, to gain admittance into an enemy's country. Similar imped<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ments occur at every ſtep, to exhauſt the ſtrength and delay the progreſs of an invader. Formerly an invading army would pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the heart of a neighbouring country, almoſt as ſoon as intelligence of its approach could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021127_0046_0FB23BB646E8A188"/>
but now a comparitively ſmall force of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined troops, acting on the defenſive with the aid of poſts, is able to impede and finally to fruſtrate the enterpriſes of one much more conſiderable. The hiſtory of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a hiſtory of nations ſubdued and empires over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but of towns taken and retaken, of battles that decide nothing, of retreats more beneficial than victories, of much effort and little acquiſition.</p>
                     <p>In this country the ſcene would be alogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed. The jealouſy of military eſtabliſhments, would poſtpone them as long as poſſible. The want of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications leaving the frontiers of one ſtate open to another, would facilitate inroads. The populous ſtates would with little difficulty over run their leſs populous neighbours. Conqueſts would be as eaſy to be made as difficult to be retained. War therefore would be deſultory and predatory. Plunder and devaſtation ever march in the train of irregulars. The cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events, which would characteriſe our military exploits.</p>
                     <p>This picture is not too highly wrought, though I confeſs, it would not long remain a juſt one. Safety from external danger is the moſt powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent deſtruction of life and property incident to war—the continual effort and alarm attendant on a ſtate of continual danger, will compel nations the moſt attached to liberty, to reſort for repoſe and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to inſtitutions, which have a tendency to deſtroy their civil and political rights. To be more ſafe they, at length, become willing to run the riſk of being leſs free.</p>
                     <p>The inſtitutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES, and the correſpondent appendages of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eſtabliſhment. Standing armies, it is ſaid, are not provided againſt in the new conſtitution, and it is
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021127_0047_0FB23BB7C51AC728"/>
thence inferred that they would exiſt under it.<note n="*" place="bottom">This objection will be fully examined in its proper place, and it will be ſhown that the only rational precaution which could have been taken on this ſubject has been taken; and a much better one than is to be found in any conſtitution that has been heretofore framed in America, moſt of which contain no guard at all on this ſubject.</note> This inference, from the very form of the propoſition, is, at beſt, problematical and uncertain. But STANDING ARMIES, it may be replied, muſt inevitably reſult from a diſſolution of the confederacy. Frequent war, and conſtant apprehenſion, which require a ſtate of as conſtant preparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker ſtates, or confederacies, would firſt have recourſe to them, to put themſelves upon an equality with their more potent neighbours. They would endeavour to ſupply the inferiority of population and reſources, by a more regular and effective ſyſtem of defence, by diſciplined troops and by fortifications. They would, at the ſame time, be neceſſitated to ſtrengthen the executive arm of government; in doing which, their conſtitutions would acquire a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive direction towards monarchy. It is of the nature of war to increaſe the executive at the expence of the legiſlative authority.</p>
                     <p>The expedients which have been mentioned would ſoon give the ſtates, or confederacies, that made uſe of them, a ſuperiority over their neighbours. Small ſtates, or ſtates of leſs natural ſtrength, under vigorous governments, and with the aſſiſtance of diſciplined armies, have often triumphed over large ſtates, or ſtates of greater natural ſtrength, which have been deſtitute of theſe advantages. Neither the pride, nor the ſafety of the more important ſtates, or confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, would permit them long to ſubmit to this morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and adventitious inferiority. They would quickly reſort to means ſimilar to thoſe by which it had been effected, to reinſtate themſelves in their loſt pre-eminence. Thus we ſhould in a little time ſee eſtabliſhed in every part of this country, the ſame
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021127_0048_0FB23BB944D7C2E8"/>
engines of deſpotiſm which have been the ſcourge of the old world. This at leaſt would be the natural courſe of things, and our reaſonings will be the more likely to be juſt, in proportion as they are accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to this ſtandard.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are not vague inferences, drawn from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or ſpeculative defects in a conſtitution, the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of the people, or their repreſentatives and delegates, but they are ſolid concluſions drawn from the natural and neceſſary progreſs of human affairs.</p>
                     <p>It may perhaps be aſked, by way of objection to this, why did not ſtanding armies ſpring up out of the contentions which ſo often diſtracted the ancient republics of Greece? Different anſwers equally ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, may be given to this queſtion. The induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious habits of the people of the preſent day, abſorbed in the purſuits of gain, and devoted to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of agriculture and commerce, are incompatible with the condition of a nation of ſoldiers, which was the true condition of the people of thoſe republics. The means of revenue, which have been ſo greatly multiplied by the encreaſe of gold and ſilver, and of the arts of induſtry, and the ſcience of finance, which is the offspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have produced an intire revolution in the ſyſtem of war, and have rendered diſciplined armies, diſtinct from the body of the citizens, the inſeparable companion of frequent hoſtility.</p>
                     <p>There is a wide difference alſo, between military eſtabliſhments in a country, ſeldom expoſed by its ſituation to internal invaſions, and in one which is often ſubject to them, and always apprehenſive of them. The rulers of the former can have no good pretext, if they are even ſo inclined, to keep on foot armies ſo numerous as muſt of neceſſity be maintained in the latter. Theſe armies being, in the firſt caſe, rarely, if at all, called into activity for interior defence, the people are in no danger of being broken to mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

ſubordination. The laws are not accuſtomed to relaxations, in favour of military exigencies—the civil ſtate remains in full vigor, neither corrupted nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the principles or propenſities of the other ſtate. The ſmallneſs of the army renders the natural ſtrength of the community an overmatch for it, and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for protection, or to ſubmit to its oppreſſions, neither love nor fear the ſoldiery: They view them with a ſpirit of jealous acquieſcence in a neceſſary evil, and ſtand ready to reſiſt a power which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights.</p>
                     <p>The army under ſuch circumſtances, may uſefully aid the magiſtrate to ſuppreſs a ſmall faction, or an occaſional mob, or inſurrection; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments againſt the united efforts of the great body of the people.</p>
                     <p>In a country, in the predicament laſt deſcribed, the contrary of all this happens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prepared to repel it—its armies muſt be numerous enough for inſtant defence. The continual neceſſity for their ſervices enhances the importance of the ſoldier, and proportionally degrades the condition of the citizen. The military ſtate becomes elevated above the civil. The inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably ſubjected to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent infringements on their rights, which ſerve to weaken their ſenſe of thoſe rights; and by degrees, the people are brought to conſider the ſoldiery not only as their protectors, but as their ſuperiors.

There has been, for a long time paſt, little room for the operation of the other cauſes, which have been enumerated as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of internal war. This peculiar felicity of ſituation has, in a great degree, contributed to preſerve the liberty, which that country to this day enjoys, in ſpite of the prevalent venality and corruption.

'Tis poſſible, though not eaſy, that the people of that iſland may be enſlaved from other cauſes, but it cannot be by the proweſs of an army ſo inconſiderable as that which has been uſually kept up within the kingdom.</p>

                     <p>A Firm union will be of the utmoſt moment to the peace and liberty of the ſtates as a barrier againſt domeſtic faction and inſurrection. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to read the hiſtory of the petty republics of Greece and Italy, without feeling ſenſations of horror and diſguſt at the diſtractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid ſucceſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, by which they were kept in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual vibration, between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit occaſional calms, theſe only ſerve as ſhortlived contraſts to the furious ſtorms that are to ſucceed. If now and then intervals of felicity open themſelves to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret ariſing from the reflection, that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021127_0052_0FB23BBF44E68058"/>
the pleaſing ſcenes before us are ſoon to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by the tempeſtuous waves of ſedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a tranſient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the ſame time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us to lament that the vices of government ſhould pervert the direction and tarniſh the luſtre of thoſe bright talents and exalted endowments, for which the favoured ſoils, that produced them, have been ſo juſtly celebrated.</p>
                     <p>From the diſorders that disfigure the annals of thoſe republics, the advocates of deſpotiſm have drawn ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, not only againſt the forms of republican government, but againſt the very principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free government, as inconſiſtent with the order of ſociety, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged themſelves in malicious exultation over its friends and partizans. Happily for mankind, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous fabrics reared on the baſis of liberty, which have flouriſhed for ages, have in a few glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances refuted their gloomy ſophiſms And, I truſt, America will be the broad and ſolid foundation of other edifices not leſs magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors.</p>
                     <p>But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have ſketched of republican government, were too juſt copies of the originals from which they were taken. If it had been found impracticable, to have deviſed models of a more perfect ſtructure, the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cauſe of that ſpecies of government as indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The ſcience of politics, however, like moſt other ſciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now well underſtood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular diſtribution of power into diſtinct departments—the introduction of legiſlative ballances and checks—the inſtitution of courts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of judges, holding their offices during good
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021127_0053_0FB23BC0C51DE7F0"/>
behaviour—the repreſentation of the people in the legiſlature by deputies of their own election—theſe are either wholly new diſcoveries, or have made their principal progreſs towards perfection in modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellencies of republican government may be retained, and its imperfections leſſened or avoided. To this catalogue of circumſtances, that tend to the amelioration of popular ſyſtems of civil government, I ſhall venture, however novel it may appear to ſome, to add one more on a principle, which has been made the foundation of an objection to the new conſtitution, I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which ſuch ſyſtems are to revolve, either in reſpect to the dimenſions of a ſingle ſtate, or to the conſolidation of ſeveral ſmaller ſtates into one great confederacy. The latter is that which immediately concerns the object under conſideration. It will however be of uſe to examine the principle in its application to a ſingle ſtate, which ſhall be attended to in another place.</p>
                     <p>The utility of a confederacy, as well to ſuppreſs faction and to guard the internal tranquility of ſtates, as to increaſe their external force and ſecurity, is in reality not a new idea. It has been practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has received the ſanction of the moſt applauded writers on the ſubjects of politics. The opponents of the PLAN propoſed have with great aſſiduity cited and circulated the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of Monteſquieu on the neceſſity of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted territory for a republican government. But they ſeem not to have been appriſed of the ſentiments of that great man expreſſed in another part of his work, nor to have adverted to the conſequences of the principle to which they ſubſcribe, with ſuch ready acquieſcence.</p>
                     <p>When Monteſquieu recommends a ſmall extent for republics, the ſtandards he had in view were of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, far ſhort of the limits of almoſt every one of theſe ſtates. Neither Virginia, Maſſachuſetts,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021127_0054_0FB23BC2454C0888"/>
Pennſylvania, New-York, North-Carolina nor Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, can by any means be compared with the models from which he reaſoned, and to which the terms of his deſcription apply. If we therefore take his ideas on this point, as the criterion of truth, we ſhall be driven to the alternative, either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of ſplitting ourſelves into an infinity of little, jealous, claſhing, tumultuous commonwealths, the wretched nurſeries of unceaſing diſcord and the miſerable objects of univerſal pity or contempt. Some of the writers, who have come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the other ſide of the queſtion, ſeem to have been aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the diviſion of the larger ſtates, as a deſirable thing. Such an infatuated policy, ſuch a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate expedient, might, by the multiplication of petty offices anſwer the views of men, who poſſeſs not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of perſonal intrigue, but it could never promote the greatneſs or happineſs of the people of America.</p>
                     <p>Referring the examination of the principle itſelf to another place, as has been already mentioned, it will be ſufficient to remark here, that in the ſenſe of the author who has been moſt emphatically quoted upon the occaſion, it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of the more conſiderable MEMBERS of the union; but would not militate againſt their being all comprehended in one confederate government. And this is the true queſtion, in the diſcuſſion of which we are at preſent intereſted.</p>
                     <p>So far are the ſuggeſtions of Monteſquieu from ſtanding in oppoſition to a general union of the ſtates, that he explicitly treats of a CONFEDERATE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUBLIC as the expedient for extending the ſphere of popular government and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with thoſe of republicaniſm.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>It is very probable (ſays he<note n="*" place="bottom">Spirit of Laws, Vol. I. Book IX. Chap. I.</note>) that mankind would have been obliged, at length, to live conſtantly

under the government of a SINGLE PERSON, had they not contrived a kind of conſtitution, that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a monarchical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.</p>
                        <p>This form of government is a convention, by which ſeveral ſmaller <hi>ſtates</hi> agree to become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a larger <hi>one,</hi> which they intend to form. It is a kind of aſſemblage of ſocieties, that conſtitute a new one, capable of encreaſing by means of new aſſociations, till they arrive to ſuch a degree of power as to be able to provide for the ſecurity of the united body.</p>
                        <p>A republic of this kind, able to withſtand an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal force, may ſupport itſelf without any internal corruption. The form of this ſociety prevents all manner of inconveniences.</p>
                        <p>If a ſingle member ſhould attempt to uſurp the ſupreme authority, he could not be ſuppoſed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate ſtates. Were he to have too great influence over one, this would alarm the reſt. Were he to ſubdue a part, that which would ſtill remain free might oppoſe him with forces, independent of thoſe which he had uſurped, and overpower him before he could be ſettled in his uſurpation.</p>
                        <p>Should a popular inſurrection happen in one of the confederate ſtates, the others are able to quell it. Should abuſes creep into one part, they are reformed by thoſe that remain ſound. The ſtate may be deſtroyed on one ſide, and not on the other; the confederacy may be diſſolved, and the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates preſerve their ſovereignty.</p>
                        <p>As this government is compoſed of ſmall republics it enjoys the internal happineſs of each, and with reſpect to its external ſituation it is poſſeſſed, by means of the aſſociation of all the advantages of large monarchies.</p>

                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:021127_0056_0FB23BC5450B9488"/>I have thought it proper to quote at length theſe intereſting paſſages, becauſe they contain a luminous abrigement of the principal arguments in favour of the union, and muſt effectually remove the falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which a miſapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to produce. They have at the ſame time an intimate connection with the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate deſign of this paper; which is to illuſtrate the tendency of the union to repreſs domeſtic faction and inſurrection.</p>
                     <p>A diſtinction, more ſubtle than accurate, has been raiſed between a <hi>confederacy</hi> and a <hi>conſolidation</hi> of the ſtates. The eſſential characteriſtic of the firſt is ſaid to be, the reſtriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals of whom they are compoſed. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal adminiſtration. An exact equality of ſuffrage between the members has alſo been inſiſted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government. Theſe poſitions are in the main arbitrary; they are ſupported neither by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple nor precedent. It has indeed happened that governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner, which the diſtinction, taken notice of, ſuppoſes to be inherent in their nature—but there have been in moſt of them extenſive exceptions to the practice, which ſerve to prove, as far as example will go, that there is no abſolute rule on the ſubject. And it will be clearly ſhewn, in the courſe of this inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that as far as the principle contended for has prevailed, it has been the cauſe of incurable diſorder and imbecility in the government.</p>
                     <p>The definition of a <hi>confederate republic</hi> ſeems ſimply to be, an "aſſemblage of ſocieties," or an aſſociation of two or more ſtates into one ſtate. The extent, modifications and objects of the federal authority are mere matters of diſcretion. So long as the ſeparate organization of the members be not aboliſhed, ſo

                        </gap>es, though it ſhould be in perfect ſubordination to the general authority of the union, it would ſtill be, in fact and in theory, an aſſociation of ſtates, or a confederacy. The propoſed conſtitution, ſo far from implying an abolition of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>te governments, makes them conſtituent parts of the national ſovereignty by allowing them a direct repreſentation in the ſenate, and leaves in their poſſeſſion certain excluſive and very important portions of ſovereign power.—This fully correſponds, in every rational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.</p>
                     <p>In the Lycian confederacy, which conſiſted of twenty-three CITIES, or republics, the largeſt were intitled to <hi>three</hi> votes in the COMMON COUNCIL, thoſe of the middle claſs to <hi>two,</hi> and the ſmalleſt to <hi>one.</hi> The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magiſtrates of the reſpective CITIES. This was certainly the moſt delicate ſpecies of interference in their internal adminiſtration; for if there be any thing that ſeems excluſively appropriated to the local juriſdictions, it is the appointment of their own officers. Yet Monteſquieu, ſpeaking of this aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, ſays,
<q>Were I to give a model of an excellent confederate republic, it would be that of Lycia.</q>
Thus we perceive that the diſtinctions inſiſted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian, and we ſhall be led to conclude, that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory.</p>

governments, never finds himſelf ſo much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propenſity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail therefore to ſet a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, injuſtice and confuſion introduced into the public councils, have in truth been the mortal diſeaſes under which popular governments have every where periſhed; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adverſaries to liberty derive their moſt ſpecious declamations. The valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able improvements made by the American conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this ſide as was wiſhed and expected. Complaints are every where heard from our moſt conſiderate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and perſonal liberty; that our governments are too unſtable; that the public good is diſregarded in the conflicts of rival parties; and that meaſures are too often decided, not according to the rules of juſtice, and the rights of the minor party; but by the ſuperior force of an intereſted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing majority. However anxiouſly we may wiſh that theſe complaints had no foundation, the evidence of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in ſome degree true. It will be found indeed, on a candid review of our ſituation, that ſome of the diſtreſſes under which we labor, have been erroneouſly charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found at the ſame time, that other cauſes will not alone account for many of our heavieſt misfortunes; and particularly, for that prevailing and increaſing diſtruſt of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the other. Theſe muſt be chiefly, if not
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021127_0059_0FB23BC9C574C638"/>

                     <p>By a faction I underſtand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by ſome common impulſe of paſſion, or of intereſt, adverſe to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate intereſts of the community.</p>
                     <p>There are two methods of curing the miſchiefs of faction: The one, by removing its cauſes; the other, by controling its effects.</p>
                     <p>There are again two methods of removing the cauſes of faction: The one by deſtroying the liberty which is eſſential to its exiſtence; the other, by giving to every citizen the ſame opinions, the ſame paſſions, and the ſame intereſts.</p>
                     <p>It could never be more truly ſaid than of the firſt remedy, that it is worſe than the diſeaſe. Liberty is to faction, what air is to fire, an aliment without which it inſtantly expires. But it could not be a leſs folly to aboliſh liberty, which is eſſential to political life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it nouriſhes faction, than it would be to wiſh the annihilation of air, which is eſſential to animal life, becauſe it imparts to fire its deſtructive agency.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond expedient is as impracticable, as the firſt would be unwiſe. As long as the reaſon of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exerciſe it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection ſubſiſts between his reaſon and his ſelf-love, his opinions and his paſſions will have a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themſelves. The diverſity in the faculties of men from which the rights of property originate, is not leſs an inſuperable obſtacle to an uniformity of intereſts. The protection of theſe faculties is the firſt object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the poſſeſſion of different degrees

                     <p>The latent cauſes of faction are thus ſown in the nature of man; and we ſee them every where brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumſtances of civil ſociety. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiouſly contending for pre-eminence and power; or to perſons of other deſcriptions whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes have been intereſting to the human paſſions, have in turn divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animoſity, and rendered them much more diſpoſed to vex and oppreſs each other, than to co-operate for their common good. So ſtrong is this propenſity of mankind to fall into mutual animoſities, that where no ſubſtantial occaſion preſents itſelf, the moſt frivolous and fanciful diſtinctions have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to kindle their unfriendly paſſions, and excite their moſt violent conflicts. But the moſt common and durable ſource of factions, has been the various and unequal diſtribution of property. Thoſe who hold, and thoſe who are without property, have ever formed diſtinct intereſts in ſociety. Thoſe who are creditors, and thoſe who are debtors, fall under a like diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. A landed intereſt, a manufacturing intereſt, a mercantile intereſt, a monied intereſt, with many leſſer intereſts, grow up of neceſſity in civilized nations, and divide them into different claſſes, actuated by different ſentiments and views. The regulation of theſe various and interfering intereſts forms the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal taſk of modern legiſlation, and involves the ſpirit of party and faction in the neceſſary and ordinary ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of government.</p>
                     <p>No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cauſe; becauſe his intereſt would certainly bias his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Yet the parties are and muſt be themſelves the judges; and the moſt numerous party, or, in other words, the moſt powerful faction muſt be expected to prevail. Shall domeſtic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by reſtrictions on foreign manufactures? Are queſtions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing claſſes; and probably by neither, with a ſole regard to juſtice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various deſcriptions of property, is an act which ſeems to require the moſt exact impartiality, yet there is perhaps no legiſlative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party, to trample on the rules of juſtice. Every ſhilling with which they over-burden the inferior number, is a ſhilling ſaved to their own pockets.</p>
                     <p>It is in vain to ſay, that enlightened ſtateſmen will be able to adjuſt theſe claſhing intereſts, and render them all ſubſervient to the public good. Enlightened ſtateſmen will not always be at the helm: Nor, in many caſes, can ſuch an adjuſtment be made at all, without taking into view indirect and remote conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which will rarely prevail over the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intereſt which one party may find in diſregarding the rights of another, or the good of the whole.</p>

                        <pb n="57" facs="unknown:021127_0062_0FB23BCE46D315E8"/>The inference to which we are brought, is, that the <hi>cauſes</hi> of faction cannot be removed; and that relief is only to be ſought in the means of controling its <hi>effects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a faction conſiſts of leſs than a majority, relief is ſupplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its ſiniſter views by regular vote: It may clog the adminiſtration, it may convulſe the ſociety; but it will be unable to execute and maſk its violence under the forms of the conſtitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government on the other hand enables it to ſacrifice to its ruling paſſion or intereſt, both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To ſecure the public good, and private rights againſt the danger of ſuch a faction, and at the ſame time to preſerve the ſpirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our enquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great deſideratum, by which alone this form of government can be reſcued from the opprobrium under which it has ſo long labored, and be recommended to the eſteem and adoption of mankind.</p>
                     <p>By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the exiſtence of the ſame paſſion or intereſt in a majority at the ſame time, muſt be prevented; or the majority, having ſuch co-exiſtent paſſion or intereſt, muſt be rendered, by their number and local ſituation, unable to concert and carry into effect ſchemes of oppreſſion. If the impulſe and the opportunity be ſuffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be ſuch on the injuſtice and violence of individuals, and loſe their efficacy in proporti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n to the number com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together; that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.</p>
                     <p>From this view of the ſubject, it may be concluded, that a pure democracy, by which I mean a ſociety,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:021127_0063_0FB23BCFC5426F80"/>
conſiſting of a ſmall number of citizens, who aſſemble and adminiſter the government in perſon, can admit of no cure for the miſchiefs of faction. A common paſſion or intereſt will, in almoſt every caſe, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert reſults from the form of government itſelf; and there is nothing to check the inducements to ſacrifice the weaker party, or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is, that ſuch democracies have ever been ſpectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with perſonal ſecurity, or the rights of property; and have in general been as ſhort in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths.— Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this ſpecies of government, have erroneouſly ſuppoſed, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the ſame time, be perfectly equallized and aſſimilated in their poſſeſſions, their opinions, and their paſſions.</p>
                     <p>A republic, by which I mean a government in which the ſcheme of repreſentation takes place, opens a different proſpect, and promiſes the cure for which we are ſeeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we ſhall compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend both the nature of the cure, and the efficacy which it muſt derive from the union.</p>
                     <p>The two great points of difference between a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy and a republic, are, firſt, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a ſmall number of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens elected by the reſt; ſecondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater ſphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.</p>
                     <p>The effect of the firſt difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by paſſing them through the medium of a choſen body of citizens, whoſe wiſdom may beſt diſcern the true intereſt of their country, and whoſe patriotiſm and love of juſtice, will be leaſt likely to ſacrifice it to temporary or partial conſiderations. Under ſuch a regulation, it may well
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021127_0064_0FB23BD145B56148"/>
happen that the public voice pronounced by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, will be more conſonant to the public good, than if pronounced by the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves convened for the purpoſe. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, of local prejudices, or of ſiniſter deſigns, may by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, firſt obtain the ſuffrages, and then betray the intereſts of the people. The queſtion reſulting is, whether ſmall or extenſive republics are moſt favourable to the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favour of the latter by two obvious conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place it is to be remarked, that however ſmall the republic may be, the repreſentatives muſt be raiſed to a certain number, in order to guard againſt the cabals of a few; and that however large it may be, they muſt be limited to a certain number, in order to guard againſt the confuſion of a multitude. Hence the number of repreſentatives in the two caſes not being in proportion to that of the conſtituents, and being proportionally greateſt in the ſmall republic, it follows, that if the proportion of fit characters be not leſs in the large than in the ſmall republic, the former will preſent a greater option, and conſequently a greater probability of a fit choice.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, as each repreſentative will be choſen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the ſmall republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practiſe with ſucceſs the vicious arts, by which elections are too often carried; and the ſuffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre on men who poſſeſs the moſt attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive merit, and the moſt diffuſive and eſtabliſhed characters.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that in this, as in moſt other caſes, there is a mean, on both ſides of which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021127_0065_0FB23BD2C5B230E0"/>
too little acquainted with all their local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and leſſer intereſts; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to theſe, and too little fit to comprehend and purſue great and national objects. The federal conſtitution forms a happy combination in this reſpect; the great and aggregate intereſts being referred to the national, the local and particular to the ſtate legiſlatures</p>
                     <p>The other point of difference is, the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compaſs of republican, than of democratic government; and it is this circumſtance principally which renders factious combinations leſs to to be dreaded in the former, than in the latter. The ſmaller the ſociety, the fewer probably will be the diſtinct parties and intereſts compoſing it; the fewer the diſtinct parties and intereſts, the more frequently will a majority be found of the ſame party; and the ſmaller the number of individuals compoſing a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the ſmaller the compaſs within which they are placed, the more eaſily will they concert and execute their plans of oppreſſion. Extend the ſphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; you make it leſs probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if ſuch a common motive exiſts, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to diſcover their own ſtrength, and to act in uniſon with each other. Beſides other impediments, it may be remarked, that where there is a conſciouſneſs of unjuſt or diſhonorable purpoſes, communication is always checked by diſtruſt, in proportion to the number whoſe concurrence is neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Hence it clearly appears, that the ſame advantage, which a republic has over a democracy, in controling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a ſmall republic—is enjoyed by the union over the ſtates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it. Does this advantage conſiſt in the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of repreſentatives, whoſe enlightened views and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021127_0066_0FB23BD45CAD81C8"/>
virtuous ſentiments render them ſuperior to local prejudices, and to ſchemes of injuſtice? It will not be denied, that the repreſentation of the union will be moſt likely to poſſeſs theſe requiſite endowments. Does it conſiſt in the greater ſecurity afforded by a greater variety of parties, againſt the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppreſs the reſt? In an equal degree does the encreaſed variety of parties, compriſed within the union, encreaſe this ſecurity. Does it, in fine, conſiſt in the greater obſtacles oppoſed to the concert and accompliſhment of the ſecret wiſhes of an unjuſt and intereſted majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Here, again, the extent of the union gives it the moſt palpable advantage.</p>
                     <p>The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular ſtates, but will be unable to ſpread a general conflagration through the other ſtates: A religious ſect, may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy; but the variety of ſects diſperſed over the entire face of it, muſt ſecure the national councils againſt any danger from that ſource: A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal diviſion of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be leſs apt to pervade the whole body of the union, than a particular member of it; in the ſame proportion as ſuch a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or diſtrict, than an entire ſtate.</p>
                     <p>In the extent and proper ſtructure of the union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diſeaſes moſt incident to republican government. And according to the degree of pleaſure and pride, we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cheriſhing the ſpirit, and ſupporting the character of federaliſts.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XI. The Utility of the Union in Reſpect to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and a Navy.</head>
                     <p>THE importance of the union, in a commercial light, is one of thoſe points, about which there is leaſt room to entertain a difference of opinion, and which has in fact commanded the moſt general aſſent of men, who have any acquaintance with the ſubject. This applies as well to our intercourſe with foreign countries, as with each other.</p>
                     <p>There are appearances to authoriſe a ſuppoſition, that the adventurous ſpirit, which diſtinguiſhes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneaſy ſenſations in ſeveral of the maritime powers of Europe. They ſeem to be apprehenſive of our too great interference in that carrying trade, which is the ſupport of their navigation and the foundation of their naval ſtrength. Thoſe of them, which have colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in America, look forward, to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful ſolicitude. They foreſee the dangers, that may threaten their American dominions from the neighbourhood of ſtates, which have all the diſpoſitions, and would poſſeſs all the means, requiſite to the creation of a powerful marine. Impreſſions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of foſtering diviſions among us, and of depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us as far as poſſible of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This would anſwer the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold purpoſe of preventing our interference in their navigation, of monopoliſing the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings, by which we might ſoar to a dangerous greatneſs. Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace by facts the workings of this policy to the cabinets of miniſters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:021127_0068_0FB23BD74828D630"/>If we continue united, we may counteract a policy ſo unfriendly to our proſperity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending at the ſame time throughout the ſtates, we may oblige foreign countries to bid againſt each other, for the privileges of our markets. This aſſertion will not appear chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical to thoſe who are able to appreciate the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to any manufacturing nation of the markets of three millions of people—increaſing in rapid progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the moſt part excluſively addicted to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and likely from local circumſtances to remain in this diſpoſition; and the immenſe difference there would be to the trade and navigation of ſuch a nation, between a direct communication in its own ſhips, and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from America, in the ſhips of another country. Suppoſe, for inſtance, we had a government in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, capable of excluding Great-Britain (with whom we have at preſent no treaty of commerce) from all our ports, what would be the probable operation of this ſtep upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate with the faireſt proſpect of ſucceſs for commercial privileges of the moſt valuable and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive kind in the dominions of that kingdom? When theſe queſtions have been aſked, upon other occaſions, they have received a plauſible but not a ſolid or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer. It has been ſaid, that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the ſyſtem of Britain; becauſe ſhe could proſecute her trade with us, through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate cuſtomers and pay-maſters for thoſe articles which were wanted for the ſupply of our markets. But would not her navigation be mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially injured, by the loſs of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compenſation for their agency and riſk? Would not the mere circumſtance of freight occaſion a conſiderable deduction? Would not ſo circuitous an
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021127_0069_0FB23BD8C5B9BE78"/>
intercourſe facilitate the competitions of other nations, by enchancing the price of Britiſh commodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this intereſting branch of the Britiſh commerce?</p>
                     <p>A mature conſideration of the objects, ſuggeſted by theſe queſtions, will juſtify a belief, that the real diſadvantages to Great Britain, from ſuch a ſtate of things, conſpiring with the prepoſſeſſions of a great part of the nation in favour of the American trade, and with the importunities of the Weſt-India iſlands, would produce a relaxation in her preſent ſyſtem, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of thoſe iſlands and elſewhere, from which our trade would derive the moſt ſubſtantial benefits. Such a point gained from the Britiſh government, and which could not be expected without an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in exemptions and immunities in our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, would be likely to have a correſpondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be inclined to ſee themſelves altogether ſupplanted in our trade.</p>
                     <p>A further reſource for influencing the conduct of European nations towards us, in this reſpect would ariſe from the eſtabliſhment of a federal navy. There can be no doubt, that the continuance of the union, under an efficient government, would put it in our power, at a period not very diſtant, to create a navy, which, if it could not vie with thoſe of the great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime powers, would at leaſt be of reſpectable weight if thrown into the ſcale of either of two contending parties. This would be more particularly the caſe in relation to operations in the Weſt-Indies. A few ſhips of the line ſent opportunely to the reinforcement of either ſide, would often be ſufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which intereſts of the greateſt magnitude were ſuſpended. Our poſition is in this reſpect a very commanding one. And if to this conſideration we add that of the uſefulneſs of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:021127_0070_0FB23BDACEE90FF8"/>
ſupplies from this country, in the proſecution of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary operations in the Weſt-Indies, it will readily be perceived, that a ſituation ſo favourable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial privileges. A price would be ſet not only upon our friendſhip, but upon our neutrality. By a ſteady adherance to the union we may hope ere long to become the arbiter of Europe in America; and to be able to incline the balance of European compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions in this part of the world as our intereſt may dictate.</p>
                     <p>But in the reverſe of this eligible ſituation we ſhall diſcover, that the rivalſhips of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and would fruſtrate all the tempting advantages, which nature has kindly placed within our reach. In a ſtate ſo inſignificant, our commerce would be a prey to the wanton inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddlings of all nations at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little ſcruple or remorſe ſupply their wants by depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on our property, as often as it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be reſpected, when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, deſpicable by its weakneſs, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.</p>
                     <p>Under a vigorous national government, the natural ſtrength and reſources of the country, directed to a common intereſt, would baffle all the combinations of European jealouſy to reſtrain our growth. This ſituation would even take away the motive to ſuch combinations, by inducing an impracticability of ſucceſs. An active commerce, an extenſive navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, a flouriſhing marine would then be the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table offspring of moral and phyſical neceſſity. We might defy the little arts of little politicians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, or vary, the irreſiſtible and unchangeable courſe of nature.</p>
                     <p>But in a ſtate of diſunion theſe combinations might exiſt, and might operate with ſucceſs. It would be
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021127_0071_0FB23BDBC7E2C0C8"/>
in the power of the maritime nations, availing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of our univerſal impotence, to preſcribe the conditions of our political exiſtence; and as they have a common intereſt in being our carriers, and ſtill more in preventing our being theirs, they would in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability combine to embarraſs our navigation in ſuch a manner, as would in effect deſtroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We ſhould thus be compelled to content ourſelves with the firſt price of our commodities, and to ſee the profits of our trade ſnatched from us to enrich our enemies and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. That unequalled ſpirit of enterpriſe, which ſignaliſes the genius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itſelf an inexhauſtible mine of national wealth, would be ſtifled and loſt; and poverty and diſgrace would overſpread a country, which with wiſdom might make herſelf the admiration and envy of the world.</p>
                     <p>There are rights of great moment to the trade of America, which are rights of the union—I allude to the fiſheries, to the navigation of the Lakes and to that of the Miſſiſſippi. The diſſolution of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy would give room for delicate queſtions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the future exiſtence of theſe rights; which the intereſt of more powerful partners would hardly fail to ſolve to our diſadvantage. The diſpoſition of Spain with regard to the Miſſiſſippi needs no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. France and Britain are concerned with us in the fiſheries; and view them as of the utmoſt moment to their navigation. They, of courſe, would hardly remain long indifferent to that decided maſtery of which experience has ſhown us to be poſſeſſed in this valuable branch of traffic; and by which we are able to underſell thoſe nations in their own markets. What more natural, than that they ſhould be diſpoſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, from the liſts, ſuch dangerous competitors?</p>
                     <p>This branch of trade ought not to be conſidered as a partial benefit. All the navigating ſtates may in different degrees advantageouſly participate in it, and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021127_0072_0FB23BDD468ECD70"/>
under circumſtances of a greater extenſion of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile capital would not be unlikely to do it. As a nurſery of ſeamen it now is, or when time ſhall have more nearly aſſimilated the principles of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the ſeveral ſtates, will become an univerſal reſource. To the eſtabliſhment of a navy it muſt be indiſpenſible.</p>
                     <p>To this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in various ways. Every inſtitution will grow and flouriſh in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentered towards its formation and ſupport. A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the reſources of all, is an object far leſs remote than a navy of any ſingle ſtate, or partial confederacy, which would only embrace the reſources of a part. It happens indeed that different portions of confederated America poſſeſs each ſome peculiar advantage for this eſſential eſtabliſhment. The more Southern ſtates furniſh in greater abundance certain kinds of naval ſtores—tar, pitch and turpentine. Their wood for the conſtruction of ſhips is alſo of a more ſolid and laſting texture. The difference in the duration of the ſhips of which the navy might be compoſed, if chiefly conſtructed of Southern wood would be of ſignal importance either in the view of naval ſtrength or of national economy. Some of the Southern and of the middle ſtates yield a greater plenty of iron and of better quality. Seamen muſt chiefly be drawn from the Nothern hive. The neceſſity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce, and the conducive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that ſpecies of commerce to the proſperity of a navy, are points too manifeſt to require a particular elucidation. They, by a kind of reaction, mutually beneficial, promote each other.</p>
                     <p>An unreſtrained intercourſe between the ſtates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will advance the trade of each, by an interchange of their reſpective productions, not only for the ſupply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021127_0073_0FB23BDEC5B038F8"/>
part will be repleniſhed, and will acquire additional motion and vigour from a free circulation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of every part. Commercial enterpriſe will have much greater ſcope, from the diverſity in the productions of different ſtates. When the ſtaple of one fails, from a bad harveſt or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the ſtaple of another. The variety not leſs than the value of products for exportation, contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be conducted upon much better terms, with a large number of materials of a given value, than with a ſmall number of materials of the ſame value; ariſing from the competitions of trade and from the fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of markets. Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and unſaleable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can ſcarcely happen that they ſhould all be at one time in the latter predicament; and on this account the operations of the merchant would be leſs liable to any conſiderable obſtruction or ſtagnation. The ſpeculative trader will at once perceive the force of theſe obſervations; and will acknowledge, that the aggregate ballance of the commerce of the United States, would bid fair to be much more favourable than that of the Thirteen States, without union, or with partial unions.</p>
                     <p>It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the ſtates are united, or diſunited, there would ſtill be an intimate intercourſe between them which would anſwer the ſame ends: But this intercourſe would be fettered, interrupted and narrowed by a multiplicity of cauſes; which in the courſe of theſe papers have been amply detailed. An unity of commercial, as well as political intereſts, can only reſult from an unity of government.</p>
                     <p>There are other points of view, in which this ſubject might be placed, of a ſtriking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a newſpaper diſcuſſion. I ſhall briefly obſerve, that
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021127_0074_0FB23BE045A7E040"/>
our ſituation invites, and our intereſt prompts us, to aim at an aſcendant in the ſyſtem of American affairs. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a diſtinct ſet of intereſts. Unhappily for the other three, Europe by her arms and by her negociations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all. Africa, Aſia, and America, have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively felt her domination. The ſuperiority ſhe has long maintained, has tempted her to plume herſelf as the miſtreſs of the world, and to conſider the reſt of mankind as created for her benefit. Men, admired as profound philoſophers, have, in direct terms, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to her inhabitants a phyſical ſuperiority; and have gravely aſſerted that all animals, and with them the human ſpecies, degenerate in America—that even dogs ceaſe to bark after having breathed a while in our atmoſphere<note n="*" place="bottom">Recherches philoſophiques ſur les Americains.</note>. Facts have too long ſupported theſe arrogant pretenſions of the European: It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach that aſſuming brother moderation. Union will enable us to do it. Diſunion will add another victim to his triumphs. Let Americans diſdain to be the inſtruments of European greatneſs! Let the Thirteen States, bound together in a ſtrict and indiſſoluble union, concur in erecting one great American ſyſtem, ſuperior to the controul of all tranſ-atlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XII. The Utility of the Union in reſpect to Revenue.</head>
                     <p>THE effects of union, upon the commercial proſperity of the ſtates, have been ſufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the intereſts of revenue will be the ſubject of our preſent enquiry.</p>
                     <p>The proſperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged, by all enlightened ſtateſmen to be the moſt uſeful as well as the moſt productive ſource of national wealth; and has accordingly become a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary object of their political cares. By multiplying the means of gratification, by promoting the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and circulation of the precious metals, thoſe darling objects of human avarice and enterpriſe, it ſerves to vivify and invigorate all the channels of induſtry, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiouſneſs. The aſſiduous merchant, the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious huſbandman, the active mechanic, and the induſtrious manufacturer, all orders of men look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleaſing reward of their toils. The often-agitated queſtion between agriculture and commerce, has from indubitable experience received a deciſion, which has ſilenced the rivalſhips that once ſubſiſted between them, and has proved, to the entire ſatisfaction of their friends, that their intereſts are intimately blended and interwoven. It has been found, in various countries, that in proportion as commerce has flouriſhed land has riſen in value. And how could it have happened otherwiſe? Could that which procures a freer vent for the products of the earth—which furniſhes new incitements to the cultivators of land—which is the moſt powerful inſtrument in increaſing the quantity of money in a ſtate—could that, in fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labour and induſtry, in every ſhape, fail to augment the value of that article, which
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021127_0076_0FB23BE34568D788"/>
is the prolific parent of far the greateſt part of the objects, upon which they are exerted? It is aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſo ſimple a truth ſhould ever have had an adverſary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a ſpirit of ill informed jealouſy or of too great abſtraction and refinement is to lead men aſtray from the plaineſt paths of reaſon and conviction.</p>
                     <p>The ability of a country to pay taxes muſt always be proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation and to the celerity with which it circulates. Commerce, contributing to both th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ertile, cultivated and populous territory, a large proportion of which is ſituated in mild and luxuriant climates. In ſome parts of this territory are to be found, the beſt gold and ſilver mines in Europe. And yet, from the want of the foſtering influence of commerce, that monarch can boaſt but ſlender revenues. He has ſeveral times been compelled to owe obligations to the pecuniary ſuccours of other nations, for the preſervation of his eſſential intereſts; and is unable, upon the ſtrength of his own reſources, to ſuſtain a long or continued war.</p>
                     <p>But it is not in this aſpect of the ſubject alone that union will be ſeen to conduce to the purpoſes of revenue. There are other points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate and deciſive. It is evident from the ſtate of the country, from the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point itſelf, that it is impracticable to raiſe any very conſiderable ſums by direct taxation. Tax laws have in vain been multiplied—new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried—the public expectation has been uniformly diſappointed, and the treaſuries of the ſtates have remained empty. The popular ſyſtem of adminiſtration, inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:021127_0077_0FB23BE4C5F91168"/>
real ſcarcity of money, incident to a languid and mutilated ſtate of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extenſive collections, and has at length taught the different legiſlatures the folly of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p>No perſon acquainted with what happens in other countries, will be ſurpriſed at this circumſtance. In ſo opulent a nation as that of Britain, where direct taxes, from ſuperior wealth, muſt be much more toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and, from the vigor of the government, much more practicable, than in America, far the greateſt part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind; from impoſts and from exciſes. Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter deſcription.</p>
                     <p>In America, it is evident, that we muſt a long time, depend for the means of revenue, chiefly on ſuch duties. In moſt parts of it, exciſes muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within a narrow compaſs. The genius of the people will ill-brook the inquiſitive and peremptory ſpirit of exciſe laws. The pockets of the farmers on the other hand will reluctantly yield but ſcanty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in the unwelcome ſhape of impoſitions on their houſes and lands—and perſonal property is too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious and inviſible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way, than by the imperceptible agency of taxes on conſumption.</p>
                     <p>If theſe remarks have any foundation, that ſtate of things, which will beſt enable us to improve and extend ſo valuable a reſource, muſt be the beſt adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit of a ſerious doubt, that this ſtate of things muſt reſt on the baſis of a general union. As far as this would be conducive to the intereſts of commerce, ſo far it muſt tend to the extenſion of the revenue to be drawn from that ſource. As far as it would contribute to render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regulations for the collection of the duties more ſimple and efficacious, ſo far it muſt ſerve to anſwer the purpoſes of making the ſame rate of duties more
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:021127_0078_0FB23BE645A23AF0"/>
productive, and of putting it into the power of the government to increaſe the rate, without prejudice to trade.</p>
                     <p>The relative ſituation of theſe ſtates—the number of rivers with which they are interſected, and of bays that waſh their ſhores—the facility of communication in every direction—the affinity of language and manners—the familiar habits of intercourſe; all theſe are circumſtances that would conſpire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty; and would inſure frequent evaſions of the commercial regulations of each other. The ſeparate ſtates, or confederacies, would be neceſſitated by mutual jealouſy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowneſs of their duties. The temper of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for a long time to come, would not permit thoſe rigorous precautions, by which the European nations guard the avenues into their reſpective coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as well by land as by water, and which even there are found inſufficient obſtacles to the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous ſtratagems of avarice.</p>
                     <p>In France there is an army of patrols (as they are called) conſtantly employed to ſecure her fiſcal regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations againſt the inroads of the dealers in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Mr. Neckar computes the number of theſe patrols at upwards of twenty thouſand. This proves the immenſe difficulty in preventing that ſpecies of traffic, where there is an inland communication, and ſhews in a ſtrong light the diſadvantages, with which the collection of duties in this country would be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, if by diſunion the ſtates ſhould be placed in a ſituation with reſpect to each other, reſembling that of France with reſpect to her neighbours. The arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are neceſſarily armed would be intolerable in a free country.</p>
                     <p>If on the contrary there be but one government, pervading all the States, there will be as to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of our commerce but ONE SIDE to guard,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:021127_0079_0FB23BE7C53275A8"/>
the ATLANTIC COAST. Veſſels arriving directly from foreign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely chooſe to hazard themſelves to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated and critical perils, which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into port. They would have to dread both the dangers of the coaſt, and of detection as well after as before their arrival at the places of their final deſtination. An ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue. A few armed veſſels, judiciouſly ſtationed at the entrances of our ports, might at ſmall expence be made uſeful ſentinels of the laws. And the government having the ſame intereſt to provide againſt violations every where, the co-operation of its meaſures in each ſtate would have a powerful tendency to render them effectual. Here alſo we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by union an advantage which nature holds out to us, and which would be relinquiſhed by ſeparation. The United States lie at a great diſtance from Europe and at a conſiderable diſtance from all other places, with which they would have extenſive connections of foreign trade. The paſſage from them to us in a few hours, or in a ſingle night, as between the coaſts of France and Britain and of other neighbouring nations would be impracticable. This is a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſecurity againſt a direct contraband with foreign countries; but a circuitous contraband to one ſtate through the medium of another, would be both eaſy and ſafe. The difference between a direct impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from abroad and an indirect importation, through the channel of a neighbouring ſtate, in ſmall parcels, according to time and opportunity, with the additional facilities of inland communication, muſt be palpable to every man of diſcernment.</p>
                     <p>It is, therefore, evident, that one national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be able, at much leſs expence, to extend the duties on imports, beyond compariſon further, than would be practicable to the ſtates ſeparately, or
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:021127_0080_0FB23BE94539E400"/>
to any partial confederacies: Hitherto I believe it may ſafely be aſſerted that theſe duties have not upon an average exceeded in any ſtate three per cent. In France they are eſtimated at about fifteen per cent, and in Britain the proportion is ſtill greater. There ſeems to be nothing to hinder their being increaſed in this country, to at leaſt treble their preſent amount. The ſingle article of ardent ſpirits, under federal regulation, might be made to furniſh a conſiderable revenue. Upon a ratio to the importation into this ſtate, the whole quantity imported into the United States may at a low computation be eſtimated at four millions of gallons; which at a ſhilling per gallon would produce two hundred thouſand pounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty; and if it ſhould tend to diminiſh the conſumption of it, ſuch an effect would be equally favorable to the agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the economy, to the morals and to the health of the ſociety. There is perhaps nothing ſo much a ſubject of national extravagance, as this very article.</p>
                     <p>What will be the conſequence, if we are not able to avail ourſelves of the reſource in queſtion in its full extent? A nation cannot long exiſt without revenue. Deſtitute of this eſſential ſupport, it muſt reſign its independence, and ſink into the degraded condition of a province. This is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede. Revenue therefore muſt be had at all events. In this country, if the principal part be not drawn from commerce, it muſt fall with oppreſſive weight upon land. It has been already intimated that exciſes, in their true ſignification, are too little in uniſon with the feelings of the people, to admit of great uſe being made of that mode of taxation: nor indeed, in the ſtates where almoſt the ſole employment is agriculture, are the objects proper for exciſe ſufficiently numerous, to permit very ample collections in that way. Perſonal eſtate, (as has been before remarked) from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of tracting it, cannot be ſubjected to large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:021127_0081_0FB23BEAC764DA50"/>
by any other means than by taxes on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. In populous cities, it may be enough the ſubject of conjecture, to occaſion the oppreſſion of individuals, without much aggregate benefit to the ſtate; but beyond theſe circles it muſt in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure eſcape the eye and the hand of the tax gatherer. As the neceſſities of the ſtate, nevertheleſs, muſt be ſatisfied in ſome mode or other, the defect of other reſources muſt throw the principal weight of the public burthens on the poſſeſſors of land. And as on the other hand the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate ſupply, unleſs all the ſources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under ſuch embarraſſments, cannot be put into a ſituation conſiſtent with its reſpectability, or its ſecurity. Thus we ſhall not even have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of a full treaſury to atone for the oppreſſion of that valuable claſs of the citizens, who are employed in the cultivation of the ſoil. But public and private diſtreſs will keep pace with each other in gloomy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert; and unite in deploring the infatuation of thoſe councils, which led to diſunion.</p>

                     <p>AS connected with the ſubject of revenue, we may with propriety conſider that of economy. The money ſaved from one object may be uſefully applied to another; and there will be ſo much the leſs to be drawn from the pockets of the people. If the ſtates are united under one government, there will be but one national civil liſt to ſupport; if they are divided into ſeveral confederacies, there will be as many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:021127_0082_0FB23BEC45185A10"/>
national civil liſts to be provided for; and each of them, as to the principal departments coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive with that which would be neceſſary for a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole. The entire ſeparation of the ſtates into thirteen unconnected ſovereignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many advocates. The ideas of men who ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate upon the diſmemberment of the empire, ſeem generally turned towards three confederacies; one conſiſting of the four Northern, another of the four middle, and a third of the five Southern ſtates. There is little probability that there would be a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. According to this diſtribution, each confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy would compriſe an extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great-Britain. No well informed man will ſuppoſe that the affairs of ſuch a confederacy can be properly regulated by a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſs comprehenſive in its organs or inſtitutions, than that which has been propoſed by the convention. When the dimenſions of a ſtate attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the ſame energy of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſame forms of adminiſtration, which are requiſite in one of much greater extent. This idea admits not of preciſe demonſtration, becauſe there is no rule by which we can meaſure the momentum of civil power, neceſſary to the government of any given number of individuals; but when we conſider that the Iſland of Britain, nearly commenſurate with each of the ſuppoſed confederacies, contains about eight millions of people, and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the paſſions of ſo large a ſociety to the public good, we ſhall ſee no reaſon to doubt that the like portion of power would be ſufficient to perform the ſame taſk in a ſociety far more numerous. Civil power properly organiſed and exerted is capable of diffuſing its force to a very great extent; and can in a manner reproduce itſelf in every part of a great empire by a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:021127_0083_0FB23BEDC4A489A0"/>The ſuppoſition, that each confederacy into which the ſtates would be likely to be divided, would require a government not leſs comprehenſive, than the one propoſed, will be ſtrengthened by another ſuppoſition, more probable than that which preſents us with three confederacies as the alternative to a general union. If we attend carefully to geographical and commercial conſiderations, in conjunction with the habits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the different ſtates, we ſhall be led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in caſe of diſunion they will moſt naturally league themſelves under two governments. The four Eaſtern ſtates, from all the cauſes that form the links of national ſympathy and connection, may with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty be expected to unite. New-York, ſituated as ſhe is, would never be unwiſe enough to oppoſe a feeble and unſupported flank to the weight of that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. There are obvious reaſons, that would faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate her acceſſion to it. New-Jerſey is too ſmall a ſtate to think of being a frontier, in oppoſition to this ſtill more powerful combination; nor do there appear to be any obſtacles to her admiſſion into it. Even Pennſylvania would have ſtrong inducements to join the Northern league. An active foreign commerce on the baſis of her own navigation is her true policy, and coincides with the opinions and diſpoſitions of her citizens. The more Southern ſtates, from various circumſtances, may not think themſelves much inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the encouragement of navigation. They may prefer a ſyſtem, which would give unlimited ſcope to all nations, to be the carriers as well as the purchaſers of their commodities. Pennſylvania may not chooſe to confound her intereſts in a connection ſo adverſe to her policy. As ſhe muſt at all events be a frontier, ſhe may deem it moſt conſiſtent with her ſafety to have her expoſed ſide turned towards the weaker power of the Southern, rather than towards the ſtronger power of the Northern confederacy. This would give her the faireſt chance to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Nothing can be more evident than that the Thirteen States will be able to ſupport a national government, better than one half, or one third, or any number leſs than the whole.

                     <p>If in addition to the conſideration of a plurality of civil liſts, we take into view the number of perſons who muſt neceſſarily be employed to guard the inland communication, between the different confederacies, againſt illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly ſpring up out of the neceſſiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

All that remains, within this branch of our enquiries, is to take notice of an objection, that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the union embraces. A few obſervations on this ſubject will be the more proper, as it is perceived that the adverſaries of the new conſtitution are availing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a prevailing prejudice, with regard to the practicable ſphere of republican adminiſtration, in order to ſupply by imaginary difficulties, the want of thoſe ſolid objections, which they endeavour in vain to find.</p>
                     <p>The error which limits republican government to a narrow diſtrict, has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only, that it ſeems to owe its riſe and prevalence chiefly to the confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a republic with a democracy: And applying to the former reaſonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true diſtinction between theſe forms was alſo adverted to on a former occaſion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exerciſe the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in perſon; in a republic they aſſemble and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it by their repreſentatives and agents. A demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy conſequently muſt be confined to a ſmall ſpot. A republic may be extended over a large region.</p>
                     <p>To this accidental ſource of the error may be added, the artifice of ſome celebrated authors, whoſe writings have had a great ſhare in forming the modern ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of political opinions. Being ſubjects either of an abſolute, or limited monarchy, they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to heighten the advantages or palliate the evils of thoſe forms; by placing in compariſon with them, the vices and defects of the republican, and by citing as ſpecimens of the latter, the turbulent democracies of ancient Greece, and modern Italy. Under the confuſion of names, it has been an eaſy taſk to transfer
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:021127_0086_0FB23BF247E8DF30"/>
to a republic, obſervations applicable to a democracy only, and among others, the obſervation that it can never be eſtabliſhed but among a ſmall number of people, living within a ſmall compaſs of territory.</p>
                     <p>Such a fallacy may have been the leſs perceived, as moſt of the popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic ſpecies; and even in modern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of repreſentation, no example is ſeen of a government wholly popular, and founded at the ſame time wholly on that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. If Europe has the merit of diſcovering this great mechanical power in government, by the ſimple agency of which, the will of the largeſt political body may be concentred, and its force directed to any object, which the public good requires: America can claim the merit of making the diſcovery the baſis of unmixed and extenſive republics. It is only to be lamented, that any of her citizens ſhould wiſh to deprive her of the additional merit of diſplaying its full efficacy in the eſtabliſhment of the comprehenſive ſyſtem now under her conſideration.</p>
                     <p>As the natural limit of a democracy is that diſtance from the central point, which will juſt permit the moſt remote citizens to aſſemble as often as their public functions demand; and will include no greater number than can join in thoſe functions; ſo the natural limit of a republic is that diſtance from the centre, which will barely allow the repreſentatives of the people to meet as often as may be neceſſary for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of public affairs. Can it be ſaid, that the limits of the United States exceed this diſtance? It will not be ſaid by thoſe who recollect that the Atlantic coaſt is the longeſt ſide of the union; that during the term of thirteen years, the repreſentatives of the ſtates have been almoſt continually aſſembled; and that the members from the moſt diſtant ſtates are not chargeable with greater intermiſſions of attendance, than thoſe from the ſtates in the neighbourhod of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="unknown:021127_0087_0FB23BF3C52569D0"/>That we may form a juſter eſtimate with regard to this intereſting ſubject, let us reſort to the actual dimenſions of the union. The limits, as fixed by the treaty of peace are on the Eaſt the Atlantic, on the South the latitude of thirty one degrees, on the Weſt the Miſſiſſippi, and on the North an irregular line running in ſome inſtances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the forty-ſecond. The Southern ſhore of lake Erie lies below that lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Computing the diſtance between the thirty-firſt and forty-fifth degrees, it amounts to nine hundred and ſeventy three common miles; computing it from thirty one to forty two degrees to ſeven hundred, ſixty four miles and an half. Taking the mean for the diſtance, the amount will be eight hundred, ſixty eigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> miles and three fourths. The mean diſtance from the Atlantic to the Miſſiſſippi, does not probably exceed ſeven hundred and fifty miles. On a compariſon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> this extent, with that of ſeveral countries in Europe the practicability of rendering our ſyſtem commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to it, appears to be demonſtrable. It is not a great deal larger than Germany, where a diet, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the whole empire is continual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y aſſembled; or than Poland before the late diſmemberment, where another national diet was the depoſitary of the ſupreme power. Paſſing by France and Spain, we find that in Great Britain, inferior as it may be in ſize, the repreſentatives of the Northern extremity of the iſland, have as far to travel to the national council, as will be required of thoſe of the moſt remote parts of the union.</p>
                     <p>Favourable as this view of the ſubject may be, ſome obſervations remain which will place it in a light ſtill more ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place it is to be remembered, that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and adminiſtering laws. Its juriſdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic, but
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021127_0088_0FB23BF544E0BFB0"/>
which are not to be attained by the ſeparate proviſions of any. The ſubordinate governments which can extend their care to all thoſe other objects, which can be ſeparately provided for, will retain their due autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and activity. Were it propoſed by the plan of the convention to aboliſh the governments of the particular ſtates, its adverſaries would have ſome ground for their objection, though it would not be difficult to ſhow that if they were aboliſhed, the general government would be compelled by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf preſervation, to reinſtate them in their proper juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond obſervation to be made is, that the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate object of the federal conſtitution is to ſecure the union of the Thirteen primitive States, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them ſuch other ſtates, as may ariſe in their own boſoms, or in their neighbourhoods, which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that may be neceſſary for thoſe angles and fractions of our territory, which lie on our north-weſtern frontier, muſt be left to thoſe whom further diſcoveries and experience will render more equal to the taſk.</p>
                     <p>Let it be remarked in the third place, that the intercourſe throughout the union will be daily facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by new improvements. Roads will every where be ſhortened, and kept in better order; accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for travellers will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our eaſtern ſide will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout the whole extent of the Thirteen States. The communication between the Weſtern and Atlantic diſtricts, and between different parts of each, will be rendered more and more eaſy by thoſe numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has interſected our country, and which art finds it ſo little difficult to connect and complete.</p>
                     <p>A fourth and ſtill more important conſideration is, that as almoſt every ſtate will on one ſide or other be a frontier, and will thus find in a regard to its ſafety,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021127_0089_0FB23BF75095AAA0"/>
an inducement to make ſome ſacrifices for the ſake of the general protection; ſo the ſtates which lie at the greateſt diſtance from the heart of the union, and which of courſe may partake leaſt of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the ſame time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will conſequently ſtand on particular occaſions, in greateſt need of its ſtrength and reſources. It may be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Georgia or the ſtates forming our Weſtern or North-Eaſtern borders, to ſend their repreſentatives to the ſeat of government, but they would find it more ſo to ſtruggle alone againſt an invading enemy, or even to ſupport alone the whole expence of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, which may be dictated by the neighbourhood of continual danger. If they ſhould derive leſs benefit therefore from the union in ſome reſpects, than the leſs diſtant ſtates, they will derive greater benefit from it in other reſpects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout.</p>
                     <p>I ſubmit to you my fellow citizens, theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in full confidence that the good ſenſe which has ſo often marked your deciſions, will allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never ſuffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance or however faſhionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into the gloomy and perilous ſcenes into which the advocates for diſunion would conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of America, knit together as they are by ſo many chords of affection, can no longer live together as members of the ſame family; can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happineſs; can no longer be fellow citizens of one great reſpectable and flouriſhing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildeſt projectors; that it raſhly attempts what it
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021127_0090_0FB23BF84B0B87A8"/>
is impoſſible to accompliſh. No my countrymen, ſhut your ears againſt this unhallowed language. Shut your hearts againſt the poiſon which it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American citizens, the mingled blood which they have ſhed in defence of their ſacred rights, conſecrate their union, and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be ſhunned, believe me the moſt alarming of all novelties, the moſt wild of all projects, the moſt raſh of all attempts, is that of rending us in pieces, in order to preſerve our liberties and promote our happineſs. But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected merely becauſe it may compriſe what is new? Is it not the glory of the people of America, that whilſt they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not ſuffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for cuſtom, or for names, to overrule the ſuggeſtions of their own good ſenſe, the knowledge of their own ſituation, and the leſſons of their own experience? To this manly ſpirit, poſterity will be indebted for the poſſeſſion, and the world for the example of the numerous innovations diſplayed on the American theatre, in favour of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate rights and public happineſs. Had no important ſtep been taken by the leaders of the revolution for which a precedent could not be diſcovered, no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed of which an exact model did not preſent itſelf, the people of the United States might, at this moment, have been numbered among the melancholy victims of miſguided councils, muſt at beſt have been labouring under the weight of ſome of thoſe forms which have cruſhed the liberties of the reſt of mankind. Happily for America, happily we truſt for the whole human race, they purſued a new and more noble courſe. They accompliſhed a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human ſociety: They reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe. They formed the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021127_0091_0FB23BF9C778B458"/>
deſign of a great confederacy, which it is incumbent on their ſucceſſors to improve and perpetuate. If their works betray imperfections, we wonder at the fewneſs of them. If they erred moſt in the ſtructure of the union, this was the work moſt difficult to be executed, this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide.</p>

                     <p>IN the courſe of the preceding papers, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, my fellow citizens, to place before you, in a clear and convincing light, the importance of union to your political ſafety and happineſs.

                     <p>In purſuance of the plan, which I have laid down, for the diſcuſſion of the ſubject, the point next in order to be examined is the
<q>inſufficiency of the preſent confederation to the preſervation of the union.</q>
It may perhaps be aſked, what need is there of reaſoning or proof to illuſtrate a poſition, which is neither controverted nor doubted; to which the underſtandings and feelings of all claſſes of men aſſent; and which in ſubſtance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the friends of the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution?—It muſt in truth be acknowledged that however theſe may differ in other reſpects, they in general appear to harmoniſe in this ſentiment at leaſt, that there are mater<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>al imperfections in our national ſyſtem, and that ſomething is neceſſary to be done to reſcue us from impending anarchy. The facts that ſupport this opinion are no longer objects of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. They have forced themſelves upon the ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the people at large, and have at length extorted from thoſe, whoſe miſtaken policy has had the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſhare in precipitating the extremity, at which we are arrived, a reluctant confeſſion of the reality of many of thoſe defects in the ſcheme of our federal government, which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the union.</p>
                     <p>We may indeed with propriety be ſaid to have reached almoſt the laſt ſtage of national humiliation. There is ſcarcely any thing that can wound the pride, or degrade the character of an independent nation, which we do not experience. Are there engagements to the performance of which we are held by every tie reſpectable among men? Theſe are the ſubjects of conſtant and unbluſhing violation. Do we owe debts

to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time of imminent peril, for the preſervation of our political exiſtence? Theſe remain without any proper or ſatisfactory proviſion for their diſcharge. Have we valuable territories and important poſts in the poſſeſſion of a foreign power, which by expreſs ſtipulations ought long ſince to have been ſurrendered? Theſe are ſtill retained, to the prejudice of our intereſts not leſs than of our rights. Are we in a condition to reſent, or to repel the aggreſſion?

                        </gap> us from it. Is public credit an indiſpenſable reſource in time of public danger? We ſeem to have abandoned its cauſe as deſperate and irretrievable. Is commerce of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to national wealth? Ours is at the loweſt point of declenſion. Is reſpectability in the eyes of foreign powers a ſafeguard againſt foreign encroachments? The imbecillity of our government even forbids them to treat with us: Our ambaſſadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic ſovereignty. Is a violent and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural decreaſe in the value of land a ſymptom of national diſtreſs? The price of improved land in moſt parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity of waſte land at market, and can only be fully explained by that want of private and public confidence, which are ſo alarmingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent among all ranks and which have a direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the friend and patron of induſtry? That moſt uſeful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narroweſt limits, and this ſtill more from an opinion of inſecurity than from a ſcarcity of money. To ſhorten an enumeration
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:021127_0094_0FB23BFE45BFE0C8"/>
of particulars which can afford neither pleaſure nor inſtruction it may in general be demanded, what indication is there of national diſorder, poverty and inſignificance that could befal a community ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly bleſſed with natural advantages as we are, which does not form a part of the dark catalogue of our public misfortunes?</p>
                     <p>This is the melancholy ſituation to which we have been brought by thoſe very maxims and councils, which would now deter us from adopting the propoſed conſtitution; and which not content with having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us to the brink of a precipice, ſeem reſolved to plunge us into the abyſs, that awaits us below. Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm ſtand for our ſafety, our tranquility, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at laſt break the fatal charm which has too long ſeduced us from the paths of felicity and proſperity.</p>
                     <p>It is true, as has been before obſerved, that facts too ſtubborn to be reſiſted have produced a ſpecies of general aſſent to the abſtract propoſition that there exiſt material defects in our national ſyſtem; but the uſefulneſs of the conceſſion, on the part of the old adverſaries of federal meaſures, is deſtroyed by a ſtrenous oppoſition to a remedy, upon the only prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that can give it a chance of ſucceſs. While they admit that the government of the United States is deſtitute of energy, they contend againſt conferring upon it thoſe powers which are requiſite to ſupply that energy: They ſeem ſtill to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable—at an augmentation of federal authority without a dimunition of ſtate authority—at ſovereignty in the union and complete independence in the members, They ſtill, in fine, ſeem to cheriſh with blind devotion the political monſter of an <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium in imperio.</hi> This renders a full diſplay of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal defects of the confederation neceſſary, in order to ſhew, that the evils we experience do not proceed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021127_0095_0FB23C009CDE07A8"/>
from minute or partial imperfections, but from funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental errors in the ſtructure of the building which cannot be amended otherwiſe than by an alteration in the firſt principles and main pillars of the fabric.</p>
                     <p>The great and radical vice in the conſtruction of the exiſting confederation is in the principle of LEGIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATION for STATES or GOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as contradiſtinguiſhed from the INDIVIDUALS of whom they conſiſt. Though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the union; yet it pervades and governs thoſe on which the efficacy of the reſt depends. Except as to the rule of appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment, the United States have an indefinite diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make requiſitions for men and money; but they have no authority to raiſe either by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America. The conſequence of this is, that though in theory their reſolutions concerning thoſe objects are laws, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally binding on the members of the union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations, which the ſtates obſerve or diſregard at their option.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſingular inſtance of the capriciouſneſs of the human mind, that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head, there ſhould ſtill be found men, who object to the new conſtitution for deviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old; and which is in itſelf evidently incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the idea of GOVERNMENT; a principle in ſhort which, if it is to be executed at all, muſt ſubſtitute the violent and ſanguinary agency of the ſword to the mild influence of the magiſtracy.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing abſurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between independent nations, for certain defined purpoſes preciſely ſtated in a treaty; regulating all the details of time, place, circumſtance and quantity; leaving nothing to future diſcretion; and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts of this kind
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:021127_0096_0FB23C020A25FDF0"/>
exiſt among all civilized nations ſubject to the uſual viciſſitudes of peace and war, of obſervance and non-obſervance, as the intereſts or paſſions of the contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers dictate. In the early part of the preſent century, there was an epidemical rage in Europe for this ſpecies of compacts; from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for benefits which were never realized. With a view to eſtabliſhing the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium of power and the peace of that part of the world, all the reſources of negotiation were exhauſted, and triple and quadruple alliances were formed; but they were ſcarcely formed before they were broken, giving an inſtructive but afflicting leſſon to mankind, how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have no other ſanction than the obligations of good faith, and which oppoſe general conſiderations of peace and juſtice to the impulſe of any immediate intereſt or paſſion.</p>
                     <p>If the particular ſtates in this country are diſpoſed to ſtand in a ſimilar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a general DISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the ſcheme would indeed be pernicious, and would entail upon us all the miſchiefs which have been enumerated under the firſt head; but it would have the merit of being at leaſt conſiſtent and practicable. Abandoning all views towards a confederate government, this would bring us to a ſimple alliance offenſive and defenſive; and would place us in a ſituation to be alternately friends and enemies of each other, as our mutual jealouſies and rivalſhips nouriſhed by the intrigues of foreign nations ſhould preſcribe to us.</p>
                     <p>But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous ſituation; if we will ſtill adhere to the deſign of a national government, or which is the ſame thing of a ſuperintending power under the direction of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon council, we muſt reſolve to incorporate into our plan thoſe ingredients which may be conſidered as forming the characteriſtic difference between a league
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:021127_0097_0FB23C0389643490"/>
and a government; we muſt extend the authority of the union to the perſons of the citizens—the only proper objects of government.</p>
                     <p>Government implies the power of making laws. It is eſſential to the idea of a law, that it be attended with a ſanction; or, in other words, a penalty or puniſhment for diſobedience. If there be no penalty annexed to diſobedience, the reſolutions or commands which pretend to be laws, will in fact amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation. This penalty, whatever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways; by the agency of the courts and miniſters of juſtice, or by military force; by the COERTION of the magiſtracy, or by the COERTION of arms. The firſt kind can evidently apply only to men—the laſt kind muſt of neceſſity be employed againſt bodies politic, or communities or ſtates. It is evident, that there is no proceſs of a court by which their obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the laws can in the laſt reſort be enforced. Sentences may be denounced againſt them for viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their duty; but theſe ſentences can only be carried into execution by the ſword. In an aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities that compoſe it, every breach of the laws muſt involve a ſtate of war, and military execution muſt become the only inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of civil obedience. Such a ſtate of things can certainly not deſerve the name of government, nor would any prudent man chooſe to commit his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to it.</p>
                     <p>There was a time when we were told that breaches, by the ſtates, of the regulations of the federal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were not to be expected—that a ſenſe of common intereſt would preſide over the conduct of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive members, and would beget a full compliance with all the conſtitutional requiſitions of the union.

received further leſſons from that beſt oracle of wiſdom, experience. It at all times betrayed an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the true ſprings by which human conduct is actuated, and belied the original inducements to the eſtabliſhment of civil power. Why has govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been inſtituted at all? Becauſe the paſſions of men will not conform to the dictates of reaſon and juſtice, without conſtraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater diſintereſtedneſs than individuals? The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate obſervers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reaſons. Regard to reputation has a leſs active influence, when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number, than when it is to fall ſingly upon one. A ſpirit of faction which is apt to mingle its poiſon in the deliberations of all bodies of men, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In addition to all this, there is in the nature of ſovereign power an impatience of controul, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes thoſe who are inveſted with the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rciſe of it, to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to reſtrain or direct its operations. From this ſpirit it happens, that in every political aſſociation which is formed upon the principle of uniting in a common intereſt a number of leſſer ſovereignties, there will be found a kind of excentric tendency in the ſubordinate or inferior orbs, by the operation of which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the common centre. This tendency is not difficult to be accounted for. It has its origin in the love of power. Power controuled or abridged is almoſt always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controuled or abridged. This ſimple propoſition will teach us how little reaſon there is to expect, that the perſons, entruſted with the adminiſtration of the affairs of the particular members of a confederacy, will at all times
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021127_0099_0FB2458686B4B0A8"/>
be ready, with perfect good humour and an unbiaſſed regard to the public weal, to execute the reſolutions or decrees of the general authority. The reverſe of this reſults from the conſtitution of man.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the meaſures of the confederacy cannot be executed, without the intervention of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular adminiſtrations, there will be little proſpect of their being executed at all. The rulers of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive members, whether they have a conſtitutional right to do it or not, will undertake to judge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the meaſures themſelves. They will conſider the conformity of the thing propoſed or required to their immediate intereſts or aims; the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this will be done; and in a ſpirit of intereſted and ſuſpicious ſcrutiny, without that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of national circumſtances and reaſons of ſtate, which is eſſential to a right judgment, and with that ſtrong predilection in favor of local objects, which can hardly fail to miſlead the deciſion. The ſame proceſs muſt be repeated in every member of which the body is conſtituted; and the execution of the plans, framed by the councils of the whole, will always fluctuate on the diſcretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part. Thoſe who have been converſant in the proceedings of popular aſſemblies; who have ſeen how difficult it often is, when there is no exterior preſſure of circumſtances, to bring them to harmonious reſolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impoſſible it muſt be to induce a number of ſuch aſſemblies, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating at a diſtance from each other, at different times, and under different impreſſions, long to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate in the ſame views and purſuits.</p>
                     <p>In our caſe, the concurrence of thirteen diſtinct ſovereign wills is requiſite under the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the complete execution of every important meaſure, that proceeds from the union. It has happened as was to have been foreſeen. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021127_0100_0FB24590E972CF30"/>
of the union have not been executed; and the delinquencies of the ſtates have ſtep by ſtep matured themſelves to an extreme; which has at length arreſted all the wheels of the national government, and brought them to an awful ſtand. Congreſs at this time ſcarcely poſſeſs the means of keeping up the forms of adminiſtration; till the ſtates can have time to agree upon a more ſubſtantial ſubſtitute for the preſent ſhadow of a federal government. Things did not come to this deſperate extremity at once. The cauſes which have been ſpecified produced at firſt only unequal and diſproportionate degrees of compliance with the requiſitions of the union. The greater deficiencies of ſome ſtates furniſhed the pretext of example and the temptation of intereſt to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, or to the leaſt delinquent ſtates. Why ſhould we do more in proportion than thoſe who are embarked with us in the ſame political voyage? Why ſhould we conſent to bear more than our proper ſhare of the common burthen? Theſe were ſuggeſtions which human ſelfiſhneſs could not withſtand, and which even ſpeculative men, who looked forward to remote conſequences, could not without heſitation combat. Each ſtate yielding to the perſuaſive voice of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intereſt or convenience has ſucceſſively with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn its ſupport, till the frail and tottering edifice ſeems ready to fall upon our heads and to cruſh us beneath its ruins.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XVI. The ſame Subject continued, in Relation to the ſame Principles.</head>
                     <p>THE tendency of the principle of legiſlation for ſtates or communities, in their political capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, as it has been exemplified by the experiment we have made of it, is equally atteſted by the events
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021127_0101_0FB245956754E4B8"/>
which have befallen all other governments of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate kind, of which we have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in thoſe ſyſtems. The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a diſtinct and particular examination. I ſhall content myſelf with barely obſerving here, that of all the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of antiquity which hiſtory has handed down to us, the Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far as there remain veſtiges of them, appear to have been moſt free from the fetters of that miſtaken principle, and were accordingly thoſe which have beſt deſerved, and have moſt liberally received the applauding ſuffrages of political writers.</p>
                     <p>This exceptionable principle may as truly as empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically be ſtiled the parent of anarchy: It has been ſeen that delinquencies in the members of the union are its natural and neceſſary offspring; and that whenever they happen, the only conſtitutional remedy is force, and the immediate effect of the uſe of it, civil war.</p>
                     <p>It remains to enquire how far ſo odious an engine of government, in its application to us, would even be capable of anſwering its end. If there ſhould not be a large army, conſtantly at the diſpoſal of the national government, it would either not be able to employ force ot all, or when this could be done, it would amount to a war between different parts of the confederacy, concerning the infractions of a league; in which the ſtrongeſt combination would be moſt likely to prevail, whether it conſiſted of thoſe who ſupported, or of thoſe who reſiſted the general autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redreſſed would be confined to a ſingle member, and if there were more than one, who had neglected their duty, ſimilarity of ſituation would induce them to unite for common defence. Independent of this motive of ſympathy, if a large and influential ſtate ſhould happen to be the aggreſſing member, it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbours, to win over ſome of them as aſſociates to its cauſe.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:021127_0102_0FB24598F0337E28"/>
Specious arguments of danger to the general liberty could eaſily be contrived; plauſible excuſes for the deficiencies of the party, could, without difficulty be invented, to alarm the apprehenſions, inflame the paſſions, and conciliate the good will even of thoſe ſtates which were not chargeable with any violation, or omiſſion of duty. This would be the more likely to take place, as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected ſometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers, with a view to getting rid of all external controul upon their deſigns of perſonal agrandizement; the better to effect which, it is preſumable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent ſtates. If aſſociates could not be found at home, recourſe would be had to the aid of foreign powers, who would ſeldom be diſinclined to encouraging the diſſentions of a confederacy, from the firm union of which they had ſo much to fear. When the ſword is once drawn, the paſſions of men obſerve no bounds of moderation. The ſuggeſtions of wounded pride, the inſtigations of irritated reſentment, would be apt to carry the ſtates, againſt which the arms of the union were exerted, to any extremes neceſſary to avenge the affront, or to avoid the diſgrace of ſubmiſſion. The firſt war of this kind would probably terminate i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a diſſolution of the union.</p>
                     <p>This may be conſidered as the violent death of the confederacy. Its more natural death is what we now ſeem to be on the point of experiencing, if the federal ſyſtem be not ſpeedily renovated in a more ſubſtantial form. It is not probable, conſidering the genius of this country, that the complying ſtates would often be inclined to ſupport the authority of the union by engaging in a war againſt the non-complying ſtates. They would always be more ready to purſue the milder courſe of putting themſelves upon an equal footing with the delinquent members, by an imitation of their example. And the guilt of all would thus
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:021127_0103_0FB2459A88B87BA0"/>
become the ſecurity of all. Our paſt experience has exhibited the operation of this ſpirit in its full light. There would in fact be an inſuperable difficulty in aſcertaining when force could with propriety be employed. In the article of pecuniary contribution, which would be the moſt uſual ſource of delinquency, it would often be impoſſible to decide whether it had proceeded from diſinclination, or inability. The pretence of the latter would always be at hand. And the caſe muſt be very f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>agrant in which its fallacy could be detected with ſufficient certainty to juſtify the harſh expedient of compulſion. It is eaſy to ſee that this problem alone, as often as it ſhould occur, would open a wide field to the majority that happened to prevail in the national council, for the exerciſe of factious views, of partiality and of oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to require no pains to prove that the ſtates ought not to prefer a national conſtitution, which could only be kept in motion by the inſtrumentality of a large army, continually on foot to execute the ordinary requiſitions or decrees of the government. And yet this is the plain alternative involved by thoſe who wiſh to deny it the power of extending its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to individuals. Such a ſcheme, if practicable at all, would inſtantly degenerate into a military deſpotiſm; but it will be found in every light imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable. The reſources of the union would not be equal to the maintenance of an army conſiderable enough to confine the larger ſtates within the limits of their duty; nor would the means ever be furniſhed of forming ſuch an army in the firſt inſtance. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſiders the populouſneſs and ſtrength of ſeveral of theſe ſtates ſingly at the preſent juncture, and looks forward to what they will become, even at the diſtance of half a century, will at once diſmiſs as idle and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary any ſcheme, which aims at regulating their movements by laws, to operate upon them in their collective capacities, and to be executed by a coertion applicable to them in the ſame capacities. A project
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:021127_0104_0FB2459CDDFFE6B0"/>
of this kind is little leſs romantic than the monſter-taming ſpirit, attributed to the fabulous heroes and demi-gods of antiquity.</p>
                     <p>Even in thoſe confederacies, which have been compoſed of members ſmaller than many of our counties, the principle of legiſlation for ſovereign ſtates, ſupported by military coertion, has never been found effectual. It has rarely been attempted to be employed, but againſt the weaker members; and in moſt inſtances attempts to coerce the refractory and diſobedient, have been the ſignals of bloody wars; in which one half of the confederacy has diſplayed its banners againſt the other half.</p>
                     <p>The reſult of theſe obſervations to an intelligent mind muſt be clearly this, that if it be poſſible at any rate to conſtruct a federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and preſerving the general tranquillity, it muſt be founded, as to the objects committed to its care, upon the reverſe of the principle contended for by the opponents of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed conſtitution. It muſt carry its agency to the perſons of the citizens. It muſt ſtand in need of no intermediate legiſlations; but muſt itſelf be impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to employ the arm of the ordinary magiſtrate to execute its own reſolutions. The majeſty of the national authority muſt be manifeſted through the medium of the courts of juſtice. The government of the union, like that of each ſtate, muſt be able to addreſs itſelf immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals; and to attract to its ſupport, thoſe paſſions, which have the ſtrongeſt influence upon the human heart. It muſt in ſhort, poſſeſs all the means and have a right to reſort to all the methods of executing the powers, with which it is entruſted, that are poſſeſſed and exerciſed by the governments of the particular ſtates.</p>
                     <p>To this reaſoning it may perhaps be objected, that if any ſtate ſhould be diſſaffected to the authority of the union, it could at any time obſtruct the execution
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:021127_0105_0FB245A1865ADC90"/>
of its laws, and bring the matter to the ſame iſſue of force, with the neceſſity of which the oppoſite ſcheme is reproached.</p>
                     <p>The plauſibility of this objection will vaniſh the moment we advert to the eſſential difference between a mere NON COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and ACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interpoſition of the ſtate-legiſlatures be neceſſary to give effect to a meaſure of the union, they have only NOT TO ACT, or TO ACT EVASIVELY, and the meaſure is defeated. This neglect of duty may be diſguiſed under affected but unſubſtantial proviſions, ſo as not to appear, and of courſe not to excite any alarm in the people for the ſafety of the conſtitution. The ſtate-leaders may even make a merit of their ſurreptitious invaſions of it, on the ground of ſome temporary convenience, exemption or advantage.</p>
                     <p>But if the execution of the laws of the national government, ſhould not require the intervention of the ſtate-legiſlatures; if they were to paſs into imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate operation upon the citizens themſelves, the particular governments could not interrupt their progreſs without an open and violent exertion of an unconſtitutional power. No omiſſions, nor evaſions would anſwer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in ſuch a manner, as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights. An experiment of this nature would always be hazardous in the face of a conſtitution in any degree competent to its own defence, and of a people enlightened enough to diſtinguiſh between a legal exerciſe and an illegal uſurpation of authority. The ſucceſs of it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not merely a factious majority in the legiſlature, but the concurrence of the courts of juſtice, and of the body of the people. If the judges were not embarked in a conſpiracy with the legiſlature, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the reſolutions of ſuch a majority to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſupreme law of the land, unconſtitutional and void. If the people were not tainted with the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:021127_0106_0FB245A453F04750"/>
ſpirit of their ſtate repreſentatives, they, as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral guardians of the conſtitution, would throw their weight into the national ſcale, and give it a decided preponderancy in the conteſt. Attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or raſhneſs; becauſe they could ſeldom be made without danger to the authors; unleſs in caſes of a tyrannical exerciſe of the federal authority.</p>
                     <p>If oppoſition to the national government ſhould ariſe from the diſorderly conduct of refractory, or ſeditious individuals, it could be overcome by the ſame means which are daily employed againſt the ſame evil, under the ſtate governments. The magiſtracy, being equally the miniſters of the law of the land, from whatever ſource it might emanate, would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be as ready to guard the national as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiouſneſs. As to thoſe partial commotions and inſurrections which ſometimes diſquiet ſociety, from the intrigues of an inconſiderable faction, or from ſudden or occaſional ill humours that do not infect the great body of the community, the general government could command more extenſive reſources for the ſuppreſſion of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances of that kind, than would be in the power of any ſingle member. And as to thoſe mortal feuds, which in certain conjunctures ſpread a conflagration through a whole nation, or through a very large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of it, proceeding either from weighty cauſes of diſcontent given by the government, or from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of ſome violent popular paroxiſm, they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation. When they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and diſmemberments of empire. No form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can always either avoid or controul them. It is in vain to hope to guard againſt events too mighty for human foreſight or precaution; and it would be idle to object to a government becauſe it could not perform impoſſibilities.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XVII. The Subject continued, and illuſtrated by Examples to ſhow the Tendency of Federal Governments, rather to Anarchy among the Members than Tyranny in the Head.</head>
                     <p>AN objection of a nature different from that which has been ſtated and anſwered in my laſt addreſs, may perhaps be likewiſe urged againſt the principle of legiſlation for the individual citizens of America. It may be ſaid, that it would tend to render the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the union too powerful, and to enable it to abſorb in itſelf thoſe reſiduary authorities, which it might be judged proper to leave with the ſtates for local purpoſes. Allowing the utmoſt latitude to the love of power, which any reaſonable man can require, I confeſs I am at a loſs to diſcover what temptation the perſons entruſted with the adminiſtration of the general government could ever feel to diveſt the ſtates of the authorities of that deſcription. The regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mere domeſtic police of a ſtate appears to me to hold out ſlender allurements to ambition. Commerce, finance, negotiation and war ſeem to comprehend all the objects, which have charms for minds governed by that paſſion; and all the powers neceſſary to theſe objects ought in the firſt inſtance to be lodged in the national depoſitary. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of private juſtice between the citizens of the ſame ſtate, the ſuperviſion of agriculture and of other concerns of a ſimilar nature, all thoſe things in ſhort which are proper to be provided for by local legiſlation, can never be deſireable cares of a general juriſdiction. It is therefore improbable that there ſhould exiſt a diſpoſition in the federal councils to uſurp the powers with which they are connected;
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:021127_0108_0FB245AA661C5CE8"/>
becauſe the attempt to exerciſe thoſe powers would be as troubleſome as it would be nugatory; and the poſſeſſion of them, for that reaſon, would contribute nothing to the dignity, to the importance, or to the ſplendor of the national government.</p>
                     <p>But let it be admitted for argument ſake, that mere wantonneſs and luſt of domination would be ſufficient to beget that diſpoſion, ſtill it may be ſafely affirmed, that the ſenſe of the conſtituent body of the national repreſentatives, or in other words of the people of the ſeveral States would controul the indulgence of ſo extravagant an appetite. It will always be far more eaſy for the ſtate governments to encroach upon the national authorities, than for the national government to encroach upon the ſtate authorities. The proof of this propoſition turns upon the greater degree of influence, which the ſtate governments, if they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter their affairs with uprightneſs and prudence, will generally poſſeſs over the people; a circumſtance which at the ſame time teaches us, that there is an inherent and intrinſic weakneſs in all federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and that too much pains cannot be taken in their organization, to give them all the force which is compatible with the principles of liberty.</p>
                     <p>The ſuperiority of influence in favour of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular governments would reſult partly from the diffuſive conſtruction of the national government; but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the attention of the ſtate adminiſtrations would be directed.</p>
                     <p>It is a known fact in human nature that its affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are commonly weak in proportion to the diſtance or diffuſivneſs of the object. Upon the ſame principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his neighbourhood, to his neighbourhood than to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity at large, the people of each ſtate would be apt to feel a ſtronger byaſs towards their local govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than towards the government of the union; unleſs the force of that principle ſhould be deſtroyed by a much better adminiſtration of the latter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="unknown:021127_0109_0FB245ABE2F687F0"/>This ſtrong propenſity of the human heart would find powerful auxiliaries in the objects of ſtate regulation.</p>
                     <p>The variety of more minute intereſts, which will neceſſarily fall under the ſuperintendence of the local adminiſtrations, and which will form ſo many rivulets of influence running through every part of the ſociety, cannot be particulariſed without involving a detail too tedious and unintereſting to compenſate for the inſtruction it might afford.</p>
                     <p>There is one tranſcendent advantage belonging to the province of the ſtate governments which alone ſuffices to place the matter in a clear and ſatisfactory light—I mean the ordinary adminiſtration of criminal and civil juſtice. This of all others is the moſt powerful, moſt univerſal and moſt attractive ſource of popular obedience and attachment. It is this, which—being the immediate and viſible guardian of life and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty—having its benefits and its terrors in conſtant activity before the public eye—regulating all thoſe perſonal intereſts and familiar concerns to which the ſenſibility of individuals is more immediately awake— contributes more than any other circumſtance to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing upon the minds of the people affection, eſteem and reverence towards the government. This great cement of ſociety which will diffuſe itſelf almoſt wholly through the channels of the particular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, independent of all other cauſes of influence, would enſure them ſo decided an empire over their reſpective citizens, as to render them at all times a complete counterpoiſe and not unfrequently dangerous rivals to the power of the union.</p>
                     <p>The operations of the national government on the other hand, falling leſs immediately under the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the maſs of the citizens, the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by ſpeculative men. Relating to more general intereſts, they will be leſs apt to come home to the feelings of the people; and, in proportion, leſs likely to inſpire
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:021127_0110_0FB245B1EDCF2088"/>
a habitual ſenſe of obligation and an active ſentiment of attachment.</p>
                     <p>The reaſoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the experience of all federal conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, with which we are acquainted, and of all others, which have borne the leaſt analogy to them.</p>
                     <p>Though the ancient feudal ſyſtems were not ſtrictly ſpeaking confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that ſpecies of aſſociation. There was a common head, chieftain, or ſovereign, whoſe authority exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over the whole nation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and a number of ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate vaſſals, or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to them and numerous trains of <hi>inferior</hi> vaſſals or retainers, who occupied and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience to the perſons of whom they held it. Each principal vaſſal was a kind of ſovereign within his particular demeſnes. The conſequences of this ſituation were a continual oppoſition to the authority of the ſovereign, and frequent wars between the great barons, or chief feudatories themſelves. The power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak either to preſerve the public peace or to protect the people againſt the oppreſſions of their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is emphatically ſtiled by hiſtorians the times of feudal anarchy.</p>

In thoſe inſtances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his vaſſals, his ſucceſs was chiefly owing to the tyranny of thoſe vaſſals ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the common people were dreaded and deteſted by both; till mutual danger and mutual intereſt effected an union between them fatal to the power of the ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy. Had the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and juſtice, preſerved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers, the conteſts between them and the prince muſt almoſt always have ended in their favor and in the abridgement or ſubverſion of the royal authority.</p>
                     <p>This is not an aſſertion founded merely in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or conjecture, Among other illuſtrations of its truth which might be cited, Scotland will furniſh a cogent example. The ſpirit of clanſhip which was at an early day introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and their dependents by ties equivalent to thoſe of kindred, rendered the ariſtocracy a conſtant overmatch for the power of the monarch; till the incorporation with England ſubdued its fierce and ungovernable ſpirit, and reduced it within thoſe rules of ſubordination, which a more rational and a more energetic ſyſtem of civil polity had previouſly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the latter kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The ſeparate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with the feudal baronies; with this advantage in their favor, that from the reaſons already explained, they will generally poſſeſs the confidence and good will of the people; and with ſo important a ſupport will be able effectually to oppoſe all incroachments of the national government. It will be well if they are not able to counteract its legitimate and neceſſary authority. The points of ſimilitude conſiſt in the rivalſhip of power, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to both, and in the CONCENTRATION of large portions of the ſtrength of the community into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular DEPOSITORIES, in one caſe at the diſpoſal of individuals, in the other caſe at the diſpoſal of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical bodies.</p>

                     <p>AMONG the confederacies of antiquity, the moſt conſiderable was that of the Grecian republics aſſociated under the Amphyctionic council. From the beſt accounts tranſmitted of this celebrated inſtitution, it bore a very inſtructive analogy to the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation of the American ſtates.</p>
                     <p>The members retained the character of independent and ſovereign ſtates, and had equal votes in the federal council. This council had a general authority to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolve whatever it judged neceſſary for the common welfare of Greece—to declare and carry on war—to decide in the laſt reſort all controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the members—to fine the aggreſſing party— to employ the whole force of the confederacy againſt the diſobedient—to admit new members. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyctions were the guardians of religion, and of the immenſe riches belonging to the temple of Delphos, where they had the right of juriſdiction in controverſies between the inhabitants and thoſe who came to conſult the oracle. As a further proviſion for the efficacy of the federal powers, they took an oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to puniſh the violators of this oath, and to inflict vengeance on ſacrilegious deſpoilers of the temple.</p>
                     <p>In theory and upon paper, this apparatus of powers, ſeems amply ſufficient for all general purpoſes. In
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:021127_0113_0FB245C227ACF798"/>
ſeveral material inſtances, they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation. The Amphyctions had in their hands the ſuperſtition of the times, one of the principal engines by which government was then maintained; they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared authority to uſe coertion againſt refractory cities, and were bound by oath to exert this authority on the neceſſary occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Very different nevertheleſs was the experiment from the theory. The powers, like thoſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent congreſs, were adminiſtered by deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities; and exerciſed over them in the ſame capacities. Hence the weakneſs, the diſorders, and finally the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the confederacy. The more powerful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, inſtead of being kept in awe and ſubordination, tyrannized ſucceſſively over all the reſt. Athens, as we learn from Demoſthenes, was the arbiter of Greece ſeventy three years. The Lacedemonians next go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned it twenty nine years; at a ſubſequent period, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of domination.</p>
                     <p>It happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the deputies of the ſtrongeſt cities, awed and corrupted thoſe of the weaker, and that judgment went in favor of the moſt powerful party.</p>
                     <p>Even in the midſt of defenſive and dangerous wars with Perſia and Macedon, the members never acted in concert, and were more or fewer of them, eternally the dupes, or the hirelings of the common enemy. The intervals of foreign war, were filled up by domeſtic viciſſitudes, convulſions and carnage.</p>
                     <p>After the concluſion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the Lacedemonians, required that a number of the cities ſhould be turned out of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The Athenians finding that the Lacedemonians would loſe fewer partizans by ſuch a meaſure than themſelves, and would become maſters of the public deliberations,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:021127_0114_0FB245C30E2A3498"/>
vigorouſly oppoſed and defeated the attempt. This piece of hiſtory proves at once the inefficiency of the union; the ambition and jealouſy of its moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful members, and the dependent and degraded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the reſt. The ſmaller members, though entitled by the theory of their ſyſtem, to revolve in equal pride and majeſty around the common center, had become in fact ſatellites of the orbs of primary magnitude.</p>
                     <p>Had the Greeks, ſays the Abbé Milot, been as wiſe as they were courageous, they would have been admoniſhed by experience of the neceſſity of a cloſer union, and would have availed themſelves of the peace which followed their ſucceſs againſt the Perſian arms, to eſtabliſh ſuch a reformation. Inſtead of this obvious policy, Athens and Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they had acquired, became firſt rivals, and then enemies; and did each other infinitely more miſchief, than they had ſuffered from Xerxes. Their mutual jealouſies, fears, hatreds and injuries, ended in the celebrated Peloponneſian war; which itſelf ended in the ruin and ſlavery of the Athenians, who had begun it.</p>
                     <p>As a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by internal diſſentions; ſo theſe never fail to bring on freſh calamities from abroad. The Phocians having ploughed up ſome conſecrated ground belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the temple of Apollo, the Amphyctionic council, according to the ſuperſtition of the age, impoſed a fine on the ſacrilegious offenders. The Phocians, being abetted by Athens and Sparta, refuſed to ſubmit to the decree. The Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook to maintain the authority of the Amphyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to avenge the violated god. The latter being the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eaker party, invited the aſſiſtance of Philip of Macedon, who had ſecretly foſtered the conteſt. Philip gladly ſeized the opportunity of executing the deſigns he had long planned againſt the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and bribes he won over to
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:021127_0115_0FB245C464EB7E08"/>
his intereſts the popular leaders of ſeveral cities; by their influence and votes, gained admiſſion into the Amphyctionic council; and by his arts and his arms, made himſelf maſter of the confederacy.</p>
                     <p>Such were the conſequences of the fallacious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, on which this intereſting eſtabliſhment was founded. Had Greece, ſays a judicious obſerver on her fate, been united by a ſtricter confederation, and perſevered in her union, ſhe would never have worn the chains of Macedon; and might have proved a barrier to the vaſt projects of Rome.</p>
                     <p>The Achaean league, as it is called, was another ſociety of Grecian republics, which ſupplies us with valuable inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wiſer, than in the preceding inſtance. It will accordingly appear, that though not exempt from a ſimilar cataſtrophe, it by no means equally deſerved it.</p>
                     <p>The cities compoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng this league, retained their municipal juriſdiction, appointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect equality. The ſenate in which they were repreſented, had the ſole and excluſive right of peace and war—of ſending and receiving ambaſſadors—of entering into treaties and alliances— of appointing a chief magiſtrate or pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tor, as he was called, who commanded their armies; and who with the advice and conſent of ten of the ſenators, not only aſtminiſtered the government in the receſs of the ſenate, but had a great ſhare in its deliberation, when aſſembled. According to the primitive conſtitution, there were two pretors aſſociated in the adminiſtration, but on trial, a ſingle one was preferred.</p>
                     <p>It appears that the cities had all the ſame laws and cuſtoms, the ſame weights and meaſures, and the ſame money. But how far this effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council, is left in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. It is ſaid only, that the cities were in a manner compelled to receive the ſame laws and
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:021127_0116_0FB245C608058EF0"/>
uſages. When Lacedemon was brought into the league by Philopoemen, it was attended with an abolition of the inſtitutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption of thoſe of the Achaeans. The Amphyctionic confederacies, of which ſhe had been a member, left her in the full exerciſe of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and her legiſlation. This circumſtance alone proves a very material difference in the genius of the two ſyſtems.</p>
                     <p>It is much to be regretted that ſuch imperfect monuments remain of this curious political fabric. Could its interior ſtructure and regular operation be aſcertained, it is probable that more light would be thrown by it on the ſcience of federal government, than by any of the like experiments with which we are acquainted.</p>
                     <p>One important fact ſeems to be witneſſed by all the hiſtorians who take notice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the renovation of the league by Aratus, as before its diſſolution by the arts of Macedon, there was infinitely more of moderation and juſtice in the adminiſtration of its government, and leſs of violence and ſedition in the people, than were to be found in any of the cities exerciſing <hi>ſingly</hi> all the prerogatives of ſovereignty. The abbé Mably in his obſervations on Greece, ſays that the popular government, which was ſo tempeſtuous elſewhere, cauſed no diſorders in the members of the Achaean republic, <hi>becauſe it was there tempered by the general authority and laws of the confederacy.</hi>

                     <p>Whilſt the Amphyctionic confederacy remained, that of the Achaeans, which comprehended the leſs important cities only, made little figure on the theatre
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:021127_0117_0FB245CC1D3FC718"/>
of Greece. When the former became a victim to Macedon, the latter was ſpared by the policy of Philip and Alexander. Under the ſucceſſors of theſe princes, however, a different policy prevailed. The arts of diviſion were practiſed among the Achaeans; each city was ſeduced into a ſeparate intereſt; the union was diſſolved. Some of the cities fell under the tyranny of Macedonian garriſons; others under that of uſurpers ſpringing out of their own confuſions. Shame and oppreſſion ere long awakened their love of liberty. A few cities re-united. Their example was followed by others, as opportunities were found of cutting off their tyrants. The league ſoon embraced almoſt the whole Peloponneſus. Macedon ſaw its progreſs; but was hindered by internal diſſentions from ſtopping it. All Greece caught the enthuſiaſm, and ſeemed ready to unite in one confederacy, when the jealouſy and envy in Sparta and Athens, of the riſing glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal damp on the enterprize. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the league to court the alliance of the kings of Egypt and Syria; who, as ſucceſſors of Alexander were rivals of the king of Macedon. This policy was defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led by his ambition to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbours the Achaeans; and who as an enemy to Macedon, had intereſt enough with the Egyptian and Syrian princes, to effect a breach of their engagements with the league. The Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of ſubmitting to Cleomenes, or of ſupplicating the aid of Macedon, its former oppreſſor. The latter expedient was adopted. The conteſt of the Greeks always afforded a pleaſing opportunity to that powerful neighbour, of intermeddling in their affairs. A Macedonian army quickly appeared: Cleomenes was vanquiſhed. The Achaeans ſoon experienced, as often happens, that a victorious and powerful ally, is but another name for a maſter. All that their moſt abject compliances
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:021127_0118_0FB245D1D76E8130"/>
could obtain from him was a toleration of the exerciſe of their laws. Philip, who was now on the throne of Macedon, ſoon provoked, by his tyrannies, freſh combinations among the Greeks. The Achaeans, though weakened by internal diſſentions, and by the revolt of Meſſene one of its members, being joined by the Etolians and Athenians, erected the ſtandard of oppoſition. Finding themſelves, though thus ſupported unequal to the undertaking, they once more had recourſe to the dangerous expedient of introducing the ſuccour of foreign arms. The Romans to whom the invitation was made, eagerly embraced it. Philip was conquered: Macedon ſubdued. A new criſis enſued to the league. Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions broke out among its members. Theſe the Romans foſtered. Callicrates and other popular leaders, became mercenary inſtruments for inveig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their countrymen. The more effectually to nouriſh diſcord and diſorder, the Romans had, to the aſtoniſhment of thoſe who confided in their ſincerity, already proclaimed univerſal liberty <note n="*" place="bottom">This was but another name more ſpecious for the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the members on the federal head.</note> throughout Greece. With the ſame inſidious views, they now ſeduced the members from the league, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to their pride, the violation it committed on their ſovereignty. By theſe arts, this union, the laſt hope of Greece, the laſt hope of antient liberty, was torn into pieces; and ſuch imbecility and diſtraction introduced, that the arms of Rome found little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in compleating the ruin which their arts had commenced. The Achaeans were cut to pieces; and Achaia loaded with chains, under which it is groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this hour.</p>

                     <p>THE examples of antient confederacies, cited in my laſt paper, have not exhauſted the ſource of experimental inſtruction on this ſubject. There are exiſting inſtitutions, founded on a ſimilar prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which merit particular conſideration. The firſt which preſents itſelf is the Germanic body.</p>
                     <p>In the early ages of chriſtianity Germany was occupied by ſeven diſtinct nations, who had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chief. The Franks, one of the number, having conquered the Gauls, eſtabliſhed the kingdom which has taken its name from them. In the ninth century, Charlemagne, its warlike monarch, carried his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arms in every direction; and Germany became a part of his vaſt dominions. On the diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which took place under his ſons, this part was erected into a ſeparate and independent empire. Charlemagne and his immediate deſcendants poſſeſſed the reality, as well as the enſigns and dignity of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power. But the principal vaſſals, whoſe fiefs had become hereditary, and who compoſed the national diets which Charlemagne had not aboliſhed, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally threw off the yoke, and advanced to ſovereign juriſdiction and independence. The force of imperial ſovereignty was inſufficient to reſtrain ſuch powerful dependents; or to preſerve the unity and tranquility of the empire. The moſt furious private wars, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with every ſpecies of calamity, were carried on between the different princes and ſtates. The
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:021127_0120_0FB245D96AED4DB8"/>
imperial authority, unable to maintain the public order, declined by degrees, till it was almoſt extinct in the anarchy, which agitated the long interval between the death of the laſt emperor of the Suabian, and the acceſſion of the firſt emperor of the Auſtrian lines. In the eleventh century, the emperors enjoyed full ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the ſymbols and decorations of power.</p>
                     <p>Out of this feudal ſyſtem, which has itſelf many of the important features of a confederacy, has grown the federal ſyſtem, which conſtitutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are veſted in a diet repreſenting the component members of the confederacy; in the emperor who is the executive magiſtrate, with a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on the decrees of the diet; and in the imperial chamber and aulic council, two judiciary tribunals having ſupreme juriſdiction in controverſies which concern the empire, or which happen among its members.</p>
                     <p>The diet poſſeſſes the general power of legiſlating for the empire—of making war and peace—contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alliances—aſſeſſing quotas of troops and money— conſtructing fortreſſes—regulating coin—admitting new members—and ſubjecting diſobedient members to the ban of the empire, by which the party is degraded from his ſovereign rights, and his poſſeſſions forfeited. The members of the confederacy are expreſsly reſtricted from entering into compacts, prejudicial to the empire, from impoſing tolls and duties on their mutual intercourſe, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the emperor and diet; from altering the value of money; from doing injuſtice to one another; or from affording aſſiſtance or retreat to diſturbers of the public peace. And the ban is denounced againſt ſuch as ſhall violate any of theſe reſtrictions. The members of the diet, as ſuch, are ſubject in all caſes to be judged by the emperor and diet, and in their private capacities, by the aulic council and imperial chamber.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="unknown:021127_0121_0FB245DAE4CCD278"/>The prerogotives of the emperor are numerous. The moſt important of them are, his excluſive right to make propoſitions to the diet—to negative its reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions—to name ambaſſadors—to confer dignities and titles—to fill vacant electorates—to found univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities—to grant privileges not injurious to the ſtates of the empire—to receive and apply the public reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues—and generally to watch over the public ſafety. In certain caſes, the electors form a council to him. In quality of emperor he poſſeſſes no territory within the empire; nor receives any revenue for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. But his revenue and dominions, in other qualities, conſtitute him one of the moſt powerful princes in Europe.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch a parade of conſtitutional powers, in the repreſentatives and head of this confederacy, the natural ſuppoſition would be, that it muſt form an exception to the general character which belongs to its kindred ſyſtems. Nothing would be farther from the reality. The fundamental principle, on which it reſts, that the empire is a community of ſovereigns; that the diet is a repreſentation of ſovereigns; and that the laws are addreſſed to ſovereigns; render the empire a nerveleſs body; incapable of regulating its own members; inſecure againſt external dangers; and agitated with unceaſing fermentations in its own bowels.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of Germany is a hiſtory of wars between the emperor and the princes and ſtates; of wars among the princes and ſtates themſelves; of the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtrong, and the oppreſſion of the weak; of foreign intruſions, and foreign intrigues; of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of men and money, diſregarded, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally complied with; of attempts to enforce them, altogether abortive, or attended with ſlaughter and deſolation, involving the innocent with the guilty; of general imbecilty, confuſion and miſery.</p>
                     <p>In the ſixteenth century, the emperor with one part of the empire on his ſide, was ſeen engaged againſt
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:021127_0122_0FB245E4797B1E50"/>
the other princes and ſtates. In one of the conflicts, the emperor himſelf was put to flight, and very near being made priſoner by the elector of Saxony. The late king of Pruſſia was more than once pitted againſt his imperial ſovereign; and commonly proved an overmatch for him. Controverſies and wars among the members themſelves have been ſo common, that the German annals are crowded with the bloody pages which deſcribe them. Previous to the peace of Weſtphalia, Germany was deſolated by a war of thirty years, in which the emperor, with one half of the empire was on one ſide; and Sweden with the other half on the oppoſite ſide. Peace was at length negotiated and dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to which foreign powers are parties, made a fundamental part of the Germanic conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>If the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the neceſſity of ſelf defence; its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is ſtill deplorable. Military preparations muſt be preceded by ſo many tedious diſcuſſions, ariſing from the jealouſies, pride, ſeparate views, and claſhing pretenſions, of ſovereign bodies; that before the diet can ſettle the arrangements, the enemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take it, are retiring into winter quarters.</p>
                     <p>The ſmall body of national troops which has been judged neceſſary in time of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid, infected with local prejudices, and ſupported by irregular and diſproportionate contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to the treaſury.</p>
                     <p>The impoſſibility of maintaining order, and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing juſtice among theſe ſovereign ſubjects, produced the experiment of dividing the empire into nine or ten circles or diſtricts; of giving them an interior organization; and of charging them with the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary execution of the laws againſt delinquent and contumacious members. This experiment has only ſerved to demonſtrate more fully, the radical vice of

the conſtitution. Each circle is the miniature picture of the deformities of this political monſter. They either fail to execute their commiſſions, or they do it with all the devaſtation and carnage of civil war. Sometimes whole circles are defaulters, and then they increaſe the miſchief which they were inſtituted to remedy.</p>
                     <p>We may form ſome judgment of this ſcheme of military coertion, from a ſample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial city, of the circle of Suabia, the abbè de St. Croix enjoyed certain immunities which had been reſerved to him. In the exerciſe of theſe, on ſome public occaſion, outrages were committed on him, by the people of the city. The conſequence was, that the city was put under the ban of the empire; and the duke of Bavaria, though director of another circle, obtained an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enforce it. He ſoon appeared before the city, with a corps of ten thouſand troops and finding it a fit occaſion, as he had ſecretly intended from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to revive an antiquated claim, on the pretext that his anceſtors had ſuffered the place to be diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered from his territory<note n="*" place="bottom">Pfeffel, Nouvel abreg. chronol. de l'hiſt. &amp;c. d'Allemagne, ſays the pretext was to indemnify himſelf for the expence of the expedition.</note>; he took poſſeſſion of it, in his own name; diſarmed and puniſhed the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and re-annexed the city to his domains.</p>
                     <p>It may be aſked perhaps what has ſo long kept this disjointed machine from falling entirely to pieces? The anſwer is obvious. The weakneſs of moſt of the members, who are unwilling to expoſe themſelves to the mercy of foreign powers; the weakneſs of moſt of the principal members, compared with the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable powers all around them; the vaſt weight and influence which the emperor derives from his ſeparate and hereditary dominions; and the intereſt he feels in preſerving a ſyſtem, with which his family pride is connected, and which conſtitutes him the firſt prince
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:021127_0124_0FB245E86A9F5C98"/>
in Europe; theſe cauſes ſupport a feeble and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious union; whilſt the repellent quality, incident to the nature of ſovereignty, and which time continually ſtrengthens, prevents any reform whatever, founded on a proper conſolidation. Nor is it to be imagined, if this obſtacle could be ſurmounted, that the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring powers would ſuffer a revolution to take place, which would give to the empire the force and pre-eminence to which it is entitled. Foreign nations have long conſidered themſelves as intereſted in the changes made by events in this conſtitution; and have, on various occaſions, betrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>If more direct examples were wanting, Poland as a government over local ſovereigns, might not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be taken notice of. Nor could any proof more ſtriking, be given of the calamities flowing f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>om ſuch inſtitutions. Equally unfit for ſelf government, and ſelf defence, it has long been at the mercy of its powerful neighbours; who have lately had the mercy to diſburden it of one third of its people and territories.</p>
                     <p>The connection among the Swiſs cantons ſcarcely amounts to a confederacy; though it is ſometimes cited as an inſtance of the ſtability of ſuch inſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>They have no common treaſury—no common troops even in war—no common coin—no common judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, nor any other common mark of ſovereignty.</p>
                     <p>They are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical poſition, by their individual weakneſs and inſignificancy; by the fear of powerful neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to one of which they were formerly ſubject; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="unknown:021127_0125_0FB245E9E6CD8478"/>
accommodating diſputes among the cantons. The proviſion is, that the parties at variance ſhall each chuſe four judges out of the neutral cantons who in caſe of diſagreement, chuſe an umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of impartiality, pronounces definitive ſentence; which all the cantons are bound to enforce. The competency of this regulation may be eſtimated, by a clauſe in their treaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus of Savoy; in which he obliges himſelf to interpoſe as mediator in diſputes between the cantoas; and to employ force, if neceſſary, againſt the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious party.</p>
                     <p>So far as the peculiarity of their caſe will admit of compariſon with that of the United States; it ſerves to confirm the principle intended to be eſtabliſhed. Whatever efficacy the union may have had in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes, it appears that the moment a cauſe of difference ſprang up, capable of trying its ſtrength, it failed. The controverſies on the ſubject of religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in three inſtances have kindled violent and bloody conteſts, may be ſaid in fact to have ſevered the league. The Proteſtant and Catholic cantons have ſince had their ſeparate diets; where all the moſt important concerns are adjuſted, and which have left the general diet little other buſineſs than to take care of the common bailages.</p>
                     <p>That ſeparation had another conſequence which merits attention. It produced oppoſite alliances with foreign powers; of Bern as the head of the Proteſtant aſſociation, with the United Provinces; and of Luzerne, as the head of the Catholic aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, with France.</p>

                     <p>THE United Netherlands are a confederacy of republics, or rather of ariſtocracies, of a very remarkable texture; yet confirming all the leſſons derived from thoſe which we have already reviewed.</p>
                     <p>The union is compoſed of ſeven co-equal and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſtates, and each ſtate or province is a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of equal and independent cities. In all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant caſes not only the provinces, but the cities mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t be unanimous.</p>
                     <p>The ſovereignty of the union is repreſented by the ſtates general, conſiſting uſually of about fifty depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appointed by the provinces. They hold their ſeats, ſome for life, ſome for ſix, three and one years. From two provinces they continue in appointment during pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The ſtates general have authority to enter into treaties and alliances—to make war and peace—to raiſe armies and equip fleets—to aſcertain quotas and demand contributions. In all theſe caſes however, unanimity and the ſanction of their conſtituents are requiſite. They have authority to appoint and receive ambaſſadors—to execute treaties and alliances already formed—to provide for the collection of duties on imports and exports—to regulate the mint, with a ſaving to the provincial rights—to govern as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns the dependent territories. The provinces are reſtrained, unleſs with the general conſent, from entering into foreign treaties—from eſtabliſhing impoſts injurious to others, or charging their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with higher duties than their own ſubjects. A council of ſtate, a chamber of accounts, with five colleges of admiralty, aid and fortify the federal adminiſtration.</p>

                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:021127_0127_0FB245FA6C2957F8"/>The executive magiſtrate of the union is the ſtadtholder, who is now a hereditary prince. His principal weight and influence in the republic are derived from his independent title; from his great patrimonial eſtates; from his family connections with ſome of the chief potentates of Europe; and more than all, perhaps, from his being ſtadtholder in the ſeveral provinces, as well as for the union, in which provincial quality, he has the appointment of town magiſtrates under certain regulations, executes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial decrees, preſides when he pleaſes in the provincial tribunals; and has throughout the power of pardon.</p>
                     <p>As ſtadtholder of the union, he has however conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable prerogatives.</p>
                     <p>In his political capacity he has authority to ſettle diſputes between the provinces, when other methods fail—to aſſiſt at the deliberations of the ſtates general, and at their particular conferences—to give audiences to foreign ambaſſadors, and to keep agents for his particular affairs at foreign courts.</p>
                     <p>In his military capacity, he commands the federal troops—provides for garriſons, and in general regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates military affairs—diſpoſes of all appointments from colonels to enſigns, and of the governments and poſts of fortified towns.</p>
                     <p>In his marine capacity, he is admiral general, and ſuperintends and directs every thing relative to naval forces, and other naval affairs—preſides in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities in perſon or by proxy—appoints lieutenant admirals and other officers—and eſtabliſhes councils of war, whoſe ſentences are not executed till he approves them.</p>
                     <p>His revenue, excluſive of his private income, amounts to 300,000 florins. The ſtanding army which he commands conſiſts of about 40,000 men.</p>
                     <p>Such is the nature of the celebrated Belgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Imbecility in the government; diſcord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious exiſtence in peace, and peculiar cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities from war.</p>
                     <p>It was long ago remarked by Grotius, that nothing but the hatred of his countrymen to the houſe of Auſtria, kept them from being ruined by the vices of their conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The union of Utrecht, ſays another reſpectable writer, repoſes an authority in the ſtates general ſeemingly ſufficient to ſecure harmony, but the jealouſy in each provin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> renders the practice very different from the theory.</p>
                     <p>The ſame inſtrument ſays another, obliges each province to levy certain contributions; but this article never could and probably never will be executed; becauſe the inland provinces who have little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce cannot pay an equal quota.</p>
                     <p>In matters of contribution, it is the practice to wave the articles of the conſtitution. The danger of delay obliges the conſenting provinces to furniſh their quotas, without waiting for the others; and then to obtain reimburſement from the others, by depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which are frequent, or otherwiſe as they can. The great wealth and influence of the province of Holland, enable her to effect both theſe purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>It has more than once happened that the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies have been ultimately to be collected at the point of the bayonet; a thing practicable, though dreadful, in a confederacy, where one of the members exceeds in force all the reſt; and where ſeveral of them are too ſmall to meditate reſiſtance: But utterly impracticable in one compoſed of members, ſeveral of which are equal to each other in ſtrength and reſources, and equal ſingly to a vigorous and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering defence.</p>
                     <p>Foreign miniſters, ſays Sir William Temple, who was himſelf a foreign miniſter, elude matters taken <hi>ad referendum,</hi> by tampering with the provinces and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:021127_0129_0FB246066B836B68"/>
cities. In 1726, the treaty of Hanover was delayed by theſe means a whole year. Inſtances of a like nature are numerous and notorious.</p>
                     <p>In critical emergencies, the ſtates general are often compelled to overleap their conſtitutional bounds. In 1688, they concluded a treaty of themſelves at the riſk of their heads. The treaty of Weſtphalia in 1648, by which their independence was formally and finally recognized, was concluded without the conſent of Zeland. Even as recently as the laſt treaty of peace with Great-Britain, the conſtitutional principle of unanimity was departed from. A weak conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt neceſſarily terminate in diſſolution, for want of proper powers, or the uſurpation of powers requiſite for the public ſafety. Whether the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, when once begun, will ſtop at the ſalutary point, or go forward to the dangerous extreme, muſt depend on the contingencies of the moment. Tyranny has perhaps oftener grown out of the aſſumptions of power, called for, on preſſing exigencies, by a defective conſtitution, than out of the full exerciſe of the largeſt conſtitutional authorities.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the calamities produced by the ſtadtholderſhip, it has been ſuppoſed, that without his influence in the individual provinces, the cauſes of anarchy manifeſt in the confederacy, would long ago have diſſolved it.
<q>Under ſuch a government, ſays the abbè Mably, the union could never have ſubſiſted, if the provinces had not a ſpring within themſelves, capable of quickening their tardineſs, and compelling them to the ſame way of thinking. This ſpring is the ſtadtholder.</q>
It is remarked by Sir William Temple,
<q>that in the intermiſſions of the ſtadtholderſhip, Holland by her riches and her authority which drew the others into a ſort of dependence, ſupplied the place.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are not the only circumſtances which have controuled the tendency to anarchy and diſſolution. The ſurrounding powers impoſe an abſolute neceſſity
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:021127_0130_0FB24607F41E4900"/>
of union to a certain degree, at the ſame time, that they nouriſh by their intrigues, the conſtitutional vices, which keep the republic in ſome degree always at their mercy.</p>
                     <p>The true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of theſe vices and have made no leſs than four regular experiments by <hi>extraordinary aſſemblies,</hi> convened for the ſpecial purpoſe, to apply a remedy: As many times, has their laudable zeal found it impoſſible to <hi>unite the public councils</hi> in reforming the known, the acknowledged, the fatal evils of the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtitution. Let us pauſe my fellow citizens, for one moment, over this melancholy and monitory leſſon of hiſtory; and with the tear that drops for the calamities brought on mankind by their adverſe opinions and ſelfiſh paſſions; let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to Heaven, for the propitious concord which has diſtinguiſhed the conſultations for our political happineſs.</p>
                     <p>A deſign was alſo conceived of eſtabliſhing a general tax to be adminiſtered by the federal authority. This alſo had its adverſaries and failed.</p>
                     <p>This unhappy people ſeem to be now ſuffering from popular convulſions, from diſſentions among the ſtates and from the actual invaſion of foreign arms, the criſis of their deſtiny. All nations have their eyes fixed on the awful ſpectacle. The firſt wiſh prompted by humanity is, that this ſevere trial may iſſue in ſuch a revolution of their government, as will eſtabliſh their union, and render it the parent of tranquility, freedom and happineſs: The next, that the aſylum under which, we truſt, the enjoyment of theſe bleſſings, will ſpeedily be ſecured in this country, may receive and conſole them for the cataſtrophe of their own.</p>
                     <p>I make no apology for having dwelt ſo long on the contemplation of theſe federal precedents. Experience is the oracle of truth; and where its reſponſes are unequivocal, they ought to be concluſive and ſacred. The important truth, which it unequivocally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces

                     <p>HAVING in the three laſt numbers taken a ſummary review of the principal circumſtances and events which depict the genius and fate of other confederate governments; I ſhall now proceed in the enumeration of the moſt important of thoſe defects, which have hitherto diſappointed our hopes from the ſyſtem eſtabliſhed among ourſelves. To form a ſafe and ſatisfactory judgment of the proper remedy, it is abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould be well acquainted with the extent and malignity of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The next moſt palpable defect of the exiſting confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is the total want of a SANCTION to its laws. The United States as now compoſed, have no power to exact obedience, or puniſh diſobedience to their reſolutions, either by pecuniary mulcts, by a ſuſpenſion or diveſtiture of privileges, or by any other conſtitutional means. There is no expreſs delegation of authority to them to uſe force againſt delinquent members; and if ſuch a right ſhould be aſcribed to the federal head, as reſulting from the nature of the ſocial compact between the ſtates, it muſt be by infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and conſtruction, in the face of that part of the ſecond article, by which it is declared,
<q>that
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:021127_0132_0FB246152EEE86C0"/>
each ſtate ſhall retain every power, juriſdiction and right, not <hi>expreſsly</hi> delegated to the United States in Congreſs aſſembled.</q>
The want of ſuch a right involves no doubt a ſtriking abſurdity; but we are reduced to the dilemma either of ſuppoſing that defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, prepoſterous as it may ſeem, or of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening or explaining away a proviſion, which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies of thoſe, who oppoſe the new conſtitution; and the omiſſion of which in that plan, has been the ſubject of much plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible animadverſion and ſevere criticiſm. If we are unwilling to impair the force of this applauded provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we ſhall be obliged to conclude, that the United States afford the extraordinary ſpectacle of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſtitute even of the ſhadow of conſtitutional power to enforce the execution of its own laws. It will appear from the ſpecimens which have been cited, that the American confederacy in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſtands diſcriminated from every other inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a ſimilar kind, and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world.</p>
                     <p>The want of a mutual guarantee of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is another capital imperfection in the federal plan. There is nothing of this kind declared in the articles that compoſe it; and to imply a tacit gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee from conſiderations of utility, would be a ſtill more flagrant departure from the clauſe which has been mentioned, than to imply a tacit power of coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the like conſiderations. The want of a guarantee, though it might in its conſequences endanger the union, does not ſo immediately attack its exiſtence as the want of a conſtitutional ſanction to its laws.</p>
                     <p>Without a guarantee, the aſſiſtance to be derived from the union in repelling thoſe domeſtic dangers, which may ſometimes threaten the exiſtence of the ſtate conſtitutions, muſt be renounced. Uſurpation may rear its creſt in each ſtate, and trample upon the liberties of the people; while the national
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:021127_0133_0FB24616E66D0940"/>
government could legally do nothing more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold its encroachments with indignation and regret. A ſucceſsful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law, while no ſuccour could conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be afforded by the union to the friends and ſupporters of the government. The tempeſtuous ſituation, from which Maſſachuſetts has ſcarcely emerged, evinces that dangers of this kind are not merely ſpeculative. Who can determine what might have been the iſſue of her late convulſions, if the mal-contents had been headed by a Ceſar or by a Cromwell? Who can predict what effect a deſpotiſm eſtabliſhed in Maſſachuſetts would have upon the liberties of New-Hampſhire or Rhode-Iſland; of Connecticut or New-York.</p>
                     <p>The inordinate pride of ſtate importance has ſuggeſted to ſome minds an objection to the principle of a guarantee in the federal government; as involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an officious interference in the domeſtic concerns of the members. A ſcruple of this kind would deprive us of one of the principal advantages to be expected from union; and can only flow from a raiſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the nature of the proviſion itſelf. It could be no impediment to reforms of the ſtate conſtitutions by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable mode. This right would remain undiminiſhed. The guarantee could only operate againſt changes to be effected by violence. Towards the prevention of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of this kind too many checks cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. The peace of ſociety, and the ſtability of government, depend abſolutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this head. Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the leſs pretence for the uſe of violent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in partial or occaſional diſtempers of the ſtate. The natural cure for an ill adminiſtration, in a popular or repreſentative conſtitution, is a change of men. A guarantee by the national authority would be as much directed againſt the uſurpations of rulers, as
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:021127_0134_0FB246199E677A50"/>
againſt the ferments and outrages of faction and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the community.</p>
                     <p>The principle of regulating the contributions of the ſtates to the common treaſury by QUOTAS is another fundamental error in the confederation. Its repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to an adequate ſupply of the national exigencies has been already pointed out, and has ſufficiently appeared from the trial which has been made of it. I ſpeak of it now ſolely with a view to equality among the ſtates. Thoſe who have been accuſtomed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the circumſtances, which produce and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute national wealth, muſt be ſatisfied that there is no common ſtandard, or barometer, by which the degrees of it can be aſcertained. Neither the value of lands nor the numbers of the people, which have been ſucceſſively propoſed as the rule of ſtate contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, has any pretenſion to being a juſt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. If we compare the wealth of the United Netherlands with that of Ruſſia or Germany or even of France; and if we at the ſame time compare the total value of the lands, and the aggregate popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contracted territory of that republic, with the total value of the lands, and the aggregate popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the immenſe regions of either of thoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, we ſhall at once diſcover that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the proportion of either of theſe two objects and that of the relative wealth of thoſe nations. If the like parallel were to be run between ſeveral of the American ſtates; it would furniſh a like reſult. Let Virginia be contraſted with North-Carolina, Pennſylvania with Connecticut, or Maryland with New-Jerſey, and we ſhall be convinced that the reſpective abilities of thoſe ſtates, in relation to revenue, bear little or no analogy to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritive ſtock in lands or to their comparitive popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.—The poſition may be equally illuſtrated by a ſimilar proceſs between the counties of the ſame ſtate. No man acquainted with the ſtate of New-York will doubt, that the active wealth of Kings county bears
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:021127_0135_0FB24622B8FBB908"/>
a much greater proportion to that of Montgomery, than it would appear to do, if we ſhould take either the total value of the lands or the total numbers of the people as a criterion!</p>
                     <p>The wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of cauſes. Situation, ſoil, climate, the nature of the productions, the nature of the government, the genius of the citizens—the degree of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they poſſeſs—the ſtate of commerce, of arts, of induſtry—theſe circumſtances and many more too complex, minute, or adventitious, to admit of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpecification, occaſion differences hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable in the relative opulence and riches of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent countries. The conſequence clearly is, that there can be no common meaſure of national wealth; and of courſe, no general or ſtationary rule, by which the ability of a ſtate to pay taxes can be determined. The attempt therefore to regulate the contributions of the members of a confederacy, by any ſuch rule, connot fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>This inequality would of itſelf be ſufficient in America to work the eventual deſtruction of the union, if any mode of inforcing a compliance with its requiſitions could be deviſed. The ſuffering ſtates would not long conſent to remain aſſociated upon a principle which diſtributed the public burthens with ſo unequal a hand; and which was calculated to impoveriſh and oppreſs the citizens of ſome ſtates, while thoſe of others would ſcarcely be conſcious of the ſmall proportion of the weight they were required to ſuſtain. This however is an evil inſeparable from the principle of quotas and requiſitions.</p>
                     <p>There is no method of ſteering clear of this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience but by authoriſing the national government to raiſe its own revenues in its own way. Impoſts, exciſes and in general all duties upon articles of conſumption may be compared to a fluid, which will in time find its level with the means of paying them.
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:021127_0136_0FB24623B6357CB8"/>
The amount to be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own option, and can be regulated by an attention to his reſources. The rich may be extravagant, the poor can be frugal. And private oppreſſion, may always be avoided by a judicious ſelection of objects proper for ſuch impoſitions. If inequalities ſhould ariſe in ſome ſtates from duties on particular objects, theſe will in all probability be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in other ſtates from the duties on other objects. In the courſe of time and things, an equilibrium, as far as it is attainable, in ſo complicated a ſubject, will be eſtabliſhed every where. Or if inequalities ſhould ſtill exiſt they would neither be ſo great in their degree, ſo uniform in their operation, nor ſo odious in their appearance, as thoſe which would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſpring from quotas upon any ſcale, that can poſſibly be deviſed.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſignal advantage of taxes on articles of conſumption, that they contain in their own nature a ſecurity againſt exceſs. They preſcribe their own limit; which cannot be exceeded without defeating the end propoſed—that is an extenſion of the revenue. When applied to this object, the ſaying is as juſt as it is witty, that
<q>in political arithmetic, two and two do not always make four.</q>
If duties are too high they leſſen the conſumption—the collection is eluded; and the product to the treaſury is not ſo great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds. This forms a compleat barrier againſt any material oppreſſion of the citizens, by taxes of this claſs, and is itſelf a natural limitation of the power of impoſing them.</p>
                     <p>Impoſitions of this kind uſually fall under the denomination of indirect taxes, and muſt for a long time conſtitute the chief part of the revenue raiſed in this country. Thoſe of the direct kind, which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally relate to lands and buildings, may admit of a rule of apportionment. Either the value of land,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:021127_0137_0FB2462F03FBFD30"/>
or the number of the people may ſerve as a ſtandard. The ſtate of agriculture, and the populouſneſs of a country, are conſidered as having a near relation to each other. And as a rule for the purpoſe intended, numbers in the view of ſimplicity and certainty, are entitled to a preference. In every country it is an Herculean taſk to obtain a valuation of the land; in a country imperfectly ſettled and progreſſive in improvement, the difficulties are increaſed almoſt to impracticability. The expence of an accurate valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is in all ſituations a formidable objection. In a branch of taxation where no limits to the diſcretion of the government are to be found in the nature of the thing, the eſtabliſhment of a fixed rule, not incompatible with the end, may be attended with fewer inconveniencies than to leave that diſcretion altogether at large.</p>

                     <p>IN addition to the defects already enumerated in the exiſting federal ſyſtem, there are others of not leſs importance, which concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the adminiſtration of the affairs of the union.</p>
                     <p>The want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to be of the number. The utility of ſuch a power has been anticipated under the firſt head of our enquiries; and for this reaſon as well as from the univerſal conviction entertained upon the ſubject, little need be added in this place. It is indeed evident, on the moſt ſuperficial view, that there is no object, either as it reſpects the intereſts of trade or finance that more ſtrongly demands a
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:021127_0138_0FB2463065768F98"/>
federal ſuperintendence. The want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers; and has given occaſions of diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction between the ſtates. No nation acquainted with the nature of our political aſſociation would be unwiſe enough to enter into ſtipulations with the United States, conceding on their part privileges of importance, while they were appriſed that the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the part of the union, might at any moment be violated by its members; and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they deſired in our markets, without granting us any return, but ſuch as their momentary conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience might ſuggeſt. It is not therefore to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, that Mr. Jenkinſon in uſhering into the houſe of commons a bill for regulating the temporary intercourſe between the two countries, ſhould preface its introduction by a declaration that ſimilar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in former bills had been found to anſwer every purpoſe to the commerce of Great Britain, and that it would be prudent to perſiſt in the plan until it ſhould appear whether the American government was likely or not to acquire greater conſiſtency<note n="*" place="bottom">This, as nearly as I can recollect, was the ſenſe of this ſpeech in introducing the laſt bill.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Several ſtates have endeavoured by ſeparate prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, reſtrictions and excluſions, to influence the conduct of that kingdom in this particular; but the want of concert, ariſing from the want of a general authority, and from claſhing and diſſimilar views in the ſtates, has hitherto fruſtrated every experiment of the kind; and will continue to do ſo as long as the ſame obſtacles to an uniformity of meaſures continue to exiſt.</p>
                     <p>The interfering and unneighbourly regulations of ſome ſtates, contrary to the true ſpirit of the union, have in different inſtances given juſt cauſe of umbrage and complaint to others; and it is to be feared that
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:021127_0139_0FB24631E566FF38"/>
examples of this nature, if not reſtrained by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional controul, would be multiplied and extended till they became not leſs ſerious ſources of animoſity and diſcord, than injurious impediments to the intercourſe between the different parts of the confederacy.
<q>The commerce of the German empire<note n="*" place="bottom">Encyclopedie, article Empire.</note>, is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the ſeveral princes and ſtates exact upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes paſſing through their territories; by means of which the fine ſtreams and navigable rivers with which Germany is ſo happily watered, are rendered almoſt uſeleſs.</q>
Though the genius of the people of this country might never permit this deſcription to be ſtrictly applicable to us, yet we may reaſonably expect, from the gradual conflicts of ſtate regulations, that the citizens of each, would at length come to be conſidered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens.</p>
                     <p>The power of raiſing armies, by the moſt obvious conſtruction of the articles of the confederation, is merely a power of making requiſitions upon the ſtates for quotas of men. This practice, in the courſe of the late war, was found replete with obſtructions to a vigorous and to an economical ſyſtem of defence. It gave birth to a competition between the ſtates, which created a kind of auction for men. In order to furniſh the quotas required of them, they outbid each other, till bounties grew to an enormous and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable ſize. The hope of a ſtill further increaſe afforded an inducement to thoſe who were diſpoſed to ſerve to procraſtinate their inliſtment; and diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to engaging for any conſiderable periods. Hence ſlow and ſcanty levies of men in the moſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical emergencies of our affairs—ſhort inliſtments at an unparalleled expence—continual fluctuations in the troops, ruinous to their diſcipline, and ſubjecting the public ſafety frequently to the perilous criſis of a diſbanded army.—Hence alſo thoſe oppreſſive expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:021127_0140_0FB2463B45E287E0"/>
for raiſing men which were upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions practiſed, and which nothing but the enthuſiaſm of liberty would have induced the people to endure.</p>
                     <p>This method of raiſing troops is not more unfriendly to economy and vigor, than it is to an equal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the burthen. The ſtates near the ſeat of war, influenced by motives of ſelf preſervation made efforts to furniſh their quotas, which even exceeded their abilities, while thoſe at a diſtance from danger were for the moſt part as remiſs as the others were diligent in their exertions. The immediate preſſure of this inequality was not in this caſe, as in that of the contributions of money, alleviated by the hope of a final liquidation. The ſtates which did not pay their proportions of money, might at leaſt be charged with their deficiencies; but no account could be formed of the deficiencies in the ſupplies of men. We ſhall not, however, ſee much reaſon to regret the want of this hope, when we conſider how little proſpect there is, that the moſt delinquent ſtates ever will be able to make compenſation for their pecuniary failures. The ſyſtem of quotas and requiſitions, whether it be applied to men or money, is in every view a ſyſtem of imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the union, and of inequality and injuſtice among the members.</p>
                     <p>The right of equal ſuffrage among the ſtates is another exceptionable part of the confederation. Every idea of proportion, and every rule of fair repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation conſpire to condemn a principle, which gives to Rhode-Iſland an equal weight in the ſcale of power with Maſſachuſetts, or Connecticut, or New-York; and to Delaware, an equal voice in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal deliberations with Pennſylvania or Virginia, or North-Carolina. Its operation contradicts that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maxim of republican government, which requires that the ſenſe of the majority ſhould prevail. Sophiſtry may reply, that ſovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the ſtates will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:021127_0141_0FB2463E00B5FDD8"/>
logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain ſuggeſtions of juſtice and common ſenſe. It may happen that this majority of ſtates is a ſmall minority of the people of America<note n="*" place="bottom">New-Hampſhire, Rhode-Iſland, New-Jerſey, Delaware, Georgia, South-Carolina and Maryland, are a majority of the whole number of the States, but they do not contain one third of the people.</note>; and two thirds of the people of America, could not long be perſuaded, upon the credit of artificial diſtinctions and ſyllogiſtic ſubtleties, to ſubmit their intereſts to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſpoſal of one third. The larger ſtates would after a while revolt from the idea of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law from the ſmaller. To acquieſce in ſuch a privation of their due importance in the political ſcale, would be not merely to be inſenſible to the love of power, but even to ſacrifice the deſire of equality. It is neither rational to expect the firſt, nor juſt to require the laſt—the ſmaller ſtates conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how peculiarly their ſafety and welfare depend on union, ought readily to renounce a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion; which, if not relinquiſhed would prove fatal to its duration.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected to this, that not ſeven but nine ſtates, or two thirds of the whole number muſt conſent to the moſt important reſolutions; and it may be thence infered, that nine ſtates would always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a majority of the inhabitants of the union. But this does not obviate the impropriety of an equal vote between ſtates of the moſt unequal dimenſions and populouſneſs; nor is the inference accurate in point of fact; for we can enumerate nine ſtates which contain leſs than a majority of the people<note n="†" place="bottom">Add New-York and Connecticut to the foregoing ſeven; and they will ſtill be leſs than a majority.</note>; and it is conſtitutionally poſſible, that theſe nine may give the vote. Beſides there are matters of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable moment determinable by a bare majority; and there are others, concerning which doubts have been entertained, which if interpreted in favor of the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:021127_0142_0FB2463F832319C0"/>
ſufficiency of a vote of ſeven ſtates, would extend its operation to intereſts of the firſt magnitude. In addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this, it is to be obſerved, that there is a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of an increaſe in the number of ſtates, and no proviſion for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all; what at firſt ſight may ſeem a remedy, is in reality a poiſon. To give a minority a negative upon the majority (which is always the caſe where more than a majority is requiſite to a deciſion) is in its tendency to ſubject the ſenſe of the greater number to that of the leſſer number. Congreſs from the non attendance of a few ſtates have been frequently in the ſituation of a Poliſh diet, where a ſingle VETO has been ſufficient to put a ſtop to all their movements. A ſixtieth part of the union, which is about the proportion of Delaware and Rhode-Iſland, has ſeveral times been able to oppoſe an entire bar to its operations. This is one of thoſe refinements which in practice has an effect, the reverſe of what is expected from it in theory. The neceſſity of unanimity in public bodies, or of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing approaching towards it, has been founded upon a ſuppoſition that it would contribute to ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But its real operation is to embarraſs the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, to deſtroy the energy of government, and to ſubſtitute the pleaſure, caprice or artifices of an inſignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and deciſions of a reſpectable majority. In thoſe emergencies of a nation, in which the goodneſs or badneſs, the weakneſs or ſtrength of its government, is of the greateſt importance, there is commonly a neceſſity for action. The public buſineſs muſt in ſome way or other go forward. If a pertinacious minority can controul the opinion of a majority reſpecting the beſt mode of conducting it; the majority, in order that ſomething may be done, muſt conform to the views of the minority; and thus the ſenſe of the ſmaller number will over rule that of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:021127_0143_0FB2464825F1DE00"/>
the greater and give a tone to the national proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Hence tedious delays—continual negotiation and intrigue—contemptible compromiſes of the public good. And yet in ſuch a ſyſtem, it is even happy when ſuch compromiſes can take place: For upon ſome occaſions, things will not admit of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and then the meaſures of government muſt be injuriouſly ſuſpended or fatally defeated. It is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the neceſſary number of votes, kept in a ſtate of inaction. Its ſituation muſt always favour of weakneſs—ſometimes border upon anarchy.</p>
                     <p>It is not difficult to diſcover that a principle of this kind gives greater ſcope to foreign corruption as well as to domeſtic faction, than that which permits the ſenſe of the majority to decide; though the contrary of this has been preſumed. The miſtake has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from not attending with due care to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that may be occaſioned by obſtructing the progreſs of government at certain critical ſeaſons. When the concurrence of a large number is required by the conſtitution to the doing of any national act, we are apt to reſt ſatisfied that all is ſafe, becauſe nothing improper will be likely <hi>to be done</hi>; but we forget how much good may be prevented, and how much ill may be produced, by the power of hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is neceſſary from being done, and of keeping affairs in the ſame unfavourable poſture in which they may happen to ſtand at particular periods.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe for inſtance we were engaged in a war, in conjunction with one foreign nation againſt another. Suppoſe the neceſſity of our ſituation demanded peace, and the intereſt or ambition of our ally led him to ſeek the proſecution of the war, with views that might juſtify us in making ſeparate terms. In ſuch a ſtate of things this ally of ours would evidently find it much eaſier by his bribes and his intrigues to tie up the hands of government from making peace, where two thirds of all the votes were requiſite to
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:021127_0144_0FB2464C2ACB2F58"/>
that object, than where a ſimple majority would ſuffice. In the firſt caſe he would have to corrupt a ſmaller number; in the laſt a greater number. Upon the ſame principle it would be much eaſier for a foreign power with which we were at war, to perplex our councils and embarraſs our exertions. And in a commercial view we may be ſubjected to ſimilar inconveniencies. A nation with which we might have a treaty of commerce, could with much greater facility prevent our forming a connection with her competitor in trade; though ſuch a connection ſhould be ever ſo beneficial to ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>Evils of this diſcription ought not to be regarded as imaginary. One of the weak ſides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is, that they afford too eaſy an inlet to foreign corruption. An heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary monarch, though often diſpoſed to ſacrifice his ſubjects to his ambition, has ſo great a perſonal intereſt in the government, and in the external glory of the nation, that it is not eaſy for a foreign power to give him an equivalent for what he would ſacrifice by treachery to the ſtate. The world has accordingly been witneſs to few examples of this ſpecies of royal proſtitution, though there have been abundant ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of every other kind.</p>
                     <p>In republics, perſons elevated from the maſs of the community, by the ſuffrages of their fellow citizens, to ſtations of great pre-eminence and power, may find compenſations for betraying their truſt, which to any but minds actuated by ſuperior virtue may appear to exceed the proportion of intereſt they have in the common ſtock, and to over-balance the obligations of duty. Hence it is that hiſtory furniſhes us with ſo many mortifying examples of the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments. How much this contributed to the ruin of the ancient commonwealths has been already diſcloſed. It is well known that the deputies of the United Provinces have, in various inſtances been purchaſed by the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:021127_0145_0FB24654F01710D0"/>

And in Sweden, the parties were alternately bought by France and England, in ſo barefaced and notorious a manner that it excited univerſal diſguſt in the nation; and was a principal cauſe that the moſt limited monarch in Europe, in a ſingle day, without tumult, violence, or oppoſition, became one of the moſt abſolute and uncontrouled.</p>
                     <p>A circumſtance, which crowns the defects of the confederation, remains yet to be mentioned—the want of a judiciary power. Laws are a dead letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation. The treaties of the United States, to have any force at all, muſt be conſidered as part of the law of the land. Their true import, as far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To produce uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in theſe determinations, they ought to be ſubmitted in the laſt reſort, to one SUPREME TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUNAL. And this tribunal ought to be inſtituted under the ſame authority which forms the treaties themſelves. Theſe ingredients are both indiſpenſible. If there is in each ſtate a court of final juriſdiction, there may be as many different final determinations on the ſame point, as there are courts. There are endleſs diverſities in the opinions of men. We often ſee not only different courts, but the judges of the ſame court differing from each other. To avoid the confuſion which would unavoidably reſult from the contradictory deciſions of a number of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent judicatories, all nations have found it neceſſary to eſtabliſh one court paramount to the reſt, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a general ſuperintendance, and authoriſed to ſettle and declare in the laſt reſort an uniform rule of civil juſtice.</p>

In this caſe, if the particular tribunals are inveſted with a right of ultimate juriſdiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the contradictions to be expected from difference of opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices, and from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of local regulations. As often as ſuch an interference was to happen, there would be reaſon to apprehend, that the proviſions of the particular laws might be preferred to thoſe of the general laws; from the deference with which men in office naturally look up to that authority to which they owe their official exiſtence. The treaties of the United States, under the preſent conſtitution, are liable to the infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thirteen different legiſlatures, and as many different courts of final juriſdiction, acting under the authority of thoſe legiſlatures. The faith, the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the peace of the whole union, are thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at the mercy of the prejudices, the paſſions, and the intereſts of every member of which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Is it poſſible that foreign nations can either reſpect or confide in ſuch a government? Is it poſſible that the people of America will longer conſent to truſt their honor, their happineſs, their ſafety, on ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious a foundation?</p>
                     <p>In this review of the confederation, I have confined myſelf to the exhibition of its moſt material defects; paſſing over thoſe imperfections in its details, by which even a conſiderable part of the power intended to be conferred upon it, has been in a great meaſure rendered abortive. It muſt be by this time evident to all men of reflection, who are either free from erronious prepoſſeſſions or can diveſt themſelves of them, that it is a ſyſtem ſo radically vicious and unſound, as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its leading features and characters.</p>

A ſingle aſſembly may be a proper receptacle of thoſe ſlender, or rather fettered authorities, which have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore delegated to the federal head; but it would be inconſiſtent with all the principles of good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to intruſt it with thoſe additional powers which even the moderate and more rational adverſaries of the propoſed conſtitution admit, ought to reſide in the United States. If that plan ſhould not be adopted; and if the neceſſity of union ſhould be able to withſtand the ambitious aims of thoſe men, who may indulge magnificent ſchemes of perſonal aggrandizement from its deſſolution; the probability would be, that we ſhould run into the project of confering ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary powers upon congreſs as they are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. And either the machine, from the intrinſic feebleneſs of its ſtructure, will moulder into pieces in ſpite of our ill-judged efforts to prop it; or by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive augmentations of its force and energy, as neceſſity might prompt, we ſhall finally accumulate in a ſingle body, all the moſt important prerogatives of ſovereignty; and thus entail upon our poſterity, one of the moſt execrable forms of government that human infatuation ever contrived.

                     <p>It has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the exiſting federal ſyſtem, that it never had a ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the PEOPLE. Reſting on no better foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than the conſent of the ſeveral legiſlatures, it has been expoſed to frequent and intricate queſtions concerning the validity of its powers; and has in ſome inſtances given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of legiſlative repeal. Owing its ratification to the law of a ſtate, it has been contended, that the ſame authority might repeal the law by which it was
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:021127_0148_0FB246632C914188"/>
ratified. However groſs a hereſy it may be to maintain that a <hi>party</hi> to a <hi>compact</hi> has a right to revoke that <hi>compact,</hi> the doctrine itſelf has had reſpectable advocates. The poſſibility of a queſtion of this nature, proves the neceſſity of laying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the mere ſanction of delegated authority.

                     <p>THE neceſſity of a conſtitution, at leaſt equally energetic with the one propoſed, to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the union, is the point, at the examination of which we are now arrived.</p>
                     <p>This inquiry will naturally divide itſelf into three branches—the objects to be provided for by a federal government—the quantity of power neceſſary to the accompliſhment of thoſe objects—the perſons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its diſtribution and organiſation will more properly claim our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the ſucceeding head.</p>
                     <p>The principal purpoſes to be anſwered by union are theſe—the common defence of the members—the preſervation of the public peace as well againſt internal convulſions as external attacks—the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the ſtates—the ſuperintendence of our intercourſe poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and commercial with foreign countries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="144" facs="unknown:021127_0149_0FB24666D0B67528"/>The authorities eſſential to the care of the common defence are theſe—to raiſe armies—to build and equip fleets—to preſcribe rules for the government of both —to direct their operations—to provide for their ſupport. Theſe powers ought to exiſt without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Becauſe it is impoſſible to foreſee or to define the extent and variety of national exigencies, and the correſpondent extent and variety of the means which may be neceſſary to ſatisfy them. The circumſtances that endanger the ſafety of nations are infinite; and for this reaſon, no conſtitutional ſhackles can wiſely be impoſed on the power to which the care of it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. This power ought to be coextenſive with all the poſſible combinations of ſuch circumſtances; and ought to be under the direction of the ſame councils, which are appointed to preſide over the common defence.</p>
                     <p>This is one of thoſe truths which to a correct and unprejudiced mind carries its own evidence along with it; and may be obſcured, but cannot be made plainer by argument or reaſoning. It reſts upon axioms as ſimple as they are univerſal—the <hi>means</hi> ought to be proportioned to the <hi>end</hi>;—the perſons from whoſe agency the attainment of any <hi>end</hi> is expected, ought to poſſeſs the <hi>means</hi> by which it is to be attained.</p>
                     <p>Whether there ought to be a federal government intruſted with the care of the common defence is a queſtion, in the firſt inſtance, open to diſcuſſion; but the moment it is decided in the affirmative, it will follow, that that government ought to be cloathed with all the powers requiſite to the complete exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of its truſt. And unleſs it can be ſhewn, that the circumſtances which may affect the public ſafety are reducible within certain determinate limits; unleſs the contrary of this poſition can be fairly and rationally diſputed, it muſt be admitted as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority, which is to provide for the defence
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:021127_0150_0FB2466BACBA16A8"/>
and protection of the community, in any matter eſſential to its efficacy; that is in any matter eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the <hi>formation, direction</hi> or <hi>ſupport</hi> of the NATIONAL FORCES.</p>
                     <p>Defective as the preſent confederation has been proved to be, this principle appears to have been fully recogniſed by the framers of it; though they have not made proper or adequate proviſion for its exerciſe. Congreſs have an unlimited diſcretion to make requiſitions of men and money—to govern the army and navy—to direct their operations. As their requiſitions are made conſtitutionally binding upon the ſtates, who are in fact under the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t ſolemn obligations to furniſh the ſupplies required of them, the intention evidently was, that the United States ſhould command whatever reſources were by them judged requiſite to the
<q>common defence and general welfare.</q>
It was preſumed that a ſenſe of their true intereſts and a regard to the dictates of good faith would be found ſufficient pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the federal head.</p>
                     <p>The experiment has however demonſtrated, that this expectation was ill founded and illuſory; and the obſervations made under the laſt head will, I imagine, have ſufficed to convince the impartial and diſcerning, that there is an abſolute neceſſity for an entire change in the firſt principles of the ſyſtem: That if we are in earneſt about giving the union energy and duration, we muſt abandon the vain project of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlating upon the ſtates in their collective capacities; we muſt extend the laws of the federal government to the individual citizens of America; we muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card the fallacious ſcheme of quotas and requiſitions, as equally impracticable and unjuſt. The reſult from all this is, that the union ought to be inveſted with full power to levy troops—to build and equip fleets and to raiſe the revenues which will be required for the formation and ſupport of an army and navy,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:021127_0151_0FB2467760B02A00"/>
in the cuſtomary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments.</p>
                     <p>If the circumſtances of our country are ſuch, as to demand a compound inſtead of a ſimple, a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate inſtead of a ſole government, the eſſential point which will remain to be adjuſted, will be to diſcriminate the OBJECTS, as far as it can be done, which ſhall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power; allowing to each the moſt ample authority for fulfilling THOSE which may be committed to its charge. Shall the union be conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the guardian of the common ſafety? Are fleets and armies and revenues neceſſary to this purpoſe? The government of the union muſt be impowered to paſs all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them. The ſame muſt be the caſe, in reſpect to commerce, and to every other matter to which its juriſdiction is permitted to extend. Is the adminiſtration of juſtice between the citizens of the ſame ſtate, the proper department of the local governments? Theſe muſt poſſeſs all the authorities which are connected with this object, and with every other that may be allotted to their particular cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance and direction. Not to confer in each caſe a degree of power, commenſurate to the end, would be to violate the moſt obvious rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to truſt the great intereſts of the nation to hands, which are diſabled from managing them with vigour and ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Who ſo likely to make ſuitable proviſions for the public defence, as that body to which the guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the public ſafety is confided—which, as the centre of information, will beſt underſtand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten—as the repreſentative of the WHOLE will feel itſelf moſt deeply intereſted in the preſervation of every part— which, from the reſponſibility implied in the duty aſſigned to it, will be moſt ſenſibly impreſſed with the neceſſity of proper exertions—and which, by the

extenſion of its authority throughout the ſtates can alone eſtabliſh uniformity and concert in the plans and meaſures, by which the common ſafety is to be ſecured? Is there not a manifeſt inconſiſtency in devolving upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It will indeed deſerve the moſt vigilant and careful attention of the people to ſee, that it be modelled in ſuch a manner as to admit of its being ſafely veſted with the requiſite powers. If any plan, which has been, or may be offered to our conſideration ſhould not upon a diſpaſſionate inſpection be found to anſwer this deſcription, it ought to be rejected. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the conſtitution of which renders it unfit to be truſted with all the powers which a free people <hi>ought to delegate to any government,</hi> would be an unſafe and improper depoſitory of the NATIONAL INTERESTS. Wherever THESE can with propriety be confided, the coincident powers may ſafely ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ompany them. This is the true reſult of all juſt reaſoning upon the ſubject. And the adverſaries of the plan, promulgated by the convention, would have given a better impreſſion of their candour, if they had confined themſelves to ſhowing that the internal ſtructure of the propoſed government, was ſuch as to render it unworthy of
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:021127_0153_0FB2467C2F062988"/>
the confidence of the people. They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The POWERS are not too extenſive for the OBJECTS of federal adminiſtration, or in other words for the management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS; nor can any ſatisfactory argument be framed to ſhow that they are chargeable with ſuch an exceſs. If it be true, as has been inſinuated by ſome of the writers on the other ſide, that the difficulty ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſes from the nature of the thing, and that the extent of the country will not permit us to form a government, in which ſuch ample powers can ſafely be repoſed, it would prove that we ought to contract our views and reſort to the expedient of ſeparate confederacies, which will move within more practicable ſpheres. For the abſurdity muſt continually ſtare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the moſt eſſential national intereſts, without daring to truſt it with the authorities which are indiſpenſable to their proper and efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative.</p>
                     <p>I truſt, however, that the impracticability of one general ſyſtem cannot be ſhewn. I am greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken if any thing of weight has yet been advanced of this tendency; and I flatter myſelf, that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which have been made in the courſe of theſe papers, have ſerved to place the reverſe of that poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in as clear a light as any matter ſtill in the womb of time and experience can be ſuſceptible of. This at all events muſt be evident, that the very difficulty itſelf, drawn from the extent of the country is the ſtrongeſt argument in favor of an energetic government; for any other can certainly never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the union of ſo large an empire. If we embrace the tenets of thoſe, who oppoſe the adoption of the propoſed conſtitution, as the ſtandard of our poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical creed, we cannot fail to verify the gloomy
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:021127_0154_0FB2467F2E70DAE0"/>
doctrines, which predict the impracticability of a national ſyſtem, pervading the entire limits of the preſent confederacy.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XXIV. The Subject continued, with an Anſwer to an Objection concerning ſtanding Armies.</head>
                     <p>TO the powers propoſed to be conferred upon the federal government in reſpect to the creation and direction of the national forces—I have met with but one ſpecific objection; which if I underſtand it right is this—that proper proviſion has not been made againſt the exiſtence of ſtanding armies in time of peace: An objection which I ſhall now endeavour to ſhew, reſts on weak and unſubſtantial foundations.</p>
                     <p>It has indeed been brought forward in the moſt vague and general form, ſupported only by bold aſſertions, without the appearance of argument— without even the ſanction of theoretical opinions, in contradiction to the practice of other free nations, and to the general ſenſe of America, as expreſſed in moſt of the exiſting conſtitutions. The propriety of this remark will appear the moment it is recollected that the objection under conſideration turns upon a ſuppoſed neceſſity of reſtraining the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation, in the article of military eſtabliſhments; a principle unheard of except in one or two of our ſtate conſtitutions, and rejected in all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>A ſtranger to our politics who was to read our newſpapers at the preſent juncture, without having previouſly inſpected the plan reported by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, would be naturally led to one of two conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—either that it contained a poſitive injunction,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:021127_0155_0FB24680AE33A6E8"/>
that ſtanding armies ſhould be kept up in time of peace, or that it veſted in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of levying troops, without ſubjecting his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any ſhape to the controul of the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>If he came afterwards to peruſe the plan itſelf, he would be ſurpriſed to diſcover that neither the one nor the other was the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e—that the whole power of raiſing armies was lodged in the <hi>legiſlature,</hi> not in the <hi>executive</hi>; that this legiſlature was to be a popular body conſiſting of the repreſentatives of the people periodically elected—and that inſtead of the proviſion he had ſuppoſed in favor of ſtanding armies, there was to be found in reſpect to this object, an important qualification even of the legiſlative diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in that clauſe which forbids the appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of money for the ſupport of an army for any longer period than two years: A precaution which, upon a nearer view of it, will appear to be a great and real ſecurity againſt military eſtabliſhments without evident neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Diſappointed in his firſt ſurmiſe, the perſon I have ſuppoſed would be apt to purſue his conjectures a little further. He would naturally ſay to himſelf, it is impoſſible that all this vehement and pathetic decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation can be without ſome colorable pretext. It muſt needs be that this people, ſo jealous of their liberties, have in all the preceding models of the conſtitutions which they have eſtabliſhed, inſerted the moſt preciſe and rigid precautions on this point, the omiſſion of which in the new plan has given b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>h to all this apprehenſion and clamour.</p>
                     <p>If under this impreſſion he proceeded to paſs in review the ſeveral ſtate conſtitutions, how great would be his diſappointment to find that <hi>two only</hi> of them<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſtatement of the matter is taken from the printed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of ſtate conſtitutions. Pennſylvania and North-Carolina, are the two which contain the interdiction in theſe words—
<q>As ſtanding a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is in truth rather a CAUTION than a PROHIBITION. New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts, Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and Maryland, have in each of their bills of rights a clauſe to this effect—
<q>Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raiſed or kept up WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE;</q>
which is a formal admiſſion of the authority of the legiſlature. New-York has no bill of her rights, and her conſtitution ſays not a word about the matter. No bills of rights appear annexed to the conſtitutions of the other ſtates except the foregoing, and their conſtitutions are equally ſilent. I am told, however, that one or two ſtates have bills of rights, which do not appear in this collection; but that thoſe alſo recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the right of the legiſlative authority in this reſpect.</note> contained an interdiction of ſtanding armies

in time of peace; that the other eleven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had either obſerved a profound ſilence on the ſubject, or had in expreſs terms admitted the right of the legiſlature to authoriſe their exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Still however he would be perſuaded that there muſt be ſome plauſible foundation for the cry raiſed on this head. He would never be able to imagine, while any ſource of information remained unexplored, that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous. It would probably occur to him that he would be likely to find the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions he was in ſearch of in the primitive compact between the ſtates. Here at length he would expect to meet with a ſolution of the enigma. No doubt he would obſerve to himſelf the exiſting confederation muſt contain the moſt explicit proviſions againſt military eſtabliſhments in time of peace; and a departure from this model in a favorite point has occaſioned the diſcontent which appears to influence theſe political champions.</p>
                     <p>If he ſhould now apply himſelf to a careful and critical ſurvey of the articles of confederation, his aſtoniſhment would not only be increaſed but would acquire a mixture of indignation at the unexpected diſcovery that theſe articles inſtead of containing the prohibition he looked for, and though they had with jealous circumſpection reſtricted the authority of the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:021127_0157_0FB2468B28004F88"/>
ſtate legiſlatures in this particular, had not impoſed a ſingle reſtraint on that of the United States. If he happened to be a man of quick ſenſibility or ardent temper, he could now no longer refrain from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing theſe clamours to be the diſhoneſt artifices of a ſiniſter and unprincipled oppoſition to a plan which ought at leaſt to receive a fair and candid examination from all ſincere lovers of their country! How elſe, he would ſay, could the authors of them have been tempted to vent ſuch loud cenſures upon that plan, about a point in which it ſeems to have conformed itſelf to the general ſenſe of America as declared in its different forms of government, and in which it has even ſuperadded a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them? If on the contrary he happened to be a man of calm and diſpaſſionate feelings—he would indulge a ſigh for the frailty of human nature, and would lament that in a matter ſo intereſting to the happineſs of milions the true merits of the queſtion ſhould be perplexed and obſcured by expedients ſo unfriendly to an impartial and right determination. Even ſuch a man could hardly forbear remarking that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to miſlead the people by alarming their paſſions rather than to convince them by arguments addreſſed to their underſtandings.</p>
                     <p>But however little this objection may be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced even by precedents among ourſelves, it may be ſatisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrinſic merits. From a cloſe examination it will appear, that reſtraints upon the diſcretion of the legiſlature in reſpect to military eſtabliſhments would be improper to be impoſed, and if impoſed, from the neceſſities of ſociety, would be unlikely to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Though a wide ocean ſeparates the United States from Europe; yet there are various conſiderations that warn us againſt an exceſs of confidence or ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. On one ſide of us and ſtretching far into our rear are growing ſettlements ſubject to the dominion
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:021127_0158_0FB2469C437E8030"/>
of Britain. On the other ſide and extending to meet the Britiſh ſettlements are colonies and eſtabliſhments ſubject to the dominion of Spain. This ſituation and the vicinity of the Weſt-India iſlands belonging to theſe two powers create between them, in reſpect to their American poſſeſſions, and in relation to us a common intereſt. The ſavage tribes on our Weſtern frontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies their natural allies; becauſe they have moſt to fear from us and moſt to hope from them. The improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the art of navigation have, as to the facility of communication, rendered diſtant nations in a great meaſure neighbours. Britain and Spain are among the principal maritime powers of Europe. A future concert of views between theſe nations ought not to be regarded as improbable. The increaſing remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conſanguinity is every day diminiſhing the force of the family compact between France and Spain. And politicians have ever with great reaſon conſidered the ties of blood as feeble and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious links of political connection. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances combined admoniſh us not to be too ſanguine in conſidering ourſelves as intirely out of the reach of danger.</p>
                     <p>Previous to the revolution, and ever ſince the peace, there has been a conſtant neceſſity for keeping ſmall garriſons on our Weſtern frontier. No perſon can doubt that theſe will continue to be indiſpenſable, if it ſhould only be againſt the ravages and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Indians. Theſe garriſons muſt either be furniſhed, by occaſional detachments from the militia, or by permanent corps in the pay of the government. The firſt is impracticable; and if practicable, would be pernicious. The militia would not long, if at all, ſubmit to be dragged from their occupations and families to perform that moſt diſagreeable duty in times of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon, or compelled to do it, the increaſed expence of a frequent rotation of
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:021127_0159_0FB2469D2A7AD120"/>
ſervice, and the loſs of labour and diſconcertion of the induſtrious purſuits of individuals, would form concluſive objections to the ſcheme. It would be as burthenſome and injurious to the public, as ruinous to private citizens. The latter reſource of permanent corps in the pay of government amounts to a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army in time of peace; a ſmall one indeed, but not the leſs real for being ſmall. Here is a ſimple view of the ſubject that ſhows us at once the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of a conſtitutional interdiction of ſuch eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, and the neceſſity of leaving the matter to the diſcretion and prudence of the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>In proportion to our increaſe in ſtrength it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, nay it may be ſaid certain, that Britain and Spain would augment their military eſtabliſhments in our neighbourhood. If we ſhould not be willing to be expoſed in a naked and defenceleſs condition to their inſults or encroachments, we ſhould find it expedient to increaſe our frontier garriſons in ſome ratio to the force by which our Weſtern ſettlements might be annoyed. There are and will be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular poſts, the poſſeſſion of which will include the command of large diſtricts of territory and facilitate future invaſions of the remainder. It may be added that ſome of thoſe poſts will be keys to the trade with the Indian nations. Can any man think it would be wiſe to leave ſuch poſts in a ſituation to be at any inſtant ſeized by one or the other of two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and formidable powers? To act this part, would be to deſert all the uſual maxims of prudence and policy.</p>
                     <p>If we mean to be a commercial people or even to be ſecure on our Atlantic ſide, we muſt endeavour as ſoon as poſſible to have a navy. To this purpoſe there muſt be dock-yards and arſenals; and, for the defence of theſe, fortifications and probably gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons. When a nation has become ſo powerful by ſea, that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets, this ſuperſedes the neceſſity of garriſons for that
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:021127_0160_0FB2469ECD5D8A10"/>
purpoſe; but where naval eſtabliſhments are in their infancy, moderate garriſons will in all likelihood be found an indiſpenſable ſecurity againſt deſcents for the deſtruction of the arſenals and dock-yards and ſometimes of the fleet itſelf.</p>

                     <p>IT may perhaps be urged, that the objects enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the preceding number ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the ſtate governments, under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the union. But this would be an inverſion of the primary principle of our political aſſociation; as it would in practice transfer the care of the common defence from the federal head to the individual members: A project oppreſſive to ſome ſtates, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to all, and baneful to the confederacy.</p>
                     <p>The territories of Britain, Spain and of the Indian nations in our neighbourhood, do not border on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtates; but incircle the union from MAINE to GEORGIA. The danger, though in different degrees, is therefore common. And the means of guarding againſt it ought in like manner to be the objects of common councils and of a common treaſury. It happens that ſome ſtates, from local ſituation, are more directly expoſed. NEW-YORK is of this claſs. Upon the plan of ſeparate proviſions, New-York would have to ſuſtain the whole weight of the eſtabliſhments requiſite to her immediate ſafety, and to the mediate or ultimate protection of her neighbours. This would neither be equitable as it reſpected New-York, nor ſafe as it reſpected the other ſtates. Various inconveniencies would attend ſuch a ſyſtem. The ſtates, to whoſe lot it might fall
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:021127_0161_0FB246A04ABED6D8"/>
to ſupport the neceſſary eſtabliſhments, would be as little able as willing, for a conſiderable time to come, to bear the burthen of competent proviſions. The ſecurity of all would thus be ſubjected to the parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, improvidence or inability of a part. If the reſources of ſuch part becoming more abundant, its proviſions ſhould be proportionally enlarged, the other ſtates would quickly take the alarm at ſeeing the whole military force of the union in the hands of two or three of its members; and thoſe probably amongſt the moſt powerful. They would each chooſe to have ſome counterpoiſe; and pretences could eaſily be contrived. In this ſituation military eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, nouriſhed by mutual jealouſy, would be apt to ſwell beyond their natural or proper ſize; and being at the ſeparate diſpoſal of the members, they would be engines for the abridgment, or demolition of the national authority.</p>
                     <p>Reaſons have been already given to induce a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the ſtate governments will too naturally be prone to a rivalſhip with that of the union, the foundation of which will be the love of power; and that in any conteſt between the federal head and one of its members, the people will be moſt apt to unite with their local government: If in addition to this immenſe advantage, the ambition of the members ſhould be ſtimulated by the ſeparate and independent poſſeſſion of military forces, it would afford too ſtrong a temptation, and too great facility to them to make enterpriſes upon, and finally to ſubvert the conſtitutional authority of the union. On the other hand, the liberty of the people would be leſs ſafe in this ſtate of things, than in that which left the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal forces in the hands of the national government. As far as an army may be conſidered as a dangerous weapon of power, it had better be in thoſe hands, of which the people are moſt likely to be jealous, than in thoſe of which they are leaſt likely to be jealous. For it is a truth which the experience of all ages
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:021127_0162_0FB246A6D5CA6650"/>
has atteſted, that the people are commonly moſt in danger, when the means of injuring their rights are in the poſſeſſion of thoſe of whom they entertain the leaſt ſuſpicion.</p>
                     <p>The framers of the exiſting confederation, fully aware of the danger to the union from the ſeparate poſſeſſion of military forces by the ſtates, have in expreſs terms, prohibited them from having either ſhips or troops, unleſs with the conſent of congreſs. The truth is, that the exiſtence of a federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and military eſtabliſhments, under ſtate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are not leſs at variance with each other, than a due ſupply of the federal treaſury and the ſyſtem of quotas and requiſitions.</p>
                     <p>There are other lights beſides thoſe already taken notice of, in which the impropriety of reſtraints on the diſcretion of the national legiſlature will be equally manifeſt. The deſign of the objection, which has been mentioned, is to preclude ſtanding armies in time of peace; though we have never been informed how far it is deſired the prohibition ſhould extend; whether to raiſing armies as well as to <hi>keeping them up</hi> in a ſeaſon of tranquility or not. If it be confined to the latter it will have no preciſe ſignification, and it will be ineffectual for the purpoſe intended. When armies are once raiſed, what ſhall be denominated "keeping them up," contrary to the ſenſe of the conſtitution? What time ſhall be requiſite to aſcertain the violation? Shall it be a week, a month, or a year? Or ſhall we ſay, they may be continued as long as the danger which occaſioned their being raiſed continues? This would be to admit that they might be kept up <hi>in time of peace</hi> againſt threatening, or impending danger; which would be at once to deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition, and to introduce an extenſive latitude of conſtruction. Who ſhall judge of the continuance of the danger? This muſt undoubtedly be ſubmitted to the national government, and the matter would then be brought
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:021127_0163_0FB246A7CC1E2858"/>
to this iſſue, that the national government, to provide againſt apprehended danger, might, in the firſt inſtance, raiſe troops, and might afterwards keep them on foot, as long as they ſuppoſed the peace or ſafety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy. It is eaſy to perceive, that a diſcretion ſo latitudinary as this, would afford ample room for eluding the force of the proviſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſuppoſed utility of a proviſion of this kind, muſt be founded upon a ſuppoſed probability, or at leaſt poſſibility, of a combination between the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and legiſlative in ſome ſcheme of uſurpation. Should this at any time happen, how eaſy would it be to fabricate pretences of approaching danger? Indian hoſtilities inſtigated by Spain or Britain, would always be at hand. Provocations to produce the deſired appearances, might even be given to ſome foreign power, and appeaſed again by timely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions. If we can reaſonably preſume ſuch a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to have been formed, and that the enterpriſe is warranted by a ſufficient proſpect of ſucceſs; the army when once raiſed, from whatever cauſe, or on whatever pretext, may be applied to the execution of the project.</p>
                     <p>If to obviate this conſequence, it ſhould be reſolved to extend the prohibition to the <hi>raiſing</hi> of armies in time of peace, the United States would then exhibit the moſt extraordinary ſpectacle, which the world has yet ſeen—that of a nation incapacitated by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to prepare for defence, before it was actually invaded. As the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into diſuſe, the preſence of an enemy within our territories muſt be waited for as the legal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the protection of the ſtate. We muſt receive the blow before we could even prepare to return it. All that kind of policy by which nations anticipate diſtant danger, and meet the gathering ſtorm, muſt be abſtained from, as contrary to the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:021127_0164_0FB246A92B0FC5F0"/>
genuine maxims of a free government. We muſt expoſe our property and liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders and invite them, by our weakneſs, to ſeize the naked and defenceleſs prey, becauſe we are afraid that rulers, created by our choice—depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on our will—might endanger that liberty, by an abuſe of the means neceſſary to its preſervation.</p>
                     <p>Here I expect we ſhall be told, that the militia of the country is its natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national defence. This doctrine in ſubſtance had like to have loſt us our independence. It coſt millions to the United States that might have been ſaved. The facts, which from our own experience forbid a reliance of this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of ſuch a ſuggeſtion. The ſteady operations of war againſt a regular and diſciplined army, can only be ſucceſsfully conducted by a force of the ſame kind. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of economy, not leſs than of ſtability and vigor, confirm this poſition. The American militia, in the courſe of the late war, have by their valour on numerous occaſions, erected eternal monuments to their fame; but the braveſt of them feel and know, that the liberty of their country could not have been eſtabliſhed by their efforts alone, however great and valuable they were. War, like moſt other things, is a ſcience to be acquired and perfected by diligence, by perſeverance, by time, and by practice.</p>
                     <p>All violent policy, contrary to the natural and experienced courſe of human affairs, defeats itſelf. Pennſylvania at this inſtant affords an example of the truth of this remark. The bill of rights of that ſtate declares, that ſtanding armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be kept up in time of peace. Pennſylvania, nevertheleſs, in a time of profound peace, from the exiſtence of partial diſorders in one or two of her counties, has reſolved to raiſe a body of troops; and in all probability, will keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:021127_0165_0FB246AB7A7F6720"/>
public peace. The conduct of Maſſachuſetts affords a leſſon on the ſame ſubject, though on different ground. That ſtate (without waiting for the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of congreſs as the articles of the confederation require) was compelled to raiſe troops to quell a domeſtic inſurrection, and ſtill keeps a corps in pay to prevent a revival of the ſpirit of revolt. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts oppoſed no obſtacle to the meaſure; but the inſtance is ſtill of uſe to inſtruct us, that caſes are likely to occur under our governments, as well as under thoſe of other nations, which will ſometimes render a military force in time of peace eſſential to the ſecurity of the ſociety, and that it is therefore improper, in this reſpect, to controul the legiſlative diſcretion. It alſo teaches us, in its application to the United States, how little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, even by its own conſtituents. And it teaches us, in addition to the reſt, how unequal are parchment proviſions to a ſtruggle with public neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>It was a fundamental maxim of the Lacedemonian commonwealth, that the poſt of admiral ſhould not be conferred twice on the ſame perſon. The Pelop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſian confederates, having ſuffered a ſevere defeat at ſea from the Athenians, demanded Lyſander who had before ſerved with ſucceſs in that capacity, to command the combined fleets. The Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, to gratify their allies, and yet preſerve the ſemblance of an adherence to their antient inſtitutions had recourſe to the flimſy ſubterfuge of inveſting Lyſander with the real power of admiral, under the nominal title of vice-admiral. This inſtance is ſelected from among a multitude that might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illuſtrated by domeſtic examples; which is, that nations pay little regard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to the neceſſities of ſociety. Wiſe politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with reſtrictions, that cannot be obſerved;
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:021127_0166_0FB246B2E7FBCB48"/>
becauſe they know that every breach of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws, though dictated by neceſſity impairs that ſacred reverence, which ought to be maintained in the breaſt of rulers towards the conſtitution of a country, and forms a precedent for other breaches, where the ſame plea of neceſſity does not exiſt at all, or is leſs urgent and palpable.</p>

                     <p>IT was a thing hardly to be expected, that in a popular revolution the minds of men ſhould ſtop, at that happy mean, which marks the ſalutary boundary between POWER and PRIVILEGE, and combines the energy of government with the ſecurity of private rights. A failure in this delicate and important point is the great ſource of the inconveniences we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and if we are not cautious to avoid a repetition of the error, in our future attempts to rectify and ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorate our ſyſtem we may travel from one chimerical project to another; we may try change after change; but we ſhall never be likely to make any material change for the better.</p>
                     <p>The idea of reſtraining the legiſlative authority, in the means of providing for the national defence, is one of thoſe refinements, which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than enlightened. We have ſeen however that is has not had thus far an extenſive prevalency: That even in this country, where it has made its firſt appearance, Pennſylvania and North-Carolina are the only two ſtates by which it has been in any degree patroniſed: And that all the others have refuſed to give it the leaſt countenance; wiſely judging that confidence muſt be placed ſome
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:021127_0167_0FB246B5E63A9348"/>
where; that the neceſſity of doing it is implied in the very act of delegating power; and that it is better to hazard the abuſe of that confidence, than to embarraſs the government and endanger the public ſafety, by impolitic reſtrictions on the legiſlative authority. The opponents of the propoſed conſtitution combat in this reſpect the general deciſion of America; and inſtead of being taught by experience the propriety of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting any extremes, into which we may have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore run, they appear diſpoſed to conduct us into others ſtill more dangerous and more extravagant. As if the tone of government had been found too high, or too rigid, the doctrines they teach are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to induce us to depreſs, or to relax it, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients which upon other occaſions have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or forborn. It may be affirmed without the imputation of invective, that if the principles they inculcate on various points could ſo far obtain as to become the popular creed, they would utterly unfit the people of this country for any ſpecies of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatever. But a danger of this kind is not to be apprehended. The citizens of America have too much diſcernment to be argued into anarchy. And I am much miſtaken if experience has not wrought a deep and ſolemn conviction in the public mind, that greater energy of government is eſſential to the welfare and proſperity of the community.</p>
                     <p>It may not be amiſs in this place conciſely to remark the origin and progreſs of the idea which aims at the excluſion of military eſtabliſhments in time of peace. Though in ſpeculative minds it may ariſe from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of ſuch inſtitutions fortified by the events that have happened in other ages and countries; yet as a national ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it muſt be traced to thoſe habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from whom the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of theſe ſtates have in general ſprung.</p>
                     <p>In England for a long time after the Norman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, the authority of the monarch was almoſt unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:021127_0168_0FB246B81BE79DA0"/>
Inroads were gradually made upon the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, in favour of liberty, firſt by the barons and afterwards by the people, till the greateſt part of its moſt formidable pretenſions became extinct. But it was not till the revolution in 1688, which elevated the prince of Orange to the throne of Great Britain, that Engliſh liberty was completely triumphant. As incident to the undefined power of making war, an acknowledged prerogative of the crown, Charles IId had by his own authority kept on foot in time of peace a body of 5,000 regular troops. And this number James IId. increaſed to 30,000; which were paid out of his civil liſt. At the revolution, to aboliſh the exerciſe of ſo dangerous an authority, it became an article of the bill of rights then framed, that
<q>raiſing or keeping a ſtanding army within the kingdom in time of peace, <hi>unleſs with the conſent of parliament,</hi> was againſt law.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In that kingdom, when the pulſe of liberty was at its higheſt pitch, no ſecurity againſt the danger of ſtanding armies was thought requiſite, beyond a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of their being raiſed or kept up by the mere authority of the executive magiſtrate. The patriots, who effected that memorable revolution, were too temperate and too well informed, to think of any reſtraint on the legiſlative diſcretion. They were aware that a certain number of troops for guards and garriſons were indiſpenſable, that no preciſe bounds could be ſet to the national exigencies; that a power equal to every poſſible contingency muſt exiſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the government; and that when they referred the exerciſe of that power to the judgement of the legiſlature, they had arrived at the ultimate point of precaution, which was reconcileable with the ſafety of the community.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame ſource, the people of America may be ſaid to have derived a hereditary impreſſion of danger to liberty from ſtanding armies in time of peace. The circumſtances of a revolution quickened
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:021127_0169_0FB246C88A1129E8"/>
the public ſenſibility on every point connected with the ſecurity of popular rights; and in ſome inſtances raiſed the warmth of our zeal beyond the degree which conſiſted with the due temperature of the body politic. The attempts of two of the ſtates to reſtrict the authority of the legiſlature in the article of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eſtabliſhments are of the number of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The principles, which had taught us to be jealous of the power of a hereditary monarch, were by an injudicious exceſs extended to the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people in their popular aſſemblies. Even in ſome of the ſtates, where this error was not adopted, we find unneceſſary declarations, that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies ought not to be kept up, in time of peace, <hi>without the conſent of the legiſlature</hi>;—I call them unneceſſary, becauſe the reaſon, which had introduced a ſimilar proviſion into the Engliſh bill of rights, is not applicable to any of the ſtate conſtitutions. The power of raiſing armies at all, under thoſe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, can by no conſtruction be deemed to reſide any where elſe, than in the legiſlatures themſelves; and it was ſuperflous, if not abſurd, to declare that a matter ſhould not be done without the conſent of a body, which alone had the power of doing it. Accordingly in ſome of thoſe conſtitutions, and among others in that of the ſtate of New-York; which has been juſtly celebrated both in Europe and in America as one of the beſt of the forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed in this country, there is a total ſilence upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that even in the two ſtates, which ſeem to have meditated an interdiction of military eſtabliſhments in time of peace, the mode of expreſſion made uſe of is rather monitory than prohibitory. It is not ſaid, that ſtanding armies <hi>ſhall not be</hi> kept up, but that they <hi>ought not</hi> to be kept up in time of peace. This ambiguity of terms appears to have been the reſult of a conflict between jealouſy and conviction, between the deſire of excluding ſuch eſtabliſhments
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:021127_0170_0FB246C9DF69C750"/>
at all events, and the perſuaſion that an abſolute excluſion would be unwiſe and unſafe.</p>
                     <p>Can it be doubted that ſuch a proviſion, whenever the ſituation of public affairs was underſtood to require a departure from it, would be interpreted by the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature into a mere admonition, and would be made to yield to the neceſſities or ſuppoſed neceſſities of the ſtate? Let the fact already mentioned with reſpect to Pennſylvania decide. What then (it may be aſked) is the uſe of ſuch a proviſion, if it ceaſe to operate the moment there is an inclination to diſregard it?</p>
                     <p>Let us examine whether there be any compariſon, in point of efficacy, between the proviſion alluded to, and that which is contained in the new conſtitution, for reſtraining the appropriations of money for mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary purpoſes to the period of two years. The former by aiming at too much, is calculated to effect nothing; the latter, by ſteering clear of an imprudent extreme, and by being perfectly compatible with a proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the exigencies of the nation, will have a ſalutary and powerful operation.</p>
                     <p>The legiſlature of the United States will be <hi>obliged</hi> by this proviſion, once at leaſt in every two years, to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot; to come to a new reſolution on the point; and to declare their ſenſe of the matter, by a formal vote in the face of their conſtituents. They are not <hi>at liberty</hi> to veſt in the executive department permanent funds for the ſupport of an army; if they were even incautious enough to be willing to repoſe in it ſo improper a confidence. As the ſpirit of party, in different degrees, muſt be expected to infect all political bodies, there will be no doubt perſons in the national legiſlature willing enough to arraign the meaſures and criminate the views of the majority. The proviſion for the ſupport of a military force will always be a favourable topic for declamation. As often as the queſtion comes forward, the public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be rouſed and attracted to the ſubject, by
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:021127_0171_0FB246CB1F355588"/>
the party in oppoſition: And if the majority ſhould be really diſpoſed to exceed the proper limits, the community will be warned of the danger, and will have an opportunity of taking meaſures to guard againſt it. Independent of parties in the national legiſlature itſelf, as often as the period of diſcuſſion arrived, the ſtate legiſlatures, who will always be not only vigilant, but ſuſpicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens, againſt incroachments from the federal government, will conſtantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to ſound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if neceſſary, the ARM of their diſcontent.</p>
                     <p>Schemes to ſubvert the liberties of a great commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>require time to</hi> mature them for execution. An army ſo large as ſeriouſly to menace thoſe liberties, could only be formed by progreſſive augmentations; which would ſuppoſe not merely a temporary combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation between the legiſlature and executive, but a continued conſpiracy for a ſeries of time. Is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſuch a combination would exiſt at all? Is it probable that it would be perſevered in, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted along, through all the ſucceſſive variations in the repreſentative body, which biennial elections would naturally produce in both houſes? Is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable, that every man, the inſtant he took his ſeat in the national ſenate, or houſe of repreſentatives, would commence a traitor to his conſtituents, and to his country? Can it be ſuppoſed, that there would not be found one man diſcerning enough to detect ſo atrocious a conſpiracy, or bold or honeſt enough to appriſe his conſtituents of their danger? If ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions can fairly be made, there ought to be at once an end of all delegated authority. The people ſhould reſolve to recall all the powers they have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore parted with out of their own hands; and to divide themſelves into as many ſtates as there are
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:021127_0172_0FB246CC6D452068"/>
counties in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in perſon.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch ſuppoſitions could even be reaſonably made, ſtill the concealment of the deſign, for any duration, would be impracticable. It would be announced by the very circumſtance of augmenting the army to ſo great an extent in time of profound peace. What colorable reaſon could be aſſigned in a country ſo ſituated, for ſuch vaſt augmentations of the military force? It is impoſſible that the people could be long deceived; and the deſtruction of the project and of the projectors would quickly follow the diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid that the proviſion, which limits the appropriation of money for the ſupport of an army to the period of two years, would be unavailing; becauſe the executive, when once poſſeſſed of a force large enough to awe the people into ſubmiſſion, would find reſources in that very force ſufficient to enable him to diſpenſe with ſupplies from the votes of the legiſlature. But the queſtion again recurs: Upon what pretence could he be put in poſſeſſion of a force of that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude in time of peace? If we ſuppoſe it to have been created in conſequence of ſome domeſtic inſurrection or foreign war, then it becomes a caſe not within the principle of the objection; for this is levelled againſt the power of keeping up troops in time of peace. Few perſons will be ſo viſionary as ſeriouſly to contend that military forces ought not to be raiſed to quell a rebellion, or reſiſt an invaſion; and if the defence of the community, under ſuch circumſtances, ſhould make it neceſſary to have an army, ſo numerous as to hazard its liberty, this is one of thoſe calamities for which there is neither preventative nor cure. It cannot be provided againſt by any poſſible form of government: It might even reſult from a ſimple league offenſive and defenſive; if it ſhould ever be neceſſary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common defence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="unknown:021127_0173_0FB246CDF8F26268"/>But it is an evil infinitely leſs likely to attend us in an united than in an diſunited ſtate; nay it may be ſafely aſſerted that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter ſituation. It is not eaſy to conceive a poſſibility, that dangers ſo formidable can aſſail the whole union, as to demand a force conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough to place our liberties in the leaſt jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy; eſpecially if we take into view the aid to be derived from the militia, which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and powerful auxiliary. But in a ſtate of diſunion (as has been fully ſhewn in another place) the contrary of this ſuppoſition would become not only probable, but almoſt unavoidable.</p>

This however like moſt other things that have been alledged on that ſide, reſts on mere general aſſertion; unſupported by any preciſe or intelligible deſignation of the reaſons upon which it is founded. As far as I have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors, it ſeems to ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate in a pre-ſuppoſition that the people will be diſinclined to the exerciſe of federal authority in any matter of an internal nature. Waving any exception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citneſs of the diſtinction between internal and external, let us inquire what ground there is to preſuppoſe that diſinclination in the people. Unleſs we preſume, at the ſame time, that the powers of the general government will be worſe adminiſtred than thoſe of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:021127_0174_0FB246D210571B00"/>
the ſtate governments, there ſeems to be no room for the preſumption of ill-will, diſaffection or oppoſition in the people. I believe it may be laid down as a general rule, that their confidence in and obedience to a government, will commonly be proportioned to the goodneſs or badneſs of its adminiſtration. It muſt be admitted that there are exceptions to this rule; but theſe exceptions depend ſo entirely on accidental cauſes, that they cannot be conſidered as having any relation to the intrinſic merits or demerits of a conſtitution. Theſe can only be judged of by general principles and maxims.</p>
                     <p>Various reaſons have been ſuggeſted in the courſe of theſe papers, to induce a probability that the general government will be better adminiſtered than the particular governments; the principal of which are that the extenſion of the ſpheres of election will preſent a greater option, or latitude of choice to the people, that through the medium of the ſtate legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are ſelect bodies of men, and who are to appoint the members of the national ſenate—there is reaſon to expect that this branch will generally be compoſed with peculiar care and judgment: That theſe circumſtances promiſe greater knowledge and more comprehenſive information in the national coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: And that on account of the extent of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from which thoſe, to whoſe direction they will be committed, will be drawn, they will be leſs apt to be tainted by the ſpirit of faction, and more out of the reach of thoſe occaſional ill humours or temporary prejudices and propenſities, which in ſmaller ſocieties frequently contaminate the public deliberations, beget injuſtice and oppreſſion of a part of the community, and engender ſchemes, which though they gratify a momentary inclination or deſire, terminate in general diſtreſs, diſſatisfaction and diſguſt. Several additional reaſons of conſiderable force, to fortify that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, will occur when we come to ſurvey with a more critic eye, the interior ſtructure of the edifice
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:021127_0175_0FB246D4961394B0"/>
which we are invited to erect. It will be ſufficient here to remark, that until ſatisfactory reaſons can be aſſigned to juſtify an opinion, that the foederal government is likely to be adminiſtered in ſuch a manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the people, there can be no reaſonable foundation for the ſuppoſition, that the laws of the union will meet with any greater obſtruction from them, or will ſtand in need of any other methods to enforce their execution, than the laws of the particular members.</p>
                     <p>The hope of impunity is a ſtrong incitement to ſedition—the dread of puniſhment a proportionately ſtrong diſcouragement to it—will not the government of the union, which, if poſſeſſed of a due degree of power, can call to its aid the collective reſources of the whole confederacy, be more likely to repreſs the <hi>former</hi> ſentiment, and to inſpire the <hi>latter,</hi> than that of a ſingle ſtate, which can only command the reſources within itſelf? A turbulent faction in a ſtate may eaſily ſuppoſe itſelf able to contend with the friends to the government in that ſtate, but it can hardly be ſo infatuated as to imagine itſelf a match for the combined efforts of the union. If this reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be juſt, there is leſs danger of reſiſtance from irregular combinations of individuals, to the authority of the confederacy, than to that of a ſingle member.</p>
                     <p>I will in this place hazard an obſervation which will not be the leſs juſt becauſe to ſome it may appear new; which is, that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exerciſe of government; the more the citizens are accuſtomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life; the more it is familiariſed to their ſight and to their feelings; the further it enters into thoſe objects which touch the moſt ſenſible cords, and put in motion the moſt active ſprings of the human heart; the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the reſpect and attachment of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Man is very much a creature of habit. A
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:021127_0176_0FB246DB291F05F8"/>
thing that rarely ſtrikes his ſenſes will generally have but a tranſient influence upon his mind. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continually at a diſtance and out of ſight, can hardly be expected to intereſt the ſenſations of the people. The inference is, that the authority of the union, and the affections of the citizens towards it, will be ſtrengthened rather than weakened by its extenſion to what are called matters of internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; and that it will have leſs occaſion to recur to force in proportion to the familiarity and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of its agency. The more it circulates through thoſe channels and currents, in which the paſſions of mankind naturally flow, the leſs will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compulſion.</p>
                     <p>One thing at all events, muſt be evident, that a government like that propoſed, would bid much fairer to avoid the neceſſity of uſing force, than the ſpecies of league contended for by moſt of its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; the authority of which ſhould only operate upon the ſtates in their political or collective capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It has been ſhewn, that in ſuch a confederacy, there can be no ſanction for the laws but force; that frequent delinquencies in the members are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral offspring of the very frame of the government; and that as often as theſe happen they can only be redreſſed, if at all, by war and violence.</p>
                     <p>The plan reported by the convention, by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the ſeveral ſtates, will enable the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to employ the ordinary magiſtracy of each in the execution of its laws. It is eaſy to perceive that this will tend to deſtroy, in the common apprehenſion, all diſtinction between the ſources from which they might proceed; and will give the federal government the ſame advantage for ſecuring a due obedience to its authority, which is enjoyed by the government of each ſtate; in addition to the influence on public opinion, which will reſult from the important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of its having power to call to its aſſiſtance
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:021127_0177_0FB246DDA9B4BA30"/>
and ſupport the reſources of the whole Union. It merits particular attention in this place, that the laws of the confederacy, as to the <hi>ennumerated</hi> and <hi>legitimate</hi> objects of its juriſdiction, will become the SUPREME LAW of the land; to the obſervance of which, all officers legiſlative, executive and judicial in each ſtate, will be bound by the ſanctity of an oath. Thus the legiſlatures, courts and magiſtrates of the reſpective members will be incorporated into the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the national government, <hi>as far as its juſt and conſtitutional authority extends</hi>; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſophiſtry which has been employed to ſhow that this will tend to the deſtruction of the ſtate governments will, in its proper place, be fully detected.</note> Any man, who will purſue by his own reflections the conſequences of this ſituation, will perceive that there is good ground to calculate upon a regular and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able execution of the laws of the union; if its powers are adminiſtered with a common ſhare of prudence. If we will arbitrarily ſuppoſe the contrary, we may deduce any inferences we pleaſe from the ſuppoſition; for it is certainly poſſible, by an injudicious exerciſe of the authorities of the beſt government that ever was or ever can be inſtituted, to provoke and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the people into the wildeſt exceſſes. But though the adverſaries of the propoſed conſtitution ſhould preſume that the national rulers would be inſenſible to the motives of public good, or to the obligations of duty; I would ſtill aſk them, how the intereſts of ambition, or the views of encroachment, can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by ſuch a conduct?</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XXVIII. The ſame Subject continued.</head>
                     <p>THAT there may happen caſes, in which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional government may be neceſſitated to reſort to force, cannot be denied. Our own experience has corroborated the leſſons taught by the examples of other nations; that emergencies of this ſort will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exiſt in all ſocieties, however conſtituted; that ſeditions and inſurrections are unhappily maladies as inſeparable from the body politic, as tumours and eruptions from the natural body; that the idea of governing at all times by the ſimple force of law (which we have been told is the only admiſſible prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of republican government) has no place but in the reveries of thoſe political doctors, whoſe ſagacity diſdains the admonitions of experimental inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Should ſuch emergencies at any time happen under the national government, there could be no remedy but force. The means to be employed muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the extent of the miſchief. If it ſhould be a ſlight commotion in a ſmall part of a ſtate, the militia of the reſidue would be adequate to its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: and the natural preſumption is, that they would be ready to do their duty. An inſurrection, whatever may be its immediate cauſe, eventually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers all government: Regard to the public peace, if not to the rights of the union, would engage the citizens, to whom the contagion had not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated itſelf, to oppoſe the inſurgents: And if the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral government ſhould be found in practice condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the proſperity and felicity of the people, it were irrational to believe that they would be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to its ſupport.</p>
                     <p>If on the contrary the inſurrection ſhould pervade a whole ſtate, or a principal part of it, the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a different kind of force might become
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:021127_0179_0FB246E1651C9088"/>
unavoidable. It appears that Maſſachuſetts found it neceſſary to raiſe troops for ſuppreſſing the diſorders within that ſtate; that Pennſylvania, from the mere apprehenſion of commotions among a part of her citizens, has thought proper to have recourſe to the ſame meaſure. Suppoſe the ſtate of New-York had been inclined to re-eſtabliſh her loſt juriſdiction over the inhabitants of Vermont; could ſhe have hoped for ſucceſs in ſuch an enterpriſe from the efforts of the militia alone? Would ſhe not have been compelled to raiſe and to maintain a more regular force for the execution of her deſign? If it muſt then be admitted that the neceſſity of recurring to a force different from the militia in caſes of this extraordinary nature, is applicable to the ſtate governments themſelves, why ſhould the poſſibility that the national government might be under a like neceſſity in ſimilar extremities, be made an objection to its exiſtence? Is it not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing that men, who declare an attachment to the union in the abſtract, ſhould urge, as an objection to the propoſed conſtitution, what applies with ten-fold weight to the plan for which they contend; and what as far as it has any foundation in truth, is an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequence of civil ſociety upon an enlarged ſcale? who would not prefer that poſſibility to the unceaſing agitations and frequent revolutions which are the continual ſcourges of petty republics?</p>
                     <p>Let us purſue this examination in another light. Suppoſe, in lieu of one general ſyſtem, two or three, or even four confederacies were to be formed, would not the ſame difficulty oppoſe itſelf to the operations of either of theſe confederacies? Would not each of them be expoſed to the ſame caſualties; and, when theſe happened, be obliged to have recourſe to the ſame expedients for upholding its authority, which are objected to a government for all the ſtates? Would the militia in this ſuppoſition be more ready or more able to ſupport the foederal authority than in the caſe of a general union? All candid and intelligent men
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:021127_0180_0FB246F21E4D2808"/>
muſt upon due conſideration acknowledge that the principle of the objection is equally applicable to either of the two caſes; and that whether we have one government for all the ſtates, or different governments for different parcels of them, or as many unconnected governments as there are ſtates, there might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be a neceſſity to make uſe of a force conſtituted differently from the militia to preſerve the peace of the community, and to maintain the juſt authority of the laws againſt thoſe violent invaſions of them, which amount to inſurrections and rebellions.</p>
                     <p>Independent of all other reaſonings upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is a full anſwer to thoſe who require a more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>emptory proviſion againſt military eſtabliſhments in time of peace, to ſay that the whole power of the propoſed government is to be in the hands of the repreſentatives of the people. This is the eſſential, and after all the only efficacious ſecurity for the rights and privileges of the people which is attainable in civil ſociety.<note n="*" place="bottom">Its full efficacy will be examined hereafter.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the repreſentatives of the people betray their conſtituents, there is then no reſource left but in the exertion of that original right of ſelf-defence, which is paramount to all poſitive forms of government; and which, againſt the uſurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, than againſt thoſe of the rulers of an individual ſtate. In a ſingle ſtate, if the perſons entruſted with ſupreme power become uſurpers, the different parcels, ſubdiviſions or diſtricts, of which it conſiſts, having no diſtinct government in each, can take no regular meaſures for defence. The citizens muſt ruſh tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly to arms, without concert, without ſyſtem, without reſource; except in their courage and deſpair. The uſurpers, cloathed with the forms of legal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, can too often cruſh the oppoſition in embryo. The ſmaller the extent of territory, the more difficult will it be for the people to form a regular or ſyſtematic
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:021127_0181_0FB246F437CA3230"/>
plan of oppoſition; and the more eaſy will it be to defeat their early efforts. Intelligence can be more ſpeedily obtained of their preparations and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the military force in the poſſeſſion of the uſurpers, can be more rapidly directed againſt the part where the oppoſition has begun. In this ſituation, there muſt be a peculiar coincidence of circumſtances to enſure ſucceſs to the popular reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The obſtacles to uſurpation, and the facilities of reſiſtance increaſe with the increaſed extent of the ſtate; provided the citizens underſtand their rights and are diſpoſed to defend them. The natural ſtrength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial ſtrength of the government, is greater than in a ſmall; and of courſe more competent to a ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with the attempts of the government to eſtabliſh a tyranny. But in a confederacy, the people, without exaggeration, may be ſaid to be entirely the maſters of their own fate. Power being almoſt always the rival of power; the general government will at all times ſtand ready to check the uſurpations of the ſtate governments; and theſe will have the ſame diſpoſition towards the general government. The people, by throwing themſelves into either ſcale, will infallibly make it preponderate. If their rights are invaded by either, they can make uſe of the other, as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of redreſs. How wiſe will it be in them by cheriſhing the union to preſerve to themſelves an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which can never be too highly priſed!</p>
                     <p>It may ſafely be received as an axiom in our poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſyſtem, that the ſtate governments will in all poſſible contingencies afford complete ſecurity againſt invaſions of the public liberty by the national autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Projects of uſurpation cannot be maſked under pretences ſo likely to eſcape the penetration of ſelect bodies of men as of the people at large. The legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures will have better means of information. They can diſcover the danger at a diſtance; and poſſeſſing all the organs of civil power, and the confidence of
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:021127_0182_0FB246F5CE0A3918"/>
the people, they can at once adopt a regular plan of oppoſition, in which they can combine all the reſources of the community. They can readily communicate with each other in the different ſtates; and unite their common forces for the protection of their common liberty.</p>
                     <p>The great extent of the country is a further ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. We have already experienced its utility againſt the attacks of a foreign power. And it would have preciſely the ſame effect againſt the enterpriſes of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious rulers in the national councils. If the federal army ſhould be able to quell the reſiſtance of one ſtate, the diſtant ſtates would be able to make head with freſh forces. The advantages obtained in one place muſt be abandoned to ſubdue the oppoſition in others; and the moment the part which had been reduced to ſubmiſſion was left to itſelf its efforts would be renewed and its reſiſtance revive.</p>
                     <p>We ſhould recollect that the extent of the military force muſt at all events be regulated by the reſources of the country. For a long time to come, it will not be poſſible to maintain a large army; and as the means of doing this increaſe, the population and natural ſtrength of the community will proportionably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. When will the time arrive, that the federal government can raiſe and maintain an army capable of erecting a deſpotiſm over the great body of the people of an immenſe empire; who are in a ſituation, through the medium of their ſtate governments, to take meaſures for their own defence with all the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, regularity and ſyſtem of independent nations? The apprehenſion may be conſidered as a diſeaſe, for which there can be found no cure in the reſources of argument and reaſoning.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XXIX. Concerning the Militia.</head>
                     <p>THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its ſervices in times of inſurrection and invaſion, are natural incidents to the duties of ſuperintending the common defence, and of watching over the internal peace of the confederacy.</p>
                     <p>It requires no ſkill in the ſcience of war to diſcern that uniformity in the organization and diſcipline of the militia would be attended with the moſt beneficial effects, whenever they were called into ſervice for the public defence. It would enable them to diſcharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert; an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army: And it would fit them much ſooner to acquire the degree of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in military functions, which would be eſſential to their uſefulneſs. This deſirable uniformity can only be accompliſhed by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is therefore with the moſt evident propriety that the plan of the convention propoſes to empower the union
<q>to provide for organizing, arming and diſciplining the militia, and for governing ſuch part of them as may be employed in the ſervice of the United States, <hi>reſerving to the ſtates reſpectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the diſcipline preſcribed by Congreſs.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the different grounds which have been taken in oppoſition to this plan, there is none that was ſo little to have been expected, or is ſo untenable in itſelf, as the one from which this particular proviſion has been attacked. If a well regulated militia be the moſt natural defence of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the diſpoſal of that body which is conſtituted the guardian of the national
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:021127_0184_0FB246FD41BCC748"/>
ſecurity. If ſtanding armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the ſame body, ought as far as poſſible to take away the inducement and the pretext to ſuch unfriendly inſtitutions. If the federal government can command the aid of the militia in thoſe emergencies which call for the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary arm in ſupport of the civil magiſtrate, it can the better diſpenſe with the employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itſelf of the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unneceſſary will be a more certain method of preventing its exiſtence tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> thouſand prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon paper.</p>
                     <p>In order to caſt an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, it has been remarked that there is no where any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the propoſed conſtitution for requiring the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS to aſſiſt the magiſtrate in the execution of his duty; whence it has been inferred that military force was intended to be his only auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary. There is a ſtriking incoherence in the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have appeared, and ſometimes even from the ſame quarter, not much calculated to inſpire a very favourable opinion of the ſincerity or fair dealing of their authors. The ſame perſons who tell us in one breath that the powers of the federal government will be deſpotic and unlimited, inform us in the next that it has not authority ſufficient even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS. The latter fortunately is as much ſhort of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as abſurd to doubt that a right to paſs all laws <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> to execute its declared powers would include that of requiring the aſſiſtance of the citizens to the officers who may be entruſted with the execution of thoſe laws; as it would be to believe that a right to enact laws neceſſary and proper for the impoſition and collection of taxes would involve that of varying the rules of deſcent and of the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of landed property, or of aboliſhing the trial by
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:021127_0185_0FB246FF6F315838"/>
jury in caſes relating to it. It being therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the ſuppoſition of a want of power to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of colour, it will follow that the concluſion which has been drawn from it, in its application to the authority of the federal government over the militia, is as uncandid as it is illogical. What reaſon could there be to infer that force was intended to be the ſole inſtrument of authority, merely becauſe there is a power to make uſe of it when neceſſary? What ſhall we think of the motives which could induce men of ſenſe to reaſon in this extraordinary manner? How ſhall we prevent a conflict between charity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction?</p>
                     <p>By a curious refinement upon the ſpirit of republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can jealouſy, we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itſelf in the hands of the federal government. It is obſerved that ſelect corps may be formed, compoſed of the young and the ardent, who may be rendered ſubſervient to the views of arbitrary power. What plan for the regulation of the militia may be purſued by the national government is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be foreſeen. But ſo far from viewing the matter in the ſame light with thoſe who object to ſelect corps as dangerous, were the conſtitution ratified, and were I to deliver my ſentiments to a member of the federal legiſlature on the ſubject of a militia eſtabliſhment, I ſhould hold to him in ſubſtance the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:—</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The project of diſciplining all the militia of the United States, is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertneſs in military movements is a buſineſs that requires time and practice. It is not a day, nor a week, nor even a month that will ſuffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other claſſes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpoſe of going through military exerciſes and evolutions
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:021127_0186_0FB2470105782968"/>
as often as might be neceſſary, to acquire the degree of perfection which would intitle them to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a well regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a ſerious public incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and loſs. It would form an annual deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the productive labour of the country to an amount which, calculating upon the preſent numbers of the people, would not fall far ſhort of a million of pounds. To attempt a thing which would abridge the maſs of labour and induſtry to ſo conſiderable an extent would be unwiſe; and the experiment, if made, could not ſucceed, becauſe it would not long be endured. Little more can reaſonably be aimed at with reſpect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to ſee that this be not neglected, it will be neceſſary to aſſemble them once or twice in the courſe of a year.</p>
                        <p>But though the ſcheme of diſciplining the whole nation muſt be abandoned as miſchievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmoſt importance that a well digeſted plan ſhould as ſoon as poſſible be adopted for the proper eſtabliſhment of the militia. The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a ſelect corps of moderate ſize, upon ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as will really ſit it for ſervice in caſe of need. By thus circumſcribing the plan, it will be poſſible to have an excellent body of well trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defence of the ſtate ſhall require it. This will not only leſſen the call for military eſtabliſhments; but if circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhould at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in diſcipline and the uſe of arms, who ſtand ready to defend their own rights and thoſe of their fellow citizens. This appears to
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:021127_0187_0FB24706897F7138"/>
me the only ſubſtitute that can be deviſed for a ſtanding army; and the beſt poſſible ſecurity againſt it if it ſhould exiſt.</p>

                     <p>Thus differently from the adverſaries of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed conſtitution ſhould I reaſon on the ſame ſubject; deducing arguments of ſafety from the very ſources which they repreſent as fraught with danger and perdition. But how the national legiſlature may reaſon on the point, is a thing which neither they nor I can foreſee.</p>
                     <p>There is ſomething ſo far fetched and ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in the idea of danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loſs whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to conſider it as a mere trial of ſkill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians, as a diſingenuous artifice to inſtil prejudices at any price, or as the ſerious offspring of political fanaticiſm. Where in the name of common ſenſe are our fears to end if we may not truſt our ſons, our brothers, our neighbours, our fellow citizens? What ſhadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the reſt of their countrymen; and who parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate with them in the ſame feelings, ſentiments, habits and intereſts? What reaſonable cauſe of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion can be inferred from a power in the union to preſcribe regulations for the militia and to command its ſervices when neceſſary; while the particular ſtates are to have the <hi>ſole and excluſive appointment of the officers?</hi> If it were poſſible ſeriouſly to indulge a jealouſy of the militia upon any conceivable eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment under the federal government, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the officers being in the appointment of the ſtates ought at once to extinguiſh it. There can be no doubt that this circumſtance will always ſecure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.</p>
                     <p>In reading many of the publications againſt the conſtitution, a man is apt to imagine that he is peruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ill written tale or romance; which inſtead
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:021127_0188_0FB2470CAE627360"/>
of natural and agreeable images exhibits to the mind nothing but frightful and diſtorted ſhapes—
"Gorgons, Hydras and Chimeras dire"
—diſcoloring and disfiguring whatever it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and transforming every thing it touches into a monſter.</p>
                     <p>A ſample of this is to be obſerved in the exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and improbable ſuggeſtions which have taken place reſpecting the power of calling for the ſervices of the militia. That of New-Hampſhire is to be marched to Georgia, of Georgia to New-Hampſhire, of New-York to Kentuke and of Kentuke to Lake Champlain. Nay the debts due to the French and Dutch are to be paid in militia-men inſtead of Louis d'ors and ducats. At one moment there is to be a large army to lay proſtrate the liberties of the people; at another moment the militia of Virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or ſix hundred miles to tame the republican contumacy of Maſſachuſetts; and that of Maſſachuſetts is to be tranſported an equal diſtance to ſubdue the refractory haughtineſs of the ariſtocratic Virginians. Do the perſons, who rave at this rate, imagine, that their art or their eloquence can impoſe any conceits or abſurdities upon the people of America for infallible truths?</p>
                     <p>If there ſhould be an army to be made uſe of as the engine of deſpotiſm what need of the militia? If there ſhould be no army, whither would the militia, irritated at being required to undertake a diſtant and diſtreſſing expedition for the purpoſe of rivetting the chains of ſlavery upon a part of their countrymen direct their courſe, but to the ſeat of the tyrants, who had meditated ſo fooliſh as well as ſo wicked a project to cruſh them in their imagined intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of power and to make them an example of the juſt vengeance of an abuſed and incenſed people? Is this the way in which uſurpers ſtride to dominion over a numerous and enlightened nation? Do they begin by exciting the deteſtation of the very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:021127_0189_0FB2470F329B8160"/>
of their intended uſurpations? Do they uſually commence their career by wanton and diſguſtful acts of power calculated to anſwer no end, but to draw upon themſelves univerſal hatred and execration? Are ſuppoſitions of this ſort the ſober admonitions of diſcerning patriots to a diſcerning people? Or are they the inflammatory ravings of chagrined incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries or diſtempered enthuſiaſts? If we were even to ſuppoſe the national rulers actuated by the moſt ungovernable ambition, it is impoſſible to believe that they would employ ſuch prepoſterous means to accompliſh their deſigns.</p>
                     <p>In times of inſurrection or invaſion it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate ſhould be marched into another to reſiſt a common enemy or to guard the republic againſt the violences of faction or ſedition. This was frequently the caſe in reſpect to the firſt object in the couſe of the late war; and this mutual ſuccour is indeed a principal end of our political aſſociation. If the power of affording it be placed under the direction of the union, there will be no danger of a ſupine and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs inattention to the dangers of a neighbour, till its near approach had ſuperadded the incitements of ſelf preſervation to the too feeble impulſes of duty and ſympathy.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XXX. Concerning Taxation.</head>
                     <p>IT has been already obſerved, that the federal government ought to poſſeſs the power of provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſupport of the national forces; in which propoſition was intended to be included the expence of raiſing troops of building and equipping fleets, and all other expences in any wiſe connected with
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:021127_0190_0FB2471585633DF0"/>
military arrangements and operations. But theſe are not the only objects to which the juriſdiction of the union, in reſpect to revenue, muſt neceſſarily be impowered to extend—It muſt embrace a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the ſupport of the national civil liſt—for the payment of the national debts contracted, or that may be contracted—and in general for all thoſe matters which will call for diſburſements out of the national treaſury. The concluſion is, that there muſt be interwoven in the frame of the government, a general power of taxation in one ſhape or another.</p>
                     <p>Money is with propriety conſidered as the vital principle of the body politic; as that which ſuſtains its life and motion, and enables it to perform its moſt eſſential functions. A complete power therefore to procure a regular and adequate ſupply of revenue, as far as the reſources of the community will permit, may be regarded as an indiſpenſable ingredient in every conſtitution. From a deficiency in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, one of two evils muſt enſue; either the people muſt be ſubjected to continual plunder as a ſubſtitute for a more eligible mode of ſupplying the public wants, or the government muſt ſink into a fatal atrophy, and in a ſhort courſe of time periſh.</p>
                     <p>In the Ottoman or Turkiſh empire, the ſovereign, though in other reſpects abſolute maſter of the lives and fortunes of his ſubjects, has no right to impoſe a new tax. The conſequence is, that he permits the baſhaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people at diſcretion; and in turn ſqueezes out of them the ſums of which he ſtands in need to ſatisfy his own exigencies and thoſe of the ſtate. In America, from a like cauſe, the government of the union has gradually dwindled into a ſtate of decay, approaching nearly to annihilation. Who can doubt that the happineſs of the people in both countries would be promoted by competent authorities in the proper hands, to provide the revenues which the neceſſities of the public might require?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="unknown:021127_0191_0FB24716A92F9FF8"/>The preſent confederation, feeble as it is, intended to repoſe in the United States, an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary wants of the union. But proceeding upon an erroneous principle, it has been done in ſuch a manner as entirely to have fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the intention. Congreſs by the articles which compoſe that compact (as has been already ſtated) are authoriſed to aſcertain and call for any ſums of money neceſſary, in their judgement, to the ſervice of the United States; and their requiſitions, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the rule of apportionment, are in every conſtitutional ſenſe obligatory upon the ſtates. Theſe have no right to queſtion the propriety of the demand, no diſcretion beyond that of deviſing the ways and means of furniſhing the ſums demanded. But though this be ſtrictly and truly the caſe; though the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a right would be an infringement of the articles of union; though it may ſeldom or never have been avowedly claimed; yet in practice it has been conſtantly exerciſed; and would continue to be ſo, as long as the revenues of the confederacy ſhould remain dependent on the intermediate agency of its members. What the conſequences of this ſyſtem have been, is within the knowledge of every man, the leaſt converſant in our public affairs, and has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly unfolded in different parts of theſe inquiries. It is this which has chiefly contributed to reduce us to a ſituation which affords ample cauſe, of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ourſelves, and of triumph to our enemies.</p>
                     <p>What remedy can there be for this ſituation, but in a change of the ſyſtem, which has produced it? in a change of the fallacious and deluſive ſyſtem of quotas and requiſitions? What ſubſtitute can there be imagined for this <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> in finance, but that of permitting the national government to raiſe its own revenues by the ordinary methods of taxation, authoriſed in every well ordered conſtitution of civil government? Ingenious men may declaim with plauſibility on any ſubject; but no human
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:021127_0192_0FB2471AB23D7728"/>
ingenuity can point out any other expedient to reſcue us from the inconveniences and embarraſſments, naturally reſulting from defective ſupplies of the public treaſury.</p>
                     <p>The more intelligent adverſaries of the new conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution admit the force of this reaſoning; but they qualify their admiſſion by a diſtinction between what they call <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external</hi> taxation. The former they would reſerve to the ſtate governments; the latter, which they explain into commercial impoſts, or rather duties on imported articles, they declare themſelves willing to concede to the federal head. This diſtinction, however, would violate that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maxim of good ſenſe and ſound policy, which dictates that every POWER ought to be proportionate to its OBJECT; and would ſtill leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inconſiſtent with every idea of vigor or effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. Who can pretend that commercial impoſts are or would be alone equal to the preſent and future exigencies of the union? Taking into the account the exiſting debt, foreign and domeſtic, upon any plan of extinguiſhment, which a man moderately impreſſed with the importance of public juſtice and public credit could approve, in addition to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, which all parties will acknowledge to be neceſſary, we could not reaſonably flatter ourſelves, that this reſource alone, upon the moſt improved ſcale, would even ſuffice for its preſent neceſſities. Its future neceſſities admit not of calculation or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and upon the principle, more than once adverted to, the power of making proviſion for them as they ariſe, ought to be equally unconfined. I believe it may be regarded as a poſition, warranted by the hiſtory of mankind, that <hi>in the uſual progreſs of things the neceſſities of a nation in every ſtage of its exiſtence will be found at leaſt equal to its reſources.</hi>

                     <p>To ſay that deficiencies may be provided for by requiſitions upon the ſtates, is on the one hand to
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:021127_0193_0FB2471D6961E710"/>
acknowledge that this ſyſtem cannot be depended upon; and on the other hand, to depend upon it for every thing beyond a certain limit. Thoſe who have carefully attended to its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by experience, or delineated in the courſe of theſe papers, muſt feel an invincible repugnancy to truſting the national intereſts, in any degree, to its operation. Its inevitable tendency, whenever it is brought into activity, muſt be to enfeeble the union, and ſow the ſeeds of diſcord and contention between the federal head and its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and between the members themſelves. Can it be expected that the deficiencies would be better ſupplied in this mode, than the total wants of the union have heretofore been ſupplied, in the ſame mode? It ought to be recollected, that if leſs will be required from the ſtates, they will have proportionably leſs means to anſwer the demand. If the opinions of thoſe who contend for the diſtinction which has been mentioned, were to be received as evidence of truth, one would be led to conclude that there was ſome known point in the economy of national affairs, at which it would be ſafe to ſtop, and to ſay—Thus far the ends of public happineſs will be promoted by ſupplying the wants of government, and all beyond this is unworthy of our care or anxiety.—How is it poſſible that a government half ſupplied and always neceſſitous, can fulfil the purpoſes of its inſtitution— can provide for the ſecurity—advance the proſperity— or ſupport the reputation of the commonwealth? How can it ever poſſeſs either energy or ſtability, dignity or credit, confidence at home or reſpectability abroad? How can its adminiſtration be any thing elſe than a ſucceſſion of expedients temporiſing, impotent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful? How will it be able to avoid a frequent ſacrifice of its engagements to immediate neceſſity? How can it undertake or execute any liberal or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged plans of public good?</p>

                        <pb n="189" facs="unknown:021127_0194_0FB2471F5DF87858"/>Let us attend to what would be the effects of this ſituation in the very firſt war in which we ſhould happen to be engaged. We will preſume, for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſake, that the revenue ariſing from the import duties anſwers the purpoſes of a proviſion for the public debt, and of a peace eſtabliſhment for the union. Thus circumſtanced, a war breaks out. What would be the probable conduct of the government in ſuch an emergency? Taught by experience that proper dependence could not be placed on the ſucceſs of requiſitions; unable by its own authority to lay hold of freſh reſources, and urged by conſiderations of national danger, would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to the defence of the ſtate? It is not eaſy to ſee how a ſtep of this kind cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d be avoided; and if it ſhould be taken, it is evident that it would prove the deſtruction of public credit at the very moment that it was become eſſential to the public ſafety. To imagine that at ſuch a criſis credit might be diſpenſed with, would be the extreme of infatuation. In the modern ſyſtem of war, nations the moſt wealthy are obliged to have recourſe to large loans. A country ſo little opulent as ours, muſt feel this neceſſity in a much ſtronger degree. But who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing, by an act which demonſtrated that no reliance could be placed on the ſteadineſs of its meaſures for paying? The loans it might be able to procure, would be as limited in their extent as burthenſome in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They would be made upon the ſame principles that uſurers commonly lend to bankrupt and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent debtors; with a ſparing hand, and at enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous premiums.</p>
                     <p>It may perhaps be imagined, that from the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the reſources of the country, the neceſſity of diverting the eſtabliſhed funds in the caſe ſuppoſed, would exiſt; though the national government ſhould poſſeſs an unreſtrained power of taxation. But two
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:021127_0195_0FB24726E6D3D990"/>
conſiderations will ſerve to quiet all apprehenſion on this head; one is, that we are ſure the reſources of the community in their full extent, will be brought into activity for the benefit of the union; the other is, that whatever deficiencies there may be, can without difficulty be ſupplied by loans.</p>
                     <p>The power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation by its own authority, would enable the national government to borrow, as far as its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities might require. Foreigners as well as the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of America, could then reaſonably repoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in its engagements; but to depend upon a government, that muſt itſelf depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, when once its ſituation is clearly underſtood, would require a degree of credulity, not often to be met with in the pecuniary tranſactions of mankind, and little reconcileable with the uſual ſharp-ſighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of avarice.</p>
                     <p>Reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men, who hope to ſee realized in America, the halcyon ſcenes of the poetic or fabulous age; but to thoſe who believe we are likely to experience a common portion of the viciſſitudes and calamities, which have fallen to the lot of other nations, they muſt appear entitled to ſerious attention. Such men muſt behold the actual ſituation of their country with painful ſolicitude, and deprecate the evils which ambition or revenge might, with too much facility, inflict upon it.</p>

To a certain degree it is right and uſeful that this ſhould be the caſe. Caution and inveſtigation are a neceſſary armour againſt error and impoſition. But this untractableneſs may be carried too far, and may degenerate into obſtinacy, perverſeneſs or diſingenuity. Though it cannot be pretended that the principles of moral and political knowledge have in general the ſame degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty with thoſe of the mathematics; yet they have much better claims in this reſpect, than to judge from the conduct of men in particular ſituations, we ſhould be diſpoſed to allow them.

                     <p>How elſe could it happen (if we admit the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to be ſincere in their oppoſition) that poſitions ſo clear as thoſe which manifeſt the neceſſity of a general power of taxation in the government of the union, ſhould have to encounter any adverſaries among men of diſcernment? Though theſe poſitions have been elſewhere fully ſtated, they will perhaps not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly recapitulated in this place, as introductory to an examination of what may have been offered by way of objection to them. They are in ſubſtance as follow:—</p>
                     <p>A government ought to contain in itſelf every power requiſite to the full accompliſhment of the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the truſts for which it is reſponſible; free from every other controul, but a regard to the public good and to the ſenſe of the people.</p>
                     <p>As the duties of ſuperintending the national defence and of ſecuring the public peace againſt foreign or domeſtic violence, involve a proviſion for
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:021127_0198_0FB2472ED4CAF7B0"/>
caſualties and dangers, to which no poſſible limits can be aſſigned, the power of making that proviſion ought to know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the reſources of the community.</p>
                     <p>As revenue is the eſſential engine by which the means of anſwering the national exigencies muſt be procured, the power of procuring that article in its full extent, muſt neceſſarily be comprehended in that of providing for thoſe exigencies.</p>
                     <p>As theory and practice conſpire to prove that the power of procuring revenue is unavailing, when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed over the ſtates in their collective capacities, the federal government muſt of neceſſity be inveſted with an unqualified power of taxation in the ordinary modes.</p>
                     <p>Did not experience evince the contrary, it would be natural to conclude that the propriety of a general power of taxation in the national government might ſafely be permitted to reſt on the evidence of theſe propoſitions, unaſſiſted by any additional arguments or illuſtrations. But we find in fact, that the antagoniſts of the propoſed conſtitution, ſo far from acquieſcing in their juſtneſs or truth ſeem to make their principal and moſt zealous effort againſt this part of the plan. It may therefore be ſatisfactory to analize the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which they combat it.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of them which have been moſt laboured with that view, ſeem in ſubſtance to amount to this:
<q>It is not true, becauſe the exigencies of the union may not be ſuſceptible of limitation, that its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined. Revenue is as requiſite to the purpoſes of the local admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations as to thoſe of the union; and the former are at leaſt of equal importance with the latter to the happineſs of the people. It is therefore as neceſſary, that the ſtate governments ſhould be able to command the means of ſupplying their wants, as, that the national government ſhould poſſeſs the like faculty, in reſpect to the wants of the union. But

an indefinite power of taxation in the <hi>latter</hi> might, and probably would in time deprive the <hi>former</hi> of the means of providing for their own neceſſities; and would ſubject them entirely to the mercy of the national legiſlature. As the laws of the union are to become the ſupreme law of the land; as it is to have power to paſs all laws that may be NECESSARY for carrying into execution, the authorities with which it is propoſed to veſt it; the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might at any time aboliſh the taxes impoſed for ſtate objects, upon the pretence of an interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with its own. It might alledge a neceſſity of doing this, in order to give efficacy to the national revenues: And thus all the reſources of taxation might by degrees, become the ſubjects of federal monopoly, to the intire excluſion and deſtruction of the ſtate governments.</q>

                     <p>This mode of reaſoning appears ſometimes to turn upon the ſuppoſition of uſurpation in the national government; at other times it ſeems to be deſigned only as a deduction from the conſtitutional operation of its intended powers. It is only in the latter light, that it can be admitted to have any pretenſions to fairneſs. The moment we launch into conjectures about the uſurpations of the federal government, we get into an unfathomable abyſs, and fairly put ourſelves out of the reach of all reaſoning. Imagination may range at pleaſure, till it gets bewildered amidſt the labyrinths of an enchanted caſtle, and knows not on which ſide to turn to eſcape from the apparitions which itſelf has raiſed. Whatever may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the union, it is eaſy to imagine an endleſs train of poſſible dangers; and by indulging an exceſs of jealouſy and timidity, we may bring ourſelves to a ſtate of abſolute ſcepticiſm and irreſolution. I repeat here what I have obſerved in ſubſtance in another place, that all obſervations founded upon the danger of uſurpation, ought to be referred to the compoſition and ſtructure of the government,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:021127_0200_0FB23DCDC419D9B8"/>
not to the nature or extent of its powers. The ſtate governments, by their original conſtitutions, are inveſted with complete ſovereignty. In what does ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſecurity conſiſt againſt uſurpations from that quarter? Doubtleſs in the manner of their formation, and in a due dependence of thoſe who are to adminiſter them upon the people. If the propoſed conſtruction of the federal government, be found upon an impartial exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it, to be ſuch as to afford, to a proper extent, the ſame ſpecies of ſecurity, all apprehenſions on the ſcore of uſurpation ought to be diſcarded.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould not be forgotten, that a diſpoſition in the ſtate governments to encroach upon the rights of the union, is quite as probable as a diſpoſition in the union to encroach upon the rights of the ſtate governments. What ſide would be likely to prevail in ſuch a conflict, muſt depend on the means which the contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties could employ towards enſuring ſucceſs. As in republics, ſtrength is always on the ſide of the people; and as there are weighty reaſons to induce a belief that the ſtate governments will commonly poſſeſs moſt influence over them, the natural concluſion is, that ſuch conteſts will be moſt apt to end to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the union; and that there is greater probability of encroachments by the members upon the federal head, than by the federal head upon the members. But it is evident, that all conjectures of this kind, muſt be extremely vague and fallible, and that it is by far the ſafeſt courſe to lay them altogether aſide; and to confine our attention wholly to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ALTHOUGH I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the conſequences, which ſeem to be apprehended to the ſtate governments, from a power in the union to controul them in the levies of money; becauſe I am perſuaded that the ſenſe of the people, the extreme hazard of provoking the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſtate governments, and a conviction of the utility and neceſſity of local adminiſtrations, for local purpoſes, would be a complete barrier againſt the oppreſſive uſe of ſuch a power: Yet I am willing here to allow in its full extent the juſtneſs of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, which requires that the individual ſtates ſhould poſſeſs an independent and uncontroulable authority to raiſe their own revenues for the ſupply of their own wants. And making this conceſſion, I affirm that (with the ſole exception of duties on imports and exports) they would under the plan of the convention retain that authority in the moſt abſolute and unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified ſenſe; and that an attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in the exerciſe of it would be a violent aſſumption of power unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by any article or clauſe of its conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>An intire conſolidation of the ſtates into one complete national ſovereignty, would imply an intire ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts; and whatever powers might remain in them would be altogether dependent on the general will But as the plan of the convention aims only a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="197" facs="unknown:021127_0202_0FB23DD0C46C33C0"/>
which they before had, and which were not by that act <hi>excluſively</hi> delegated to the United States. This excluſive delegation, or rather this alienation of ſtate ſovereignty, would only exiſt in three caſes; where the conſtitution in expreſs terms granted an excluſive authority to the union; where it granted in one inſtance an authority to the union, and in another prohibited the ſtates from exerciſing the like authority; and where it granted an authority to the union, to which a ſimilar authority in the ſtates would be abſolutely and totally <hi>contradictory</hi> and <hi>repugnant.</hi> I uſe theſe terms to diſtinguiſh this laſt caſe from another which might appear to reſemble it; but which would in fact be eſſentially different; I mean where the exerciſe of a concurrent juriſdiction might be productive of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional interferences in the <hi>policy</hi> of any branch of adminiſtration, but would not imply any direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or repugnancy in point of conſtitutional autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Theſe three caſes of excluſive juriſdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtances: The laſt clauſe but one in the eighth ſection of the firſt article provides expreſsly that congreſs ſhall exerciſe "<hi>excluſive legiſlation</hi>" over the diſtrict to be appropriated as the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This anſwers to the firſt caſe. The firſt clauſe of the ſame ſection impowers congreſs
<q>to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts and exciſes,</q>
and the ſecond clauſe of the tenth ſection of the ſame article declares that
<q>
                           <hi>no ſtate ſhall</hi> without the conſent of congreſs, <hi>lay any impoſts or duties on imports or exports,</hi> except for the purpoſe of executing it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> inſpection laws.</q>
Hence would reſult an excluſive power in the union to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clauſe which declares, that no tax or duty ſhall be laid on articles exported from any ſtate; in conſequence of which qualification it now only extends to the <hi>duties on imports.</hi> This anſwers to the ſecond caſe. The third will
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:021127_0203_0FB23DD244566D88"/>
be found in that clauſe, which declares that congreſs ſhall have power
<q>to eſtabliſh an UNIFORM RULE of naturalization throughout the United States.</q>
This muſt neceſſarily be excluſive; becauſe if each ſtate had power to preſcribe a DISTINCT RULE there could be no UNIFORM RULE.</p>
                     <p>A caſe which may perhaps be thought to reſemble the latter, but which is in fact widely different, affects the queſtion immediately under conſideration. I mean the power of impoſing taxes on all articles other than exports and imports. This, I contend, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly a concurrent and coequal authority in the United States and in the individual ſtates. There is plainly no expreſſion in the granting clauſe which makes that power <hi>excluſive</hi> in the union. There is no independent clauſe or ſentence which prohibits the ſtates from exerciſing it. So far is this from being the caſe, that a plain and concluſive argument to the contrary is deducible from the reſtraint laid upon the ſtates in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to duties on imports and exports. This reſtriction implies an admiſſion, that if it were not inſerted the ſtates would poſſeſs the power it excludes, and it implies a further admiſſion, that as to all other taxes the authority of the ſtates remains undiminiſhed. In any other view it would be both unneceſſary and dangerous; it would be unneceſſary, becauſe if the grant to the union of the power of laying ſuch duties implied the excluſion of the ſtates, or even their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination in this particular, there could be no need of ſuch a reſtriction; it would be dangerous, becauſe the introduction of it leads directly to the concluſion which has been mentioned, and which if the reaſoning of the objectors be juſt, could not have been intended; I mean that the ſtates in all caſes to which the reſtriction did not apply would have a concurrent power of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with the union. The reſtriction in queſtion amounts to what lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT; that is a <hi>negation</hi> of one thing and an <hi>affirmance</hi>
                        <pb n="199" facs="unknown:021127_0204_0FB23DD3CB5CFF20"/>
of another; a negation of the authority of the ſtates to impoſe taxes on imports and exports, and an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their authority to impoſe them on all other articles. It would be mere ſophiſtry to argue that it was meant to exclude them <hi>abſolutely</hi> from the impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taxes of the former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others <hi>ſubject to the controul</hi> of the national legiſlature. The reſtraining or prohibitory clauſe only ſays, that they ſhall not <hi>without the conſent of congreſs</hi> lay ſuch duties; and if we are to underſtand this in the ſenſe laſt mentioned, the conſtitution would then be made to introduce a formal proviſion for the ſake of a very abſurd concluſion; which is that the ſtates <hi>with the conſent</hi> of the national legiſlature might tax imports and exports; and that they might tax every other article <hi>unleſs controuled</hi> by the ſame body. If this was the intention, why was it not left in the firſt inſtance to what is alledged to be the natural operation of the original clauſe conferring a general power of taxation upon the union? It is evident that this could not have been the intention, and that it will not bear a conſtruction of the kind.</p>
                     <p>As to a ſuppoſition of repugnancy between the power of taxation in the ſtates and in the union, it cannot be ſupported in that ſenſe which would be requiſite to work an excluſion of the ſtates. It is indeed poſſible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a ſtate, which might render it <hi>inexpedient</hi> that a further tax ſhould be laid on the ſame article by the union; but it would not imply a conſtitutional inability to impoſe a further tax. The quantity of the impoſition, the expediency or inexpediency of an increaſe on either ſide, would be mutually queſtions of prudence; but there would be involved no direct contradiction of power. The particular policy of the national and of the ſtate ſyſtems of finance might now and then not exactly coincide, and might require reciprocal forbearances. It is not however a mere poſſibility of inconvenience in the exerciſe of powers,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:021127_0205_0FB23DD547923B80"/>
but an immediate conſtitutional repugnancy, that can by implication alienate and extinguiſh a pre-exiſting right of ſovereignty.</p>
                     <p>The neceſſity of a concurrent juriſdiction in certain caſes reſults from the diviſion of the ſovereign power; and the rule that all authorities of which the ſtates are not explicitly diveſted in favour of the union, remain with them in full vigour, is not only a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical conſequence of that diviſion, but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the inſtrument which contains the articles of the propoſed conſtitution. We there find that notwithſtanding the affirmative grants of general authorities, there has been the moſt pointed care in thoſe caſes where it was deemed improper that the like authorities ſhould reſide in the ſtates, to inſert negative clauſes prohibiting the exerciſe of them by the ſtates. The tenth ſection of the firſt article conſiſts altogether of ſuch proviſions. This circumſtance is a clear indication of the ſenſe of the convention, and furniſhes a rule of interpretation out of the body of the act which juſtifies the poſition I have advanced, and refutes every hypotheſis to the contrary.</p>

                     <p>THE reſidue of the argument againſt the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the conſtitution, in reſpect to taxation, is ingrafted upon the following clauſes;—the laſt clauſe of the eighth ſection of the firſt article, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes the national legiſlature
<q>to make all laws which ſhall be <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>proper,</hi> for carrying into execution <hi>the powers</hi> by that conſtitution veſted in the government of the United States, or in any
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:021127_0206_0FB23DD6C3BC8B00"/>
department or officer thereof;</q>
and the ſecond clauſe of the ſixth article declares, that
<q>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and the laws of the United States made <hi>in purſuance thereof,</hi> and the treaties made by their authority, ſhall be the <hi>ſupreme law</hi> of the land; any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two clauſes have been the ſources of much virulent invective and petulant declamation againſt the propoſed conſtitution, they have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colours of miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, as the pernicious engines by which their local governments were to be deſtroyed and their liberties exterminated—as the hideous monſter whoſe devouring jaws would ſpare neither ſex nor age, nor high nor low, nor ſacred nor profane; and yet ſtrange as it may appear, after all this clamour, to thoſe who may not have happened to contemplate them in the ſame light, it may be affirmed with perfect confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the conſtitutional operation of the intended government would be preciſely the ſame, if theſe clauſes were entirely obliterated, as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in every article. They are only declaratory of a truth, which would have reſulted by neceſſary and unavoidable implication from the very act of conſtituting a federal government, and veſting it with certain ſpecified powers. This is ſo clear a propoſition, that moderation itſelf can ſcarcely liſten to the railings which have been ſo copiouſly vented againſt this part of the plan, without emotions that diſturb its equanimity.</p>
                     <p>What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing? What is the ability to do a thing but the power of employing the <hi>means</hi> neceſſary to its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What is a LEGISLATIVE power but a power of making LAWS? What are the <hi>means</hi> to execute a LEGISLATIVE power but LAWS? What is the power of laying and collecting taxes but a <hi>legiſlative power,</hi> or a power of <hi>making laws,</hi> to lay and collect taxes?
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:021127_0207_0FB23DD844262A10"/>
What are the proper means of executing ſuch a power but <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> laws?</p>
                     <p>This ſimple train of enquiry furniſhes us at once with a teſt of the true nature of the clauſe complained of. It conducts us to this palpable truth, that a power to lay and collect taxes muſt be a power to paſs all laws <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> for the execution of that power: and what does the unfortunate and calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated proviſion in queſtion do more than declare the ſame truth; to wit, that the national legiſlature to whom the power of laying and collecting taxes had been previouſly given, might in the execution of that power paſs all laws <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> to carry it into effect? I have applied theſe obſervations thus particularly to the power of taxation, becauſe it is the immediate ſubject under conſideration, and becauſe it is the moſt important of the authorities propoſed to be conferred upon the union. But the ſame proceſs will lead to the ſame reſult in relation to all other powers declared in the conſtitution. And it is <hi>expreſsly</hi> to execute theſe powers, that the ſweeping clauſe, as it has been affectedly called, authoriſes the national legiſlature to paſs all <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> laws. If there be any thing exceptionable, it muſt be ſought for in the ſpecific powers, upon which this general declaration is predicated. The declaration itſelf, tho' it may be chargeable with tautology or redundancy, is at leaſt perfectly harmleſs.</p>
                     <p>But SUSPICION may aſk, why then was it intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? The anſwer is, that it could only have been done for greater caution, and to guard againſt all cavilling refinements in thoſe who might hereafter feel a diſpoſition to curtail and evade the legitimate authorities of the union. The convention probably foreſaw, what it has been a principal aim of theſe papers to inculcate, that the danger which moſt threatens our political welfare, is, that the ſtate governments will finally ſap the foundations of the union; and might therefore think it neceſſary, in
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:021127_0208_0FB23DDAD58F5920"/>
ſo cardinal a point, to leave nothing to conſtruction. Whatever may have been the inducement to it, the wiſdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been raiſed againſt it; as that very cry betrays a diſpoſition to queſtion the great and eſſential truth which it is manifeſtly the object of that proviſion to declare.</p>
                     <p>But it may be again aſked, who is to judge of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and <hi>propriety</hi> of the laws to be paſſed for executing the powers of the union? I anſwer firſt that this queſtion ariſes as well and as fully upon the ſimple grant of thoſe powers, as upon the declaratory clauſe: and I anſwer in the ſecond place, that the national government, like every other, muſt judge in the firſt inſtance of the proper exerciſe of its powers; and its conſtituents in the laſt. If the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould overpaſs the juſt bounds of its authority, and make a tyrannical uſe of its powers; the people whoſe creature it is muſt appeal to the ſtandard they have formed, and take ſuch meaſures to redreſs the injury done to the conſtitution, as the exigency may ſuggeſt and prudence juſtify. The propriety of a law in a conſtitutional light, muſt always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded. Suppoſe by ſome forced conſtruction of its authority (which indeed cannot eaſily be imagined) the federal legiſlature ſhould attempt to vary the law of deſcent in any ſtate; would it not be evident that in making ſuch an attempt it had exceeded its juriſdiction and infringed upon that of the ſtate? Suppoſe again that upon the pretence of an interference with its revenues, it ſhould undertake to abrogate a land tax impoſed by the authority of a ſtate; would it not be equally evident that this was an invaſion of that concurrent juriſdiction in reſpect to this ſpecies of tax which its conſtitution plainly ſuppoſes to exiſt in the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? If there ever ſhould be a doubt on this head the credit of it will be entirely due to thoſe reaſoners, who, in the imprudent zeal of their animoſity to the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:021127_0209_0FB23DDC0A208780"/>
plan of the convention, have laboured to invelope it in a cloud calculated to obſcure the plaineſt and ſimpleſt truths.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid, that the laws of the union are to be the <hi>ſupreme law</hi> of the land. What inference can be drawn from this, or what would they amount to, if they were not to be ſupreme? It is evident they would amount to nothing. A LAW by the very meaning of the term includes ſupremacy. It is a rule which thoſe to whom it is preſcribed are bound to obſerve. This reſults from every political aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. If individuals enter into a ſtate of ſociety, the laws of that ſociety muſt be the ſupreme regulator of their conduct. If a number of political ſocieties enter into a larger political ſociety, the laws which the latter may enact, purſuant to the powers entruſted to it by its conſtitution, muſt neceſſarily be ſupreme over thoſe ſocieties, and the individuals of whom they are compoſed. It would otherwiſe be a mere treaty, dependent on the good faith of the parties, and not a government; which is only another word for POLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICAL POWER AND SUPREMACY. But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger ſociety which are <hi>not purſuant</hi> to its conſtitutional powers, but which are invaſions of the reſiduary authorities of the ſmaller ſocieties, will become the ſupreme law of the land. Theſe will be merely acts of uſurpation, and will deſerve to be treated as ſuch. Hence we perceive that the clauſe which declares the ſupremacy of the laws of the union, like the one we have juſt before conſidered, only declares a truth, which flows immediately and neceſſarily from the inſtitution of a federal government. It will not, I preſume, have eſcaped obſervation, that it <hi>expreſsly</hi> confines this ſupremacy to laws made <hi>purſuant to the conſtitution</hi>; which I mention merely as an inſtance of caution in the convention; ſince that limitation would have been to be underſtood, though it had not been expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="unknown:021127_0210_0FB23DDD892D8C60"/>Though a law therefore for laying a tax for the uſe of the United States would be ſupreme in its nature, and could not legally be oppoſed or controuled; yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of a ſtate (unleſs upon imports and exports) would not be the ſupreme law of the land, but an uſurpation of power not granted by the conſtitution. As far as an improper accumulation of taxes on the ſame object might tend to render the collection difficult or precarious, this would be a mutual inconvenience not ariſing from a ſuperiority or defect of power on either ſide, but from an injudicious exerciſe of power by one or the other, in a manner equally diſadvantageous to both. It is to be hoped and preſumed however, that mutual intereſt would dictate a concert in this reſpect which would avoid any material inconvenience. The infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the whole is—that the individual ſtates would, under the propoſed conſtitution, retain an independent and uncontroulable authority to raiſe revenue to any extent of which they may ſtand in need by every kind of taxation except duties on imports and exports. It will be ſhewn in the next paper that this <hi>concurrent juriſdiction</hi> in the article of taxation was the only admiſſible ſubſtitute for an entire ſubordination, in reſpect to this branch of power, of ſtate authority to that of the union.</p>

to the ſtates far the greateſt part of the reſources of the community, there can be no color for the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they would not poſſeſs means as abundant as could be deſired for the ſupply of their own wants, independent of all external control. That the field is ſufficiently wide will more fully appear when we come to develope the inconſiderable ſhare of the public expences, for which it will fall to the lot of the ſtate governments to provide.</p>
                     <p>To argue upon abſtract principles that this co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate authority cannot exiſt, would be to ſet up theory and ſuppoſition againſt fact and reality.

It is well known that in the Roman republic, the legiſlative authority in the laſt reſort, reſided for ages in two different political bodies; not as branches of the ſame legiſlature, but as diſtinct and independent legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures; in each of which an oppoſite intereſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; in one the Patrician—in the other the Plebeian. Many arguments might have been adduced to prove the unfitneſs of two ſuch ſeemingly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory authorities, each having power to <hi>annul</hi> or <hi>repeal</hi> the acts of the other. But a man would have been regarded as frantic, who ſhould have attempted at Rome to diſprove their exiſtence. It will readily be underſtood, that I allude to the COMITIA CEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURIATA and the COMITIA TRIBUTA. The former, in which the people voted by centuries, was ſo arranged as to give a ſuperiority to the Patrician intereſt: In the latter, in which numbers prevailed, the Plebeian intereſt had an entire predominancy. And yet theſe two legiſlatures co-exiſted for ages, and the Roman republic attained to the pinacle of human greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe particularly under conſideration there is no ſuch contradiction as appears in the example
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:021127_0212_0FB23DE08E447F10"/>
cited; there is no power on either ſide to annul the acts of the other. And in practice there is little reaſon to apprehend any inconvenience; becauſe in a ſhort courſe of time the wants of the ſtates will naturally reduce themſelves within <hi>a very narrow compaſs</hi>; and in the interim the United States will, in all probability, find it convenient to abſtain wholly from thoſe objects to which the particular ſtates would be inclined to reſort.</p>
                     <p>To form a more preciſe judgment of the true merits of this queſtion, it will be we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l to advert to the proportion between the objects that will require a federal proviſion in reſpect to revenue; and thoſe which will require a ſtate proviſion. We ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that the former are altogether unlimited; and that the latter are circumſcribed within very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bounds. In purſuing this inquiry, we muſt bear in mind, that we are not to confine our view to the preſent period, but to look forward to remote futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Conſtitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a calculation of exiſting exigencies; but upon a combination of theſe, with the probable exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of ages, according to the natural and tried courſe of human affairs. Nothing therefore can be more fallacious, than to infer the extent of any power proper to be lodged in the national government, from an eſtimate of its immediate neceſſities. There ought to be a CAPACITY to provide for future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, as they may happen; and as theſe are illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in their nature, ſo it is impoſſible ſafely to limit that capacity. It is true perhaps that a computation might be made, with ſufficient accuracy to anſwer the purpoſe, of the quantity of revenue requiſite to diſcharge the ſubſiſting engagements of the union, and to maintain thoſe eſtabliſhments, which for ſome time to come, would ſuffice in time of peace. But would it be wiſe, or would it not rather be the extreme of folly to ſtop at this point, and to leave the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intruſted with the care of the national defence,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:021127_0213_0FB23DE211A47AC0"/>
in a ſtate of abſolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the community, againſt future invaſions of the public peace by foreign war or domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions? If we muſt be obliged to exceed this point, where can we ſtop ſhort of an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they may ariſe? Though it be eaſy to aſſert, in general terms, the poſſibility of forming a rational judgment of a due proviſion againſt probable dangers; yet we may ſafely challenge thoſe who make the aſſertion to bring forward their data, and may affirm that they would be found as vague and uncertain as any that could be produced to eſtabliſh the probable duration of the world. Obſervations confined to the mere proſpects of internal attacks can deſerve no weight, though even theſe will admit of no ſatisfactory calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: But if we mean to be a commercial people, it muſt form a part of our policy to be able one day to defend that commerce. The ſupport of a navy, and of naval wars, would involve contingencies that muſt baffle all the efforts of political arithmetic.</p>
                     <p>Admitting that we ought to try the novel and abſurd experiment in politics, of tying up the hands of government from offenſive war founded upon reaſons of ſtate: Yet, certainly we ought not to diſable it from guarding the community againſt the ambition or enmity of other nations. A cloud has been for ſome time hanging over the European world. If it ſhould break forth into a ſtorm, who can inſure us that in its progreſs a part of its fury would not be ſpent upon us? No reaſonable man would haſtily pronounce that we are entirely out of its reach. Or if the combuſtible materials that now ſeem to be collecting, ſhould be diſſipated without coming to maturity; or if a flame ſhould be kindled without extending to us, what ſecurity can we have that our tranquility will long remain undiſturbed from ſome other cauſe, or from ſome other quarter? Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:021127_0214_0FB23DE3856FE050"/>
left to our option; that however moderate or unam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious we may be, we cannot count upon the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or hope to extinguiſh the ambition of others. Who could have imagined, at the concluſion of the laſt war, that France and Britain, wearied and exhauſted as they both were, would ſo ſoon have looked with ſo hoſtile an aſpect upon each other? To judge from the hiſtory of mankind we ſhall be compelled to conclude, that the fiery and deſtructive paſſions of war reign in the human breaſt with much more powerful ſway, than the mild and beneficent ſentiments of peace; and that to model our political ſyſtems upon ſpeculations of laſting tranquility, would be to calculate on the weaker ſprings of the human character.</p>
                     <p>What are the chief ſources of expence in every government? What has occaſioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which ſeveral of the European nations are oppreſſed? The anſwer plainly is, wars and rebellions, the ſupport of thoſe inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are neceſſary to guard the body politic againſt theſe two moſt mortal diſeaſes of ſociety. The expences ariſing from thoſe inſtitutions which are relative to the mere domeſtic police of a ſtate, to the ſupport of its legiſlative, executive and judiciary departments, with their different appendages, and to the encouragement of agriculture and manufactures, (which will comprehend almoſt all the objects of ſtate expenditure) are inſignificant in compariſon with thoſe which relate to the national defence.</p>
                     <p>In the kingdom of Great-Britain, where all the oſtentatious apparatus of monarchy is to be provided for, not above a fifteenth part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the claſs of expences laſt mentioned; the other fourteen fifteenths are abſorbed in the payment of the intereſt of debts, contracted for carrying on the wars in which that country has been engaged, and in the maintenance of fleets and armies. If on the one hand it ſhould be obſerved that the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:021127_0215_0FB23DE70DC12610"/>
expences incurred in the proſecution of the ambitious enterprizes and vain-glorious purſuits of a monarchy, are not a proper ſtandard by which to judge of thoſe which might be neceſſary in a republic; it ought on the other hand to be remarked, that there ſhould be as great a diſproportion, between the profuſion and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of a wealthy kingdom in its domeſtic admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and the frugality and economy, which, in that particular, become the modeſt ſimplicity of republican government. If we balance a proper deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from one ſide againſt that which it is ſuppoſed ought to be made from the other, the proportion may ſtill be conſidered as holding good.</p>
                     <p>But let us take a view of the large debt which we have ourſelves contracted in a ſingle war, and let us only calculate on a common ſhare of the events which diſturb the peace of nations, and we ſhall inſtantly perceive without the aid of any elaborate illuſtration, that there muſt always be an immenſe diſproportion between the objects of federal and ſtate expenditure. It is true that ſeveral of the ſtates ſeparately are incumbered with conſiderable debts, which are an excreſcence of the late war. But this cannot happen again if the propoſed ſyſtem be adopted; and when theſe debts are diſcharged, the only call for revenue of any conſequence, which the ſtate governments will continue to experience, will be for the mere ſupport of their reſpective civil liſts; to which, if we add all contingencies, the total amount in every ſtate, ought not to exceed two hundred thouſand pounds.</p>
                     <p>If it cannot be denied to be a juſt principle, that in framing a conſtitution of government for a nation, we ought in thoſe proviſions which are deſigned to be permanent, to calculate not on temporary but on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent cauſes of expence; our attention would be directed to a proviſion in favor of the ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for an annual ſum of about 200,00<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> pounds; while the exigencies of the union could be ſuſceptible of no limits, even in imagination. In this view of
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:021127_0216_0FB23DE805800CF0"/>
the ſubject by what logic can it be maintained, that the local governments ought to command in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, an <hi>excluſive</hi> ſource of revenue for any ſum beyond the extent of 200,000 pounds? To extend its power further, in <hi>excluſion</hi> of the authority of the union, would be to take the reſources of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity out of thoſe hands which ſtood in need of them for the public welfare, in order to put them into other hands, which could have no juſt or proper occaſion for them.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe then the convention had been inclined to proceed upon the principle of a repartition of the objects of revenue between the union and its members, in <hi>proportion</hi> to their comparitive neceſſities; what particular fund could have been ſelected for the uſe of the ſtates, that would not either have been too much or too little; too little for their preſent, too much for their future wants? As to the line of ſeparation between external and internal taxes, this would leave to the ſtates, at a rough computation, the command of two-thirds of the reſources of the community to defray from a tenth to a twentieth of its expences; and to the union, one third of the reſources of the community, to defray from nine tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expences. If we deſert this boundary, and content ourſelves with leaving to the ſtates an excluſive power of taxing houſes and lands, there would ſtill be a great diſproportion between the <hi>means</hi> and the <hi>end</hi>; the poſſeſſion of one third of the reſources of the community, to ſupply at moſt one tenth of its wants. If any fund could have been ſelected and appropriated equal to and not greater than the object, it would have been inadequate to the diſcharge of the exiſting debts of the particular ſtates, and would have left them dependent on the union for a proviſion for this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The preceding train of obſervations will juſtify the poſition which has been elſewhere laid down, that,
<q>A CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in the article of
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:021127_0217_0FB23DE985C74368"/>
taxation, was the only admiſſible ſubſtitute for an entire ſubordination, in reſpect to this branch of power, of ſtate authority to that of the union.</q>
Any ſeparation of the objects of revenue that could have been fallen upon, would have amounted to a ſacrifice of the great INTERESTS of the union to the POWER of the individual ſtates. The convention thought the concurrent juriſdiction preferable to that ſubordination; and it is evident that it has at leaſt the merit of reconciling an indefinite conſtitutional power of taxation in the federal government, with an adequate and independent power in the ſtates to provide for their own neceſſities. There remain a few other lights, in which this important ſubject of taxation will claim a further conſideration.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XXXV. The ſame Subject continued.</head>
                     <p>BEFORE we proceed to examine any other objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to an indefinite power of taxation in the union, I ſhall make one general remark; which is, that if the juriſdiction of the national government in the article of revenue ſhould be reſtricted to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular objects, it would naturally occaſion an undue proportion of the public burthens to fall upon thoſe objects. Two evils would ſpring from this ſource, the oppreſſion of particular branches of induſtry, and an unequal diſtribution of the taxes, as well among the ſeveral ſtates as among the citizens of the ſame ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe, as has been contended for, the federal power of taxation were to be confined to duties on imports, it is evident that the government, for want
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:021127_0218_0FB23DEB05592BD0"/>
of being able to command other reſources, would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be tempted to extend theſe duties to an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious exceſs. There are perſons who imagine that this can never be the caſe; ſince the higher they are, the more it is alledged they will tend to diſcourage an extravagant conſumption, to produce a favorable balance of trade, and to promote domeſtic manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. But all extremes are prenicious in various ways. Exorbitant duties on imported articles ſerve to beget a general ſpirit of ſmuggling; which is always prejudicial to the fair trader, and eventually to the revenue itſelf: They tend to render other claſſes of the community tributary in an improper degree to the manufacturing claſſes to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets: They ſometimes force induſtry out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with leſs advantage. And in the laſt place they oppreſs the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them himſelf without any retribution from the conſumer. When the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market, the conſumer generally pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be overſtocked, a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and ſometimes not only exhauſts his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to think that a diviſion of the duty between the ſeller and the buyer more often happens than is commonly imagined. It is not always poſſible to raiſe the price of a commodity, in exact proportion to every additional impoſition laid upon it. The merchant, eſpecially in a country of ſmall commercial capital, is often under a neceſſity of keeping prices down, in order to a more expeditious ſale.</p>
                     <p>The maxim that the conſumer is the payer, is ſo much oftener true than the reverſe of the propoſition, that it is far more equitable the duties on imports ſhould go into a common ſtock, than that they ſhould redound to the excluſive benefit of the importing ſtates. But it is not ſo generally true as to render
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:021127_0219_0FB23DEC866FB480"/>
it equitable that thoſe duties ſhould form the only national fund. When they are paid by the merchant, they operate as an additional tax upon the importing ſtate; whoſe citizens pay their proportion of them in the character of conſumers. In this view they are productive of inequality among the ſtates; which inequality would be increaſed with the increaſed extent of the duties. The confinement of the national revenues to this ſpecies of impoſts, would be attended with inequality, from a different cauſe, between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing ſtates. The ſtates which can go furtheſt towards the ſupply of their own wants, by their own manufactures, will not, according to their numbers or wealth, conſume ſo great a proportion of imported articles, as thoſe ſtates which are not in the ſame favourable ſituation; they would not therefore in this mode alone contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the public treaſury in a ratio to their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. To make them do this, it is neceſſary that recourſe be had to exciſes; the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures. New-York is more deeply intereſted in theſe conſiderations than ſuch of her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the union to external taxation may be aware of. New-York is an importing ſtate, and from a greater diſproportion between her population and territory, is leſs likely, than ſome other ſtates, ſpeedily to become in any conſiderable degree a manuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cturing ſtate. She would of courſe ſuffer in a double light from reſtraining the juriſdiction of the union to commercial impoſts.</p>
                     <p>So far as theſe obſervations tend to inculcate a danger of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be obſerved, conformably to a remark made in another part of theſe papers, that the intereſt of the revenue itſelf would be a ſufficient guard againſt ſuch an extreme. I readily admit that this would be the caſe as long as other reſources were open; but if the avenues to them were cloſed, HOPE,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:021127_0220_0FB23DEE069E6D70"/>
ſtimulated by neceſſity, might beget experiments for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by rigorous precautions and additional penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which for a time might have the intended effect, till there had been leiſure to contrive expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients to elude theſe new precautions. The firſt ſucceſs would be apt to inſpire falſe opinions; which it might require a long courſe of ſubſequent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to correct. Neceſſity, eſpecially in politics, often occaſions falſe hopes, falſe reaſonings and a ſyſtem of meaſures, correſpondently erroneous. But even if this ſuppoſed exceſs ſhould not be a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the limitation of the federal power of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the inequalities ſpoken of would ſtill enſue, though not in the ſame degree, from the other cauſes that have been noticed. Let us now return to the examination of objections.</p>
                     <p>One which, if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition, ſeems moſt to be relied on, is that the houſe of repreſentatives is not ſufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different claſſes of citizens; in order to combine the intereſts and feelings of every part of the community, and to produce a true ſympathy between the repreſentative body and its conſtituents. This argument preſents itſelf under a very ſpecious and ſeducing form; and is well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of thoſe to whom it is addreſſed. But when we come to diſſect it with attention, it will appear to be made up of nothing but fair ſounding words. The object it ſeems to aim at is in the firſt place impracticable, and in the ſenſe in which it is contended for is unneceſſary. I reſerve for another place the diſcuſſion of the queſtion which relates to the ſufficiency of the repreſentative body in reſpect to numbers; and ſhall content myſelf with examining here the particular uſe which has been made of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſuppoſition in reference to the immediate ſubject of our inquiries.</p>
                     <p>The idea of an actual repreſentation of all claſſes of the people by perſons of each claſs is altogether
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:021127_0221_0FB23DF111239E78"/>
viſionary. Unleſs it were expreſsly provided in the conſtitution that each different occupation ſhould ſend one or more members, the thing would never take place in practice. Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined with few exceptions to give their votes to merchants in preference to perſons of their own profeſſions or trades. Thoſe diſcerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing arts furniſh the materials of mercantile enterpriſe and induſtry. Many of them indeed are immediately connected with the operations of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. They know that the merchant is their natural patron and friend; and they are aware that however great the confidence they may juſtly feel in their own good ſenſe, their intereſts can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by themſelves. They are ſenſible that their habits in life have not been ſuch as to give them thoſe acquired endowments, without which in a deliberative aſſembly the greateſt natural abilities are for the moſt part uſeleſs; and that the influence and weight and ſuperior acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the merchants, render them more equal to a conteſt with any ſpirit which might happen to infuſe itſelf into the public councils unfriendly to the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing and trading intereſts. Theſe conſiderations, and many others that might be mentioned, prove, and experience confirms it, that artizans and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, will commonly be diſpoſed to beſtow their votes upon merchants and thoſe whom they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. We muſt therefore conſider merchants as the natural repreſentatives of all theſe claſſes of the community.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the learned profeſſions, little need be obſerved; they truly form no diſtinct intereſt in ſociety; and according to their ſituation and talents will be indiſcriminately the objects of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and choice of each other, and of other parts of the community.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="unknown:021127_0222_0FB23DF288B7EF00"/>Nothing remains but the landed intereſt; and this in a political view, and particularly in relation to taxes I take to be perfectly united from the wealthieſt landlord to the pooreſt tenant. No tax can be laid on land which will not affect the propietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a ſingle acre. Every land-holder will therefore have a common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to keep the taxes on land as low as poſſible; and common intereſt may always be reckoned upon as the ſureſt bond of ſympathy. But if we even could ſuppoſe a diſtinction of intereſt between the opulent land-holder and the middling farmer, what reaſon is there to conclude that the firſt would ſtand a better chance of being deputed to the national legiſlature than the laſt? If we take fact as our guide, and look into our own ſenate and aſſembly we ſhall find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both; nor is this leſs the caſe in the ſenate, which conſiſts of a ſmaller number than in the aſſembly, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a greater number. Where the qualifications of the electors are the ſame, whether they have to chooſe a ſmall or a large number their votes will fall upon thoſe in whom they have moſt confidence; whether theſe happen to be men of large fortunes or of moderate property or of no property at all.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid to be neceſſary that all claſſes of citizens ſhould have ſome of their own number in the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative body, in order that their feelings and intereſts may be the better underſtood and attended to. But we have ſeen that this will never happen under any arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free. Where this is the caſe, the repreſentative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence on the ſpirit of the government will be compoſed of land-holders, merchants, and men of the learned profeſſions. But where is the danger that the intereſts and feelings of the different claſſes of citizens will not be underſtood or attended to by theſe three deſcriptions of men? Will not the land-holder know and feel whatever will
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:021127_0223_0FB23DF408976AC8"/>
promote or injure the intereſts of landed property? and will he not from his own intereſt in that ſpecies of property be ſufficiently prone to reſiſt every attempt to prejudice or encumber it? Will not the merchant underſtand and be diſpoſed to cultivate as far as may be proper the intereſts of the mechanic and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing arts to which his commerce is ſo nearly allied? Will not the man of the learned profeſſion, who will feel a neutrality to the rivalſhips between the different branches of induſtry, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them, ready to promote either, ſo far as it ſhall appear to him conducive to the general intereſts of the ſociety?</p>
                     <p>If we take into the account the momentary humours or diſpoſitions which may happen to prevail in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parts of the ſociety, and to which a wiſe admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration will never be inattentive, is the man whoſe ſituation leads to extenſive inquiry and information leſs likely to be a competent judge of their nature, extent and foundation than one whoſe obſervation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbours and acquaintances? Is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favour of the people, and who is dependent on the ſuffrages of his fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors ſhould take care to inform himſelf of their diſpoſitions and inclinations and ſhould be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct. This dependence, and the neceſſity of being bound himſelf and his poſterity by the laws to which he gives his aſſent are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and they are the ſtrong chords of ſympathy between the repreſentative and the conſtituent.</p>
                     <p>There is no part of the adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that requires extenſive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of political economy ſo much as the buſineſs of taxation. The man who underſtands thoſe principles beſt will be leaſt likely to reſort to oppreſſive expedients, or to ſacrifice any particular claſs of citizens to the procurement of

revenue. It might be demonſtrated that the moſt productive ſyſtem of finance will always be the leaſt burthenſome. There can be no doubt that in order to a judicious exerciſe of the power of taxation, it is neceſſary that the perſon in whoſe hands it is ſhould be acquainted with the general genius, habits and modes of thinking of the people at large and with the reſources of the country. And this is all that can be reaſonably meant by a knowledge of the intereſts and feelings of the people. In any other ſenſe the propoſition has either no meaning, or an abſurd one. And in that ſenſe let every conſiderate citizen judge for himſelf where the requiſite qualification is moſt likely to be found.</p>

If it ſhould be objected that we have ſeen other deſcriptions of men in the local legiſlatures; I anſwer, that it is admitted there are exceptions to the rule, but not in ſufficient number to influence the general complexion or character of the government. There are ſtrong minds in every walk of life that will riſe ſuperior to the diſadvantages of ſituation, and will command the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:021127_0225_0FB23DF709DE7570"/>
tribute due to their merit, not only from the claſſes to which they particularly belong, but from the ſociety in general. The door ought to be equally open to all; and I truſt, for the credit of human nature, that we ſhall ſee examples of ſuch vigorous plants flouriſhing in the ſoil of federal, as well as of ſtate legiſlation; but occaſional inſtances of this ſort, will not render the reaſoning founded upon the general courſe of things leſs concluſive.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject might be placed in ſeveral other lights that would lead all to the ſame reſult; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular it might be aſked, what greater affinity or relation of intereſt can be conceived between the carpenter and blackſmith, and the linen manufacturer or ſtocking weaver, than between the merchant and either of them? It is notorious, that there are often as great rivalſhips between different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts, as there are between any of the departments of labour and induſtry; ſo that unleſs the repreſentative body were to be far more numerous than would be conſiſtent with any idea of regularity or wiſdom in its deliberations, it is impoſſible that what ſeems to be the ſpirit of the objection we have been conſidering, ſhould ever be realiſed in practice. But I forbear to dwell longer on a matter, which has hitherto worn too looſe a garb to admit even of an accurate inſpection of its real ſhape or tendency.</p>
                     <p>There is another objection of a ſomewhat more preciſe nature which claims our attention. It has been aſſerted that a power of internal taxation in the national legiſlature could never be exerciſed with advantage, as well from the want of a ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of local circumſtances as from an interference between the revenue laws of the union and of the particular ſtates. The ſuppoſition of a want of proper knowledge, ſeems to be entirely deſtitute of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If any queſtion is depending in a ſtate legiſlature reſpecting one of the counties which demands a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of local details, how is it acquired? No doubt
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:021127_0226_0FB23DF888C4D3C8"/>
from the information of the members of the county. Cannot the like knowledge be obtained in the national legiſlature from the repreſentatives of each ſtate? And is it not to be preſumed that the men who will generally be ſent there, will be poſſeſſed of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary degree of intelligence, to be able to communicate that information? Is the knowledge of local circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as applied to taxation, a minute topographical acquaintance with all the mountains, rivers, ſtreams, highways and bye-paths in each ſtate, or is it a general acquaintance with its ſituation and reſources—with the ſtate of its agriculture, commerce, manufactures— with the nature of its products and conſumptions— with the different degrees and kinds of its wealth, property and induſtry?</p>
                     <p>Nations in general, even under governments of the more popular kind, uſually commit the adminiſtration of their finances to ſingle men, or to boards compoſed of a few individuals, who digeſt and prepare, in the firſt inſtance, the plans of taxation; which are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paſſed into laws by the authority of the ſovereign or legiſlature. Inquiſitive and enlightened ſtateſmen are every where deemed beſt qualified to make a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſelection of the objects proper for revenue; which is a clear indication, as far as the ſenſe of mankind can have weight in the queſtion, of the ſpecies of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of local circumſtances requiſite to the purpoſes of taxation.</p>
                     <p>The taxes intended to be compriſed under the general denomination of internal taxe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into thoſe of the <hi>direct</hi> and thoſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the <hi>indirect</hi> kind. Though the objection be made to both, yet the reaſoning upon it ſeems to be confined to the former branch. And indeed as to the latter, by which muſt be underſtood duties and exciſes on articles of conſumption, one is at a loſs to conceive what can be the nature of the difficulties apprehended. The knowledge relating to them, muſt evidently be of a kind that will either be ſuggeſted by the nature of the
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:021127_0227_0FB23DFA03FC6A90"/>
article itſelf, or can eaſily be procured from any well informed man, eſpecially of the mercantile claſs. The circumſtances that may diſtinguiſh its ſituation in one ſtate from its ſituation in another, muſt be few, ſimple, and eaſy to be comprehended. The principal thing to be attended to would be to avoid thoſe articles which had been previouſly appropriated to the uſe of a particular ſtate; and there could be no difficulty in aſcertaining the revenue ſyſtem of each. This could always be known from the reſpective codes of laws, as well as from the information of the members of the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
                     <p>The objection when applied to real property, or to houſes and lands, appears to have, at firſt ſight, more foundation; but even in this view, it will not bear a cloſe examination. Land taxes are commonly laid in one of two modes, either by <hi>actual</hi> valuations perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or periodical, or by occaſional aſſeſſments, at the diſcretion or according to the beſt judgment of certain officers, whoſe duty it is to make them.—In either caſe the EXECUTION of the buſineſs, which alone requires the knowledge of local details, muſt be devolved upon diſcreet perſons in the character of commiſſioners or aſſeſſors, elected by the people or appointed by the government for the purpoſe. All that the law can do muſt be to name the perſons, or to preſcribe the manner of their election or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to fix their numbers and qualifications; and to draw the general outlines of their powers and duties. And what is there in all this, that cannot as well be performed by the national legiſlature as by a ſtate legiſlature? The attention of either can only reach to general principles; local details, as already obſerved, muſt be referred to thoſe who are to execute the plan.</p>
                     <p>But there is a ſimple point of view in which this matter may be placed, that muſt be altogether ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. The national legiſlature can make uſe of the <hi>ſyſtem of each ſtate within that ſtate.</hi> The method of laying and collecting this ſpecies of taxes in each ſtate,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:021127_0228_0FB23DFB863877E0"/>
can, in all its parts, be adopted and employed by the federal government.</p>
                     <p>Let it be recollected, that the proportion of theſe taxes is not to be left to the diſcretion of the national legiſlature: but is to be determined by the numbers of each ſtate, as deſcribed in the ſecond ſection of the firſt article. An actual cenſus or enumeration of the people muſt furniſh the rule; a circumſtance which effectually ſhuts the door to partiality or oppreſſion. The abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of this power of taxation ſeems to have been provided againſt with guarded circumſpection. In addition to the precaution juſt mentioned, there is a proviſion that
<q>all duties, impoſts, and exciſes, ſhall be UNIFORM throughout the United States.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It has been very properly obſerved by different ſpeakers and writers on the ſide of the conſtitution, that if the exerciſe of the power of internal taxation by the union, ſhould be judged beforehand upon mature conſideration, or ſhould be diſcovered on expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, to be really inconvenient, the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may forbear the uſe of it, and have recourſe to requiſitions in its ſtead. By way of anſwer to this, it has been triumphantly aſked, why not in the firſt inſtance omit that ambiguous power and rely upon the latter reſource? Two ſolid anſwers may be given; the firſt is, that the actual exerciſe of the power, may be found both <hi>convenient</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi>; for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prove in theory or otherwiſe, than by the experiment that it cannot be advantageouſly exerciſed. The contrary indeed appears moſt probable. The ſecond anſwer is, that the exiſtence of ſuch a power in the conſtitution, will have a ſtrong influence in giving efficacy to requiſitions. When the ſtates know that the union can ſupply itſelf without their agency, it will be a powerful motive for exertion on their part.</p>
                     <p>As to the interference of the revenue laws of the union, and of its members; we have already ſeen that there can be no claſhing or repugnancy of authority. The laws cannot therefore in a legal ſenſe, interfere
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:021127_0229_0FB23DFD04460268"/>
with each other; and it is far from impoſſible to avoid an interference even in the policy of their different ſyſtems. An effectual expedient for this purpoſe will be mutually to abſtain from thoſe objects, which either ſide may have firſt had recourſe to. As neither can <hi>controul</hi> the other, each will have an obvious and ſenſible intereſt in this reciprocal forbearance. And where there is an <hi>immediate</hi> common intereſt, we may ſafely count upon its operation. When the particular debts of the ſtates are done away, and their expences come to be limited within their natural compaſs, the poſſibility almoſt of interference will vaniſh. A ſmall land tax will anſwer the purpoſes of the ſtates, and will be their moſt ſimple and moſt fit reſource.</p>
                     <p>Many ſpectres have been raiſed out of this power of internal taxation, to excite the apprehenſions of the people—double ſets of revenue officers—a dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their burthens by double taxations, and the frightful forms of odious and oppreſſive poll-taxes, have been played off with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt point, there are two caſes in which there can be no room for double ſets of officers; one where the right of impoſing the tax is excluſively veſted in the union, which applies to the duties on imports; the other, where the object has not fallen under any ſtate regulation or proviſion, which may be applicable to a variety of objects. In other caſes, the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is, that the United States will either wholly abſtain from the objects pre-occupied for local purpoſes, or will make uſe of the ſtate officers and ſtate regulations, for collecting the additional impoſition. This will beſt anſwer the views of revenue, becauſe it will ſave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the collection, and will beſt avoid any occaſion of diſguſt to the ſtate governments and to the people. At all events, here is a practicable expedient for avoiding ſuch an inconvenience; and nothing more can be required than to ſhow that evils predicted do not neceſſarily reſult from the plan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="225" facs="unknown:021127_0230_0FB23DFE83F78890"/>As to any argument derived from a ſuppoſed ſyſtem of influence, it is a ſufficient anſwer to ſay, that it ought not to be preſumed; but the ſuppoſition is ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of a more preciſe anſwer. If ſuch a ſpirit ſhould infeſt the councils of the union, the moſt certain road to the accompliſhment of its aim would be to employ the ſtate officers as much as poſſible, and to attach them to the union by an accumulation of their emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments. This would ſerve to turn the tide of ſtate influence into the channels of the national government, inſtead of making federal influence flow in an oppoſite and adverſe current. But all ſuppoſitions of this kind are invidious, and ought to be baniſhed from the conſideration of the great queſtion before the people. They can anſwer no other end than to caſt a miſt over the truth.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſuggeſtion of double taxation, the anſwer is plain. The wants of the union are to be ſupplied in one way or another; if to be done by the authority of the federal government, it will not be to be done by that of the ſtate governments. The quantity of taxes to be paid by the community, muſt be the ſame in either caſe; with this advantage, if the proviſion is to be made by the union, that the capital reſource of commercial impoſts, which is the moſt convenient branch of revenue, can be prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under ſtate regulation, and of courſe will render it leſs neceſſary to recur to more inconvenient methods; and with this further advantage, that as far as there may be any real difficulty in the exerciſe of the power of internal taxation, it will impoſe a diſpoſition to greater care in the choice and arrangement of the means; and muſt naturally tend to make it a fixed point of policy in the national adminiſtration to go as far as may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the public treaſury, in order to diminiſh the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of thoſe impoſitions, which might create diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the poorer and moſt numerous claſſes of the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:021127_0231_0FB23E0004923A20"/>
ſociety. Happy it is when the intereſt which the government has in the preſervation of its own power, coincides with a proper diſtribution of the public burthens, and tends to guard the leaſt wealthy part of the community from oppreſſion!</p>
                     <p>As to poll taxes, I, without ſcruple, confeſs my diſapprobation of them; and though they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed from an early period in thoſe ſtates<note n="*" place="bottom">The New-England ſtates.</note> which have uniformly been the moſt tenacious of their rights, I ſhould lament to ſee them introduced into practice under the national government. But does it follow, becauſe there is a power to lay them, that they will actually be laid? Every ſtate in the union has power to impoſe taxes of this kind; and yet in ſeveral of them they are unknown in practice. Are the ſtate governments to be ſtigmatiſed as tyrannies becauſe they poſſeſs this power? If they are not, with what propriety can the like power juſtify ſuch a charge againſt the national government, or even be urged as an obſtacle to its adoption? As little friendly as I am to the ſpecies of impoſition, I ſtill feel a thorough conviction, that the power of having recourſe to it, ought to exiſt in the federal government. There are certain emergencies of nations, in which expedients that in the ordinary ſtate of things ought to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, become eſſential to the public weal. And the government from the poſſibility of ſuch emergencies ought ever to have the option of making uſe of them. The real ſcarcity of objects in this country, which may be conſidered as productive ſources of revenue, is a reaſon peculiar to itſelf, for not abridging the diſcretion of the national councils in this reſpect. There may exiſt certain critical and tempeſtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures of the ſtate, in which a poll tax may become an ineſtimable reſource. And as I know nothing to exempt this portion of the globe from the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that have befallen other parts of it, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my averſion to every project that is calculated
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:021127_0232_0FB23E01856879C8"/>
to diſarm the government of a ſingle weapon, which in any poſſible contingency might be uſefully employed for the general defence and ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>I have now gone through the examination of thoſe powers propoſed to be conferred upon the federal government; which relate more peculiarly to its energy, and to its efficiency for anſwering the great and primary objects of union. There are others, which though omitted here, will in order to render the view of the ſubject more complete, be taken notice of under the next head of our enquiries. I flatter myſelf the progreſs already made will have ſufficed to ſatisfy the candid and judicious part of the community, that ſome of the objections which have been moſt ſtrenuouſly urged againſt the conſtitution, and which were moſt formidable in their firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are not only deſtitute of ſubſtance, but if they had operated in the formation of the plan, would have rendered it incompetent to the great ends of public happineſs and national proſperity. I equally flatter myſelf that a further and more critical inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſyſtem will ſerve to recommend it ſtill more to every ſincere and diſintereſted advocate for good government; and will leave no doubt with men of this character of the propriety and expediency of adopting it. Happy will it be for ourſelves, and moſt honorable for human nature, if we have wiſdom and virtue enough, to ſet ſo glorious an example to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind!</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XXXVII. Concerning the Difficulties which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention muſt have experienced in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a proper Plan.</head>
                     <p>IN reviewing the defects of the exiſting confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſhewing that they cannot be ſupplied by a government of leſs energy than that before the public, ſeveral of the moſt important principles of the latter fell of courſe under conſideration. But as the ultimate object of theſe papers is to determine clearly and fully the merits of this conſtitution, and the expediency of adopting it, our plan cannot be compleated without taking a more critical and thorough ſurvey of the work of the convention; without examining it on all its ſides; comparing it in all its parts, and calculating its probable effects. That this remaining taſk may be executed under impreſſions conducive to a juſt and fair reſult, ſome reflections muſt in this place be indulged, which candour previouſly ſuggeſts. It is a misfortune, inſeparable from human affairs, that public meaſures
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:021127_0239_0FB23E0C04008170"/>
are rarely inveſtigated with that ſpirit of moderation which is eſſential to a juſt eſtimate of their real ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to advance or obſtruct the public good; and that this ſpirit is more apt to be diminiſhed than promoted, by thoſe occaſions which require an unuſual exerciſe of it. To thoſe who have been led by experience to attend to this conſideration, it could not appear ſurpriſing, that the act of the convention which recommends ſo many important changes and innovations, which may be viewed in ſo many lights and relations, and which touches the ſprings of ſo many paſſions and intereſts, ſhould find or excite diſpoſitions unfriendly both on one ſide, and on the other, to a fair diſcuſſion and accurate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its merits. In ſome, it has been too evident from their own publications, that they have ſcanned the propoſed conſtitution, not only with a prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to cenſure; but with a predetermination to condemn: As the language held by others betrays an oppoſite predetermination or bias, which muſt render their opinions alſo of little moment in the queſtion. In placing however, theſe different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters on a level, with reſpect to the weight of their opinions, I wiſh not to inſinuate that there may not be a material difference in the purity of their intentions. It is but juſt to remark in favor of the latter deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as our ſituation is univerſally admitted to be peculiarly critical, and to require indiſpenſibly, that ſomething ſhould be done for our relief, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined patron of what has been actually done, may have taken his bias from the weight of theſe conſiderations, as well as from conſiderations of a ſiniſter nature. The predetermined adverſary on the other hand, can have been governed by no venial motive whatever. The intentions of the firſt may be upright, as they may on the contrary be culpable. The views of the laſt cannot be upright, and muſt be culpable. But the truth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, that theſe papers are not addreſſed to perſons falling under either of theſe
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:021127_0240_0FB23E0D848FD0F0"/>
characters. They ſolicit the attention of thoſe only, who add to a ſincere zeal for the happineſs of their country, a temper favorable to a juſt eſtimate of the means of promoting it.</p>
                     <p>Perſons of this character will proceed to an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the plan ſubmitted by the convention, not only without a diſpoſition to find or to magnify faults; but will ſee the propriety of reflecting that a faultleſs plan was not to be expected. Nor will they barely make allowances for the errors which may be chargeable on the fallibility to which the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a body of men, were liable; but will keep in mind that they themſelves alſo are but men, and ought not to aſſume an infallibility in rejudging the fallible opinions of others.</p>
                     <p>With equal readineſs will it be perceived, that beſides theſe inducements to candour, many allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ought to be made for the difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to the convention.</p>
                     <p>The novelty of the undertaking immediately ſtrikes us. It has been ſhewn in the courſe of theſe papers, that the exiſting confederation is founded on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which are fallacious; that we muſt conſequently change this firſt foundation, and with it, the ſuper-ſtructure reſting upon it. It has been ſhewn, that the other confederacies which could be conſulted as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, have been viciated by the ſame erroneous principles, and can therefore furniſh no other light than that of beacons, which give warning of the courſe to be ſhunned, without pointing out that which ought to be purſued. The moſt that the convention could do in ſuch a ſituation, was to avoid the errors ſuggeſted by the paſt experience of other countries, as well as of our own; and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors, as future expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may unfold them.</p>
                     <p>Among the difficulties encountered by the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a very important one muſt have lain, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021127_0241_0FB23E0F03647820"/>
the requiſite ſtability and energy in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the inviolable attention due to liberty, and to the republican form. Without ſubſtantially accompliſhing this part of their undertaking, they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment, or the expectation of the public: Yet, that it could not be eaſily accompliſhed, will be denied by no one, who is unwilling to betray his ignorance of the ſubject. Energy in government is eſſential to that ſecurity againſt external and internal danger, and to that prompt and ſalutary execution of the laws, which enter into the very definition of good government. Stability in government, is eſſential to national character, and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to that repoſe and confidence in the minds of the people, which are among the chief bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of civil ſociety. An irregular and mutable legiſlation is not more an evil in itſelf, than it is odious to the people; and it may be pronounced with aſſurance, that the people of this country, enlightened as they are, with regard to the nature, and intereſted, as the great body of them are, in the effects of good government will never be ſatisfied, till ſome remedy be applied to the viciſſitudes and uncertainties, which characterize the ſtate admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. On comparing, however theſe valuable ingredients with the vital principles of liberty, we muſt perceive at once, the difficulty of mingling them together in their due prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rtions. The genius of republican liberty, ſeems to demand on one ſide, not only, that all power ſhould be derived from the people; but, that thoſe entruſted with it ſhould be kept in dependence on the people, by a ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their appointments; and, that, even during this ſhort period, the truſt ſhould be placed not in a few, but in a number of hands. Stability, on the contrary, requires, that the hands, in which power is lodged, ſhould continue for a length of time the ſame. A frequent change of men will reſult from a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021127_0242_0FB23E108326EA50"/>
frequent return of electors, and a frequent change of meaſures, from a frequent change of men; whilſt energy in government requires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it by a ſingle hand. How far the convention may have ſucceeded in this part of their work, will better appear on a more accurate view of it. From the curſory view, here taken, it muſt clearly appear to have been an arduous part.</p>
                     <p>Not leſs arduous moſt have been the taſk of mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper line of partition, between the authority of the general, and that of the ſtate governments. Every man will be ſenſible of this difficulty, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as he has been accuſtomed to contemplate and diſcriminate objects, extenſive and complicated in their nature. The faculties of the mind itſelf have never yet been diſtinguiſhed and defined, with ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory preciſion, by all the efforts of the moſt acute and metaphyſical philoſophers. Senſe, perception, judgment, deſire, volition, memory, imagination, are found to be ſeparated, by ſuch delicate ſhades and minute gradations, that their boundaries have eluded the moſt ſubtle inveſtigations, and remain a pregnant ſource of ingenious diſquiſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. The boundaries between the great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of nature, and ſtill more, between the various provinces, and leſſer portions, into which they are ſubdivided, afford another illuſtration of the ſame important truth. The moſt ſagacious and laborious naturaliſts have never yet ſucceeded, in tracing with certainty, the line which ſeparates the diſtrict of vegetable life from the neighbouring region of unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized matter, or which marks the termination of the former and the commencement of the animal empire. A ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll greater obſcurity lies in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctive characters, by which the objects in each of theſe great departments of nature have been arranged and aſſorted. When we paſs from the works of nature, in which all the delineations are perfectly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021127_0243_0FB23E1203FD8BA0"/>
accurate, and appear to be otherwiſe only from the imperfection of the eye which ſurveys them, to the inſtitutions of man, in which the obſcurity ariſes as well from the object itſelf, as from the organ by which it is contemplated; we muſt perceive the neceſſity of moderating ſtill farther our expectations and hopes from the efforts of human ſagacity. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has inſtructed us that no ſkill in the ſcience of government has yet been able to diſcriminate and define, with ſufficient certainty, its three great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the legiſlative, executive and judiciary; or even the privileges and powers of the different legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative branches. Queſtions daily occur in the courſe of practice, which prove the obſcurity which reigns in theſe ſubjects, and which puzzles the greateſt adepts in political ſcience. The experience of ages, with the continued and combined labors of the moſt enlightened legiſlators and juriſts, have been equally unſucceſsful in delineating the ſeveral objects and limits of different codes of laws and different tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals of juſtice. The preciſe extent of the common law, the ſtatute law, the maritime law, the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical law, the law of corporations and other local laws and cuſtoms, remain ſtill to be clearly and finally eſtabliſhed in Great Britain, where accuracy in ſuch ſubjects has been more induſtriouſly purſued than in any other part of the world. The juriſdiction of her ſeveral courts, general and local, of law, of equity, of admiralty, &amp;c. is not leſs a ſource of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and intricate diſcuſſions, ſufficiently denoting the indeterminate limits by which they are reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively circumſcribed. All new laws, though penned with the greateſt technical ſkill, and paſſed on the fulleſt and moſt mature deliberation, are conſidered as more or leſs obſcure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and aſcertained by a ſeries of particular diſcuſſions and adjudications. Beſides the obſcurity ariſing from the complexity of objects, and the imperfection of the human faculties, the medium
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021127_0244_0FB23E138560BD50"/>
through which the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other, adds a freſh embarraſment. The uſe of words is to expreſs ideas. Perſpicuity therefore requires not only that the ideas ſhould be diſtinctly formed, but that they ſhould be expreſſed by words diſtinctly and excluſively appropriated to them. But no language is ſo copious as to ſupply words and phraſes for every complex idea, or ſo correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas. Hence it muſt happen, that however accurately objects may be diſcriminated in themſelves, and however accurately the diſcrimination may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this unavoidable inaccuracy muſt be greater or leſs, according to the complexity and novelty of the objects defined. When the Almighty himſelf condeſcends to addreſs mankind in their own language, his meaning luminous as it muſt be, is rendered dim and doubtful, by the cloudy medium through which it is communicated. Here then are three ſources of vague and incorrect definitions; indiſtinctneſs of the object, imperfection of the organ of conception, inadequateneſs of the vehicle of ideas. Any one of theſe muſt produce a certain degree of obſcurity. The convention, in delineating the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary between the federal and ſtate juriſdictions, muſt have experienced the full effect of them all.</p>
                     <p>To the difficulties already mentioned, may be added the interfering pretenſions of the larger and ſmaller ſtates. We cannot err in ſuppoſing that the former would contend for a participation in the government, fully proportioned to their ſuperior wealth and importance; and that the latter would not be leſs tenacious of the equality at preſent enjoyed by them. We may well ſuppoſe that neither ſide would entirely yield to the other, and conſequently that the ſtruggle could be terminated only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe. It is extremely probable alſo, that after
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021127_0245_0FB23E150348DDB8"/>
the ratio of repreſentation had been adjuſted, this very compromiſe muſt have produced a freſh ſtruggle between the ſame parties, to give ſuch a turn to the organization of the government, and to the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of its powers, as would increaſe the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the branches, in forming which they had reſpectively obtained the greateſt ſhare of influence. There are features in the conſtitution which warrant each of theſe ſuppoſitions; and as far as either of them is well founded, it ſhews that the convention muſt have been compelled to ſacrifice theoretical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to the force of extraneous conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>Nor could it have been the large and ſmall ſtates only which would marſhal themſelves in oppoſition to each other on various poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s. Other combinations, reſulting from a difference of local poſition and policy, muſt have created additional difficulties. As every ſtate may be divided into different diſtricts, and its citizens into different claſſes, which give birth to contending intereſts and local jealouſies; ſo the different parts of the United States are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from each other, by a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which produce a like effect on a larger ſcale. And although this variety of intereſts, for reaſons ſufficiently explained in a former paper, may have a ſalutary influence on the adminiſtration of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when formed; yet every one muſt be ſenſible of the contrary influence which muſt have been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in the taſk of forming it.</p>
                     <p>Would it be wonderful if under the preſſure of all theſe difficulties, the convention ſhould have been forced into ſome deviations from that artificial ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and regular ſymmetry, which an abſtract view of the ſubject might lead an ingenious theoriſt to beſtow on a conſtitution planned in his cloſet or in his imagination? The real wonder is, that ſo many difficulties ſhould have been ſurmounted; and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted with an unanimity almoſt as unprecedented as it muſt have been unexpected. It is impoſſible for
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021127_0246_0FB23E168384B608"/>
any man of candor to reflect on this circumſtance, without partaking of the aſtoniſhment. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it, a finger of that Almighty Hand which has been ſo frequently and ſignally extended to our relief in the critical ſtages of the revolution. We had occaſion in a former paper, to take notice of the repeated trials which have been unſucceſsfully made in the United Netherlands, for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their conſtitution. The hiſtory of almoſt all the great councils and conſultations, held among mankind for reconciling their diſcordant opinions, aſſuaging their mutual jealouſies, and adjuſting their reſpective intereſts, is a hiſtory of factions, contentions and diſappointments; and may be claſſed among the moſt dark and degrading pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which diſplay the infirmities and depravities of the human character. If, in a few ſcattered inſtances, a brighter aſpect is preſented, they ſerve only as exceptions to admoniſh us of the general truth; and by their luſtre to darken the gloom of the adverſe proſpect to which they are contraſted. In revolving the cauſes from which theſe exceptions reſult, and applying them to the particular inſtance before us, we are neceſſarily led to two important concluſions. The firſt is, that the convention muſt have enjoyed in a very ſingular degree, an exemption from the peſtilential influence of party animoſities; the diſeaſes moſt incident to deliberative bodies, and moſt apt to contaminate their proceedings. The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, that all the deputations compoſing the convention, were either ſatisfactorily accommodated by the final act; or were induced to accede to it, by a deep conviction of the neceſſity of ſacrificing private opinions and partial intereſts, to the public good, and by a deſpair of ſeeing this neceſſity diminiſhed by delays or by new experiments.</p>

                     <p>IT is not a little remarkable that in every caſe reported by antient hiſtory, in which government has been eſtabliſhed with deliberation and conſent, the taſk of framing it has not been committed to an aſſembly of men; but has been performed by ſome individual citizen of pre-eminent wiſdom and approved integrity. Minos, we learn, was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive founder of the government of Crete; as Zaleucus was of that of the Locrians. Theſeus firſt, and after him Draco and Solon, inſtituted the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Athens. Lycurgus was the lawgiver of Sparta. The foundation of the original government of Rome was laid by Romulus; and the work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by two of his elective ſucceſſors, Numa, and Tullus Hoſtilius. On the abolition of royalty, the conſular adminiſtration was ſubſtituted by Brutus, who ſtepped forward with a project for ſuch a reform, which he alledged had been prepared by Servius Tullius, and to which his addreſs obtained the aſſent and ratification of the ſenate and people. This remark is applicable to confederate governments alſo. Amphyction, we are told, was the author of that which bore his name. The Achaean league received its firſt birth from Achaeus, and its ſecond from Aratus. What degree of agency theſe reputed lawgivers might have in their reſpective eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or how far they might be cloathed with the legitimate authority of the people, cannot in every inſtance be aſcertained. In ſome, however, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was ſtrictly regular. Draco appears to have been entruſted by the people of Athens, with inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite powers to reform its government and laws.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021127_0248_0FB23E19830B6F28"/>
And Solon, according to Plutarch, was in a manner compelled by the univerſal ſuffrage of his fellow citizens, to take upon him the ſole and abſolute power of new modelling the conſtitution. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings under Lycurgus were leſs regular; but as far as the advocates for a regular reform could prevail, they all turned their eyes towards the ſingle efforts of that celebrated patriot and ſage, inſtead of ſeeking to bring about a revolution, by the intervention of a deliberative body of citizens. Whence could it have proceeded that a people, jealous as the Greeks were of their liberty, ſhould ſo far abandon the rules of caution, as to place their deſtiny in the hands of a ſingle citizen? Whence could it have proceeded that the Athenians, a people who would not ſuffer an army to be commanded by fewer than ten generals, and who required no other proof of danger to their liberties than the illuſtrious merit of a fellow citizen, ſhould conſider one illuſtrious citizen as a more eligible depoſitary of the fortunes of themſelves and their poſterity, than a ſelect body of citizens, from whoſe common deliberations more wiſdom, as well as more ſafety, might have been expected? Theſe queſtions cannot be fully anſwered without ſuppoſing that the fears of diſcord and diſunion among a number of counſellors, exceeded the apprehenſion of treachery or incapacity in a ſingle individual. Hiſtory informs us likewiſe of the difficulties with which theſe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated reformers had to contend; as well as of the expedients which they were obliged to employ, in order to carry their reforms into effect. Solon, who ſeems to have indulged a more temporiſing policy, confeſſed that he had not given to his countrymen the government beſt ſuited to their happineſs, but moſt tolerable to their prejudices. And Lycurgus, more true to his object, was under the neceſſity of mixing a portion of violence with the authority of ſuperſtition; and of ſecuring his final ſucceſs, by a voluntary renunciation, firſt of his country, and then
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021127_0249_0FB23E1B09A58738"/>
of his life. If theſe leſſons teach us, on one hand, to admire the improvement made by America on the ancient mode of preparing and eſtabliſhing regular plans of government; they ſerve not leſs on the other, to admoniſh us of the hazards and difficulties incident to ſuch experiments, and of the great imprudence of unneceſſarily multiplying them.</p>

                        </gap>jecture that the errors which may be contained in the plan of the convention are ſuch as have reſulted rather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated and difficult ſubject, than from a want of accuracy or care in the inveſtigation of it; and conſequently ſuch as will not be aſcertained until an actual trial ſhall have pointed them out? This conjecture is rendered probable not only by many conſiderations of a general nature, but by the particular caſe of the articles of confederation. It is obſervable that among the numerous objections and amendments ſuggeſted by the ſeveral ſtates, when theſe articles were ſubmitted for their ratification, not one is found which alludes to the great and radical error, which on actual trial has diſcovered itſelf. And if we except the obſervations which New-Jerſey was led to make rather by her local ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation than by her peculiar foreſight, it may be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned whether a ſingle ſuggeſtion was of ſufficient moment to juſtify a reviſion of the ſyſtem. There is abundant reaſon nevertheleſs to ſuppoſe that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial as theſe objections were, they would have been adhered to with a very dangerous inflexibility in ſome ſtates, had not a zeal for their opinions and ſuppoſed intereſts, been ſtifled by the more powerful ſentiment of ſelf-preſervation. One ſtate, we may remember, perſiſted for ſeveral years in refuſing her concurrence, although the enemy remained the whole period at our gates, or rather in the very bowels of our country. Nor was her pliancy in the end effected by a leſs motive than the fear of being chargeable with protracting the public calamities, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering

the event of the conteſt. Every candid reader will make the proper reflections on theſe important facts.</p>
                     <p>A patient who finds his diſorder daily growing worſe; and that an efficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme danger; after coolly revolving his ſituation, and the characters of different phyſicians, ſelects and calls in ſuch of them as he judges moſt capable of adminiſtering relief, and beſt entitled to his confidence. The phyſicians attend: The caſe of the patient is carefully examined: a conſultation is held. They are unanimouſly agreed that the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are critical, but that the caſe, with proper and timely relief, is ſo far from being deſperate, that it may be made to iſſue in an improvement of his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. They are equally equanimous in preſcribing the remedy by which this happy effect is to be produced. The preſcription is no ſooner made known however, than a number of perſons interpoſe, and without denying the reality or danger of the diſorder, aſſure the patient that the preſcription will be poiſon to his conſtitution, and forbid him under pain of certain death to make uſe of it. Might not the patient reaſonably demand before he ventured to follow this advice, that the authors of it ſhould at leaſt agree among themſelves, on ſome other remedy to be ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted? And if he found them differing as much from one another, as from his firſt counſellors, would he not act prudently, in trying the experiment unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly recommended by the latter, rather than in hearkening to thoſe who could neither deny the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a ſpeedy remedy, nor agree in propoſing one?</p>
                     <p>Such a patient, and in ſuch a ſituation is America at this moment. She has been ſenſible of her malady. She has obtained a regular and unanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice. And ſhe is warned by others againſt following this advice, under pain of the moſt fatal conſequences. Do the monitors deny the reality of her danger? No. Do they deny the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021127_0251_0FB23E1E03AF4C60"/>
neceſſity of ſome ſpeedy and powerful remedy? No. Are they agreed, are any two of them agreed in their objections to the remedy propoſed, or in the proper one to be ſubſtituted? Let them ſpeak for themſelves. This one tells us that the propoſed conſtitution ought to be rejected, becauſe it is not a confederation of the ſtates, but a government over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a government over indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, to a certain extent, but by no means to the extent propoſed. A third does not object to the government over individuals or to the extent propoſed, but to the want of a bill of rights. A fourth concurs in the abſolute neceſſity of a bill of rights, but contends that it ought to be declaratory not of the perſonal rights of individuals, but of the rights reſerved to the ſtates in their political capacity. A fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any ſort would be ſuperfluous and miſplaced, and that the plan would be unexceptionable, but for the fatal power of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the times and places of election. An objector in a large ſtate exclaims loudly againſt the unreaſonable equality of repreſentation in the ſenate. An objector in a ſmall ſtate is equally loud againſt the dangerous inequality in the houſe of repreſentatives. From this quarter we are alarmed with the amazing expence from the number of perſons who are to adminiſter the new government. From another quarter, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the ſame quarter, on another occaſion, the cry is, that the congreſs will be but the ſhadow of a repreſentation, and that the government would be far leſs objectionable, if the number and the expence were doubled. A patriot in a ſtate that does not import or export, diſcerns inſuperable objections againſt the power of direct taxation. The patriotic adverſary in a ſtate of great exports and imports, is not leſs diſſatisfied that the whole burthen of taxes may be thrown on conſumption. This politician diſcovers in the conſtitution a direct and irreſiſtible tendency to monarchy. That is equally ſure, it will
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021127_0252_0FB23E1F8522E930"/>
end in ariſtocracy. Another is puzzled to ſay which of theſe ſhapes it will ultimately aſſume, but ſees clearly it muſt be one or other of them. Whilſt a fourth is not wanting, who with no leſs confidence affirms that the conſtitution is ſo far from having a bias towards either of theſe dangers, that the weight on that ſide will not be ſufficient to keep it upright and firm againſt its oppoſite propenſities. With another claſs of adverſaries to the conſtitution, the language is that the legiſlative, executive and judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are intermixed in ſuch a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government, and all the requiſite precautions in favour of liberty. Whilſt this objection circulates in vague and general expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, there are not a few who lend their ſanction to it. Let each one come forward with his particular explanation and ſcarce any two are exactly agreed on the ſubject. In the eyes of one the junction of the ſenate with the preſident in the reſponſible function of appointing to offices, inſtead of veſting this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power in the executive, alone, is the vicious part of the organiſation. To another, the excluſion of the houſe of repreſentatives, whoſe numbers alone could be a due ſecurity againſt corruption and partiality in the exerciſe of ſuch a power, is equally obnoxious. With another, the admiſſion of the preſident into any ſhare of a power which muſt ever be a dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magiſtrate, is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealouſy. No part of the arrangement according to ſome is more admiſſible than the trial of impeachments by the ſenate, which is alternately a member both of the legiſlative and executive departments, when this power ſo evidently belonged to the judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We concur fully, reply others, in the objection to this part of the plan, but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error. Our principal diſlike to the organiſation ariſes from the extenſive
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021127_0253_0FB23E210432A560"/>
powers already lodged in that department. Even among the zealous patrons of a council of ſtate, the moſt irreconcilable variance is diſcovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be conſtituted. The demand of one gentleman is that the council ſhould conſiſt of a ſmall number, to be appointed by the moſt numerous branch of the legiſlature. Another would prefer a larger number, and conſiders it as a fundamental condition that the appointment ſhould be made by the preſident himſelf.</p>
                     <p>As it can give no umbrage to the writers againſt the plan of the federal conſtitution, let us ſuppoſe that as they are the moſt zealous, ſo they are alſo the moſt ſagacious of thoſe who think the late convention were unequal to the taſk aſſigned them, and that a wiſer and better plan might and ought to be ſubſtituted. Let us further ſuppoſe that their country ſhould concur both in this favourable opinion of their merits, and in their unfavourable opinion of the convention; and ſhould accordingly proceed to form them into a ſecond convention, with full powers and for the expreſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of reviſing and remoulding the work of the firſt. Were the experiment to be ſeriouſly made, though it requires ſome effort to view it ſeriouſly even in fiction, I leave it to be decided by the ſample of opinions juſt exhibited, whether with all their enmity to their predeceſſors, they would in any one point depart ſo widely from their example, as in the diſcord and ferment that would mark their own deliberations; and whether the conſtitution, now before the public, would not ſtand as fair a chance for immortality, as Lycurgus gave to that of Sparta, by making its change to depend on his own return from exile and death, if it were to be immediately adopted, and were to continue in force, not until a BETTER, but until ANOTHER ſhould be agreed upon by this new aſſembly of law-givers.</p>
                     <p>It is a matter both of wonder and regret, that thoſe who raiſe ſo many objections againſt the new
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021127_0254_0FB23E2287F56E08"/>
conſtitution, ſhould never call to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not neceſſary that the former ſhould be perfect; it is ſufficient that the latter is more imperfect. No man would refuſe to give braſs for ſilver or gold, becauſe the latter had ſome alloy in it. No man would refuſe to quit a ſhattered and tottering habitation, for a firm and commodious building, becauſe the latter had not a porch to it; or becauſe ſome of the rooms might be a little larger or ſmaller, or the cieling a little higher or lower than his fancy would have planned them. But waving illuſtrations of this ſort, is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that moſt of the capital objections urged againſt the new ſyſtem, lie with tenfold weight againſt the exiſting confederation? Is an indefinite power to raiſe money dangerous in the hands of a federal government? The preſent congreſs can make requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to any amount they pleaſe; and the ſtates are conſtitutionally bound to furniſh them; they can emit bills of credit as long as they will pay for the paper; they can borrow both abroad and at home, as long as a ſhilling will be lent. Is an indefinite power to raiſe troops dangerous? The confederation gives to congreſs that power alſo; and they have already begun to make uſe of it. Is it improper and unſafe to intermix the different powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſame body of men? Congreſs, a ſingle body of men, are the ſole depoſitory of all the federal powers. Is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of the treaſury, and the command of the army, into the ſame hands? The confederation places them both in the hands of congreſs. Is a bill of rights eſſential to liberty? The confederation has no bill of rights. Is it an objection againſt the new conſtitution, that it empowers the ſenate with the concurence of the executive to make treaties which are to be the laws of the land? The exiſting congreſs, without any ſuch controul, can make treaties which they themſelves have declared, and moſt of the ſtates have
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021127_0255_0FB23E240526D900"/>
recognized, to be the ſupreme law of the land. Is the importation of ſlaves permitted by the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for twenty years? By the old, it is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ever.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be told that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be in theory, it is rendered harmleſs by the dependence of congreſs on the ſtates for the means of carrying them into practice: That however large the maſs of powers may be, it is in fact a lifeleſs maſs. Then ſay I in the firſt place, that the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is chargeable with the ſtill greater folly of declaring certain powers in the federal government to be abſolutely neceſſary, and at the ſame time render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them abſolutely nugatory; And in the next place, that if the union is to continue, and no better govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſubſtituted, effective powers muſt either be granted to or aſſumed by the exiſting congreſs, in either of which events the contraſt juſt ſtated will hold good. But this is not all. Out of this lifeleſs maſs has already grown an excreſcent power, which tends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a defective conſtruction of the ſupreme govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the union. It is now no longer a point of ſpeculation and hope that the weſtern territory is a mine of vaſt wealth to the United States; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not of ſuch a nature as to extricate them from their preſent diſtreſſes, or for ſome time to come, to yield any regular ſupplies for the public expences, yet muſt it hereafter be able under proper manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both to effect a gradual diſcharge of the domeſtic debt, and to furniſh for a certain period, liberal tributes to the federal treaſury. A very large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this fund has been already ſurrendered by individual ſtates; and it may with reaſon be expected, that the remaining ſtates will not perſiſt in witholding ſimilar proofs of their equity and generoſity. We may calculate therefore that a rich and fertile country, of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the United States, will ſoon become a national ſtock. Congreſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021127_0256_0FB23E2583953898"/>
have aſſumed the adminiſtration of this ſtock. They have began to render it productive. Congreſs have undertaken to do more, they have proceeded to form new ſtates; to erect temporary governments; to appoint officers for them; and to preſcribe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on which ſuch ſtates ſhall be admitted into the confederacy. All this has been done; and done without the leaſt colour of conſtitutional authority. Yet no blame has been whiſpered; no alarm has been ſounded. A GREAT and INDEPENDENT fund of revenue is paſſing into the hands of a SINGLE BODY of men, who can RAISE TROOPS to an INDEFINITE NUMBER, and appropriate money to their ſupport for an INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. And yet there are men who have not only been ſilent ſpectators of this proſpect; but who are advocates for the ſyſtem which exhibits it; and at the ſame time urge againſt the new ſyſtem the objections which we have heard. Would they not act with more conſiſtency in urging the eſtabliſhment of the latter, as no leſs neceſſary to guard the union againſt the future powers and reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a body conſtructed like the exiſting congreſs, than to ſave it from the dangers threatened by the preſent impotency of that aſſembly?</p>
                     <p>I mean not by any thing here ſaid to throw cenſure on the meaſures which have been purſued by congreſs. I am ſenſible they could not have done otherwiſe. The public intereſt, the neceſſity of the caſe, impoſed upon them the taſk of overleaping their conſtitutional limits. But is not the fact an alarming proof of the danger reſulting from a government which does not poſſeſs regular powers commenſurate to its objects? A diſſolution or uſurpation is the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually expoſed.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XXXIX. The Conformity of the Plan to Republican Principles: An Objection in Reſpect to the Powers of the Convention, examined.</head>
                     <p>THE laſt paper having concluded the obſervations which were meant to introduce a candid ſurvey of the plan of government reported by the convention, we now proceed to the execution of that part of our undertaking. The firſt queſtion that offers itſelf is, whether the general form and aſpect of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſtrictly republican? It is evident that no other form would be reconcileable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the revolution; or with that honorable deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which animates every votary of freedom, to reſt all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for ſelf-government. If the plan of the convention therefore be found to depart from the republican character, its advocates muſt abandon it as no longer defenſible.</p>
                     <p>What then are the diſtinctive characters of the republican form? Were an anſwer to this queſtion to be ſought, not by recurring to principles, but in the application of the term by political writers, to the conſtitutions of different ſtates, no ſatisfactory one would ever be found. Holland, in which no particle of the ſupreme authority is derived from the people, has paſſed almoſt univerſally under the denomination of a republic. The ſame title has been beſtowed on Venice, where abſolute power over the great body of the people, is exerciſed in the moſt abſolute manner, by a ſmall body of hereditary nobles. Poland which is a mixture of ariſtocracy and of monarchy in their worſt forms, has been dignified with the ſame appellation. The government of England, which has one republican
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021127_0258_0FB23E28839F9108"/>
branch only, combined with a hereditary ariſtocracy and monarchy, has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the liſt of republics. Theſe examples, which are nearly as diſſimilar to each other as to a genuine republic, ſhew the extreme inaccuracy with which the term has been uſed in political diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                     <p>If we reſort for a criterion, to the different principles on which different forms of government are eſtabliſhed, we may define a republic to be, or at leaſt may beſtow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people; and is adminiſtered by perſons holding their offices during pleaſure, for a limited period, or during good behaviour. It is <hi>eſſential</hi> to ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it be derived from the great body of the ſociety, not from an inconſiderable proportion, or a favored claſs of it; otherwiſe a handful of tyrannical nobles, exerciſing their oppreſſions by a delegation of their powers, might aſpire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic. It is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for ſuch a government, that the perſons adminiſtering it be appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures juſt ſpecified; otherwiſe every government in the United States, as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organiſed or well executed, would be degraded from the republican character. According to the conſtitution of every ſtate in the union, ſome or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people. According to moſt of them the chief magiſtrate himſelf is ſo appointed. And according to one, this mode of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment is extended to one of the co-ordinate branches of the legiſlature. According to all the conſtitutions alſo, the tenure of the higheſt offices is extended to a definite period, and in many inſtances, both within the legiſlative and executive departments, to a period
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021127_0259_0FB23E2A04454300"/>
of years. According to the proviſions of moſt of the conſtitutions, again, as well as according to the moſt reſpectable and received opinions on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ubject, the members of the judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good behaviour.</p>
                     <p>On comparing the conſtitution planned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, with the ſtandard here fixed, we perceive at once that it is in the moſt rigid ſenſe conformable to it. The houſe of repreſentatives, like that of one branch at leaſt of all the ſtate legiſlatures, is elected immediately by the great body of the people. The ſenate, like the preſent congreſs, and the ſenate of maryland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> derives its appointment indirectly from the people. The preſident is indirectly derived from the choice of the people, according to the example in moſt of the ſtates. Even the judges, with all other officers of the union, will, as in the ſeveral ſtates, be the choice, though a remote choice, of the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The duration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican ſtandard, and to the model of the ſtate conſtitutions. The houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives is periodically elective as in all the ſtates; and for the period of two years as in the ſtate of ſouth carolina. The ſenate is elective for the period of ſix years; which is but one year more than the period of the ſenate of Maryland; and but two more than that of the ſenates of New-York and Virginia. The preſident is to continue in office for the period of four years; as in New-York and Delaware, the chief magiſtrate is elected for three years, and in South Carolina for two years. In the other ſtates the election is annual. In ſeveral of the ſtates however, no explicit provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made for the impeachment of the chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. And in Delaware and Virginia, he is not impeachable till out of office. The preſident of the United States is impeachable at any time during his continuance in office. The tenure by which the judges are to hold their places, is, as it unqueſtionably ought to be, that of good behaviour. The tenure of the
<pb n="23"

                            rendition="simple:additions"/>
miniſterial offices generally will be a ſubject of legal regulation, conformably to the reaſon of the caſe, and the example of the ſtate conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>Could any further proof be required of the republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can complexion of this ſyſtem, the moſt deciſive one might be found in its abſolute prohibition of titles of nobility, both under the federal and the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and in its expreſs guaratee of the republican form to each of the latter.</p>
                     <p>But it was not ſufficient, ſay the adverſaries of the propoſed conſtitution, for the convention to adhere to the republican form. They ought with equal care, to have preſerved the <hi>federal</hi> form, which regards the union as a <hi>confederacy</hi> of ſovereign ſtates; inſtead of which, they have framed a <hi>national</hi> government, which regards the union as a <hi>conſolidation</hi> of the ſtates. And it is aſked by what authority this bold and radical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation was undertaken. The handle which has been made of this objection requires, that it ſhould be examined with ſome preciſion.</p>
                     <p>Without enquiring into the accuracy of the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which the objection is founded, it will be neceſſary to a juſt eſtimate of its force, firſt to aſcertain the real character of the government in queſtion; ſecondly, to enquire how far the convention were authoriſed to propoſe ſuch a government; and thirdly, how far the duty they owed to their country, could ſupply any defect of regular authority.</p>
                     <p>Firſt. In order to aſcertain the real character of the government it may be conſidered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be eſtabliſhed; to the ſources from which its ordinary powers are to be drawn to the operation of thoſe powers; to the extent of them; and to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be introduced.</p>
                     <p>On examining the firſt relation, it appears on one hand that the conſtitution is to be founded on the aſſent and ratification of the people of America, given by deputies elected for the ſpecial purpoſe; but on the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021127_0261_0FB23E2D631E3C00"/>
other that this aſſent and ratification is to be given by the people, not as individuals compoſing one entire nation; but as compoſing the diſtinct and independent ſtates to which they reſpectively belong. It is to be the aſſent and ratification of the ſeveral ſtates derived from the ſupreme authority in each ſtate, the authority of the people themſelves. The act therefore eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the conſtitution, will not be a <hi>national</hi> but a <hi>federal</hi> act.</p>
                     <p>That it will be a federal and not a national act, as theſe terms are underſtood by the objectors, the act of the people as forming ſo many independent ſtates, not as forming one aggregate nation is obvious from this ſingle conſideration, that it is to reſult neither from the deciſion of a <hi>majority</hi> of the people of the union, nor from that of a <hi>majority</hi> of the ſtates. It muſt reſult from the <hi>unanimous</hi> aſſent of the ſeveral ſtates that are parties to it, differing no other wiſe from their ordinary aſſent than in its being expreſſed, not by the legiſlative authority, but by that of the people themſelves. Were the people regarded in this tranſaction as forming one nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the United States, would bind the minority; in the ſame manner as the majority in each ſtate muſt bind the minority; and the will of the majority muſt be determined either by a compariſon of the individual votes; or by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of the majority of the ſtates, as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the United States. Neither of theſe rules has been adopted. Each ſtate in ratifying the conſtitution, is conſidered as a ſovereign body independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act. In this relation then the new conſtitution will, if eſtabliſhed, be a <hi>federal</hi> and not a <hi>national</hi> conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The next relation is to the ſources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived. The houſe of repreſentatives will derive its powers
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021127_0262_0FB23E2E851A0F90"/>
from the people of America, and the people will be repreſented in the ſame proportion, and on the ſame principle, as they are in the legiſlature of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate. So far the government is <hi>national</hi> not <hi>federal.</hi> The ſenate on the other hand will derive its powers from the ſtates, as political and co-equal ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties; and theſe will be repreſented on the principle of equality in the ſenate, as they now are in the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing congreſs. So far the government is <hi>federal,</hi> not <hi>national.</hi> The executive power will be derived from a very compound ſource. The immediate election of the preſident is to be made by the ſtates in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical characters. The votes allotted to them, are in a compound ratio, which conſiders them partly as diſtinct and co-equal ſocieties; partly as unequal members of the ſame ſociety. The eventual election, again is to be made by that branch of the legiſlature which conſiſts of the national repreſentatives; but in this particular act, they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations from ſo many diſtinct and co-equal bodies politic. From this aſpect of the government, it appears to be of a mixed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, preſenting at leaſt as many <hi>federal</hi> as <hi>national</hi> features.</p>
                     <p>The difference between a federal and national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as it relates to the <hi>operation of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is, by the adverſaries of the plan of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuppoſed to conſiſt in this, that in the former, the powers operate on the political bodies compoſing the confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on the individual citizens compoſing the nation, in their individual capacities. On trying the conſtitution by this criterion, it falls under the <hi>national,</hi> not the <hi>federal</hi> character; though perhaps not ſo compleatly as has been underſtood. In ſeveral caſes, and particularly in the trial of controverſies to which ſtates may be parties, they muſt be viewed and proceeded againſt in their collective and political capacities only. But the operation of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021127_0263_0FB23E3003C46AA0"/>
on the people in their individual capacities, in its ordinary and moſt eſſential proceedings, will on the whole, in the ſenſe of its opponents, deſignate it in this relation, a <hi>national</hi> government.</p>
                     <p>But if the government be national with regard to the <hi>operation</hi> of its powers, it changes its aſpect again when we contemplate it in relation to the <hi>extent</hi> of its powers. The idea of a national government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves in it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an indefinite ſupremacy over all perſons and things, ſo far as they are objects of lawful go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Among a people conſolidated into one nation, this ſupremacy is compleatly veſted in the national legiſlature. Among communities united for particular purpoſes, it is veſted partly in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and partly in the municipal legiſlatures. In the former caſe, all local authorities are ſubordinate to the ſupreme; and may be controuled, directed, or aboliſhed by it at pleaſure. In the latter, the local or municipal authorities form diſtinct and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent portions of the ſupremacy, no more ſubject within their reſpective ſpheres to the general autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than the general authority is ſubject to them within its own ſphere. In this relation then, the propoſed government cannot be deemed a <hi>national</hi> one; ſince its juriſdiction extends to certain enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated objects only, and leaves to the ſeveral ſtates a reſiduary and inviolable ſovereignty over all other objects. It is true that in controverſies relating to the boundary between the two juriſdictions, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under the general government. But this does not change the principle of the caſe. The deciſion is to be impartially made, according to the rules of the conſtitution; and all the uſual and moſt effectual precautions are taken to ſecure this impartiality. Some ſuch tribunal is clearly eſſential to prevent an appeal to the ſword, and a diſſolution of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact; and that it ought to be eſtabliſhed under the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021127_0264_0FB23E31845B9DA8"/>
general, rather than under the local governments; or to ſpeak more properly, that it could be ſafely eſtabliſhed under the firſt alone, is a poſition not likely to be combated.</p>
                     <p>If we try the conſtitution by its laſt relation, to the authority by which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly <hi>national,</hi> nor wholly <hi>federal.</hi> Were it wholly national, the ſupreme and ultimate authority would reſide in the <hi>majority</hi> of the people of the union; and this authority would be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at all times, like that of a majority of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſociety, to alter or aboliſh its eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Were it wholly federal on the other hand, the concurrence of each ſtate in the union would be eſſential to every alteration that would be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan of the convention, is not founded on either of theſe principles. In requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than a majority, and particularly, in comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proportion by <hi>ſtates,</hi> not by <hi>citizens,</hi> it departs from the <hi>national,</hi> and advances towards the <hi>federal</hi> character: In rendering the concurrence of leſs than the whole number of ſtates ſufficient, it loſes again the <hi>federal,</hi> and partakes of the <hi>national</hi> character.</p>
                     <p>The propoſed conſtitution therefore, even when teſted by the rules laid down by its antagoniſts, is in ſtrictneſs, neither a national nor a federal conſtitution; but a compoſition of both. In its foundation it is federal, not national; in the ſources from which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national; in the operation of theſe powers, it is national, not federal; in the extent of them again, it is federal, not national; and finally, in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments, it is neither wholly federal, nor wholly national.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XL. The ſame Objection further examined.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> point to be examined is, whether the convention were authoriſed to frame and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this mixed conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The powers of the convention ought in ſtrictneſs to be determined by an inſpection of the commiſſions given to the members by their reſpective conſtituents. As all of theſe however, had reference, either to the recommendation from the meeting at Annapolis in September, 1786, or to that from congreſs in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1787, it will be ſufficient to recur to theſe particular acts.</p>
                     <p>The act from Annapolis recommends the
<q>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of commiſſioners to take into conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the ſituation of the United States, to deviſe <hi>ſuch further proviſions</hi> as ſhall appear to them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render the conſtitution of the federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>adequate to the exigencies of the union</hi>; and to report ſuch an act for that purpoſe, to the United States in congreſs aſſembled, as, when agreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the legiſlature of every ſtate, will effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſame.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The recommendatory act of congreſs is in the words following:
<q>Whereas there is proviſion in the articles of confederation and perpetual union, for making alterations therein, by the aſſent of a congreſs of the United States, and of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſeveral ſtates: And whereas experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath evinced, that there are defects in the preſent confederation, as a mean to remedy which ſeveral of the ſtates, and <hi>particularly the ſtate of New-York,</hi> by expreſs inſtructions to their dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates in congreſs, have ſuggeſted a convention for
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021127_0266_0FB23E3482DD3EF0"/>
the purpoſes expreſſed in the following reſolution; and ſuch convention appearing to be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable mean of eſtabliſhing in theſe ſtates, <hi>a firm national government.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Reſolved, That in the opinion of congreſs, it is expedient, that on the 2d Monday in May next, a convention of delegates, who ſhall have been appointed by the ſeveral ſtates, be held at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, for the ſole and expreſs purpoſe <hi>of reviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the articles of confederation,</hi> and reporting to congreſs and the ſeveral legiſlatures, ſuch <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and proviſions therein,</hi> as ſhall, when agreed to in congreſs, and confirmed by the ſtates, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the federal conſtitution <hi>adequate to the exigencies of government and the preſervation of the union.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From theſe two acts it appears, 1ſt. that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the convention was to eſtabliſh in theſe ſtates, <hi>a firm national government</hi>; 2d. that this government was to be ſuch as would be <hi>adequate to the exigencies of government</hi> and <hi>the preſervation of the union</hi>; 3d. that theſe purpoſes were to be effected by <hi>alterations and proviſions in the articles of confederation,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the act of congreſs, or by <hi>ſuch further proviſions as ſhould appear neceſſary,</hi> as it ſtands in the recommendatory act from Annapolis; 4th. that the alterations and proviſions were to be reported to congreſs, and to the ſtates, in order to be agreed to by the former, and confirmed by the latter.</p>
                     <p>From a compariſon and fair conſtruction of theſe ſeveral modes of expreſſion, is to be deduced the authority under which the convention acted. They were to frame a <hi>national government,</hi> adequate to the <hi>exigencies of government</hi> and <hi>of the union,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the articles of confederation into ſuch form as to accompliſh theſe purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>There are two rules of conſtruction dictated by plain reaſon, as well as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of the expreſſion ought, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to be allowed ſome meaning, and be made to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021127_0267_0FB23E36033D0678"/>
conſpire to ſome common end. The other is, that where the ſeveral parts cannot be made to coincide, the leſs important ſhould give way to the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part; the means ſhould be ſacrificed to the end, rather than the end to the means.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe then that the expreſſions defining the authority of the convention, were irreconcileably at variance with each other; that a <hi>national</hi> and <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate government</hi> could not poſſibly, in the judgment of the convention, be effected by <hi>alterations</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi> in the <hi>articles of confederation,</hi> which part of the definition ought to have been embraced, and which rejected? Which was the more important, which the leſs important part? Which the end, which the means? Let the moſt ſcrupulous expoſitors of delegated powers; let the moſt inveterate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors againſt thoſe exerciſed by the convention, anſwer theſe queſtions. Let them declare, whether it was of moſt importance to the happineſs of the people of America, that the articles of confederation ſhould be diſregarded, and an adequate government be provided, and the union preſerved; or that an adequate government ſhould be omitted, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of confederation preſerved. Let them declare, whether the preſervation of theſe articles was the end for ſecuring which a reform of the government was to be introduced as the means; or whether the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a government, adequate to the national hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, was the end at which theſe articles themſelves originally aimed, and to which they ought, as inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means, to have been ſacrificed.</p>
                     <p>But is it neceſſary to ſuppoſe that theſe expreſſions are abſolutely irreconciliable to each other; that no <hi>alterations</hi> or <hi>proviſions</hi> in the <hi>articles of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> could poſſibly mould them into a national and adequate government; into ſuch a governmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

exerciſe of ungranted power. <hi>Alterations</hi> in the body of the inſtrument, are expreſsly authoriſed. <hi>New proviſions</hi> therein are alſo expreſsly authoriſed. Here then is a power to change the title; to inſert new articles; to alter old ones, Muſt it of neceſſity be admitted that this power is infringed, ſo long as a part of the old articles remain? Thoſe who maintain the affirmative, ought at leaſt to mark the boundary between authoriſed and uſurped innovations, between that degree of change which lies within the compaſs of <hi>alterations and further proviſions</hi>; and that which amounts to a <hi>tranſmutation</hi> of the government. Will it be ſaid that the alterations ought not to have touched the ſubſtance of the confederation? The ſtates would never have appointed a convention with ſo much ſolemnity, nor deſcribed its objects with ſo much lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if ſome <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> reform had not been in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. Will it be ſaid that the <hi>fundamental principles</hi> of the confederation were not within the purview of the convention, and ought not to have been varied? I aſk what are theſe principles? Do they require that in the eſtabliſhment of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſtates ſhould be regarded as diſtinct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſovereigns? They are ſo regarded by the conſtitution propoſed. Do they require that the members of the government ſhould derive their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment from the legiſlatures, not from the people of the ſtates? One branch of the new government is to be appointed by theſe legiſlatures; and under the confederation the delegates to congreſs <hi>may all</hi> be appointed immediately by the people, and in two ſtates<note n="*" place="bottom">Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland.</note> are actually ſo appointed. Do they require that the powers of the government ſhould act on the ſtates, and not immediately on individuals? In ſome inſtances, as has been ſhewn, the powers of the new government will act on the ſtates in their collective characters. In ſome inſtances alſo thoſe of the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing government act immediately on individuals: In
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021127_0269_0FB23E3902EFFBD0"/>
caſes of capture, of piracy, of the poſt-office, of coins weights and meaſures, of trade with the Indians, of claims under grants of land by different ſtates, and above all, in the caſe of trials by courts-martial in the army and navy, by which death may be inflicted without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil magiſtrate; in all theſe caſes the powers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation operate immediately on the perſons and intereſts of individual citizens. Do theſe fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principles require particularly that no tax ſhould be levied without the intermediate agency of the ſtates? The confederation itſelf authoriſes a direct tax to a certain extent on the poſt-office. The power of coinage has been ſo conſtrued by congreſs, as to levy a tribute immediately from that ſource alſo. But pretermitting theſe inſtances, was it not an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged object of the convention, and the univerſal expectation of the people, that the regulation of trade ſhould be ſubmitted to the general government in ſuch a form as would render it an immediate ſource of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral revenue? Had not congreſs repeatedly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this meaſure as not inconſiſtent with the fundamental principles of the confederation? Had not every ſtate but one, had not New-York herſelf, ſo far complied with the plan of congreſs, as to recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the <hi>principle</hi> of the innovation? Do theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in fine require that the powers of the general government ſhould be limited, and that beyond this limit, the ſtates ſhould be left in poſſeſſion of their ſovereignty and independence? We have ſeen that in the new government as in the old, the general powers are limited, and that the ſtates, in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enumerated caſes, are left in the enjoyment of their ſovereign and independent juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, that the great principles of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution propoſed by the convention, may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered leſs as abſolutely new, than as the expanſion of principles which are found in the articles of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. The misfortune under the latter ſyſtem
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021127_0270_0FB23E3A834F4658"/>
has been, that theſe principles are ſo feeble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined as to juſtify all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged againſt it; and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new ſyſtem, the aſpect of an entire transformation of the old.</p>
                     <p>In one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from the tenor of their commiſſion. Inſtead of reporting a plan requiring the confirmation <hi>of all the ſtates,</hi> they have reported a plan which is to be confirmed and may be carried into effect by <hi>nine ſtates only.</hi> It is worthy of remark, that this objection, though the moſt plauſible, has been the leaſt urged in the publications which have ſwarmed againſt the convention. The forbearance can only have proceeded from an irreſiſtible conviction of the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ſubjecting the ſate of twelve ſtates, to the perverſeneſs or corruption of a thirteenth; from the example of inflexible oppoſition given by a <hi>majority</hi> of one ſixtieth of the people of America, to a meaſure approved and called for by the voice of twelve ſtates compriſing fifty-nine ſixtieths of the people; an example ſtill freſh in the memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the wounded honor and proſperity of his country. As this objection therefore, has been in a manner waved by thoſe who have cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſed the powers of the convention, I diſmiſs it without further obſervation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> point to be enquired into is, how far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of duty ariſing out of the caſe itſelf, could have ſupplied any defect of regular authority.</p>
                     <p>In the preceding enquiries, the powers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention have been analiſed and tried with the ſame rigour, and by the ſame rules, as if they had been real and final powers, for the eſtabliſhment of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the United States. We have ſeen, in what manner they have borne the trial, even on that ſuppoſition. It is time now to recollect, that the powers were merely adviſory and recommendatory; that they were ſo meant by the ſtates, and ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021127_0271_0FB23E3C03ADECD0"/>
by the convention; and that the latter have accordingly planned and propoſed a conſtitution, which is to be of no more conſequence than the paper on which it is written, unleſs it be ſtamped with the approbation of thoſe to whom it is addreſſed. This reflection places the ſubject in a point of view altogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety of the courſe taken by the convention.</p>
                     <p>Let us view the ground on which the convention ſtood. It may be collected from their proceedings, that they were deeply and unanimouſly impreſſed with the criſis which had led their country almoſt with one voice to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ke ſo ſingular and ſolemn an experiment, for correcting the errors of a ſyſtem by which this criſis had been produced; that they were no leſs deeply and unanimouſly convinced, that ſuch a reform as they have propoſed, was abſolutely neceſſary to effect the purpoſes of their appointment. It could not be unknown to them, that the hopes and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the great body of citizens, throughout this great empire, were turned with the keeneſt anxiety, to the event of their deliberations. They had every reaſon to believe that the contrary ſentiments agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the minds and boſoms of every external and internal foe to the liberty and proſperity of the United States. They had ſeen in the origin and progreſs of the experiment, the alacrity with which the <hi>propoſition,</hi> made by a ſingle ſtate (Virginia) towards a partial amendment of the confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They had ſeen the <hi>liberty aſſumed</hi> by a <hi>very few</hi> deputies, from a <hi>very few</hi> ſtates, convened at Annapolis, of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending a great and critical object, wholly foreign to their commiſſion, not only juſtified by the public opinion, but actually carried into effect, by twelve out of the Thirteen States. They had ſeen in a variety of inſtances, aſſumptions by congreſs not only of recommendatory, but of operative powers, warranted
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021127_0272_0FB23E3D8302FF00"/>
in the public eſtimation, by occaſions and objects infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely leſs urgent than thoſe by which their conduct was to be governed. They muſt have reflected, that in all great changes of eſtabliſhed governments, forms ought to give way to ſubſtance; that a rigid adherence in ſuch caſes to the former, would render nominal and nugatory, the tranſcendent and precious right of the people to

                     <p>But that the objectors may be diſarmed of every pretext, it ſhall be granted for a moment, that the convention were neither authoriſed by their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor juſtified by circumſtances, in propoſing a conſtitution for their country: Does it follow that the conſtitution ought for that reaſon alone to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected? If according to the noble precept, it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to accept good advice even from an enemy, ſhall we ſet the ignoble example of refuſing ſuch advice even when it is offered by our friends?

                     <p>The ſum of what has been here advanced and proved, is that the charge againſt the convention of exceeding their powers, except in one inſtance little urged by the objectors, has no foundation to ſupport it; that if they had exceeded their powers, they were not only warranted but required, as the confidential ſervants of their country, by the circumſtances in which they were placed, to exerciſe the liberty which they aſſumed, and that finally, if they had violated both their powers, and their obligations in propoſing a conſtitution, this ought nevertheleſs to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, if it be calculated to accompliſh the views and happineſs of the people of America. How far this character is due to the conſtitution, is the ſubject under inveſtigation.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XLI. General View of the Powers propoſed to be veſted in the Union.</head>
                     <p>THE conſtitution propoſed by the convention may be conſidered under two general points of view. The FIRST relates to the ſum or quantity of power which it veſts in the government, including the reſtraints impoſed on the ſtates. The SECOND, to the particular ſtructure of the government, and the diſtribution of this power, among its ſeveral branches.</p>
                     <p>Under the firſt view of the ſubject two important queſtions ariſe; 1. Whether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be unneceſſary or improper? 2. Whether the entire maſs of them be dangerous to the portion of juriſdiction left in the ſeveral ſtates?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:021127_0275_0FB23E4206168478"/>Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been veſted in it? This is the firſt queſtion.</p>
                     <p>It cannot have eſcaped thoſe who have attended with candour to the arguments employed againſt the extenſive powers of the government, that the authors of them have very little conſidered how far theſe powers were neceſſary means of attaining a neceſſary end. They have choſen rather to dwell on the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which muſt be unavoidably blended with all political advantages; and on the poſſible abuſes which muſt be incident to every power or truſt of which a beneficial uſe can be made. This method of handling the ſubject cannot impoſe on the good ſenſe of the people of America. It may diſplay the ſubtlety of the writer; it may open a boundleſs field for rhetoric and declamation; it may inflame the paſſions of the unthinking, and may confirm the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the miſthinking. But cool and candid people will at once reflect, that the pureſt of human bleſſings muſt have a portion of alloy in them; that the choice muſt always be made, if not of the leſſer evil, at leaſt of the GREATER, not the PERFECT good; and that in every political inſtitution, a power to advance the public happineſs involves a diſcretion which may be miſapplied and abuſed. They will ſee therefore that in all caſes, where power is to be conferred, the point firſt to be decided is whether ſuch a power be neceſſary to the public good; as the next will be, in caſe of an affirmative deciſion, to guard as effectually as poſſible againſt a perverſion of the power to the public detriment.</p>
                     <p>That we may form a correct judgment on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it will be proper to review the ſeveral powers conferred on the government of the union; and that this may be the more conveniently done, they may be reduced into different claſſes as they relate to the following different objects; 1. Security againſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign danger; 2. Regulation of the intercourſe with
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021127_0276_0FB23E43840BDF98"/>
foreign nations; 3. Maintenance of harmony and proper intercourſe among the ſtates; 4. Certain miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous objects of general utility; 5. Reſtraint of the ſtates from certain injurious acts; 6. Proviſions for giving due efficacy to all theſe powers.</p>
                     <p>The powers falling within the firſt claſs, are thoſe of declaring war, and granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets; of regulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and borrowing money.</p>
                     <p>Security againſt foreign danger is one of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive objects of civil ſociety. It is an avowed and eſſential object of the American union. The powers requiſite for attaining it, muſt be effectually confided to the federal councils.</p>
                     <p>Is the power of declaring war neceſſary? No man will anſwer this queſtion in the negative. It would be ſuperfluous therefore to enter into a proof of the affirmative. The exiſting confederation eſtabliſhes this power in the moſt ample form.</p>
                     <p>Is the power of raiſing armies, and equipping fleets neceſſary? This is involved in the foregoing power. It is involved in the power of ſelf-defence.</p>
                     <p>But was it neceſſary to give an INDEFINITE POWER of raiſing TROOPS, as well as providing fleets; and of maintaining both in PEACE, as well as in WAR?</p>
                     <p>The anſwer to theſe queſtions has been too far anticipated, in another place, to admit an extenſive diſcuſſion of them in this place. The anſwer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeems to be ſo obvious and concluſive as ſcarcely to juſtify ſuch a diſcuſſion in any place. With what colour of propriety could the force neceſſary for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, be limited by thoſe who cannot limit the force of offence? If a federal conſtitution could chain the ambition, or ſet bounds to the exertions of all other nations, then indeed might it prudently chain the diſcretion of its own government, and ſet bounds to the exertions for its own ſafety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="unknown:021127_0277_0FB23E4504D8F780"/>How could a readineſs for war in time of peace be ſafely prohibited, unleſs we could prohibit in like manner the preparations and eſtabliſhments of every hoſtile nation? The means of ſecurity can only be regulated by the means and the danger of attack. They will in fact be ever determined by theſe rules, and by no others. It is in vain to oppoſe conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal barriers to the impulſe of ſelf-preſervation. It is worſe than in vain; becauſe it plants in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution itſelf neceſſary uſurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germe of unneceſſary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains conſtantly a diſciplined army ready for the ſervice of ambition or revenge, it obliges the moſt pacific nations, who may be within the reach of its enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, to take correſponding precautions. The fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military eſtabliſhments in time of peace. They were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Charles VII. of France. All Europe has followed, or been forced into the example. Had the example not been followed by other nations, all Europe muſt long ago have worn the chains of a univerſal monarch Were every nation except France now to diſband its peace eſtabliſhment, the ſame event might follow. The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undiſciplined valour of all other nations, and rendered her miſtreſs of the world.</p>
                     <p>Not leſs true is it, that the liberties of Rome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the final victim to her military triumphs, and that the liberties of Europe, as far as they ever exiſted, have with few exceptions been the price of her military eſtabliſhments. A ſtanding force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a dangerous, at the ſame time that it may be a neceſſary proviſion. On the ſmalleſt ſcale it has its inconveniences. On an extenſive ſcale, its conſequences may be fatal. On any ſcale, it is an object of laudable circumſpection and precaution. A wiſe nation will combine all theſe conſiderations;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021127_0278_0FB23E4683A01DA8"/>
and whilſt it does not raſhly preclude itſelf from any reſource which may become eſſential to its ſafety, will exert all its prudence in diminiſhing both the neceſſity and the danger of reſorting to one which may be inauſpicious to its liberties.</p>
                     <p>The cleareſt marks of this prudence are ſtamped on the propoſed conſtitution. The union itſelf which it cements and ſecures, deſtroys every pretext for a military eſtabliſhment which could be dangerous. America, united with a handful of troops, or without a ſingle ſoldier, exhibits a more forbidding poſture to foreign ambition, than America diſunited, with an hundred thouſand veterans ready for combat. It was remarked on a former occaſion, that the want of this pretext had ſaved the liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her inſular ſituation and her maritime reſources, impregnable to the armies of her neighbours, the rulers of Great-Britain have never been able, by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an extenſive peace eſtabliſhment. The diſtance of the United States from the powerful nations of the world, gives them the ſame happy ſecurity. A dangerous eſtabliſhment can never be neceſſary or plauſible, ſo long as they continue a united people. But let it never for a moment be forgotten, that they are indebted for this advantage to their union alone. The moment of its diſſolution will be the date of a new order of things. The fears of the weaker or the ambition of the ſtronger ſtates or confederacies, will ſet the ſame example in the new, as Charles VII. did in the old world. The example will be followed here from the ſame motives which produced univerſal imitation there. Inſtead of deriving from our ſituation the precious advantage which Great-Britain has derived from hers, the face of America will be but a copy of that of the continent of Europe. It will preſent liberty every where cruſhed between ſtanding armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes of diſunited
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021127_0279_0FB23E4804047528"/>
America will be even more diſaſtrous than thoſe of Europe. The ſources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits. No ſuperior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her rival nations, inflame their mutual animoſities, and render them the inſtruments of foreign ambition, jealouſy and revenge. In America, the miſeries ſpringing from her internal jealouſies, contentions and wars, would form a part only of her lot. A plentiful addition of evils would have their ſource in that relation in which Europe ſtands to this quarter of the earth, and which no other quarter of the earth bears to Europe. This picture of the conſequences of diſunion cannot be too highly coloured, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves peace, every man who loves his country, every man who loves liberty, ought to have it ever before his eyes, that he may cheriſh in his heart a due attachment to the union of America, and be able to ſet a due value on the means of preſerving it.</p>
                     <p>Next to the effectual eſtabliſhment of the union, the beſt poſſible precaution againſt danger from ſtanding armies, is a limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to their ſupport. This precaution the conſtitution has prudently added. I will not repeat here the obſervations, which I flatter myſelf have placed this ſubject in a juſt and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory light. But it may not be improper to take notice of an argument againſt this part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which has been drawn from the policy and practice of Great-Britain. It is ſaid that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of an army in that kingdom, requires an annual vote of the legiſlature; whereas the American conſtitution has lengthened this critical period to two years. This is the form in which the compariſon is uſually ſtated to the public: But is it a juſt form? Is it a fair compariſon? Does the Britiſh conſtitution reſtrain the parliamentary diſcretion to one year? Does the American impoſe on the congreſs appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021127_0280_0FB23E49F8485340"/>
for two years? On the contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy themſelves, that the Britiſh conſtitution fixes no limit whatever to the diſcretion of the legiſlature, and that the American ties down the legiſlature to two years, as the longeſt admiſſible term.</p>
                     <p>Had the argument from the Britiſh example been truly ſtated, it would have ſtood thus: The term for which ſupplies may be appropriated to the army eſtabliſhment, though unlimited by the Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, has nevertheleſs in practice been limited by parliamentary diſcretion, to a ſingle year. Now if in Great-Britain, where the houſe of commons is elected for ſeven years; where ſo great a proportion of the members are elected by ſo ſmall a proportion of the people; where the electors are ſo corrupted by the repreſentatives, and the repreſentatives ſo corrupted by the crown, the repreſentative body can poſſeſs a power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term, without deſiring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a ſingle year; ought not ſuſpicion herſelf to bluſh in pretending that the repreſentatives of the United States, elected FREELY, by the WHOLE BODY of the people, every SECOND YEAR, cannot be ſafely entruſted with a diſcretion over ſuch appropriations, expreſsly limited to the ſhort period of TWO YEARS.</p>
                     <p>A bad cauſe ſeldom fails to betray itſelf. Of this truth, the management of the oppoſition to the federal government is an unvaried exemplification. But among all the blunders which have been committed, none is more ſtriking than the attempt to enliſt on that ſide, the prudent jealouſy entertained by the people, of ſtanding armies. The attempt has awakened fully the public attention to that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject; and has led to inveſtigations which muſt terminate in a thorough and univerſal conviction, not only that the conſtitution has provided the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual guards againſt danger from that quarter, but
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021127_0281_0FB23E4B0351BB40"/>
that nothing ſhort of a conſtitution fully adequate to the national defence, and the preſervation of the union, can ſave America from as many ſtanding armies as it may be ſplit into ſtates or confederacies; and from ſuch a progreſſive augmentation of theſe eſtabliſhments in each, as will render them as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to the properties and ominous to the liberties of the people; as any eſtabliſhment that can become neceſſary, under a united and efficient government, muſt be tolerable to the former, and ſafe to the latter.</p>
                     <p>The palpable neceſſity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has protected that part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution againſt a ſpirit of cenſure, which has ſpared few other parts. It muſt indeed be numbered among the greateſt bleſſings of America, that as her union will be the only ſource of her maritime ſtrength, ſo this will be a principal ſource of her ſecurity againſt danger from abroad. In this reſpect our ſituation bears another likeneſs to the inſular advantage of Great-Britain. The batteries moſt capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling foreign enterprizes on our ſafety, are happily ſuch as can never be turned by a perfidious govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt our liberties.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of them deeply intereſted in this proviſion for naval protection, and if they have hitherto been ſuffered to ſleep quietly in their beds; if their property has remained ſafe againſt the predatory ſpirit of licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to ranſom themſelves from the terrors of a conflagration, by yielding to the exactions of daring and ſudden invaders, theſe inſtances of good fortune are not to be aſcribed to the capacity of the exiſting government for the protection of thoſe from whom it claims allegiance, but to cauſes that are fugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps Virginia and Maryland, which are peculiarly vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable on their eaſtern frontiers, no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on this ſubject than
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021127_0282_0FB23E4C8484E7F8"/>
New-York. Her ſea coaſt is extenſive. The very important diſtrict of the ſtate is an iſland. The ſtate itſelf is penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The great emporium of its commerce, the great reſervoir of its wealth, lies every moment at the mercy of events, and may almoſt be regarded as a hoſtage, for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy, or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be the reſult of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious ſituation of European affairs, and all the unruly paſſions attending it, be let looſe on the ocean our eſcape from inſults and depredations, not only on that element but every part of the other bordering on it, will be truly miraculous. In the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of America, the ſtates more immediately expoſed to theſe calamities, have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now exiſts; and if their ſingle reſources were equal to the taſk of fortifying themſelves againſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the object to be protected would be almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the means of protecting them.</p>
                     <p>The power of regulating and calling forth the militia has been already ſufficiently vindicated and explained.</p>
                     <p>The power of levying and borrowing money, being the ſinew of that which is to be exerted in the national defence, is properly thrown into the ſame claſs with it. This power alſo has been examined already with much attention, and has I truſt been clearly ſhewn to be neceſſary both in the extent and form given to it by the conſtitution. I will addreſs one additional reflection only to thoſe who contend that the power ought to have been reſtrained to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal taxation, by which they mean taxes on articles imported from other countries. It cannot be doubted that this will always be a valuable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ource of revenue, that for a conſiderable time, it muſt be a principal ſource, that at this moment it is an eſſential one.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021127_0283_0FB23E4E03BB46C8"/>
But we may form very miſtaken ideas on this ſubject, if we do not call to mind in our calculations, that the extent of revenue drawn from foreign commerce, muſt vary with the variations both in the extent and the kind of imports, and that theſe variations do not correſpond with the progreſs of population, which muſt be the general meaſure of the public wants. As long as agriculture continues the ſole field of labour, the importation of manufactures muſt increaſe as the conſumers multiply. As ſoon as domeſtic manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are begun by the hands not called for by agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, the imported manufactures will decreaſe as the numbers of people increaſe. In a more remote ſtage, the imports may conſiſt in conſiderable part of raw materials which will be wrought into articles for exportation, and will therefore require rather the encouragement of bounties, than to be loaded with diſcouraging duties. A ſyſtem of government, meant for duration ought to contemplate theſe revolutions, and be able to accommodate itſelf to them.</p>
                     <p>Some who have not denied the neceſſity of the power of taxation, have grounded a very fierce attack againſt the conſtitution on the language in which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed, that the power
<q>to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts and exciſes, to pay the debts, and provide for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defence and general welfare of the United States,</q>
amounts to an unlimited commiſſion to exerciſe every power which may be alledged to be neceſſary for the common defence or general welfare. No ſtronger proof could be given of the diſtreſs under which theſe writers labour for objections, than their ſtooping to ſuch a miſconſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the congreſs been found in the conſtitution, than the general expreſſions juſt cited, the authors of the objection might have had ſome colour for it; though it would have been difficult to find a reaſon for ſo aukward a form of deſcribing an authority to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021127_0284_0FB23E4F8301FD30"/>
legiſlate in all poſſible caſes. A power to deſtroy the freedom of the preſs, the trial by jury or even to regulate the courſe of deſcents, or the forms of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, muſt be very ſingularly expreſſed by the terms "to raiſe money for the general welfare."</p>
                     <p>But what colour can the objection have, when a ſpecification of the objects alluded to by theſe general terms, immediately follows; and is not even ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a longer pauſe than a ſemicolon. If the different parts of the ſame inſtrument ought to be ſo expounded as to give meaning to every part which will bear it; ſhall one part of the ſame ſentence be excluded altogether from a ſhare in the meaning; and ſhall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent and the clear and preciſe expreſſions, be denied any ſignification whatſoever? For what purpoſe could the enumeration of particular powers be inſerted, if theſe and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural or common than firſt to uſe a general phraſe, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea of an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of particulars, which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to confound and miſlead, is an abſurdity which as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection, or on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the conſtitution, we muſt take the liberty of ſuppoſing, had not its origin with the latter.</p>
                     <p>The objection here is the more extraordinary, as it appears, that the language uſed by the convention is a copy from the articles of confederation. The objects of the union among the ſtates as deſcribed in article 3d. are,
<q>their common defence, ſecurity of their liberties, and mutual and general welfare.</q>
The terms of article 8th, are ſtill more identical.
<q>All charges of war, and all other expences, that ſhall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs

ſhall be defrayed out of a common treaſury, &amp;c.</q>

                     <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> claſs of powers lodged in the general government, conſiſts of thoſe which regulate the intercourſe with foreign nations, to wit, to make treaties; to ſend and receive ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls; to define and puniſh piracies and felonies committed on the high ſeas, and offences againſt the law of nations; to regulate foreign commerce, including a power to prohibit after the year 1808, the importation of ſlaves, and to lay an intermediate duty of ten dollars per head, as a diſcouragement to ſuch importations.</p>
                     <p>This claſs of powers forms an obvious and eſſential branch of the federal adminiſtration. If we are to be one nation in any reſpect, it clearly ought to be in reſpect to other nations.</p>

                        <pb n="49" facs="unknown:021127_0286_0FB23E528362CE58"/>The powers to make treaties and to ſend and receive ambaſſadors, ſpeak their own propriety.— Both of them are compriſed in the articles of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; with this difference only, that the former is diſembarraſſed by the plan of the convention of an exception, under which treaties might be ſubſtantially fruſtrated by regulations of the ſtates; and that a power of appointing and receiving
<q>other public miniſters and conſuls,</q>
is expresſly and very properly added to the former proviſion concerning ambaſſadors. The term ambaſſador, if taken ſtrictly, as ſeems to be required by the ſecond of the articles of confederation, comprehends the higheſt grade only of public miniſters; and excludes the grades which the United States will be moſt likely to prefer where foreign embaſſies may be neceſſary. And under no latitude of conſtruction will the term comprehend conſuls. Yet it has been found expedient, and has been the practice of congreſs to employ the inferior grades of public miniſters; and to ſend and receive conſuls. It is true that where treaties of commerce ſtipulate for the mutual appointment of conſuls, whoſe functions are connected with commerce, the admiſſion of foreign conſuls may fall within the power of making commercial treaties; and that where no ſuch treaties exiſt, the miſſion of American conſuls into foreign countries, may <hi>perhaps</hi> be covered under the authority given by the 9th article of the confederation, to appoint all ſuch civil officers as may be neceſſary for managing the general affairs of the United States. But the admiſſion of conſuls into the United States, where no previous treaty has ſtipulated it, ſeems to have been no where provided for. A ſupply of the omiſſion is one of the leſſer inſtances in which the convention have improved on the model before them. But the moſt minute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions become important when they tend to obviate the neceſſity or the pretext for gradual and unobſerved uſurpations of power. A liſt of the caſes in which
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:021127_0287_0FB23E54666763F0"/>
congreſs have been betrayed, or forced by the defects of the confederation into violations of their chartered authorities, would not a little ſurpriſe thoſe who have paid no attention to the ſubject; and would be no inconſiderable argument in favor of the new conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which ſeems to have provided no leſs ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for the leſſer, than the more obvious and ſtriking defects of the old.</p>
                     <p>The power to define and puniſh piracies and felonies committed on the high ſeas, and offences againſt the law of nations, belongs with equal propriety to the general government; and is a ſtill greater improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the articles of confederation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe articles contain no proviſion for the caſe of offences againſt the law of nations; and conſequently leave it in the power of any indiſcreet member to embroil the confederacy with foreign nations.</p>
                     <p>The proviſion of the federal articles on the ſubject of piracies and felonies, extends no farther than to the eſtabliſhment of courts for the trial of theſe offences. The definition of piracies might perhaps, without inconveniency, be left to the law of nations; though a legiſlative definition of them is found in moſt municipal codes. A definition of felonies on the high ſeas is evidently requiſite. Felony is a term of looſe ſignification even in the common law of England; and of various import in the ſtatute law of that kingdom. But neither the common, nor the ſtatute law of that or of any other nation, ought to be a ſtandard for the proceedin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> of this, unleſs previouſly made its own by legiſlative adoption. The meaning of the term as defined in the codes of the ſeveral ſtates, would be as impracticable as the former would be a diſhonorable and illegitimate guide. It is not preciſely the ſame in any two of the ſtates; and varies in each with every reviſion of its criminal laws. For the ſake of certainty and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity therefore, the power of defining felonies in this caſe, was in every reſpect neceſſary and proper.</p>

                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:021127_0288_0FB23E5583B493F0"/>The regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within ſeveral views which have been taken of this ſubject, has been too fully diſcuſſed to need addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proofs here of its being properly ſubmitted to the federal adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>It were doubtleſs to be wiſhed that the power of prohibiting the importation of ſlaves, had not been poſtponed until the year 1808, or rather that it had been ſuffered to have immediate operation. But it is not difficult to account either for this reſtriction on the general government, or for the manner in which the whole clauſe is expreſſed. It ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a great point gained in favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate for ever within theſe ſtates, a traffic which has ſo long and ſo loudly upbraided the barbariſm of modern policy; that within that period it will receive a conſiderable diſcouragement from the federal government, and may be totally aboliſhed by a concurrence of the few ſtates which continue the unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given by ſo great a majority of the union. Happy would it be for the unfortunate Africans, if an equal proſpect lay before them, of being redeemed from the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their European brethren!</p>
                     <p>Attempts have been made to pervert this clauſe into an objection againſt the conſtitution, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it on one ſide as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on another, as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America. I mention theſe miſconſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not with a view to give them an anſwer, for they deſerve none; but as ſpecimens of the manner and ſpirit in which ſome have thought fit to conduct their oppoſition to the propoſed government.</p>
                     <p>The powers included in the <hi>third</hi> claſs, are thoſe which provide for the harmony and proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe among the ſtates.</p>

                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:021127_0289_0FB23E5704717768"/>Under this head might be included the particular reſtraints impoſed on the authority of the ſtates, and certain powers of the judicial department; but the former are reſerved for a diſtinct claſs, and the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the ſtructure and organization of the government. I ſhall confine myſelf to a curſory review of the remaining powers comprehended under this third deſcription, to wit, to regulate commerce among the ſeveral ſtates and the Indian tribes; to coin money, regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin; to provide for the puniſhment of counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the current coin and ſecurities of the United States; to fix the ſtandard of weights and meaſures; to eſtabliſh an uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws of bankruptcy; to preſcribe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of each ſtate ſhall be proved, and the effect they ſhall have in other ſtates, and to eſtabliſh poſt-offices and poſt-roads.</p>
                     <p>The defect of power in the exiſting confederacy, to regulate the commerce between its ſeveral members, is in the number of thoſe which have been clearly pointed out by experience. To the proofs and remarks which former papers have brought into view on this ſubject, it may be added, that without this ſupplemental proviſion, the great and eſſential power of regulating foreign commerce, would have been incomplete, and ineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief of the ſtates which import and export through other ſtates, from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter. Were theſe at liberty to regulate the trade between ſtate and ſtate, it muſt be foreſeen that ways would be found out, to load the articles of import and export, during the paſſage through their juriſdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter, and the conſumers of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

introduced by future contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs, that it would nouriſh unceaſing animoſities, and not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably terminate in ſerious interruptions of the public tranquility. To thoſe who do not view the queſtion through the medium of paſſion or of intereſt, the deſire of the commercial ſtates to collect in any form, an indirect revenue from their uncommercial neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, muſt appear not leſs impolitic than it is unfair; ſince it would ſtimulate the injured party, by reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as intereſt, to reſort to leſs convenient channels for their foreign trade. But the mild voice of reaſon, pleading the cauſe of an enlarged and permanent intereſt, is but too often drowned before public bodies as well as individuals, by the clamours of an impatient avidity for immediate and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate gain.</p>
                     <p>The neceſſity of a ſuperintending authority over the reciprocal trade of confederated ſtates has been illuſtrated by other examples as well as our own. In Switzerland, where the union is ſo very ſlight, each canton is obliged to allow to merchandizes, a paſſage through its juriſdiction into other cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany, it is a law of the empire, that the princes and ſtates ſhall not lay tolls or cuſtoms on bridges, rivers, or paſſages, without the conſent of the emperor and diet; though it appears from a quotation in an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent paper, that the practice in this as in many other inſtances in that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of confederation, which render the proviſion
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021127_0291_0FB24756DC967758"/>
obſcure and contradictory. The power is there reſtrained to Indians, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> members of any of the ſtates, and is not to violate or infringe the legiſlative right of any ſtate within its own limits. What deſcription of Indians are to be deemed members of a ſtate, is not yet ſettled; and has been a queſtion of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils. And how the trade with Indians, though not members of a ſtate, yet reſiding within its legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative juriſdiction, can be regulated by an external authority, without ſo far intruding on the internal rights of legiſlation, is abſolutely incomprehenſible. This is not the only caſe in which the articles of confederation have inconſiderately endeavoured to accompliſh impoſſibilities; to reconcile a partial ſovereignty in the union, with complete ſovereignty in the ſtates; to ſubvert a mathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and letting the whole remain.</p>
                     <p>All that need be remarked on the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, is that by providing for this laſt caſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has ſupplied a material omiſſion in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of confederation. The authority of the exiſting congreſs is reſtrained to the regulation of coin <hi>ſtruck</hi> by their own authority, or that of the reſpective ſtates. It muſt be ſeen at once, that the propoſed uniformity in the <hi>value</hi> of the current coin might be deſtroyed by ſubjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of the different ſtates.</p>
                     <p>The puniſhment of counterfeiting the public ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as well as of the current coin, is ſubmitted of courſe to that authority, which is to ſecure the value of both.</p>
                     <p>The regulation of weights and meaſures is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the articles of confederation, and is founded on like conſiderations with the preceding power of regulating coin.</p>
                     <p>The diſſimilarity in the rules of naturalization, has long been remarked as a fault in our ſyſtem, and as
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021127_0292_0FB24749BA492868"/>
laying a foundation for intricate and delicate queſtions. In the 4th article of the confederation, it is declared
<q>that the <hi>free inhabitants</hi> of each of theſe ſtates, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from juſtice excepted, ſhall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of <hi>free citizens,</hi> in the ſeveral ſtates, and <hi>the people</hi> of each ſtate, ſhall in every other, enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce, &amp;c.</q>
There is a confuſion of language here, which is remarkable. Why the terms <hi>free inhabitants,</hi> are uſed in one part of the article; <hi>free citizens</hi> in another, and <hi>people</hi> in another, or what was meant by ſupperadding
<q>to all privileges and immunities of free citizens,</q>
—
<q>all the privileges of trade and commerce,</q>
cannot eaſily be determined. It ſeems to be a conſtruction ſcarcely avoidable, however that thoſe who come under the denomination of <hi>free inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants</hi> of a ſtate, although not citizens of ſuch ſtate, are entitled in every other ſtate to all the privileges of <hi>free citizens</hi> of the latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own ſtate; ſo that it may be in the power of a particular ſtate, or rather every ſtate is laid under a neceſſity, not only to confer the rights of citizenſhip in other ſtates upon any whom it may admit to ſuch rights within itſelf; but upon any whom it may allow to become inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants within its juriſdiction. But were an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the term "inhabitants" to be admitted, which would confine the ſtipulated privileges citizens alone, the difficulty is diminiſhed only, not removed. The very improper power would ſtill be retained by each ſtate, of naturalizing aliens in every other ſtate. In one ſtate reſidence for a ſhort term confers all the rights of citizenſhip. In another qualifications of greater importance are required. An alien therefore legally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter, may by previous reſidence only in the former elude his incapacity; and thus the law of one ſtate, be prepoſterouſly rendered paramount to
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021127_0293_0FB2474B9DF84590"/>
the law of another within the juriſdiction of the other. We owe it to mere caſualty, that very ſerious embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments on this ſubject have been hitherto eſcaped. By the laws of ſeveral ſtates, certain deſcriptions of aliens who had rendered themſelves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts inconſiſtent, not only with the rights of citizenſhip, but with the privileges of reſidence. What would have been the conſequence, if ſuch perſons, by reſidence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatever the legal conſequences might have been, other conſequences would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have reſulted of too ſerious a nature, not to be provided againſt. The new conſtitution has accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with great propriety made proviſion againſt them, and all others proceeding from the defect of the confederation, on this head by authoriſing the general government to eſtabliſh an uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States.</p>
                     <p>The power of eſtabliſhing uniform laws of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy, is ſo intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent ſo many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different ſtates, that the expediency of it ſeems not likely to be drawn into queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The power of preſcribing by general laws the manner in which the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of each ſtate ſhall be proved, and the effect they ſhall have in other ſtates, is an evident and valuable improvement on the clauſe relating to this ſubject in the articles of confederation.

It is a power exerciſed by every legiſlature of the union, I might ſay of the world, by virtue of its general ſupremacy. Without it, not only the public authority might be inſulted and its proceedings be interrupted, with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the ſtate, comprehending the ſeat of the government for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the exerciſe of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally diſhonorable to the government, and diſſatisfactory to the other members of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. This conſideration has the more weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the ſtationary reſidence of the government, would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a ſingle ſtate; and would create ſo many obſtacles to a removal of the government, as ſtill further to abridge its neceſſary independence. The extent of this federal diſtrict is ſufficiently circumſcribed to ſatisfy every jealouſy of an oppoſite nature. And as it is to be appropriated to this uſe with the conſent of the ſtate ceding it; as the ſtate will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights, and the conſent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find ſufficient inducements of intereſt to become willing parties to the ceſſion; as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exerciſe authority over them; as a municipal legiſlature for local purpoſes, derived from their own ſuffrages, will of courſe be allowed them; and as the authority of the legiſlature of the ſtate, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the ceſſion, will be derived from the whole people of the ſtate, in their adoption of the conſtitution, every imaginable objection ſeems to be obviated.</p>

                     <p>In the articles of confederation no proviſion is found on this important ſubject. Canada was to be admitted of right on her joining in the meaſures of the United States; and the other <hi>colonies,</hi> by which

We have ſeen the inconvenience of this omiſſion, and the aſſumption of power into which congreſs have been led by it. With great propriety therefore has the new ſyſtem ſupplied the defect. The general precaution that no new ſtates ſhall be formed without the concurrence of the federal authority and that of the ſtates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, is conſonant to the principles which ought to govern ſuch tranſactions.

<q>To guarantee to every ſtate in the union a republican form of government; to protect each of them againſt invaſion; and on application of the legiſlature, or of the executive (when the legiſlature cannot be convened) againſt domeſtic violence.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a confederacy founded on republican prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and compoſed of republican members, the ſuperintending government ought clearly to poſſeſs
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021127_0298_0FB2476130D2B010"/>
authority to defend the ſyſtem againſt ariſtocratic or monarchial innovations. The more intimate the nature of ſuch a union may be, the greater intereſt have the members in the political inſtitutions of each other; and the greater right to inſiſt that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into, ſhould be <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> maintained. But a right implies a remedy; and where elſe could the remedy be depoſited, than where it is depoſited by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? Governments of diſſimilar principles and forms, have been found leſs adapted to a federal coalition of any ſort, than thoſe of a kindred nature. <q>As the confederate republic of Germany, ſays Monteſquieu,
conſiſts of free cities and petty ſtates, ſubject to different princes, experience ſhows us that it is more imperfect than that of Holland and Switzerland. Greece was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
he adds,
as ſoon as the king of Macedon obtained a ſeat among the Amphyctions.</q>
In the latter caſe, no doubt, the diſproportionate force, as well as the monarchical form of the new confederate, had its ſhare of influence on the events. It may poſſibly be aſked what need there could be of ſuch a precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the ſtate governments, without the concurrence of the ſtates themſelves. Theſe queſtions admit of ready anſwers. If the interpoſition of the general government ſhould not be needed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for ſuch an event will be a harmleſs ſuperfluity only in the conſtitution. But who can ſay what experiments may be produced by the caprice of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtates, by the ambition of enterprizing leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers, To the ſecond queſtion it may be anſwered, that if the general government ſhould interpoſe by virtue of this conſtitutional authority, it will be of courſe bound to purſue the authority. But the authority extends no farther than to a <hi>guaranty</hi> of a republican form of government, which ſuppoſes a pre-exiſting
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021127_0299_0FB2476648FABC90"/>
government of the form which is to be guaranteed. As long therefore as the exiſting republican forms are continued by the ſtates, they are guaranteed by the federal conſtitution. Whenever the ſtates may chuſe to ſubſtitute other republican forms, they have a right to do ſo, and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter. The only reſtriction impoſed on them is, that they ſhall not exchange republican for anti-republican conſtitutions; a reſtriction which it is preſumed will hardly be conſidered as a grievance.</p>
                     <p>A protection againſt invaſion is due from every ſociety to the parts compoſing it. The latitude of the expreſſion here uſed, ſeems to ſecure each ſtate not only againſt foreign hoſtility, but againſt ambitious or vindictive enterprizes of its more powerful neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The hiſtory both of antient and modern confederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought not to be inſenſible to the policy of this article.</p>
                     <p>Protection againſt domeſtic violence is added with equal propriety. It has been remarked that even among the Swiſs cantons, which properly ſpeaking are not under one government, proviſion is made for this object; and the hiſtory of that league informs us, that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by the moſt democratic, as the other cantons. A recent and well known event among ourſelves, has warned us to be prepared for emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of a like nature.</p>
                     <p>At firſt view it might ſeem not to ſquare with the republican theory, to ſuppoſe either that a majority have not the right, or that a minority will have the force to ſubvert a government; and conſequently that the federal interpoſition can never be required but when it would be improper. But theoretic reaſoning in this, as in moſt other caſes, muſt be qualified by the leſſons of practice. Why may not illicit combinations for purpoſes of violence be formed as well by a majority of a ſtate, eſpecially a
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021127_0300_0FB247686C562C88"/>
ſmall ſtate, as by a majority of a county or a diſtrict of the ſame ſtate; and if the authority of the ſtate ought in the latter caſe to protect the local magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, ought not the federal authority in the former to ſupport the ſtate authority? Beſides, there are certain parts of the ſtate conſtitutions which are ſo interwoven with the federal conſtitution, that a violent blow cannot be given to the one without communicating the wound to the other. Inſurrections in a ſtate will rarely induce a federal interpoſition, unleſs the number concerned in them, bear ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the friends of government. It will be much better that the violence in ſuch caſes ſhould be repreſſed by the ſuperintending power, than that the majority ſhould be left to maintain their cauſe by a bloody and obſtinate conteſt. The exiſtence of a right to interpoſe will generally prevent the neceſſity of exerting it.</p>
                     <p>Is it true that force and right are neceſſarily on the ſame ſide in republican governments? May not the minor party poſſeſs ſuch a ſuperiority of pecuniary reſources, of military talents and experience, or of ſecret ſuccours from foreign powers, as will render it ſuperior alſo in an appeal to the ſword? May not a more compact and advantageous poſition turn the ſcale on the ſame ſide againſt a ſuperior number ſo ſituated as to be leſs capable of a prompt and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected exertion of its ſtrength? Nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force, victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a cenſus of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an election! May it not happen in fine that the minority of <hi>citizens</hi> may become a majority of <hi>perſons,</hi> by the acceſſion of alien reſidents, of a caſual concourſe of adventurers, or of thoſe whom the conſtitution of the ſtate has not admitted to the rights of ſuffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy ſpecies of population abounding in ſome of the ſtates, who during the calm of regular
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021127_0301_0FB2476AF9D95B50"/>
government are ſunk below the level of men; but who in the tempeſtuous ſcenes of civil violence may emerge into the human character, and give a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of ſtrength to any party with which they may aſſociate themſelves.</p>
                     <p>In caſes where it may be doubtful on which ſide juſtice lies, what better umpires could be deſired by two violent factions, flying to arms and tearing a ſtate to pieces, than the repreſentatives of confederate ſtates not heated by the local flame? To the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of judges they would unite the affection of friends. Happy would it be if ſuch a remedy for its infirmities, could be enjoyed by all free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if a project equally effectual could be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the univerſal peace of mankind.</p>
                     <p>Should it be aſked what is to be the redreſs for an inſurrection pervading all the ſtates, and comprizing a ſuperiority of the entire force, though not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional right; the anſwer muſt be, that ſuch a caſe, as it would be without the compaſs of human remedies, ſo it is fortunately not within the compaſs of human probability; and that it is a ſufficient recommendation of the federal conſtitution, that it diminiſhes the riſk of a calamity, for which no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conſtitution can provide a cure.</p>
                     <p>Among the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by Monteſquieu, an important one is,
<q>that ſhould a popular inſurrection happen in one of the ſtates, the others are able to quell it. Should abuſes creep into one part, they are reformed by thoſe that remain ſound.</q>

                     <p>Among the leſſer criticiſms which have been exerciſed on the conſtitution, it has been remarked that the validity of engagements ought to have been aſſerted in favor of the United States, as well as againſt them; and in the ſpirit which uſually cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſes little critics, the omiſſion has been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and magnified into a plot againſt the national rights. The authors of this diſcovery may be told, what few others need be informed of, that as engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in their nature reciprocal, an aſſertion of their validity on one ſide neceſſarily involves a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity on the other ſide; and that as the article is merely declaratory, the eſtabliſhment of the principle in one caſe is ſufficient for every caſe. They may be further told that every conſtitution muſt limit its precautions to dangers that are not altogether ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary; and that no real danger can exiſt that the government would <hi>dare,</hi> with or even without this conſtitutional declaration before it, to remit the debts juſtly due to the public, on the pretext here condemned.</p>

the experience on one ſide or on the other. The exception in favor of the equality of ſuffrage in the ſenate was probably meant as a palladium to the reſiduary ſovereignty of the ſtates, implied and ſecured by that principle of repreſentation in one branch of the legiſlature; and was probably inſiſted on by the ſtates particularly attached to that equality. The other exception muſt have been admitted on the ſame conſiderations which produced the privilege defended by it.</p>

<q>The ratification of the conventions of nine ſtates ſhall be ſufficient for the eſtabliſhment of this conſtitution between the ſtates ratifying the ſame.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This article ſpeaks for itſelf. The expreſs autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the people alone could give due validity to the conſtitution. To have required the unanimous ratification of the thirteen ſtates, would have ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the eſſential intereſts of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a ſingle member. It would have marked a want of foreſight in the convention, which our own experience would have rendered inexcuſeable.</p>
                     <p>Two queſtions of a very delicate nature preſent themſelves on this occaſion. 1. On what principle the confederation, which ſtands in the ſolemn form of a compact among the ſtates, can be ſuperceded without the unanimous conſent of the parties to it? 2. What relation is to ſubſiſt between the nine or more ſtates ratifying the conſtitution, and the remaining few who do not become parties to it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt queſtion is anſwered at once by recurring to the abſolute neceſſity of the caſe; to the great principle of ſelf preſervation; to the tranſcendent law of nature and of nature's God, which declares that the ſafety and happineſs of ſociety, are the objects at which all political inſtitutions aim, and to which all ſuch inſtitutions muſt be ſacrificed. <hi>Perhaps</hi> alſo an anſwer may be found without ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the principles of the compact itſelf. It
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021127_0304_0FB24773B4991298"/>
has been heretofore noted among the defects of the confederation, that in many of the ſtates, it had received no higher ſanction than a mere legiſlative ratification. The principle of reciprocality ſeems to require, that its obligation on the other ſtates ſhould be reduced to the ſame ſtandard. A compact between independent ſovereigns, founded on acts of legiſlative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties. It is an eſtabliſhed doctrine on the ſubject of treaties that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach committed by either of the parties abſolves the others; and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes them, if they pleaſe, to pronounce the compact violated and void. Should it unhappily be neceſſary to appeal to theſe delicate truths for a juſtification for diſpenſing with the conſent of particular ſtates to a diſſolution of the federal pact, will not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining parties find it a difficult taſk to anſwer the <hi>multiplied</hi> and <hi>important</hi> infractions with which they may confronted? The time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits. The ſcene is now changed and with it, the part which the ſame motives dictate.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond queſtion is not leſs delicate; and the flattering proſpect of its being merely hypothetical, forbids an over-curious diſcuſſion of it. It is one of thoſe caſes which muſt be left to provide for itſelf. In general it may be obſerved, that although no political relation can ſubſiſt between the aſſenting and diſſenting ſtates, yet the moral relations will remain uncancelled. The claims of juſtice, both on one ſide and on the other, will be in force, and muſt be fulfilled; the rights of humanity muſt in all caſes be duly and mutually reſpected; whilſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a common intereſt, and above all the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the endearing ſcenes which are paſt, and

                     <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> claſs of proviſions in favor of the federal authority, conſiſts of the following reſtrictions on the authority of the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.
<q>No ſtate ſhall enter into any treaty, alliance or confederation, grant letters of marque and repriſal, coin money, emit bills of credit, make any thing but gold and ſilver a legal tender in payment of debt; paſs any bill of attainder, <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The prohibition againſt treaties, alliances and confederations, makes a part of the exiſting articles of union; and for reaſons which need no explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is copied into the new conſtitution. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of letters of marque is another part of the old ſyſtem, but is ſomewhat extended in the new. According to the former, letters of marque could be granted by the ſtates, after a declaration of war. According to the latter, theſe licences muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as well during war as previous to its decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, from the government of the United States. This alteration is fully juſtified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate reſponſibility to the nation in all thoſe, for whoſe conduct the nation itſelf is to be reſponſible.</p>
                     <p>The right of coining money, which is here taken from the ſtates, was left in their hands by the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021127_0306_0FB24F5FB26876F8"/>
as a concurrent right with that of congreſs, under an exception in favor of the excluſive right of congreſs to regulate the alloy and value. In this inſtance alſo the new proviſion is an improvement on the old. Whilſt the alloy and value depended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtates could have no other effect than to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply expenſive mints, and diverſify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency defeats one purpoſe for which the power was originally ſubmitted to the federal head. And as far as the former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and ſilver to the central mint for recoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints eſtabliſhed under the general authority.</p>
                     <p>The extenſion of the prohibition to bills of credit muſt give pleaſure to every citizen in proportion to his love of juſtice, and his knowledge of the true ſprings of public proſperity. The loſs which Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica has ſuſtained ſince the peace, from the peſtilent effects of paper money, on the neceſſary confidence between man and man; on the neceſſary confidence in the public councils; on the induſtry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, conſtitutes an enormous debt againſt the ſtates chargeable with this unadviſed meaſure, which muſt long remain unſatisfied; or rather an accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwiſe than by a voluntary ſacrifice on the alter of juſtice, of the power which has been the inſtrument of it. In addition to theſe perſuaſive conſiderations, it may be obſerved that the ſame reaſons which ſhew the neceſſity of denying to the ſtates the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to ſubſtitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every ſtate a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as ſtates; and thus the intercourſe among them would be impeded;
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:021127_0307_0FB24F612BF616E0"/>
retroſpective alterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of other ſtates be injured, and animoſities be kindled among the ſtates themſelves. The ſubjects of foreign powers might ſuffer from the ſame cauſe, and hence the union be diſcredited and embroiled by the indiſcretion of a ſingle mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. No one of theſe miſchiefs is leſs incident to a power in the ſtates to emit paper money, than to coin gold or ſilver. The power to make any thing but gold and ſilver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the ſtates, on the ſame principle with that of ſtriking of paper currency.</p>
                     <p>Bills of attainder, <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the firſt principles of the ſocial compact, and to every principle of ſound legiſlation. The two former are expresſly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to ſome of the ſtate conſtitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the ſpirit and ſcope of theſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental charters. Our own experience has taught us nevertheleſs, that additional fences againſt theſe dangers ought not to be omitted. Very properly therefore have the convention added this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bulwark in favor of perſonal ſecurity and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate rights; and I am much deceived if they have not in ſo doing as faithfully conſulted the genuine ſentiments, as the undoubted intereſts of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents. The ſober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have ſeen with regret and with indignation, that ſudden changes and legiſlative interferences in caſes affecting perſonal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprizing and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential ſpeculators; and ſnares to the more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and leſs informed part of the community. They have ſeen too, that one legiſlative interference is but the firſt link of a long chain of repetitions; every ſubſequent interference being naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the effects of the preceding. They very
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021127_0308_0FB24F66AD3856F8"/>
rightly infer, therefore, that ſome thorough reform is wanting which will baniſh ſpeculations on public meaſures, inſpire a general prudence and induſtry, and give a regular courſe to the buſineſs of ſociety. The prohibition with reſpect to titles of nobility, is copied from the articles of confederation and needs no comment.</p>

                     <p>The reſtraint on the power of the ſtates over imports and exports is enforced by all the arguments which prove the neceſſity of ſubmitting the regulation of trade to the federal councils. It is needleſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to remark further on this head, than that the manner in which the reſtraint is qualified, ſeems well calculated at once to ſecure to the ſtates a reaſonable diſcretion in providing for the conveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United States a reaſonable check againſt the abuſe of this diſcretion. The remaining particulars of this clauſe, fall within reaſonings which are either ſo obvious, or have been ſo fully developed, that they may be paſſed over without remark.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Few parts of the conſtitution have been aſſailed with more intemperance than this; yet on a fair inveſtigation of it, as has been elſewhere ſhewn, no part can appear more completely invulnerable. Without the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of this power, the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution would be a dead letter. Thoſe who object to the article therefore as a part of the conſtitution, can only mean that the <hi>form</hi> of the proviſion is improper. But have they conſidered whether a better form could have been ſubſtituted?</p>
                     <p>There are four other poſſible methods which the convention might have taken on this ſubject. They might have copied the ſecond article of the exiſting confederation which would have prohibited the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of any power not <hi>expresſly</hi> delegated; they might have attempted a poſitive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms
<q>neceſſary and proper;</q>
they might have attempted a negative enumeration of them, by ſpecifying the powers excepted from the general definition: They might have been altogether ſilent on the ſubject; leaving theſe neceſſary and proper powers, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and inference.</p>
                     <p>Had the convention taken the firſt method of adopting the ſecond article of confederation; it is evident that the new congreſs would be continually expoſed as their predeceſſors have been, to the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native of conſtruing the term "<hi>expreſsly</hi>" with ſo much rigour as to diſarm the government of all real authority whatever, or with ſo much latitude as to deſtroy altogether the force of the reſtriction. It would be eaſy to ſhew if it were neceſſary, that no important power, delegated by the articles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, has been or can be executed by congreſs,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:021127_0310_0FB24F6BC033B260"/>
without recuring more or leſs to the doctrine of <hi>conſtruction</hi> or <hi>implication.</hi> As the powers delegated under the new ſyſtem are more extenſive, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is to adminiſter it would find itſelf ſtill more diſtreſſed with the alternative of betraying the public intereſt by doing nothing; or of violating the conſtitution by exerciſing powers indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and proper; but at the ſame time, not <hi>expreſsly</hi> granted.</p>
                     <p>Had the convention attempted a poſitive enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the powers neceſſary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the attempt would have involved a compleat digeſt of laws on every ſubject to which the conſtitution relates; accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated too not only to the exiſting ſtate of things, but to all the poſſible changes which futurity may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: For in every new application of a general power, the <hi>particular powers,</hi> which are the means of attaining the <hi>object</hi> of the general power, muſt always neceſſarily vary with that object; and be often properly varied whilſt the object remains the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means, not neceſſary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution, the taſk would have been no leſs chimerical; and would have been liable to this further objection; that every defect in the enumeration, would have been equivalent to a poſitive grant of authority. If to avoid this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions and deſcribed the reſidue by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, <hi>not neceſſary or proper:</hi> It muſt have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the excepted powers only; that theſe would be ſuch as would be leaſt likely to be aſſumed or tolerated becauſe the enumeration would of courſe ſelect ſuch as would be leaſt neceſſary or proper, and that the unneceſſary and improper powers included in the reſiduum, would be leſs forcibly excepted, than if no partial enumeration had been made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:021127_0311_0FB24F6D6B2E0420"/>Had the conſtitution been ſilent on this head, there can be no doubt that all the particular powers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite as means of executing the general powers, would have reſulted to the government, by unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able implication. No axiom is more clearly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in law, or in reaſon, than that wherever the end is required, the means are authoriſed; wherever a general power to do a thing is given, every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power neceſſary for doing it, is included. Had this laſt method therefore been purſued by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, every objection now urged againſt their plan, would remain in all its plauſibility; and the real inconveniency would be incurred, of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving a pretext which may be ſeized on critical occaſions for drawing into queſtion the eſſential powers of the union.</p>
                     <p>If it be aſked, what is to be the conſequence, in caſe the congreſs ſhall miſconſtrue this part of the conſtitution, and exerciſe powers not warranted by its true meaning? I anſwer the ſame as if they ſhould miſconſtrue or enlarge any other power veſted in them, as if the general power had been reduced to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and any one of theſe were to be violated; the ſame in ſhort, as if the ſtate legiſlatures ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their reſpective conſtitutional authorities. In the firſt inſtance, the ſucceſs of the uſurpation will depend on the executive and judiciary departments, which are to expound and give effect to the legiſlative acts; and in the laſt reſort, a remedy muſt be obtained from the people, who can by the election of more faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, annul the acts of the uſurpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redreſs may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in againſt unconſtitutional acts of the federal than of the ſtate legiſlatures, for this plain reaſon, that as every ſuch act of the former, will be an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the rights of the latter, theſe will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to ſound the alarm to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of federal repreſentatives. There being no
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:021127_0312_0FB24F6EC61A0AD0"/>
ſuch intermediate body between the ſtate legiſlatures and the people, intereſted in watching the conduct of the former, violations of the ſtate conſtitution are more likely to remain unnoticed and unredreſſed.</p>

<q>This conſtitution and the laws of the United States which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which ſhall be made, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land, and the judges in every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The indiſcreet zeal of the adverſaries to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it alſo, without which it would have been evidently and radically defective. To be fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this we need only ſuppoſe for a moment, that the ſupremacy of the ſtate conſtitutions had been left compleat by a ſaving clauſe in their favor.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, as theſe conſtitutions inveſt the ſtate legiſlatures with abſolute ſovereignty, in all caſes not excepted by the exiſting articles of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, all the authorities contained in the propoſed conſtitution, ſo far as they exceed thoſe enumerated in the confederation, would have been annulled, and the new congreſs would have been reduced to the ſame impotent condition with their predeceſſors.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, as the conſtitutions of ſome of the ſtates do not even expreſsly and fully recognize the exiſting powers of the confederacy, an expreſs ſaving of the ſupremacy of the former, would in ſuch ſtates have brought into queſtion, every power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the propoſed conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, as the conſtitutions of the ſtates differ much from each other, it might happen that a treaty or national law of great and equal import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the ſtates, would interfere with ſome and not with other conſtitutions, and would conſequently be valid in ſome of the ſtates at the ſame time that it would have no effect in others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:021127_0313_0FB24F702E63CB20"/>In fine, the world would have ſeen for the firſt time, a ſyſtem of government founded on an inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fundamental principles of all government; it would have ſeen the authority of the whole ſociety every where ſubordinate to the authority of the parts; it would have ſeen a monſter in which the head was under the direction of the members.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.
<q>The ſenators and repreſentatives, and the members of the ſeveral ſtate legiſlatures; and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States, and the ſeveral ſtates ſhall be bound by oath or affirmation, to ſupport this conſtitution.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It has been aſked, why it was thought neceſſary, that the ſtate magiſtracy ſhould be bound to ſupport the federal conſtitution, and unneceſſary that a like oath ſhould be impoſed on the officers of the United States in favour of the ſtate conſtitutions?</p>
                     <p>Several reaſons might be aſſigned for the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I content myſelf with one which is obvious and concluſive. The members of the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will have no agency in carrying the ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions into effect. The members and officers of the ſtate governments, on the contrary, will have an eſſential agency in giving effect to the federal conſtitution. The election of the preſident and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, will depend in all caſes, on the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates. And the election of the houſe of repreſentatives, will equally depend on the ſame authority in the firſt inſtance; and will probably, for ever be conducted by the officers and according to the laws of the ſtates.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Among the proviſions for giving efficacy to the federal powers, might be added, thoſe which belong to the executive and judiciary departments: But as theſe are reſerved for particular examination in another place, I paſs them over in this.</p>
                     <p>We have now reviewed in detail all the articles compoſing the ſum or quantity of power delegated by the propoſed conſtitution to the federal government;
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:021127_0314_0FB24F71B0402858"/>
and are brought to this undeniable concluſion, that no part of the power is unneceſſary or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for accompliſhing the neceſſary objects of the union. The queſtion therefore, whether this amount of power ſhall be granted or not, reſolves itſelf into another queſtion, whether or not a government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the exigencies of the union, ſhall be eſtabliſhed; or in other words, whether the union itſelf ſhall be preſerved.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XLV. A further Diſcuſſion of the ſuppoſed Danger from the Powers of the Union, to the State Governments.</head>
                     <p>HAVING ſhewn that no one of the powers tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the federal government is unneceſſary or improper, the next queſtion to be conſidered is whether the whole maſs of them will be dangerous to the portion of authority left in the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
                     <p>The adverſaries to the plan of the convention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of conſidering in the firſt place what degree of power was abſolutely neceſſary for the purpoſes of the federal government, have exhauſted themſelves in a ſecondary enquiry into the poſſible conſequences of the propoſed degree of power, to the governments of the particular ſtates. But if the union, as has been ſhewn, be eſſential, to the ſecurity of the people of America againſt foreign danger; if it be eſſential to their ſecurity againſt contentions and wars among the different ſtates; if it be eſſential to guard them againſt thoſe violent and oppreſſive factions which imbitter the bleſſings of liberty, and againſt thoſe military eſtabliſhments which muſt gradually poiſon its very fountain; if, in a word the union be eſſential
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021127_0315_0FB24F739200A868"/>
to the happineſs of the people of America, is it not prepoſterous, to urge as an objection to a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without which the objects of the union cannot be attained, that ſuch a government may derogate from the importance of the governments of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſtates? Was then the American revolution effected, was the American confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thouſands ſpilt, and the hard earned ſubſtance of millions laviſhed, not that the people of America ſhould enjoy peace, liberty, and ſafety; but that the governments of the individual ſtates, that particular municipal eſtabliſhments might enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of ſovereignty? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the old world that the people were made for kings, not kings for the people. Is the ſame doctrine to be revived in the new, in another ſhape, that the ſolid happineſs of the people is to be ſacrificed to the views of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inſtitutions of a different form? It is too early for politicians to preſume on our forgetting that the public good, the real welfare of the great body of the people is the ſupreme object to be purſued; and that no form of government whatever, has any other value, than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object. Were the plan of the convention adverſe to the public happineſs, my voice would be, reject the plan. Were the union itſelf inconſiſtent with the public happineſs, it would be, aboliſh the union. In like manner as far as the ſovereignty of the ſtates cannot be reconciled to the happineſs of the people; the voice of every good citizen muſt be, let the former be ſacrificed to the latter. How far the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is neceſſary, has been ſhewn. How far the unſacrificed reſidue will be endangered, is the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before us.</p>
                     <p>Several important conſiderations have been touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the courſe of theſe papers, which diſcountenance the ſuppoſition that the operation of the federal
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:021127_0316_0FB24F7A08091160"/>
government will by degrees prove fatal to the ſtate governments. The more I revolve the ſubject the more fully I am perſuaded that the balance is much more likely to be diſturbed by the preponderancy of the laſt than of the firſt ſcale.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen in all the examples of antient and modern confederacies, the ſtrongeſt tendency conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually betraying itſelf in the members to deſpoil the general government of its authorities, with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the encroachments. Although in moſt of theſe examples, the ſyſtem has been ſo diſſimilar from that under conſideration, as greatly to weaken any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference concerning the latter from the fate of the former; yet as the ſtates will retain under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed conſtitution a very extenſive portion of active ſovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly diſregarded. In the Achaean league, it is probable that the federal head had a degree and ſpecies of power, which gave it a conſiderable likeneſs to the government framed by the convention. The Lycian confederacy, as far as its principles and form are tranſmitted, muſt have borne a ſtill greater analogy to it. Yet hiſtory does not inform us that either of them ever degenerated or tended to degenerate into one conſolidated government. On the contrary, we know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the diſſentions, and finally the diſunion of the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate authorities. Theſe caſes are the more worthy of our attention, as the external cauſes by which the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>onent parts were preſſed together, were much more numerous and powerful than in our caſe; and conſequently, leſs powerful ligaments within, would be ſufficient to bind the members to the head, and to each other.</p>
                     <p>In the feudal ſyſtem we have ſeen a ſimilar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity exemplified. Notwithſtanding the want of proper ſympathy in every inſtance between the local
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:021127_0317_0FB24F7DAC6D8CE8"/>
ſovereigns and the people, and the ſympathy in ſome inſtances between the general ſovereign and the latter; it uſually happened that the local ſovereigns prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the rivalſhip for encroachments. Had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and ſubordination; and particularly had the local ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns poſſeſſed the affections of the people, the great kingdoms in Europe, would at this time conſiſt of as many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate governments will have the advantage of the federal government, whether we compare them in reſpect to the immediate dependence of the one on the other; to the weight of perſonal influence which each ſide will poſſeſs; to the powers reſpectively veſted in them; to the predilection and probable ſupport of the people; to the diſpoſition and faculty of reſiſting and fruſtrating the meaſures of each other.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate governments may be regarded as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent and eſſential parts of the federal government; whilſt the latter is no wiſe eſſential to the operation or organiſation of the former. Without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the ſtate legiſlatures, the preſident of the United States cannot be elected at all. They muſt in all caſes have a great ſhare in his appointment, and will perhaps in moſt caſes of themſelves deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. The ſenate will be elected abſolutely and excluſively by the ſtate legiſlatures. Even the houſe of repreſentatives, though drawn immediately from the people, will be choſen very much under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of that claſs of men, whoſe influence over the people obtains for themſelves an election into the ſtate legiſlatures. Thus each of the principal branches of the federal government will owe its exiſtence more or leſs to the favor of the ſtate governments, and muſt conſequently feel a dependence, which is much more likely to beget a diſpoſition too obſequious, than too overbearing towards them. On the other
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:021127_0318_0FB24F7E99E2C908"/>
ſide, the component parts of the ſtate governments will in no inſtance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the federal government, and very little if at all, to the local influence of its members.</p>
                     <p>The number of individuals employed under the conſtitution of the United States, will be much ſmaller, than the number employed under the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtates. There will conſequently be leſs of perſonal influence on the ſide of the former, than of the latter. The members of the legiſlative, executive and judiciary departments of thirteen and more ſtates; the juſtices of peace, officers of militia, miniſterial offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of juſtice, with all the county corporation and town officers, for three millions and more of people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed and having particular acquaintance with every claſs and circle of people, muſt exceed beyond all proportion, both in number and influence, thoſe of every deſcription who will be employed in the adminiſtration of the federal ſyſtem. Compare the members of the three great departments, of the Thirteen Sates, excluding from the judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the juſtices of peace, with the members of the correſponding departments of the ſingle government of the union; compare the militia officers of three millions of people, with the military and marine officers of any eſtabliſhment which is within the compaſs of probability, or I may add, of poſſibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ſtates to be deciſive. If the federal government is to have collectors of revenue, the ſtate governments will have theirs alſo. And as thoſe of the former will be principally on the ſea-coaſt, and not very numerous; whilſt thoſe of the latter will be ſpread over the face of the country, and will be very numerous, the advantage in this view alſo lies on the ſame ſide. It is true that the confederacy is to poſſeſs, and may exerciſe, the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the ſtates:
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:021127_0319_0FB24F80017C18B0"/>
But it is probable that this power will not be reſorted to, except for ſupplemental purpoſes of revenue; that an option will then be given to the ſtates to ſupply their quotas by previous collections of their own; and that the eventual collection under the immediate authority of the union, will generally be made by the officers, and according to the rules, appointed by the ſeveral ſtates. Indeed it is extremely probable that in other inſtances, particularly in the organization of the judicial power, the officers of the ſtates will be cloathed with the correſpondent authority of the union. Should it happen however that ſeparate collectors of internal revenue ſhould be appointed under the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral government, the influence of the whole number would not be a compariſon with that of the multitude of ſtate-officers in the oppoſite ſcale. Within every diſtrict, to which a federal collector would be allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there would not be leſs than thirty or forty or even more officers of different deſcriptions and many of them perſons of character and weight, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence would lie on the ſide of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The powers delegated by the propoſed conſtitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Thoſe which are to remain in the ſtate governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exerciſed principally on external objects, as war, peace, negociation, and foreign commerce; with which laſt the power of taxation will for the moſt part be connected. The powers reſerved to the ſeveral ſtates will extend to all the objects, which, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement and proſperity of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The operations of the federal government will be moſt extenſive and important in times of war and danger; thoſe of the ſtate governments, in times of peace and ſecurity. As the former periods will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably bear a ſmall proportion to the latter, the ſtate governments will here enjoy another advantage over
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021127_0320_0FB24F818B4DEFA8"/>
the federal government. The more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defence, the leſs frequent will be thoſe ſcenes of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which might favour their aſcendancy over the governments of the particular ſtates.</p>
                     <p>If the new conſtitution be examined with accuracy and candour, it will be found that the change which it propoſes, conſiſts much leſs in the addition of NEW POWERS to the union, than in the invigoration of its ORIGINAL POWERS. The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power; but that ſeems to be an addition which few oppoſe, and from which no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions are entertained. The powers relating to war and peace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other more conſiderable powers, are all veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the exiſting congreſs by the articles of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. The propoſed change does not enlarge theſe powers; it only ſubſtitutes a more effectual mode of adminiſtering them. The change relating to tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, may be regarded as the moſt important: and yet the preſent congreſs have as compleat authority to REQUIRE of the ſtates indefinite ſupplies of money for the common defence and general welfare, as the future congreſs will have to require them of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual citizens; and the latter will be no more bound than the ſtates themſelves have been, to pay the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas reſpectively taxed on them. Had the ſtates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied punctually with the articles of confederation, or could their compliance have been enforced by as peaceable means as may be uſed with ſucceſs towards ſingle perſons, our paſt experience is very far from countenancing an opinion that the ſtate governments would have loſt their conſtitutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire conſolidation. To maintain that ſuch an event would have enſued, would be to ſay at once, that the exiſtence of the ſtate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments is incompatible with any ſyſtem whatever that accompliſhes the eſſential purpoſes of the union.</p>

I aſſume this poſition here as it reſpects the firſt, reſerving the proofs for another place. The federal and ſtate of governments are in fact but different agents and truſtees of the people, inſtituted with different powers, and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for different purpoſes. The adverſaries of the conſtitution ſeem to have loſt ſight of the people alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their reaſonings on this ſubject; and to have viewed theſe different eſtabliſhments, not only as mutual rivals and enemies, but as uncontrouled by any common ſuperior in their efforts to uſurp the authorities of each other. Theſe gentlemen muſt here be reminded of their error. They muſt be told that the ultimate authority, wherever the derivative may be found, reſides in the people alone; and that it will not depend merely on the comparative ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or addreſs of the different governments, whether either, or which of them, will be able to enlarge its ſphere of juriſdiction at the expence of the other. Truth no leſs than decency requires, that the event in every caſe ſhould be ſuppoſed to depend on the ſentiments and ſanction of their common conſtituents.</p>
                     <p>Many conſiderations, beſides thoſe ſuggeſted on a former occaſion, ſeem to place it beyond doubt, that
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021127_0322_0FB24F85EE3EA750"/>
the firſt and moſt natural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their reſpective ſtates. Into the adminiſtration of theſe, a greater number of individuals will expect to riſe. From the gift of theſe, a greater number of offices and emoluments will flow. By the ſuperintending care of theſe, all the more domeſtic and perſonal intereſts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be regulated and provided for. With the affairs of theſe, the people will be more familiarly and minutely converſant.

                        </gap> and of family and party attachments; on the ſide of theſe, therefore, the popular bias may well be expected moſt ſtrongly to incline.</p>
                     <p>Experience ſpeaks the ſame language in this caſe. The federal adminiſtration, though hitherto very defective, in compariſon with what may be hoped under a better ſyſtem, had during the war, and particularly, whilſt the independent fund of paper emiſſions was in credit, an activity and importance as great as it can well have, in any future circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatever. It was engaged too in a courſe of meaſures, which had for their object, the protection of every thing that was dear, and the acquiſition of every thing that could be deſirable to the people at large. It was nevertheleſs, invariably found, after the tranſient enthuſiaſm for the early congreſſes was over, that the attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own particular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that the federal council was at no time the idol of popular favor; and that oppoſition to propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enlargements of its powers and importance, was the ſide uſually taken by the men who wiſhed to build their political conſequence on the prepoſſeſſions of their fellow citizens.</p>
                     <p>If therefore, as has been elſewhere remarked, the people ſhould in future become more partial to the federal than to the ſtate governments, the change can
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021127_0323_0FB24F88CA8DE780"/>
only reſult from ſuch manifeſt and irreſiſtible proofs of a better adminiſtration, as will overcome all their antecedent propenſities. And in that caſe, the people ought not ſurely to be precluded from giving moſt of their confidence where they may diſcover it to be moſt due: But even in that caſe, the ſtate governments could have little to apprehend, becauſe it is only within a certain ſphere, that the federal power can, in the nature of things, be advantageouſly adminiſtered.</p>
                     <p>The remaining points on which I propoſed to compare the federal and ſtate governments, are the diſpoſition, and the faculty they may reſpectively poſſeſs, to reſiſt and fruſtrate the meaſures of each other.</p>
                     <p>It has been already proved, that the members of the federal will be more dependent on the members of the ſtate governments, than the latter will be on the former. It has appeared alſo, that the prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the people on whom both will depend, will be more on the ſide of the ſtate governments, than of the federal government. So far as the diſpoſition of each, towards the other, may be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by theſe cauſes, the ſtate governments muſt clearly have the advantage. But in a diſtinct and very important point of view, the advantage will lie on the ſame ſide. The prepoſſeſſions which the members themſelves will carry into the federal government, will generally be favorable to the ſtates; whilſt it will rarely happen, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſtate governments will carry into the public councils, a bias in favor of the general government. A local ſpirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of the congreſs, than a national ſpirit will prevail in the legiſlatures of the particular ſtates. Every one knows that a great proportion of the errors committed by the ſtate legiſlatures proceeds from the diſpoſition of the members to ſacrifice the comprehenſive and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent intereſts of the ſtate, to the particular and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:021127_0324_0FB24F8C037E93B8"/>
ſeparate views of the counties or diſtricts in which they reſide. And if they do not ſufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the collective welfare of their particular ſtate, how can it be imagined, that they will make the aggregate proſperity of the union, and the dignity and reſpectability of its government, the objects of their affections and conſultations? For the ſame reaſon, that the members of the ſtate legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures will be unlikely to attach themſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to national objects, the members of the federal legiſlature will be likely to attach themſelves too much to local objects. The ſtates will be to the latter, what counties and towns are to the former. Meaſures will too often be decided according to their probable effect, not on the national proſperity and happineſs, but on the prejudices, intereſts and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of the governments and people of the individual ſtates. What is the ſpirit that has in general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized the proceedings of congreſs? A peruſal of their journals as well as the candid acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch as have had a ſeat in that aſſembly, will inform us, that the members have but too frequently diſplayed the character, rather of partizans of their reſpective ſtates, than of impartial guardians of a common intereſt; that where, on one occaſion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſacrifices have been made of local conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to the aggrandizement of the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the great intereſts of the nation have ſuffered on an hundred, from an undue atttention to the local prejudices, intereſts and views of the particular ſtates. I mean not by theſe reflections to inſinuate, that the new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the exiſting government may have purſued, much leſs that its views will be as confined as thoſe of the ſtate legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures; but only that it will partake ſufficiently of the ſpirit of both, to be diſinclined to invade the rights of the individual ſtates, or the prerogatives of their governments. The motives on the part of the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:021127_0325_0FB24F9669A967C0"/>
ſtate governments, to augment their prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government, will be over-ruled by no reciprocal prediſpoſitions in the members.</p>
                     <p>Were it admitted however that the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may feel an equal diſpoſition with the ſtate governments to extend its power beyond the due limits, the latter would ſtill have the advantage in the means of defeating ſuch encroachments. If an act of a particular ſtate, though unfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that ſtate, and ſhould not too groſsly violate the oaths of the ſtate officers, it is executed immediately, and of courſe, by means on the ſpot, and depending on the ſtate alone. The oppoſition of the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the interpoſition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the ſide of the ſtate, and the evil could not be prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means which muſt always be reſorted to with reluctance and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. On the other hand, ſhould an unwarrantable meaſure of the federal government be unpopular in particular ſtates, which would ſeldom fail to be the caſe, or even a warrantable meaſure be ſo, which may ſometimes be the caſe, the means of oppoſition to it are powerful and at hand. The diſquietude of the people, their repugnance and perhaps refuſal to co-operate with the officers of the union, the frowns of the executive magiſtracy of the ſtate, the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments created by legiſlative devices, which would often be added on ſuch occaſions, would oppoſe in any ſtate difficulties not to be deſpiſed; would form in a large ſtate very ſerious impediments, and where the ſentiments of ſeveral adjoining ſtates happened to be in uniſon, would preſent obſtructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.</p>
                     <p>But ambitious encroachments of the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the authority of the ſtate governments, would
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:021127_0326_0FB24F97F2527240"/>
not excite the oppoſition of a ſingle ſtate or of a few ſtates only. They would be ſignals of general alarm. Every government would eſpou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> The ſame combination in ſhort would reſult from an apprehenſion of the federal, as was produced by the dread of a foreign yoke; and unleſs the projected innovations ſhould be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily renounced, the ſame appeal to a trial of force would be made in the one caſe, as was made in the other. But what degree of madneſs could ever drive the federal government to ſuch an extremity? In the conteſt with Great-Britain, one part of the empire was employed againſt the other. The more nume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ous part invaded the rights of the leſs numerous part. The attempt was unjuſt and unwiſe; but it was not in ſpeculation abſolutely chimerical. But what would be the conteſt in the caſe we are ſuppoſing? Who would be the parties? A few repreſentatives of the people would be oppoſed to the people themſelves; or rather one ſet of repreſenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ives would be contending againſt thirteen ſets of repreſentatives, with the whole body of their common conſtituents on the ſide of the latter.</p>
                     <p>The only refuge left for thoſe who prophecy the downfal of the ſtate governments; is the viſionary ſuppoſition that the federal government may previouſly accumulate a military force for the projects of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The reaſonings contained in theſe papers muſt have been employed to little purpoſe indeed, if it could be neceſſary now to diſprove the reality of this danger. That the people and the ſtates ſhould for a ſufficient period of time elect an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of men ready to betray both; that the traitors ſhould throughout this period, uniformly and ſyſtematically purſue ſome fixed plan for the extenſion of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eſtabliſhment; that the governments and the people of the ſtates ſhould ſilently and patiently behold
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021127_0327_0FB24F98C9807308"/>
the gathering ſtorm, and continue to ſupply the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, until it ſhould be prepared to burſt on their own heads, muſt appear to every one more like the inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent dreams of a delirious jealouſy, or the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal, than like the ſober apprehenſions of genuine patriotiſm. Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant as the ſuppoſition is, let it however be made. Let a regular army, fully equal to the reſources of the country be formed; and let it be entirely at the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the federal government; ſtill it would not be going too far to ſay, that the ſtate governments with the people on their ſide would be able to repel the danger. The higheſt number to which, according to the beſt computation, a ſtanding army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of ſouls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield in the United States an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thouſand men. To theſe would be oppoſed a militia amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men choſen from among themſelves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments poſſeſſing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumſtanced could ever be conquered by ſuch a proportion of regular troops. Thoſe who are beſt acquainted with the late ſucceſsful reſiſtance of this country againſt the Britiſh arms will be moſt inclined to deny the poſſibility of it. Beſides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans poſſeſs over the people of almoſt every other nation, the exiſtence of ſubordinate governments to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier againſt the enterprizes of ambition, more inſurmountable than any which a ſimple government of any form can admit of. Notwithſtanding the military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ſeveral kingdoms of Europe, which are
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:021127_0328_0FB24F9BDEA2A6C0"/>
carried as far as the public reſources will bear, the governments are afraid to truſt the people with arms. And it is not certain that with this aid alone, they would not be able to ſhake off their yokes. But were the people to poſſeſs the additional advantages of local governments choſen by themſelves, who could collect the national will, and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by theſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greateſt aſſurance that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be ſpeedily overturned, in ſpite of the legions which ſurround it. Let us not inſult the free and gallant citizens of America with the ſuſpicion that they would be leſs able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual poſſeſſion, than the debaſed ſubjects of arbitrary power would be to reſcue theirs from the hands of their oppreſſors. Let us rather no longer inſult them with the ſuppoſition, that they can ever reduce themſelves to the neceſſity of making the experiment, by a blind and tame ſubmiſſion to the long train of inſidious meaſures, which muſt precede and produce it.</p>
                     <p>The argument under the preſent head may be put into a very conciſe form, which appears altogether concluſive. Either the mode in which the federal government is to be conſtructed will render it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently dependant on the people, or it will not. On the firſt ſuppoſition, it will be reſtrained by that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from forming ſchemes obnoxious to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents. On the other ſuppoſition it will not poſſeſs the confidence of the people, and its ſchemes of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation will be eaſily defeated by the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; who will be ſupported by the people.</p>
                     <p>On ſumming up the conſiderations ſtated in this and the laſt paper, they ſeem to amount to the moſt convincing evidence, that the powers propoſed to be lodged in the federal government, are as little formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to thoſe reſerved to the individual ſtates, as they
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:021127_0329_0FB24F9F8D26A360"/>
are indiſpenſibly neceſſary to accompliſh the purpoſes of the union; and that all thoſe alarms which have been ſounded, of a meditated and conſequential anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of the ſtate governments, muſt, on the moſt favorable interpretation, be aſcribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER XLVII. The Meaning of the Maxim, which requires a Separation of the Departments of Power, examined and aſcertained.</head>
                     <p>HAVING reviewed the general form of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed government, and the general maſs of power allotted to it; I proceed to examine the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtructure of this government, and the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of this maſs of power among its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent parts.</p>
                     <p>One of the principal objections inculcated by the more reſpectable adverſaries to the conſtitution, is its ſuppoſed violation of the political maxim, that the legiſlative, executive and judiciary departments ought to be ſeperate and diſtinct. In the ſtructure of the federal government, no regard, it is ſaid, ſeems to have been paid to this eſſential precaution in favor of liberty. The ſeveral departments of power are diſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>No political truth is certainly of greater intrinſic value or is ſtamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all

powers legiſlative, executive and judiciary in the ſame hands, whether of one, a few or many, and whether hereditary, ſelf appointed, or elective, may juſtly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the federal conſtitution therefore, really chargeable with this accumulation of power or with a mixture of powers, having a dangerous tendency to ſuch an accumulation, no further arguments would be neceſſary to inſpire a univerſal reprobation of the ſyſtem. I perſuade myſelf however, that it will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> made apparent to every one, that the charge cannot be ſupported, and that the maxim on which it relies, has been totally miſconceived and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. In order to form correct ideas on this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubject, it will be proper to inveſtigate the ſenſe, in which the preſervation of liberty requires, that the three great departments of power ſhould be ſeparate and diſtinct.</p>
                     <p>The oracle who is always conſulted and cited on this ſubject, is the celebrated Monteſquieu. If he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the ſcience of politics, he has the merit at leaſt of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing and recommending it moſt effectually to the attention of mankind. Let us endeavour in the firſt place to aſcertain his meaning on this point.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh conſtitution was to Monteſqueiu, what Homer has been to the didactic writers on epic poetry. As the latter have conſidered the work of the immortal bard, as the perfect model from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by which all ſimilar works were to be judged; ſo this great political critic appears to have viewed the conſtitution of England as the ſtandard, or to uſe his own expreſſion, as the mirror of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical liberty; and to have delivered in the form of elementary truths, the ſeveral characteriſtic princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that particular ſyſtem. That we may be ſure then not to miſtake his meaning in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſe,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021127_0331_0FB24FA713C7B880"/>
let us recur to the ſource from which the maxim was drawn.</p>
                     <p>On the ſlighteſt view of the Britiſh conſtitution we muſt perceive, that the legiſlative, executive, and judiciary departments are by no means totally ſeparate and diſtinct from each other. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive magiſtrate forms an integral part of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority. He alone has the prerogative of making treaties with foreign ſovereigns, which when made, have, under certain limitations, the force of legiſlative acts. All the member<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the judiciary department are appointed by him; can be removed by him on the addreſs of the two houſes of parliament, and form, when he pleaſes to conſult them, one of his conſtitutional councils. One branch of the legiſlative department forms alſo, a great conſtitutional council to the executive chief; as on another hand, it is the ſole depoſitary of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial power in caſes of impeachment, and is inveſted with the ſupreme appellate juriſdiction, in all other caſes. The judges again are ſo far connected with the legiſlative department, as often to attend and participate in its deliberations, though not admitted to a legiſlative vote.</p>
                     <p>From theſe facts by which Monteſquieu was guided it may clearly be inferred, that in ſaying,
<q>there can be no liberty where the legiſlative and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers are united in the ſame perſon, or body of magiſtrates,</q>
or,
<q>if the power of judging be not ſeparated from the legiſlative and executive powers,</q>
he did not mean that theſe departments ought to have no <hi>partial agency</hi> in, or no <hi>control</hi> over the acts of each other. His meaning, as his own words import, and ſtill more concluſively as illuſtrated by the example in his eye, can amount to no more than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, that where the <hi>whole</hi> power of one department is exerciſed by the ſame hands which poſſeſs the <hi>whole</hi> power of another department, the fundamental principles of a free conſtitution, are
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021127_0332_0FB24FAA75F47060"/>
ſubverted. This would not have been the caſe in the conſtitution examined by him, if the king who is the ſole executive magiſtrate, had poſſeſſed alſo the complete legiſlative power, or the ſupreme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice; or if the entire legiſlative body, had poſſeſſed the ſupreme judiciary, or the ſupreme executive authority. This however is not among the vices of that conſtitution. The magiſtrate in whom the whole executive power reſides cannot of himſelf make a law, though he can put a negative on every law, nor adminiſter juſtice in perſon, though he has the appointment of thoſe who do adminiſter it. The judges can exerciſe no executive prerogative, though they are ſhoots from the executive ſtock, nor any legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative function, though they may be adviſed with by the legiſlative councils. The entire legiſlature, can perform no judiciary act; though by the joint act of two of its branches, the judges may be removed from their offices; and though one of its branches is poſſeſſed of the judicial power in the laſt reſort. The entire legiſlature again can exerciſe no executive prerogative, though one of its branches<note n="*" place="bottom">The King.</note> conſtitutes the ſupreme executive magiſtracy; and another, on the impeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the ſubordinate officers in the executive department.</p>
                     <p>The reaſons on which Monteſquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonſtration of his meaning.
<q>When the legiſlative and executive powers are united in the ſame perſon or body,
ſays he,
there can be no liberty, becauſe apprehenſions may ariſe leſt <hi>the ſame</hi> monarch or ſenate ſhould <hi>enact</hi> tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical laws, to <hi>execute</hi> them in a tyrannical manner.</q>
Again
<q>Were the power of judging joined with the legiſlative, the life and liberty of the ſubject would be expoſed to arbitrary control, for <hi>the judge</hi> would then be <hi>the legiſlator.</hi> Were it joined to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power, <hi>the judge</hi> might behave with all the violence of <hi>an oppreſſor.</hi>
                        </q>
Some of theſe reaſons
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021127_0333_0FB24FABAFD9A628"/>
are more fully explained in other paſſages; but briefly ſtated as they are here, they ſufficiently eſtabliſh the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.</p>
                     <p>If we look into the conſtitutions of the ſeveral ſtates, we find that notwithſtanding the emphatical, and in ſome inſtances, the unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down, there is not a ſingle inſtance in which the ſeveral departments of power have been kept abſolutely ſeparate and diſtinct. New-Hampſhire, whoſe conſtitution was the laſt formed, ſeems to have been fully aware of the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility and inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of theſe departments; and has qualified the doctrine by declaring

                           <hi>that the legiſlative, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and judiciary powers ought to be kept as ſeparate from, and independent of each other</hi> as the nature of a free government will admit; or as is conſiſtent with that chain of connection, that binds the whole fabric of the conſtitution in one indiſſoluble bond of unity and amity.</q>
Her conſtitution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly mixes theſe departments in ſeveral reſpects. The ſenate, which is a branch of the legiſlative department, is alſo a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments. The preſident who is the head of the executive department, is the preſiding member alſo of the ſenate; and beſides an equal vote in all caſes, has a caſting vote in caſe of a tie. The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive head is himſelf eventually elective every year by the legiſlative department; and his council is every year choſen by and from the members of the ſame department. Several of the officers of ſtate are alſo appointed by the legiſlature. And the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the executive department.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts has obſerved a ſufficient though leſs pointed caution in expreſſing this fundamental article of liberty. It declares,
<q>that the legiſlative department ſhall never exerciſe the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:021127_0334_0FB24FB4AC1A2558"/>
executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive ſhall never exerciſe the legiſlative and judicial powers, or either of them: The judicial ſhall never exerciſe the legiſlative and executive powers, or either of them.</q>
This declaration correſponds preciſely with the doctrine of Monteſquieu, as it has been explained, and is not in a ſingle point violated by the plan of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. It goes no farther than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exerciſing the powers of another department. In the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to which it is prefixed, a partial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate has a qualified negative on the legiſlative body; and the ſenate, which is a part of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, is a court of impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary departments. The members of the judiciary department again are appointable by the executive department, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable by the ſame authority, on the addreſs of the two legiſlative branches. Laſtly, a number of the officers of government are annually appointed by the legiſlative department. As the appointment to offices, particularly executive offices, is in its nature an executive function, the compilers of the conſtitution have in this laſt point at leaſt, violated the rule eſtabliſhed by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I paſs over the conſtitution of Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, becauſe they were formed prior to the revolution; and even before the principle under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination had become an object of political attention.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution of New-York contains no decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on this ſubject; but appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly blending the different departments. It gives nevertheleſs to the executive magiſtrate a partial controul over the legiſlative department; and what is more, gives a like controul to the judiciary department, and even blends the executive and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:021127_0335_0FB24FB65DD37F80"/>
judiciary departments in the exerciſe of this controul. In its council of appointment, members of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative are aſſociated with the executive authority in the appointment of officers both executive and judiciary. And its court for the trial of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and correction of errors, is to conſiſt of one branch of the legiſlature and the principal members of the judiciary department.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution of New-Jerſey has blended the different powers of government more than any of the preceding. The governor, who is the executive magiſtrate, is appointed by the legiſlature; is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and ordinary or ſurrogate of the ſtate; is a member of the ſupreme court of appeals, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident with a caſting vote, of one of the legiſlative branches. The ſame legiſlative branch acts again as executive council of the governor, and with him conſtitutes the court of appeals. The members of the judiciary department are appointed by the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative department, and removeable by one branch of it, on the impeachment of the other.</p>
                     <p>According to the conſtitution of Pennſylvania, the preſident, who is head of the executive department, is annually elected by a vote in which the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive department predominates. In conjunction with an executive council, he appoints the members of the judiciary department, and forms a court of impeachments for trial of all officers, judiciary as well as executive. The judges of the ſupreme court, and juſtices of the peace, ſeem alſo to be removeable by the legiſlature; and the executive power of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning in certain caſes to be referred to the ſame department. The members of the executive council are made EX OFFICIO juſtices of peace throughout the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>In Delaware, the chief executive magiſtrate is annually elected by the legiſlative department. The ſpeakers of the two legiſlative branches are vice-preſidents in the executive department. The
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:021127_0336_0FB24FBEE7E2B950"/>
executive chief, with ſix others, appointed three by each of the legiſlative branches, conſtitute the ſupreme court of appeals: He is joined with the legiſlative department in the appointment of the other judges. Throughout the ſtates it appears that the members of the legiſlature may at the ſame time be juſtices of the peace. In this ſtate, the members of one branch of it are EX OFFICIO juſtices of the peace; as are alſo the members of the executive council. The principal officers of the executive department are appointed by the legiſlative; and one branch of the latter forms a court of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All officers may be removed on addreſs of the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>Maryland has adopted the maxim in the moſt unqualified terms; declaring that the legiſlative, executive and judicial powers of government, ought to be forever ſeparate and diſtinct from each other. Her conſtitution, notwithſtanding makes the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive magiſtrate appointable by the legiſlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment; and the members of the judiciary, by the executive department.</p>
                     <p>The language of Virginia is ſtill more pointed on this ſubject. Her conſtitution declares,
<q>that the legiſlative, executive and judiciary departments, ſhall be ſeparate and diſtinct; ſo that neither exerciſe the powers properly belonging to the other; nor ſhall any perſon exerciſe the powers of more than one of them at the ſame time; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that the juſtices of county courts ſhall be eligible to either houſe of aſſembly.</q>
Yet we find not only this expreſs exception, with reſpect to the members of the inferior courts; but that the chief magiſtrate with his executive council are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the legiſlature; that two members of the latter are triennially diſplaced at the pleaſure of the legiſlature; and that all the principal officers, both executive and judiciary, are filled by the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. The executive prerogative of pardoning,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:021127_0337_0FB24FCC54337E58"/>
alſo is in one caſe veſted in the legiſlative depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution of North-Carolina, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,

refers at the ſame time to the legiſlative department, the appointment not only of the executive chief, but all the principal officers within both that and the judiciary department.</p>
                     <p>In South-Carolina, the conſtitution makes the executive magiſtracy eligible by the legiſlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. It gives to the latter alſo the appointment of the members of the judiciary department, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding even juſtices of the peace and ſheriffs; and the appointment of officers in the executive department, down to captains in the army and navy of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>In the conſtitution of Georgia, where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<q>that the legiſlative, executive and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary departments ſhall be ſeparate and diſtinct, ſo that neither exerciſe the powers properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the other.</q>
We find that the executive department is to be filled by appointments of the legiſlature; and the executive prerogative of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be finally exerciſed by the ſame authority. Even juſtices of the peace are to be appointed by the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>In citing theſe caſes in which the legiſlative, executive and judiciary departments have not been kept totally ſeparate and diſtinct, I wiſh not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zations of the ſeveral ſtate governments. I am fully aware that among the many excellent principles which they exemplify, they carry ſtrong marks of the haſte, and ſtill ſtronger of the inexperience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they were framed. It is but too obvious that in ſome inſtances, the fundamental principle under conſideration has been violated by too great a mixture, and even an actual conſolidation of the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:021127_0338_0FB24FD0ED547A18"/>
different powers; and that in no inſtance has a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent proviſion been made for maintaining in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the ſeparation delineated on paper. What I have wiſhed to evince is, that the charge brought againſt the propoſed conſtitution, of violating a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred maxim of free government, is warranted neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author; nor by the ſenſe in which it has hitherto been underſtood in America. This intereſting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will be reſumed in the enſuing paper.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER LXVIII. The ſame Subject continued, with a View to the Means of giving Efficacy in Practice to that Maxim.</head>
                     <p>IT was ſhewn in the laſt paper, that the political apothegm there examined, does not require that the legiſlative, executive and judiciary departments ſhould be wholly unconnected with each other. I ſhall undertake in the next place, to ſhew that unleſs theſe departments be ſo far connected and blended, as to give to each a conſtitutional controul over the others, the degree of ſeparation which the maxim requires as eſſential to a free government, can never in practice be duly maintained.</p>
                     <p>It is agreed on all ſides, that the powers properly belonging to one of the departments, ought not to be directly and compleatly adminiſtered by either of the other departments. It is equally evident, that neither of them ought to poſſeſs directly or indirectly, an over-ruling influence over the others in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their reſpective powers. It will not be denied that power is of an incroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually reſtrained from paſſing the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:021127_0339_0FB24FD66E988B08"/>
limits, aſſigned to it. After diſcriminating therefore in theory, the ſeveral claſſes of power, as they may in their nature be legiſlative, executive or judiciary; the next and moſt difficult taſk, is to provide ſome practical ſecurity for each againſt the invaſion of the others. What this ſecurity ought to be, is the great problem to be ſolved.</p>
                     <p>Will it be ſufficient to mark with preciſion the boundaries of theſe departments in the conſtitution of the government, and to truſt to theſe parchment barriers againſt the encroaching ſpirit of power? This is the ſecurity which appears to have been princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally relied on by the compilers of moſt of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican conſtitutions. But experience aſſures us that the efficacy of the proviſion has been greatly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and that ſome more adequate defence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary for the more feeble, againſt the more powerful members of the government. The legiſlative department is every where extending the ſphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.</p>
                     <p>The founders of our republics have ſo much merit for the wiſdom which they have diſplayed, that no taſk can be leſs pleaſing than that of pointing out the errors into which they have fallen. A reſpect for truth however obliges us to remark, that they ſeem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and all-graſping prerogative of an hereditary magiſtrate, ſupported and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legiſlative authority. They ſeem never to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the danger from legiſlative uſurpations, which by aſſembling all power in the ſame hands, muſt lead to the ſame tyranny as is threatened by executive uſurpations.</p>
                     <p>In a government, where numerous and extenſive prerogatives are placed in the hands of a hereditary monarch, the executive department is very juſtly regarded as the ſource of danger, and watched with
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:021127_0340_0FB24FD996E78A68"/>
all the jealouſy which a zeal for liberty ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. In a democracy, where a multitude of people exerciſe in perſon the legiſlative functions, and are continually expoſed by their incapacity for regular deliberation and concerted meaſures, to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magiſtrates, tyranny may well be apprehended on ſome favourable emergency, to ſtart up in the ſame quarter. But in a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive republic, where the executive magiſtracy is carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the legiſlative power is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by an aſſembly, which is inſpired by a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed influence over the people with an intrepid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in its own ſtrength; which is ſufficiently nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to feel all the paſſions which actuate a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; yet not ſo numerous as to be incapable of purſuing the objects of its paſſions, by means which reaſon preſcribes; it is againſt the enterpriſing ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this department, that the people ought to indulge all their jealouſy and exhauſt all their precautions.</p>
                     <p>The legiſlative department derives a ſuperiority in our governments from other circumſtances. Its conſtitutional powers being at once more extenſive and leſs ſuſceptible of preciſe limits, it can with the greater facility, maſk under complicated and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect meaſures, the encroachments which it makes, on the co-ordinate departments. It is not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a queſtion of real nicety in legiſlative bodies, whether the operation of a particular meaſure, will, or will not extend beyond the legiſlative ſphere. On the other ſide, the executive power being reſtrained within a narrower compaſs, and being more ſimple in its nature; and the judiciary being deſcribed by land marks, ſtill leſs uncertain, projects of uſurpation by either of theſe departments, would immediately betray and defeat themſelves. Nor is this all: As the legiſlative department alone has acceſs to the pockets of the people, and has in ſome conſtitutions full diſcretion, and in all, a prevailing influence
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:021127_0341_0FB24FDD352C4A18"/>
over the pecuniary rewards of thoſe who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives ſtill greater facility to encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the former.</p>
                     <p>I have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I advance on this ſubject. Were it neceſſary to verify this experience by particular proofs, they might be multiplied without end. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the records and archives of every ſtate in the union. But as a more conciſe and at the ſame time, equally ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory evidence I will refer to the example of two ſtates, atteſted by two unexceptionable authorities.</p>
                     <p>The firſt example is that of Virginia, a ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te which, as we have ſeen, has expreſsly declared in its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that the three great departments ought not to be intermixed. The authority in ſupport of it is Mr. Jefferſon, who, beſides his other advantages for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the operation of the government, was himſelf the chief magiſtrate of it. In order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impreſſed him on this ſubject, it will be neceſſary to quote a paſſage of ſome length from his very intereſting
"Notes on the ſtate of Virginia."
(p. 195)
<q>All the powers of government, legiſlative, executive and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, reſult to the legiſlative body. The concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating theſe in the ſame hands is preciſely the definition of de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>potic government. It will be no alleviation that theſe powers will be exerciſed by a plurality of hands, and not by a ſingle one. One hundred and ſeventy-three deſpots would ſurely be as oppreſſive as one. Let thoſe who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us that they are choſen by ourſelves. An <hi>elective deſpotiſm</hi> was not the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we fought for; but one which ſhould not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government ſhould be ſo divided and balanced among ſeveral bodies of magiſtracy, as that no one could tranſcend their
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:021127_0342_0FB24FDF302BD538"/>
legal limits, without being effectually checked and reſtrained by the others. For this reaſon, that convention which paſſed the ordinance of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment laid its foundation on this baſis, that the legiſlative, executive and judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould be ſeparate and diſtinct, ſo that no perſon ſhould exerciſe the powers of more than one of them at the ſame time. <hi>But no barrier was provided between theſe ſeveral powers.</hi> The judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary and executive members were left dependent on the legiſlative for their ſubſiſtence in office, and ſome of them for their continuance in it. If therefore the legiſlature aſſumes executive and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary powers, no oppoſition is likely to be made; nor if made can be effectual; becauſe in that caſe, they may put their proceeding into the form of an act of aſſembly, which will rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> them obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory on the other branches. They have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>in many</hi> inſtances <hi>decided rights</hi> which ſhould have been left to <hi>judiciary controverſy</hi>; and <hi>the direction of the executive, during the whole time of their ſeſſion, is becoming habitual and familiar.</hi>

                     <p>The other ſtate which I ſhall have for an example, is Pennſylvania; and the other authority the council of cenſors which aſſembled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part of the duty of this body, as marked out by the conſtitution, was
<q>to enquire whether the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had been preſerved inviolate in every part; and whether the legiſlative and executive branches of government had performed their duty as guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the people, or aſſumed to themſelves, or exerciſed other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the conſtitution.</q>
In the execution of this truſt, the council were neceſſarily led to a compariſon, of both the legiſlative and executive proceedings, with the conſtitutional powers of theſe departments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the truth of moſt of which, both ſides in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſubſcribed, it appears that the conſtitution had
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:021127_0343_0FB24FE1EE8220C0"/>
been flagrantly violated by the legiſlature in a variety of important inſtances.</p>
                     <p>A great number of laws had been paſſed violating without any apparent neceſſity, the rule requiring that all bills of a publick nature ſhall be previouſly printed for the conſideration of the people; although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the conſtitution, againſt improper acts of the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitutional trial by jury had been violated; and powers aſſumed, which had not been delegated by the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Executive powers had been uſurped.</p>
                     <p>The ſalaries of the judges, which the conſtitution expreſsly requires to be fixed, had been occaſionally varied; and caſes belonging to the judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, frequently drawn within legiſlative cognizance and determination.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who wiſh to ſee the ſeveral particulars fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under each of theſe heads, may conſult the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the council which are in print. Some of them, it will be found may be imputable to peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances connected with the war: But the greater part of them may be conſidered as the ſpontaneous ſhoots of an ill conſtituted government.</p>
                     <p>It appears alſo, that the executive department had not been innocent of frequent breaches of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. There are three obſervations however, which ought to be made on this head. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the inſtances, were either immediately produced by the neceſſities of the war, or recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Congreſs or the commander in chief. <hi>Second.</hi> In moſt of the other inſtances, they conformed either to the declared or the known ſentiments of the legiſlative department. <hi>Third.</hi> The executive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of Pennſylvania is diſtinguiſhed from that of the other ſtates, by the number of members com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it. In this reſpect it has as much affinity to a legiſlative aſſembly, as to an executive council. And being at once exempt from the reſtraint of an
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:021127_0344_0FB24FE2F97B8F98"/>
individual reſponſibility for the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from mutual example and joint influence; unauthoriſed meaſures would of courſe be more freely hazarded, than where the executive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment is adminiſtered by a ſingle hand or by a few hands.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion which I am warranted in drawing from theſe obſervations is, that a mere demarkation on parchment of the conſtitutional limits of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral departments, is not a ſufficient guard againſt thoſe encroachments which lead to a tyrannical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration of all the powers of government in the ſame hands.</p>

                     <p>THE author of the
"Notes on the ſtate of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,"
quoted in the laſt paper has ſubjoined to that valuable work, the draught of a conſtitution which had been prepared in order to be laid before a convention expected to be called in 1783, by the legiſlature, for the eſtabliſhment of a conſtitution for that commonwealth. The plan, like every thing from the ſame pen, marks a turn of thinking original, comprehenſive and accurate; and is the more worthy of attention, as it equally diſplays a fervent attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to republican government, and an enlightened view of the dangerous propenſities againſt which it ought to be guarded. One of the precautions which he propoſes, and on which he appears ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of power, againſt the invaſions of the ſtronger, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps altogether his own, and as it immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the ſubject of our preſent enquiry, ought not to be overlooked.</p>

                        <pb n="108" facs="unknown:021127_0345_0FB24FE538D9F868"/>His propoſition is,
<q>that whenever any two of the three branches of government ſhall concur in opinion, each by the voices of two thirds of their whole number, that a convention is neceſſary for altering the conſtitution or <hi>correcting breaches of it,</hi> a convention ſhall be called for the purpoſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the conſtitutional charter, under which the ſeveral branches of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hold their power, is derived; it ſeems ſtrictly conſonant to the republican theory, to recur to the ſame original authority, not only whenever it may be neceſſary to enlarge, diminiſh, or new-model the powers of government; but alſo whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others. The ſeveral departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common commiſſion, neither of them, it is evident, can pretend to an excluſive or ſuperior right of ſettling the boundaries between their reſpective powers; and how are the encroachments of the ſtronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be redreſſed, without an appeal to the people themſelves; who, as the grantors of the commiſſion, can alone declare its true meaning and enforce its obſervance?</p>
                     <p>There is certainly great force in this reaſoning, and it muſt be allowed to prove, that a conſtitutional road to the deciſion of the people, ought to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary occaſions. But there appear to be inſuperable objections againſt the propoſed recurrence to the people, as a proviſion in all caſes for keeping the ſeveral departments of power within their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional limits.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, the proviſion does not reach the caſe of a combination of two of the departments againſt a third. If the legiſlative authority, which poſſeſſes ſo many means of operating on the motives
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:021127_0346_0FB24FE9C370A168"/>
of the other departments, ſhould be able to gain to its intereſt either of the others, or even one third of its members, the remaining department could derive no advantage from this remedial proviſion. I do not dwell however, on this objection, becauſe it may be thought to lie rather againſt the modification of the principle, than againſt the principle itſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, it may be conſidered as an objection inherent in the principle, that as every appeal to the people would carry an implication of ſome defect in the government, frequent appeals would in great meaſure deprive the government of that veneration which time beſtows on every thing, and without which perhaps the wiſeſt and freeſt governments would not poſſeſs the requiſite ſtability. If it be true that all governments reſt on opinion, it is no leſs true that the ſtrength of opinion in each individual, and its practical influence on his conduct, depend much on the number which be ſuppoſes to have entertained the ſame opinion. The reaſon of man, like man himſelf, is timid and cautious, when left alone; and acquires firmneſs and confidence, in proportion to the number with which it is aſſociated. When the examples, which fortify opinion, are <hi>antient</hi> as well as <hi>numerous,</hi> they are known to have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect. In a nation of philoſophers, this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ought to be diſregarded. A reverence for the laws, would be ſufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened reaſon. But a nation of philoſophers is as little to be expected as the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical race of kings wiſhed for by Plato. And in every other nation, the moſt rational government will not find it a ſuperfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community on its ſide.</p>
                     <p>The danger of diſturbing the public tranquility by intereſting too ſtrongly the public paſſions, is a ſtill more ſerious objection againſt a frequent reference of conſtitutional queſtions, to the deciſion of the whole ſociety. Notwithſtanding the ſucceſs which
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:021127_0347_0FB24FEBF0A85450"/>
has attended the reviſions of our eſtabliſhed forms of government, and which does ſo much honor to the virtue and intelligence of the people of America, it muſt be confeſſed, that the experiments are of too tickliſh a nature to be unneceſſarily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the exiſting conſtitutions were formed in the midſt of a danger which repreſſed the paſſions moſt unfriendly to order and concord; of an enthuſiaſtic confidence of the people in their patriotic leaders, which ſtifled the ordinary diverſity of opinions on great national queſtions; of a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ardor for new and oppoſite forms, produced by a univerſal reſentment and indignation againſt the antient government; and whilſt no ſpirit of party, connected with the changes to be made, or the abuſes to be reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation. The future ſituations in which we muſt expect to be uſually placed, do not preſent any equivalent ſecurity againſt the danger which is apprehended.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt objection of all is that the deciſions which would probably reſult from ſuch appeals, would not anſwer the purpoſe of maintaining the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional equilibrium of the government. We have ſeen that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legiſlative, at the expence of the other departments. The appeals to the people therefore, would uſually be made by the executive and judiciary departments. But whether made by one ſide or the other, would each ſide enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their different ſituations. The members of the executive and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary departments, are few in number, and can be perſonally known to a ſmall part only of the people. The latter by the mode of their appointment, as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are too far removed from the people to ſhare much in their prepoſſeſſions. The former are generally the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of jealouſy: and their admiſtration is always
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:021127_0348_0FB24FED7A261BC0"/>
liable to be diſcoloured and rendered unpopular. The members of the legiſlative department, on the other hand, are numerous. They are diſtributed and dwell among the people at large. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections of blood, of friendſhip and of acquaintance, embrace a great proportion of the moſt influential part of the ſociety. The nature of their public truſt implies a perſonal influence among the people, and that they are more immediately the confidential guardians of the rights and liberties of the people. With theſe advantages, it can hardly be ſuppoſed that the adverſe party would have an equal chance for a favorable iſſue.</p>
                     <p>But the legiſlative party would not only be able to plead their cauſe moſt ſucceſsfully with the people: They would probably be conſtituted themſelves the judges. The ſame influence which had gained them an election into the legiſlature, would gain them a ſeat in the convention. If this ſhould not be the caſe with all, it would probably be the caſe with many, and pretty certainly with thoſe leading cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, on whom every thing depends in ſuch bodies. The convention in ſhort would be compoſed chiefly of men, who had been, who actually were, or who expected to be, members of the department whoſe conduct was arraigned. They would conſequently be parties to the very queſtion to be decided by them.</p>
                     <p>It might however ſometimes happen, that appeals would be made under circumſtances leſs adverſe to the executive and judiciary departments. The uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the legiſlature might be ſo flagrant and ſo ſudden, as to admit of no ſpecious colouring A ſtrong party among themſelves might take ſide with the other branches. The executive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of the people. In ſuch a poſture of things, the public deciſion might be leſs ſwayed by prepoſſeſſions in favor of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative party. But ſtill it could never be expected to turn on the true merits of the queſtion. It would
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:021127_0349_0FB24FF004392570"/>
inevitably be connected with the ſpirit of pre-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties, or of parties ſpringing out of the queſtion itſelf. It would be connected with perſons of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed character and extenſive influence in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been agents in, or opponents of the meaſures, to which the deciſion would relate. The <hi>paſſions</hi> therefore not the <hi>reaſon,</hi> of the public, would ſit in judgment. But it is the reaſon of the public alone that ought to controul and regulate the government. The paſſions ought to be controuled and regulated by the government.</p>
                     <p>We found in the laſt paper that mere declarations in the written conſtitution, are not ſufficient to reſtrain the ſeveral departments within their legal limits. It appears in this that occaſional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an effectual proviſion, for that purpoſe. How far the proviſions of a different nature contained in the plan above quoted, might be adequate, I do not examine. Some of them are unqueſtionably founded on ſound political principles, and all of them are framed with ſingular ingenuity and preciſion.</p>

                     <p>It will be attended to, that in the examination of theſe expedients, I confine myſelf to their aptitude
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:021127_0350_0FB24FF12E192D90"/>
for <hi>enforcing</hi> the conſtitution by keeping the ſeveral departments of power within their due bounds, without particularly conſidering them, as proviſions for <hi>altering</hi> the conſtitution itſelf. In the firſt view, appeals to the people at fixed periods, appear to be nearly as ineligible, as appeals on particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as they emerge. If the periods be ſeparated by ſhort intervals, the meaſures to be reviewed and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, will have been of recent date, and will be connected with all the circumſtances which tend to viciate and pervert the reſult of occaſional reviſions. If the periods be diſtant from each other, the ſame remark will be applicable to all recent meaſures, and in proportion as the remoteneſs of the others may favor a diſpaſſionate review of them, this advantage is inſeparable from inconveniences which ſeem to counterbalance it. In the firſt place, a diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of public cenſure would be a very feeble reſtraint on power from thoſe exceſſes, to which it might be urged by the force of preſent motives. Is it to be imagined, that a legiſlative aſſembly, conſiſting of a hundred or two hundred members, eagerly bent on ſome favorite object, and breaking through the reſtraints of the conſtitution in purſuit of it, would be arreſted in their career, by conſiderations drawn from a cenſorial reviſion of their conduct at the future diſtance of ten, fifteen or twenty years? In the next place, the abuſes would often have completed their miſchievous effects, before the remedial proviſion would be applied. And in the laſt place, where this might not be the caſe, they would be of long ſtanding would have taken deep root, and would not eaſily be extirpated.</p>
                     <p>The ſcheme of reviſing the conſtitution in order to correct recent breaches of it, as well as for other purpoſes, has been actually tried in one of the ſtates. One of the objects of the council of cenſors, which met in Pennſylvania, in 1783 and 1784, was, as we have ſeen, to enquire
<q>whether the conſtitution had
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:021127_0351_0FB24FFA6E2ADCE8"/>
been violated, and whether the legiſlative and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive departments had encroached on each other.</q>
This important and novel experiment in politics, merits in ſeveral points of view, very particular attention. In ſome of them it may perhaps as a ſingle experiment, made under circumſtances ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what peculiar, be thought to be not abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. But as applied to the caſe under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it involves ſome facts which I venture to remark, as a complete and ſatisfactory illuſtration of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning which I have employed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> It appears from the names of the gentlemen who compoſed the council, that ſome at leaſt of its moſt active and leading members, had alſo been active and leading characters in the parties which pre-exiſted in the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second.</hi> It appears that the ſame active and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of the council, had been active and influential members of the legiſlative and executive branches, within the period to be reviewed; and even patrons or opponents of the very meaſures to be thus brought to the teſt of the conſtitution. Two of the members had been vice-preſidents of the ſtate, and ſeveral others, members of the executive council within the ſeven preceding years. One of them had been ſpeaker, and a number of others diſtinguiſhed members of the legiſlative aſſembly, within the ſame period.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Third.</hi> Every page of their proceedings witneſſes the effect of all theſe circumſtances on the temper of of their deliberations. Throughout the continuance of the council, it was ſplit into two fixed and violent parties. The fact is acknowledged and lamented by themſelves. Had this not been the caſe, the face of their proceedings exhibit a proof equally ſatisfactory. In all queſtions, however unimportant in themſelves, or unconnected with each other, the ſame names ſtand invariably contraſted on the oppoſite columns. Every unbiaſſed obſerver, may infer without danger
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:021127_0352_0FB24FFE1C129D70"/>
of miſtake, and at the ſame time, without meaning to reflect on either party, or any individuals of either party, that unfortunately <hi>paſſion,</hi> not <hi>reaſon,</hi> muſt have preſided over their deciſions. When men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their reaſon coolly and freely, on a variety of diſtinct queſtions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on ſome of them. When they are governed by a common paſſion, their opinions, if they are ſo to be called, will be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourth.</hi> It is at leaſt problematical, whether the deciſions of this body do not, in ſeveral inſtances, miſconſtrue the limits preſcribed for the legiſlative and executive departments, inſtead of reducing and limiting them within their conſtitutional places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifth.</hi> I have never underſtood that the deciſions of the council on conſtitutional queſtions, whether rightly or erroneouſly formed, have had any effect in varying the practice founded on legiſlative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. It even appears, if I miſtake not, that in one inſtance, the cotemporary legiſlature denied the conſtructions of the council, and actually prevailed in the conteſt.</p>
                     <p>This cenſorial body, therefore, proves at the ſame time, by its reſearches, the exiſtence of the diſeaſe; and by its example, the inefficacy of the remedy.</p>
                     <p>This concluſion cannot be invalidated by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſtate in which the experiment was made, was at that criſis, and had been for a long time before, violently heated and diſtracted by the rage of party. Is it to be preſumed, that at any future ſeptennial epoch, the ſame ſtate will be free from parties? Is it to be preſumed that any other ſtate, at the ſame or any other given period, will be exempt from them? Such an event ought to be neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed nor deſired; becauſe an extinction of parties neceſſarily implies either a univerſal alarm for the public ſafety, or an abſolute extinction of liberty.</p>
                     <p>Were the precaution taken of excluding from the aſſemblies elected by the people to reviſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding

adminiſtration of the government, all perſons who ſhould have been concerned in the government within the given period, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important taſk would probably devolve on men, who with inferior capacities, would in other reſpects be little better qualified. Although they might not have been perſonally concerned in the adminiſtration, and therefore not immediately agents in the meaſures to be examined; they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have been involved in the parties connected with theſe meaſures, and have been elected under their auſpices.</p>

                     <p>TO what expedient then ſhall we finally reſort for maintaining in practice the neceſſary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of power among the ſeveral departments, as laid down in the conſtitution? The only anſwer that can be given is, that as all theſe exterior provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are found to be inadequate, the defect muſt be ſupplied, by ſo contriving the interior ſtructure of the government, as that its ſeveral conſtituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places. Without preſuming to undertake a full developement of this important idea, I will hazard a few general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which may perhaps place it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct judgment of the principles and ſtructure of the government planned by the convention.</p>
                     <p>In order to lay a due foundation for that ſeparate and diſtinct exerciſe of the different powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which to a certain extent, is admitted on all
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:021127_0354_0FB2500282B8BF30"/>
hands to be eſſential to the preſervation of liberty, it is evident that each department ſhould have a will of its own; and conſequently ſhould be ſo conſtituted that the members of each ſhould have as little agency as poſſible in the appointment of the members of the others. Were this principle rigorouſly adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the ſupreme executive, legiſlative and judiciary magiſtracies ſhould be drawn from the ſame fountain of authority, the people, through channels, having no communication whatever with one another. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch a plan of conſtructing the ſeveral depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be leſs difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties however, and ſome additional expence, would attend the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. Some deviations therefore from the principle muſt be admitted. In the conſtitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to inſiſt rigorouſly on the principle; firſt, becauſe peculiar qualifications being eſſential in the members, the primary conſideration ought to be to ſelect that mode of choice, which beſt ſecures theſe qualifications; ſecondly, becauſe the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt ſoon deſtroy all ſenſe of dependence on the authority conferring them.</p>
                     <p>It is equally evident that the members of each department ſhould be as little dependent as poſſible on thoſe of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magiſtrate, or the judges, not independent of the legiſlature in this particular, their independence in every other, would be merely nominal.</p>
                     <p>But the great ſecurity againſt a gradual concentra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral powers in the ſame department, conſiſts in giving to thoſe who adminiſter each depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the neceſſary conſtitutional means, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motives, to reſiſt encroachments of the others. The proviſion for defence muſt in this, as in all
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:021127_0355_0FB25004C9F95070"/>
other caſes, be made commenſurate to the danger of attack. Ambition muſt be made to counteract ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The intereſt of the man muſt be connected with the conſtitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that ſuch devices ſhould be neceſſary to control the abuſes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But what is government itſelf but the greateſt of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be neceſſary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be neceſſary. In framing a government which is to be adminiſtered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You muſt firſt enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol itſelf. A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control on the government; but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has taught mankind the neceſſity of auxiliary precautions.</p>
                     <p>This policy of ſupplying by oppoſite and rival intereſts, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole ſyſtem of human affairs, private as well as public. We ſee it particularly diſplayed in all the ſubordinate diſtributions of power; where the conſtant aim is to divide and arrange the ſeveral offices in ſuch a manner as that each may be a check on the other; that the private intereſt of every individual, may be a centinel over the public rights. Theſe inventions of prudence cannot be leſs requiſite in the diſtribution of the ſupreme powers of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>But it is not poſſible to give to each department an equal power of ſelf-defence. In republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the legiſlative authority neceſſarily predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates. The remedy for this inconveniency is, to divide the legiſlature into different branches; and to render them by different modes of election, and different principles of action, as little connected with each other, as the nature of their common
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:021127_0356_0FB25006FA7539A8"/>
functions, and their common dependence on the ſociety, will admit. It may even be neceſſary to guard againſt dangerous encroachments by ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precautions. As the weight of the legiſlative authority requires that it ſhould be thus divided, the weakneſs of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it ſhould be fortified. An abſolute negative, on the legiſlature, appears at firſt view to be the natural defence with which the executive magiſtrate ſhould be armed. But perhaps it would be neither altogether ſafe, nor alone ſufficient. On ordinary occaſions, it might not be exerted with the requiſite firmneſs; and on extraordinary occaſions, it might be perfidiouſly abuſed. May not this defect of an abſolute negative be ſupplied by ſome qualified connection between this weaker department, and the weaker branch of the ſtronger department, by which the latter may be led to ſupport the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rights of the former, without being too much detached from the rights of its own department?</p>
                     <p>If the principles on which theſe obſervations are founded be juſt, as I perſuade myſelf they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the ſeveral ſtate conſtitutions, and to the federal conſtitution, it will be found, that if the latter does not perfectly correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with them, the former are infinitely leſs able to bear ſuch a teſt.</p>
                     <p>There are moreover two conſiderations particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly applicable to the federal ſyſtem of America, which place that ſyſtem in a very intereſting point of view.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> In a ſingle republic, all the power ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the people, is ſubmitted to the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſingle government; and the uſurpations are guarded againſt by a diviſion of the government into diſtinct and ſeparate departments. In the compound republic of America, the power ſurrendered by the people, is firſt divided between two diſtinct govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then the portion allotted to each,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:021127_0357_0FB250098F3C6FB8"/>
ſubdivided among diſtinct and ſeparate departments. Hence a double ſecurity ariſes to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other; at the ſame time that each will be controled by itſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second.</hi> It is of great importance in a republic, not only to guard the ſociety againſt the oppreſſion of its rulers; but to guard one part of the ſociety againſt the injuſtice of the other part. Different intereſts neceſſarily exiſt in different claſſes of citizens. If a majority be united by a common intereſt, the rights of the minority will be inſecure. There are but two methods of providing againſt this evil: The one by creating a will in the community independent of the majority, that is, of the ſociety itſelf; the other by comprehending in the ſociety ſo many ſeparate deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of citizens, as will render an unjuſt combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not impracticable. The firſt method prevails in all governments poſſeſſing an hereditary or ſelf appointed authority. This at beſt is but a precarious ſecurity; becauſe a power independent of the ſociety may as well eſpouſe the unjuſt views of the major, as the rightful intereſts of the minor party, and may poſſibly be turned againſt both parties. The ſecond method will be exemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whilſt all authority in it will be derived from, and dependent on the ſociety, the ſociety itſelf will be broken into ſo many parts, intereſts and claſſes of citizens, that the rights of individuals or of the minority, will be in little danger from intereſted combinations of the majority. In a free government, the ſecurity for civil rights muſt be the ſame as that for religious rights. It conſiſts in the one caſe in the multiplicity of intereſts, and in the other, in the multiplicity of ſects. The degree of ſecurity in both caſes will depend on the number of intereſts and ſects; and this may be preſumed to depend on the extent of country and number of people
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:021127_0358_0FB2500ABA917820"/>
comprehended under the ſame government. This view of the ſubject muſt particularly recommend a proper federal ſyſtem to all the ſincere and conſiderate friends of republican government: Since it ſhews that in exact proportion as the territory of the union may be formed into more circumſcribed confederacies or ſtates, oppreſſive com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a ſociety under the forms of which the ſtronger faction can readily unite and oppreſs the weaker, anarchy may as truly be ſaid to reign, as in a ſtate of nature where the weaker indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual is not ſecured againſt the violence of the ſtronger: And as in the latter ſtate even the ſtronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their condition, to ſubmit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themſelves: So in the former ſtate, will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced by a like motive, to wiſh for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little doubted, that if the ſtate of Rhode-Iſland was ſeparated from the confederacy, and left to itſelf, the inſecurity of rights under the popular form of government within ſuch narrow limits, would be diſplayed by ſuch rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated oppreſſions of factious majorities, that ſome power altogether independent of the people would ſoon be called for by the voice of the very factions whoſe miſrule had proved the neceſſity of it. In the extended republic of the United States, and among the great variety of intereſts, parties and ſects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the whole

                     <p>FROM the more general enquiries purſued in the four laſt papers, I paſs on to a more particular examination of the ſeveral parts of the government. I ſhall begin with the houſe of repreſentatives.</p>
                     <p>The firſt view to be taken of this part of the government, relates to the qualifications of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and the elected. Thoſe of the former are to be the ſame with thoſe of the electors of the moſt numerous branch of the ſtate legiſlatures. The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the right of ſuffrage is very juſtly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government.

It was incumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and eſtabliſh this right in the conſtitution. To have left it open for the occaſional regulation of the congreſs, would have been improper for the reaſon juſt mentioned. To have ſubmitted it to the legiſlative diſcretion of the ſtates, would have been improper for the ſame reaſon; and for the additional reaſon, that it would have rendered too dependent on the ſtate governments, that branch of the federal government, which ought to be dependent on the people alone. To have reduced the different quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in the different ſtates to one uniform rule, would probably have been as diſſatisfactory to ſome of the ſtates, as it would have been difficult to the convention. The proviſion ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e by the convention appears therefore, to be the beſt that lay within their option. It muſt be ſatisfactory to every ſtate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is conformable to the ſtandard already eſtabliſhed, or which may be eſtabliſhed by the ſtate itſelf. It will be ſafe to the United States; becauſe, being fixed by the ſtate conſtitutions, it is not alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the ſtate governments, and it cannot be feared that the people of the ſtates will alter this part of their conſtitutions, in ſuch a manner as to abridge the rights ſecured to them by the federal conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The qualifications of the elected being leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and properly defined by the ſtate conſtitutions, and being at the ſame time more ſuſceptible of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, have been very properly conſidered and regulated by the convention. A repreſentative of the United States muſt be of the age of twenty-five years; muſt have been ſeven years a citizen of the United States; muſt at the time of his election, be an inhabitant of the ſtate he is to repreſent, and during the time of his ſervice muſt be in no office under the United States. Under theſe reaſonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every deſcription,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:021127_0361_0FB2501008D8C158"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>The term for which the repreſentatives are to be elected, falls under a ſecond view which may be taken of this branch. In order to decide on the propriety of this article, two queſtions muſt be conſidered; firſt, whether biennial elections will, in this caſe, be ſafe; ſecondly, whether they be neceſſary or uſeful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> As it is eſſential to liberty, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general ſhould have a common intereſt with the people; ſo it is particularly eſſential that the branch of it under conſideration ſhould have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with the people. Frequent elections are unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the only policy by which this dependence and ſympathy can be effectually ſecured. But what particular degree of frequency may be abſolutely neceſſary for the purpoſe, does not appear to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of any preciſe calculation: And muſt depend on a variety of circumſtances with which it may be connected. Let us conſult experience, the guide that ought always to be followed, whenever it can be found.</p>
                     <p>The ſcheme of repreſentation, as a ſubſtitute for a meeting of the citizens in perſon, being at moſt but very imperfectly known to antient polity; it is in more modern times only, that we are to expect inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive examples. And even here, in order to avoid a reſearch too vague and diffuſive, it will be proper to confine ourſelves to the few examples which are beſt known, and which bear the greateſt analogy to our particular caſe. The firſt to which this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ought to be applied, is the houſe of commons in Great-Britain. The hiſtory of this branch of the Engliſh conſtitution, anterior to the date of Magna Charta, is too obſcure to yield inſtruction. The very exiſtence of it has been made a queſtion among poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical antiquaries. The earlieſt records of ſubſequent
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:021127_0362_0FB25014B3B13720"/>
date prove, that parliaments were to <hi>ſit</hi> only, every year; not that they were to be <hi>elected</hi> every year. And even theſe annual ſeſſions were left ſo much at the diſcretion of the monarch, that under various pretex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, very long and dangerous intermiſſions were often contrived by royal ambition. To remedy this grievance, it was provided by a ſtatute in the reign of Charles IId. that the intermiſſions, ſhould not be protracted beyond a period of three years. On the acceſſion of William IIId, when a revolution took place in the government, the ſubject was ſtill more ſeriouſly reſumed, and it was declared to be among the fundamental rights of the people, that parliaments ought to be held <hi>frequently.</hi> By another ſtatute which paſſed a few years later in the ſame reign, the term "frequently" which had alluded to the triennial period ſettled in the time of Charles IId. is reduced to a preciſe meaning, it being expreſsly enacted that a new parliament ſhall be called within three years after the determination of the former. The laſt change from three to ſeven years is well known to have been introduced pretty early in the preſent century, under an alarm for the Hanoverian ſucceſſion. From theſe facts it appears, that the greateſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of elections which has been deemed neceſſary in that kingdom, for binding the repreſentatives to their conſtituents, does not exceed a triennial return of them. And if we may argue from the degree of liberty retained even under ſeptennial elections, and all the other vicious ingredients in the parliamentary conſtitution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of the period from ſeven to three years, with the other neceſſary reforms, would ſo far extend the influence of the people over their repreſentatives as to ſatisfy us, that biennial elections under the federal ſyſtem, cannot poſſibly be dangerous to the requiſite deqendence of the houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives on their conſtituents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="unknown:021127_0363_0FB250176FCDE658"/>Elections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated entirely by the diſcretion of the crown, and were ſeldom repeated except on the acceſſion of a new prince, or ſome other contingent event. The parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which commenced with George IId<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued throughout his whole reign, a period of about thirty-five years. The only dependence of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives on the people, conſiſted in the right of the latter to ſupply occaſional vacancies, by the election of new members, and in the chance of ſome event which might produce a general new election. The ability alſo of the Iriſh parliament to maintain the rights of their conſtituents, ſo far as the diſpoſition might exiſt, was extremely ſhackled by the control of the crown over the ſubjects of their deliberation. Of late theſe ſhackles, if I miſtake not, have been broken; and octennial parliaments have beſides been eſtabliſhed. What effect may be produced by this partial reform, muſt be left to further expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. The example of Ireland, from this view of it, can throw but little light on the ſubject. As far as we can draw any concluſion from it, it muſt be, that if the people of that country have been able, under all theſe diſadvantages, to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage of biennial elections would ſecure to them every degree of liberty which might depend on a due connection between their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives and themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Let us bring our enquiries nearer home. The example of theſe ſtates when Britiſh colonies, claims particular attention; at the ſame time that it is ſo well known, as to require little to be ſaid on it. The principle of repreſentation, in one branch of the legiſlature at leaſt, was eſtabliſhed in all of them. But the periods of election were different. They varied from one to ſeven years. Have we any reaſon to infer from the ſpirit and conduct of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people, prior to the revolution, that biennial elections would have been dangerous to the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:021127_0364_0FB2501AE61592A0"/>
public liberties? The ſpirit which every where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played itſelf at the commencement of the ſtruggle; and which vanquiſhed the obſtacles to independence, is the beſt of proofs that a ſufficient portion of liberty had been every where enjoyed to inſpire both a ſenſe of its worth, and a zeal for its proper enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This remark holds good as well with regard to the then colonies, whoſe elections were leaſt frequent, as to thoſe whoſe elections were moſt frequent. Virginia was the colony which ſtood firſt in reſiſting the parliamentary uſurpations of Great-Britain; it was the firſt alſo in eſpouſing by public act, the reſolution of independence. In Virginia, nevertheleſs, if I have not been miſinformed, elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under the former government were ſeptennial. This particular example is brought into view, not as a proof of any peculiar merit, for the priority in thoſe inſtances, was probably accidental; and ſtill leſs of any advantage in <hi>ſeptennial</hi> elections, for when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with a greater frequency they are inadmiſſible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive it to be a very ſubſtantial proof, that the liberties of the people can be in no danger from <hi>biennial</hi> elections.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion reſulting from theſe examples will be not a little ſtrengthened by recollecting three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The firſt is, that the federal legiſlature will poſſeſs a part only of that ſupreme legiſlative authority which is veſted completely in the Britiſh parliament, and which, with a few exceptions, was exerciſed by the colonial aſſemblies and the Iriſh legiſlature. It is a received and well founded maxim, that, where no other circumſtances affect the caſe, the greater the power is, the ſhorter ought to be its duration; and converſely, the ſmaller the power, the more ſafely may its duration be protracted. In the ſecond place, it has, on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, been ſhewn that the federal legiſlature will not only be reſtrained by its dependence on the people, as other legiſlative bodies are; but that it
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:021127_0365_0FB25021B70F0050"/>
will be moreover watched and controled by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral collateral legiſlatures, which other legiſlative bodies are not. And in the third place, no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon can be made between the means that will be poſſeſſed by the more permanent branches of the federal government for ſeducing, if they ſhould be diſpoſed to ſeduce, the houſe of repreſentatives from their duty to the people; and the means of influence over the popular branch, poſſeſſed by the other branches of the governments above cited. With leſs power therefore to abuſe, the federal repreſentatives can be leſs tempted on one ſide, and will be doubly watched on the other.</p>

                     <p>I SHALL here perhaps be reminded of a current obſervation,
<q>that where annual elections end, tyranny begins.</q>
If it be true, as has often been remarked, that ſayings which become proverbial, are generally founded in reaſon, it is not leſs true that when once eſtabliſhed, they are often applied to caſes to which the reaſon of them does not extend. I need not look for a proof beyond the caſe before us. What is the reaſon on which this proverbial obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is founded? No man will ſubject himſelf to the ridicule of pretending that any natural connection ſubſiſts between the ſun or the ſeaſons, and the period within which human virtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily for mankind, liberty is not in this reſpect confined to any ſingle point of time; but lies within extremes, which afford ſufficient latitude for all the variations which may be required by the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:021127_0366_0FB250277B52EB90"/>
various ſituations and circumſtances of civil ſociety, The election of magiſtrates might be, if it were found expedient, as in ſome inſtances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as annual; and if circumſtances may require a deviation from the rule on one ſide, why not alſo on the other ſide. Turning our attention to the periods eſtabliſhed among ourſelves, for the election of the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous branches of the ſtate legiſlatures, we find them by no means coinciding any more in this inſtance, than in the elections of other civil magiſtrates. In Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland, the periods are half-yearly. In the other ſtates, South-Carolina excepted, they are annual. In South-Carolina, they are bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; as is propoſed in the federal government. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the longeſt and the ſhorteſt periods; and yet it would be not eaſy to ſhew that Connecticut or Rhode-Iſland is better governed, or enjoys a greater ſhare of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal liberty than South-Carolina; or that either the one or the other of theſe ſtates are diſtinguiſhed in theſe reſpects, and by theſe cauſes, from the ſtates whoſe elections are different from both.</p>
                     <p>In ſearching for the grounds of this doctrine. I can diſcover but one, and that is wholly inapplicable to our caſe. The important diſtinction ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in America between a conſtitution eſtabliſhed by the people, and unalterable by the government; and a law eſtabliſhed by the government, and alterable by the government, ſeems to have been little underſtood and leſs obſerved in any other country. Wherever the ſupreme power of legiſlation has reſided, has been ſuppoſed to reſide alſo, a full power to change the form of the government. Even in Great Britain, where the principles of political and civil liberty have been moſt diſcuſſed, and where we hear moſt of the rights of the conſtitution, it is maintained that the authority of the parliament is tranſcendent and uncontrolable, as well with regard to the conſtitution, as the ordinary objects
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:021127_0367_0FB2502ADE8F6510"/>
of legiſlative proviſion. They have accordingly, in ſeveral inſtances, actually changed, by legiſlative acts, ſome of the moſt fundamental articles of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They have in particular, on ſeveral occaſions, changed the period of election; and on the laſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not only introduced ſeptennial, in place of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial elections; but by the ſame act continued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in place four years beyond the term for which they were elected by the people. An attention to theſe dangerous practices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of free government, of which frequency of elections is the corner ſtone; and has led them to ſeek for ſome ſecurity to liberty againſt the danger to which it is expoſed. Where no conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paramount to the government, either exiſted or could be obtained, no conſtitutional ſecurity ſimilar to that eſtabliſhed in the United States, was to be attempted. Some other ſecurity therefore was to be ſought for; and what better ſecurity would the caſe admit, than that of ſelecting and appealing to ſome ſimple and familiar portion of time, as a ſtandard for meaſuring the danger of innovations, for fixing the national ſentiment, and for uniting the patriotic exertions. The moſt ſimple and familiar portion of time, applicable to the ſubject, was that of a year; and hence the doctrine has been inculcated by a laudable zeal to erect ſome barrier againſt the gradual innovations of an unlimited government, that the advance towards tyranny was to be calculated by the diſtance of departure from the fixed point of annual elections. But what neceſſity can there be of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this expedient to a government, limited as the federal government will be, by the authority of a paramount conſtitution? Or who will pretend that the liberties of the people of America will not be more ſecure under biennial elections, unalterably fixed by ſuch a conſtitution, than thoſe of any other nation would be, where elections were annual or even more
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:021127_0368_0FB2502BB9E43C78"/>
frequent, but ſubject to alterations by the ordinary power of the government?</p>
                     <p>The ſecond queſtion ſtated is, whether biennial elections be neceſſary or uſeful? The propriety of anſwering this queſtion in the affirmative will appear from ſeveral very obvious conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>No man can be a competent legiſlator who does not add to an upright intention and a ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a certain degree of knowledge of the ſubjects on which he is to legiſlate. A part of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be acquired by means of information which lie within the compaſs of men in private as well as public ſtations. Another part can only be attained, or at leaſt thoroughly attained, by actual experience in the ſtation which requires the uſe of it. The period of ſervice ought therefore in all ſuch caſes to bear ſome proportion to the extent of practical knowledge, requiſite to the due performance of the ſervice. The period of legiſlative ſervice eſtabliſhed in moſt of the ſtates for the more numerous branch is, as we have ſeen, one year. The queſtion then may be put into this ſimple form; does the period of two years bear no greater proportion to the knowledge requiſite for federal legiſlation, than one year does to the knowledge requiſite for ſtate legiſlation? The very ſtatement of the queſtion in this form, ſuggeſts the anſwer that ought to be given to it.</p>
                     <p>In a ſingle ſtate, the requiſite knowledge relates to the exiſting laws which are uniform throughout the ſtate, and with which all the citizens are more or leſs converſant; and to the general affairs of the ſtate, which lie within a ſmall compaſs, are not very diverſified and occupy much of the attention and converſation of every claſs of people. The great theatre of the United States preſents a very different ſcene. The laws are ſo far from being uniform, that they vary in every ſtate; whilſt the public affairs of the union are ſpread throughout a very extenſive region, and are extremely diverſified by the local
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:021127_0369_0FB2502FC26C0690"/>
affairs connected with them, and can with difficulty be correctly learnt in any other place, than in the central councils, to which a knowledge of them will be brought by the repreſentatives of every part of the empire. Yet ſome knowledge of the affairs, and even of the laws of all the ſtates, ought to be poſſeſſed by the members from each of the ſtates. How can foreign trade be properly regulated by uniform laws, without ſome acquaintance with the commerce; the parts, the uſages, and the regulations of the different ſtates? How can the trade between the different ſtates be duly regulated without ſome knowledge of their relative ſituations in theſe and other points? How can taxes be judiciouſly impoſed, and effectually collected, if they be not accommodated to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent laws and local circumſtances relating to theſe objects in the different ſtates? How can uniform regulations for the militia be duly provided without a ſimilar knowledge of ſome internal circumſtances by which the ſtates are diſtinguiſhed from each other? Theſe are the principal objects of federal legiſlation, and ſuggeſt moſt forceably, the extenſive information which the repreſentatives ought to acquire. The other inferior objects will require a proportional degree of information with regard to them.</p>
                     <p>It is true that all theſe difficulties will by degrees be very much diminiſhed. The moſt laborious taſk will be the proper inauguration of the government, and the primeval formation of a federal code. Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the firſt draught will every year become both eaſier and fewer. Paſt tranſactions of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be a ready and accurate ſource of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to new members. The affairs of the union will become more and more objects of curioſity and converſation among the citizens at large. And the increaſed intercourſe among thoſe of different ſtates will contribute not a little to diffuſe a mutual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their affairs, as this again will contribute to a general aſſimilation of their manners and laws.
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:021127_0370_0FB25030F9D7B570"/>
But with all theſe abatements the buſineſs of federal legiſlation muſt continue ſo far to exceed both in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty and difficulty the legiſlative buſineſs of a ſingle ſtate, as to juſtify the longer period of ſervice aſſigned to thoſe who are to tranſact it.</p>
                     <p>A branch of knowledge which belongs to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements of a federal repreſentative, and which has not been mentioned, is that of foreign affairs. In regulating our own commerce, he ought to be not only acquainted with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>eaties between the United States and other nations, but alſo with the commercial policy and laws of other nations. He ought not be altogether ignorant of the law of nations, for that as far it is a proper object of municipal legiſlation is ſubmitted to the federal government. And although the houſe of repreſentatives is not immediately to participate in foreign negociations and arrangements, yet from the neceſſary connection between the ſeveral branches of public affairs, thoſe particular branches will frequently deſerve attention in the ordinary courſe of legiſlation, and will ſometimes demand particular legiſlative ſanction and co-operation. Some portion of this knowledge may no doubt be acquired in a man's cloſet; but ſome of it alſo can only be derived from the public ſources of information; and all of it will be acquired to beſt effect by a practical attention to the ſubject during the period of actual ſervice in the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>There are other conſiderations of leſs importance perhaps, but which are not unworthy of notice. The diſtance which many of the repreſentatives will be obliged to travel, and the arrangements rendered ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by that circumſtance, might be much more ſerious objections with fit men to this ſervice if limited to a ſingle year, than if extended to two years. No argument can be drawn on this ſubject from the caſe of the delegates to the exiſting congreſs. They are elected annually it is true; but their re-election is
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:021127_0371_0FB25035852BE210"/>
conſidered by the legiſlative aſſemblies almoſt as a matter of courſe. The election of the repreſentatives by the people would not be governed by the ſame principle.</p>
                     <p>A few of the members, as happens in all ſuch aſſemblies, will poſſeſs ſuperior talents; will, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent re-elections, become members of long ſtanding; will be thoroughly maſters of the public buſineſs, and perhaps not unwilling to avail themſelves of thoſe advantages. The greater the proportion of new members, and the leſs the information of the bulk of the members, the more apt will they be to fall into the ſnares that may be laid for them. This remark is no leſs applicable to the relation which will ſubſiſt between the houſe of repreſentatives and the ſenate.</p>
                     <p>It is an inconvenience mingled with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of our frequent elections, even in ſingle ſtates, where they are large and hold but one legiſlative ſeſſion in the year, that ſpurious elections cannot be inveſtigated and annulled in time for the deciſion to have its due effect. If a return can be obtained, no matter by what unlawful means, the irregular member, who takes his ſeat of courſe, is ſure of holding it a ſufficient time to anſwer his purpoſes. Hence a very pernicious encouragement is given to the uſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means for obtaining irregular returns. Were elections for the federal legiſlature to be annual, this practice might become a very ſerious abuſe, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the more diſtant ſtates. Each houſe is, as it neceſſarily muſt be, the judge of the elections, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and returns of its members, and whatever improvements may be ſuggeſted by experience for ſimplifying and accelerating the proceſs in diſputed caſes, ſo great a portion of a year would unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably elapſe, before an illegitimate member could be diſpoſſeſſed of his ſeat, that the proſpect of ſuch an event would be little check to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a ſeat.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER LIV. The ſame Subject continued with a View to the Ratio of Repreſentation.</head>
                     <p>THE next view which I ſhall take of the houſe of repreſentatives, relates to the appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment of its members to the ſeveral ſtates, which is to be determined by the ſame rule with that of direct taxes.</p>
                     <p>It is not contended that the number of people in each ſtate ought not to be the ſtandard for regulating the proportion of thoſe who are to repreſent the people of each ſtate. The eſtabliſhment of the ſame rule for the apportionment of taxes, will probably be as little conteſted; though the rule itſelf in this caſe, is by no means founded on the ſame principle. In the former caſe, the rule is underſtood to refer to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal rights of the people, with which it has a natural and univerſal connection. In the latter, it has refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the proportion of wealth, of which it is in no caſe a preciſe meaſure, and in ordinary caſes, a very unfit one. But notwithſtanding the imperfection of the rule as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the ſtates, it is evidently the leaſt exceptionable among the practicable rules; and had too recently obtained the general ſanction of America, not to have found a ready preference with the convention.</p>
                     <p>All this is admitted, it will perhaps be ſaid: But does it follow from an admiſſion of numbers for the meaſure of repreſentation, or of ſlaves combined with
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:021127_0373_0FB250386CF500B0"/>
free citizens, as a ratio of taxation, that ſlaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of repreſentation? Slaves are conſidered as property, not as perſons. They ought therefore to be comprehended in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be excluded from repreſentation which is regulated by a cenſus of perſons. This is the objection, as I underſtand it, ſtated in its full force. I ſhall be equally candid in ſtating the reaſoning which may be offered on the oppoſite ſide.</p>
                     <p>We ſubſcribe to the doctrine, might one of our ſouthern brethren obſerve, that repreſentation relates more immediately to perſons, and taxation more immediately to property, and we join in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this diſtinction to the caſe of our ſlaves. But we muſt deny the fact that ſlaves are conſidered merely as property, and in no reſpect whatever as perſons. The true ſtate of the caſe is, that they partake of both theſe qualities; being conſidered by our laws, in ſome reſpects, as perſons, and in other reſpects, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. In being compelled to labor not for himſelf, but for a maſter; in being vendible by one maſter to another maſter; and in being ſubject at all times to be reſtrained in his liberty, and chaſtiſed in his body, by the capricious will of another, the ſlave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and claſſed with thoſe irrational animals, which fall under the legal denomination of property. In being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected on the other hand in his life and in his limbs, againſt the violence of all others, even the maſter of his labour and his liberty; and in being puniſhable himſelf for all violence committed againſt others; the ſlave is no leſs evidently regarded by the law as a member of the ſociety; not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral perſon, not as a mere article of property. The federal conſtitution therefore, decides with great propriety on the caſe of our ſlaves, when it views them in the mixt character of perſons and of property. This is in fact their true character. It is
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:021127_0374_0FB250444DF56510"/>
the character beſtowed on them by the laws under which they live; and it will not be denied that theſe are the proper criterion; becauſe it is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into ſubjects of property, that a place is diſputed them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted that if the laws were to reſtore the rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refuſed an equal ſhare of repreſentation with the other inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>This queſtion may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all ſides, that numbers are the beſt ſcale of wealth and taxation, as they are the only proper ſcale of repreſention. Would the Convention have been impartial or conſiſtent, if they had rejected the ſlaves from the liſt of inhabitants when the ſhares of repreſentation were to be calculated; and inſerted them on the liſts when the tariff of contributions was to be adjuſted? Could it be reaſonably expected that the ſouthern ſtates would concur in a ſyſtem which conſidered their ſlaves in ſome degree as men, when burdens were to be impoſed, but refuſed to conſider them in the ſame light when advantages were to be conferred? Might not ſome ſurprize alſo be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that thoſe who reproach the ſouthern ſtates with the barbarous policy of conſidering as property, a part of their human brethren, ſhould themſelves contend that the government to which all the ſtates are to be parties, ought to conſider this unfortunate race more compleatly in the unnatural light of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, than the very laws of which they complain!</p>
                     <p>It may be replied perhaps that ſlaves are not included in the eſtimate of repreſentatives in any of the ſtates poſſeſſing them. They neither vote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor increaſe the votes of their maſters. Upon what principle then ought they to be taken into the federal eſtimate of repreſentation? In rejecting them altogether, we conſtitution would in this reſpect,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:021127_0375_0FB2504807A52B28"/>
have followed the very laws which have been appealed to, as the proper guide.</p>
                     <p>This objection is repelled by a ſingle obſervation. It is a fundamental principle of the propoſed conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that as the aggregate number of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives allotted to the ſeveral ſtates is to be determined by a federal rule founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, ſo the right of chooſing this allotted number in each ſtate is to be exerciſed by ſuch part of the inhabitants, as the ſtate itſelf may deſignate. The qualifications on which the right of ſuffrage depend, are not perhaps the ſame in any two ſtates. In ſome of the ſtates the difference is very material. In every ſtate a certain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by the conſtitution of the ſtate, who will be included in the cenſus by which the federal conſtitution apportions the repreſentatives. In this point of view, the ſouthern ſtates might retort the complaint, by inſiſting, that the principle laid down by the convention required that no regard ſhould be had to the policy of particular ſtates towards their own inhabitants; and conſequently, that the ſlaves as inhabitants ſhould have been admitted into the cenſus occording to their full number, in like manner with other inhabitants, who by the policy of other ſtates, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A rigorous adherence however, to this principle, is waved by thoſe who would be gainers by it. All that they aſk is, that equal moderation be ſhewn on the other ſide. Let the caſe of the ſlaves be conſidered, as it is in truth a peculiar one. Let the compromiſing expedient of the conſtitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants, but as debaſed by ſervitude below the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the <hi>ſlave</hi> as diveſted of two fifths of the <hi>man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all, may not another ground be taken on which this article of the conſtitution will admit of a ſtill more ready defence? We have hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:021127_0376_0FB25049B9FF9090"/>
on the idea that repreſentation related to perſons only, and not at all to property. But is it a juſt idea? Government is inſtituted no leſs for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the property, than of the perſons of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. The one as well as the other, therefore, may be conſidered as repreſented by thoſe who are charged with the government. Upon this principle it is, that in ſeveral of the ſtates, and particularly in the ſtate of New-York, one branch of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is intended more eſpecially to be the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected by that part of the ſociety which is moſt intereſted in this object of government. In the federal conſtitution this policy does not prevail. The rights of property are committed into the ſame hands with the perſonal rights. Some attention ought therefore to be paid to property in the choice of thoſe hands.</p>
                     <p>For another reaſon the votes allowed in the federal legiſlature to the people of each ſtate, ought to bear ſome proportion to the comparitive wealth of the ſtates. States have not, like individuals, an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over each other ariſing from ſuperior advantages of fortune. If the law allows an opulent citizen but a ſingle vote in the choice of his repreſentative, the reſpect and conſequence which he derives from his fortunate ſituation, very frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his choice; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of property are conveyed into the public repreſentation. A ſtate poſſeſſes no ſuch influence over other ſtates. It is not probable that the richeſt ſtate in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy will ever influence the choice of a ſingle repreſentative in any other ſtate. Nor will the repreſentatives of the larger and richer ſtates, poſſeſs any other advantage in the federal legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture over the repreſentatives of other ſtates, than what may reſult from their ſuperior number alone; as far therefore as their ſuperior wealth and weight may juſtly entitle them to any advantage, it ought
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:021127_0377_0FB2504B35F33010"/>
to be ſecured to them by a ſuperior ſhare of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation. The new conſtitution is in this reſpect materially different from the exiſting confederation, as well as from that of the United Netherlands, and other ſimilar confederacies. In each of the latter, the efficacy of the federal reſolutions depends on the ſubſequent and voluntary reſolutions of the ſtates compoſing the union. Hence the ſtates, though poſſeſſing an equal vote in the public councils, have an unequal influence, correſponding with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal importance of theſe ſubſequent and voluntary reſolutions. Under the propoſed conſtitution, the federal acts will take effect without the neceſſary intervention of the individual ſtates. They will depend merely on the majority of votes in the federal legiſlature, and conſequently each vote, whether proceeding from a larger or ſma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>e, or a ſtate more or leſs wealthy or powerful, will have an equal weight and efficacy; in the ſame manner as the votes individually given in a ſtate legiſlature, by the repreſentatives of unequal counties or other diſtricts, have each a preciſe equality of value and effect; or if there be any difference in the caſe, it proceeds from the difference in the perſonal charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the individual repreſentative, rather than from any regard to the extent of the diſtrict from which he comes.</p>
                     <p>Such is the reaſoning which an advocate for the ſouthern intereſts might employ on this ſubject: And although it may appear to be a little ſtrained in ſome points, yet on the whole, I muſt confeſs, that it fully reconciles me to the ſcale of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the convention have eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>In one reſpect the eſtabliſhment of a common mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for repreſentation and taxation will have a very ſalutary effect. As the accuracy of the cenſus to be obtained by the congreſs, will neceſſarily depend in a conſiderable decree on the diſpoſition, if not the co-operation of the ſtates, it is of great importance
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:021127_0378_0FB2504DD18CCC40"/>
that the ſtates ſhould feel as little bias as poſſible to ſwell or to reduce the amount of their numbers. Were their ſhare of repreſentation alone to be governed by this rule, they would have an intereſt in exaggerating their inhabitants. Were the rule to decide their ſhare of taxation alone, a contrary temptation would prevail. By extending the rule to both objects, the ſtates will have oppoſite intereſts, which will control and ballance each other; and produce the requiſite impartiality.</p>

                     <p>THE number of which the houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives is to conſiſt, forms another, and a very intereſting point of view under which this branch of the federal legiſlature may be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated. Scarce any article indeed in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſeems to be rendered more worthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument, with which it has been aſſailed. The charges exhibited againſt it are, firſt, that ſo ſmall a number of repreſentatives will be an unſafe depoſitary of the public intereſts; ſecondly, that they will not poſſeſs a proper knowledge of the local circumſtances of their numerous conſtituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that claſs of citizens which will ſympathiſe leaſt with the feelings of the maſs of the people, and be moſt likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depreſſion of the many; fourthly, that defective as the number will be in the firſt inſtance, it will be more and more diſproportionate, by the increaſe of the people, and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:021127_0379_0FB2504EF945E938"/>
the obſtacles which will prevent a correſpondent increaſe of the repreſentatives.</p>
                     <p>In general it may be remarked on this ſubject, that no polical problem is leſs ſuſceptible of a preciſe ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that which relates to the number moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for a repreſentative legiſlature; nor is there any point on which the policy of the ſeveral ſtates is more at variance; whether we compare their legiſlative aſſemblies directly with each other, or conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions which they reſpectively bear to the number of their conſtituents. Paſſing over the difference between the ſmalleſt and largeſt ſtates, as Delaware, whoſe moſt numerous branch conſiſts of twenty-one repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, and Maſſachuſetts, where it amounts to between three and four hundred; a very conſiderable difference is obſervable among ſtates nearly equal in population. The number of repreſentatives in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania is not more than one fifth of that in the ſtate laſt mentioned. New-York, whoſe population is to that of South-Carolina as ſix to five, has little more than one third of the number of repreſentatives. As great a diſparity prevails between the ſtates of Georgia and Delaware, or Rhode-Iſland. In Pennſylvania the repreſentatives do not bear a greater proportion to their conſtituents than of one for every four or five thouſand. In Rhode-Iſland, they bear a proportion of at leaſt one for every thouſand. And according to the conſtitution of Georgia, the proportion may be carried to one for every ten electors; and muſt unavoidably far exceed the proportion in any of the other ſtates.</p>
                     <p>Another general remark to be made is, that the ratio between the repreſentatives and the people, ought not to be the ſame where the latter are very numerous, as where they are very few. Were the repreſentatives in Virginia to be regulated by the ſtandard in Rhode-Iſland, they would at this time amount to between four and five hundred; and twenty or thirty years hence, to a thouſand. On the other
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:021127_0380_0FB2505154A7FE90"/>
hand, the ratio of Pennſylvania, if applied to the ſtate of Delaware, would reduce the repreſentative aſſembly of the latter to ſeven or eight members. Nothing can be more fallacious than to found our political calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations on arithmetical principles. Sixty or ſeventy men, may be more properly truſted with a given degree of power than ſix or ſeven. But it does not follow, that ſix or ſeven hundred would be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally a better depoſitary. And if we carry on the ſuppoſition to ſix or ſeven thouſand, the whole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning ought to be reverſed. The truth is, that in all caſes a certain number at leaſt ſeems to be neceſſary to ſecure the benefits of free conſultation and diſcuſſion, and to guard againſt too eaſy a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for improper purpoſes: As on the other hand, the number ought at moſt to be kept within a certain limit, in order to avoid the confuſion and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of a multitude. In all very numerous aſſemblies, of whatever characters compoſed, paſſion never fails to wreſt the ſceptre from reaſon. Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates; every Athenian aſſembly would ſtill have been a mob.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary alſo to recollect here the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were applied to the caſe of biennial elections. For the ſame reaſon that the limited powers of the congreſs and the control of the ſtate legiſlatures, juſtify leſs frequent elections than the public ſafety might otherwiſe require; the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the congreſs need be leſs numerous than if they poſſeſſed the whole power of legiſlation, and were under no other than the ordinary reſtraints of other legiſlative bodies.</p>
                     <p>With theſe general ideas in our minds, let us weigh the objections which have been ſtated againſt the number of members propoſed for the houſe of repreſentatives. It is ſaid in the firſt place, that ſo ſmall a number cannot be ſafely truſted with ſo much power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="144" facs="unknown:021127_0381_0FB25052B1E2B8B0"/>The number of which this branch of the legiſlature is to conſiſt at the outſet of the government, will be ſixty-five. Within three years a cenſus is to be taken, when the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thouſand inhabitants; and within every ſucceſſive period of ten years, the cenſus is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be made under the above limitation. It will not be thought an extravagant conjecture, that the firſt cenſus will, at the rate of one for every thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, raiſe the number of repreſentatives to at leaſt one hundred. Eſtimating the negroes in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of three-fifths, it can ſcarcely be doubted that the population of the United States will by that time, if it does not already, amount to three millions. At the expiration of twenty-five years, according to the computed rate of increaſe, the number of repreſentatives will amount to two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and of fifty years to four hundred. This is a number which I preſume will put an end to all fears ariſing from the ſmallneſs of the body. I take for granted here what I ſhall in anſwering the fourth objection hereafter ſhew, that the number of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives will be augmented from time to time in the manner provided by the conſtitution. On a contrary ſuppoſition, I ſhould admit the objection to have very great weight indeed.</p>
                     <p>The true queſtion to be decided then is, whether the ſmallneſs of the number as a temporary regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be dangerous to the public liberty: Whether ſixty-five members for a few years, and a hundred or two hundred for a few more, be a ſafe depoſitary for a limited and well guarded power of legiſlating for the United States? I muſt own that I could not give a negative anſwer to this queſtion, without firſt obliterating every impreſſion which I have received with regard to the preſent genius of the people of America, the ſpirit which actuates the ſtate legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures, and the principles which are incorporated
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:021127_0382_0FB250574388A1F0"/>
with the political character of every claſs of citizens. I am unable to conceive that the people of America in their preſent temper, or under any circumſtances which can ſpeedily happen, will chuſe, and every ſecond year repeat the choice of ſixty-five or an hundred men, who would be diſpoſed to form and purſue a ſcheme of tyranny or treachery. I am unable to conceive that the ſtate legiſlatures which muſt feel ſo many motives to watch, and which poſſeſs ſo many means of counteracting the federal legiſlature, would fail either to detect or to defeat a conſpiracy of the latter againſt the liberties of their common conſtituents. I am equally unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there are at this time, or can be in any ſhort time, in the United States, any ſixty-five or an hundred men capable of recommending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the choice of the people at large, who would either deſire or dare within the ſhort ſpace of two years, to betray the ſolemn truſt committed to them. What change of circumſtances time and a fuller population of our country may produce, requires a prophetic ſpirit to declare, which makes no part of my pretenſions. But judging from the circumſtances now before us, and from the probable ſtate of them within a moderate period of time, I muſt pronounce that the liberties of America cannot be unſafe in the number of hands propoſed by the federal conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>From what quarter can the danger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold? If foreign gold could ſo eaſily corrupt our federal rulers, and enable them to enſnare and betray their conſtituents, how has it happened that we are at this time a free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent nation? The congreſs which conducted us through the revolution were a leſs numerous body than their ſucceſſors will be; they were not choſen by nor reſponſible to their fellow citizens at large; though appointed from year to year, and recallable at pleaſure, they were generally continued for three
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:021127_0383_0FB2505916506AE8"/>
years; and prior to the ratification of the federal articles, for a ſtill longer term; they held their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations always under the veil of ſecreſy; they had the ſole tranſaction of our affairs with foreign nations; through the whole courſe of the war, they had the fate of their country more in their hands, than it is to be hoped will ever be the caſe with our future repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives; and from the greatneſs of the prize at ſtake and the eagerneſs of the party which loſt it, it may well be ſuppoſed, that the uſe of other means than force would not have been ſcrupled: Yet we know by happy experience that the public truſt was not betrayed; nor has the purity of our public councils in this particular ever ſuffered even from the whiſpers of calumny.</p>
                     <p>Is the danger apprehended from the other branches of the federal government? But where are the means to be found by the preſident or the ſenate, or both? Their emoluments of office it is to be preſumed will not, and without a previous corruption of the houſe of repreſentatives cannot, more than ſuffice for very different purpoſes: Their private fortunes, as they muſt all be American citizens, cannot poſſibly be ſources of danger. The only means then which they can poſſeſs, will be in the diſpenſation of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Is it here that ſuſpicion reſts her charge? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption is to be exhauſted by the preſident in ſubduing the virtue of the ſenate. Now the fidelity of the other houſe is to be the victim. The improbability of ſuch a mercenary and perfidious combination of the ſeveral members of government ſtanding on as different foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations as republican principles will well admit, and at the ſame time accountable to the ſociety over which they are placed, ought alone to quiet this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. But fortunately the conſtitution has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a ſtill further ſafeguard. The members of the congreſs are rendered ineligible to any civil offices that may be created or of which the emoluments may
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:021127_0384_0FB2505F044BEA20"/>
be increaſed, during the term of their election. No offices therefore can be dealt out to the exiſting mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but ſuch as many become vacant by ordinary caſualties; and to ſuppoſe that theſe would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to purchaſe the guardians of the people, ſelected by the people themſelves, is to renounce every rule by which events ought to be calculated, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an indiſcriminate and unbounded jealouſy, with which all reaſoning muſt be vain. The ſincere friends of liberty who give themſelves up to the extravagancies of this paſſion are not aware of the injury they do their own cauſe. As there is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circumſpection and diſtruſt: So there are other qualities in human nature, which juſtify a certain portion of eſteem and confidence. Republican government preſuppoſes the exiſtence of theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in a higher degree than any other form. Were the pictures which have been drawn by the political jealouſy of ſome among us, faithful likeneſſes of the human character, the inference would be that there is not ſufficient virtue among men for ſelf govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that nothing leſs than the chains of deſpotiſm can reſtrain them from deſtroying and devouring one another.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> charge againſt the houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives is, that it will be too ſmall to poſſeſs a due knowledge of the intereſts of its conſtituents.</p>
                     <p>As this objection evidently proceeds from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the propoſed number of repreſentatives,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:021127_0385_0FB25062F0983368"/>
with the great extent of the United States, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their inhabitants, and the diverſity of their intereſts, without taking into view at the ſame time the circumſtances which will diſtinguiſh the congreſs from other legiſlative bodies, the beſt anſwer that can be given to it, will be a brief explanation of theſe peculiarities.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſound and important principle, that the repreſentative ought to be acquainted with the intereſts and circumſtances of his conſtituents. But this principle can extend no farther than to thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and intereſts to which the authority and care of the repreſentative relate. An ignorance of a variety of minute and particular objects, which do not lie within the compaſs of legiſlation, is conſiſtent with every attribute neceſſary to a due performance of the legiſlative truſt. In determining the extent of information required in the exerciſe of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular authority, recourſe then muſt be had to the objects within the purview of that authority.</p>
                     <p>What are to be the objects of federal legiſlation? Thoſe which are of moſt importance, and which ſeem moſt to require local knowledge, are commerce, taxation and the militia.</p>
                     <p>A proper regulation of commerce requires much information, as has been elſewhere remarked; but as far as this information relates to the laws and local ſituation of each individual ſtate, a very few repreſentatives would be very ſufficient vehicles of it to the federal councils.</p>
                     <p>Taxation will conſiſt in great meaſure, of duties which will be involved in the regulation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. So far the preceding remark is applicable to this object. As far as it may conſiſt of internal collections, a more diffuſive knowledge of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſtate may be neceſſary. But will not this alſo be poſſeſſed in ſufficient degree by a very few intelligent men, diffuſively elected within the ſtate. Divide the largeſt ſtate into ten or twelve
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:021127_0386_0FB25066F2669E50"/>
diſtricts, and it will be found that there will be no peculiar local intereſt in either, which will not be within the knowledge of the repreſentative of the diſtrict. Beſides this ſource of information, the laws of the ſtate framed by repreſentatives from every part of it, will be almoſt of themſelves a ſufficient guide. In every ſtate there have been made, and muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be made, regulations on this ſubject, which will in many caſes leave little more to be done by the federal legiſlature, than to review the different laws, and reduce them into one general act. A ſkilful individual in his cloſet, with all the local codes before him, might compile a law on ſome ſubjects of taxation for the whole union, without any aid from oral infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and it may be expected, that whenever internal taxes may be neceſſary, and particularly in caſes requiring uniformity throughout the ſtates, the more ſimple objects will be preferred. To be fully ſenſible of the facility which will be given to this branch of federal legiſlation, by the aſſiſtance of the ſtate codes, we need only ſuppoſe for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this or any other ſtate were divided into a number of parts, each having and exerciſing within itſelf a power of local legiſlation. Is it not evident that a degree of local information and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory labour would be found in the ſeveral volumes of their proceedings, which would very much ſhorten the labours of the general legiſlature, and render a much ſmaller number of members ſufficient for it? The federal councils will derive great advantage from another circumſtance. The repreſentatives of each ſtate will not only bring with them a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able knowledge of its laws, and a local knowlege of their reſpective diſtricts; but will probably in all caſes have been members, and may even at the very time be members of the ſtate legiſlature, where all the local information and intereſts of the ſtate are aſſembled, and from whence they may eaſily be
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:021127_0387_0FB2506BCD59E090"/>
conveyed by a very few hands into the legiſlature of the United States.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the regulation of the militia, there are ſcarcely any circumſtances in reference to which local knowledge can be ſaid to be neceſſary. The general face of the country, whether mountainous or level, moſt fit for the operations of infantry or cavalry, is almoſt the only conſideration of this nature that can occur. The art of war teaches general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of organization, movement and diſcipline, which apply univerſally.</p>
                     <p>The attentive reader will diſcern that the reaſoning here uſed to prove the ſufficiency of a moderate number of repreſentatives, does not in any reſpect contradict what was urged on another occaſion with regard to the extenſive information which the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives ought to poſſeſs, and the time that might be neceſſary for acquiring it. This information, ſo far as it may relate to local objects, is rendered neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and difficult, not by a difference of laws and local circumſtances within a ſingle ſtate, but of thoſe among different ſtates. Taking each ſtate by itſelf, its laws are the ſame, and its intereſts but little diverſified. A few men therefore will poſſeſs all the knowledge requiſite for a proper repreſentation of them. Were the intereſts and affairs of each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſtate, perfectly ſimple and uniform, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every other, and the whole ſtate might be competently repreſented, by a ſingle member taken from any part of it. On a compariſon of the different ſtates together, we find a great diſſimilarity in their laws, and in many other circumſtances connected with the objects of federal legiſlation, with all of which the federal repreſentatives ought to have ſome acquaintance. Whilſt a few repreſentatives therefore from each ſtate may bring with them a due knowledge of their own ſtate, every repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative will have much information to acquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:021127_0388_0FB2506CF47663B0"/>
all the other ſtates. The changes of time, as was formerly remarked, on the comparative ſituation of the different ſtates, will have an aſſimilating effect. The effect of time on the internal affairs of the ſtates taken ſingly, will be juſt the contrary. At preſent ſome of the ſtates are little more than a ſociety of huſhandmen. Few of them have made much progreſs in thoſe branches of induſtry, which give a variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation. Theſe however will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced population; and will require on the part of each ſtate a fuller repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The foreſight of the convention has accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly taken care that the progreſs of population may be accompanied with a proper increaſe of the repreſentative branch of the government.</p>
                     <p>The experience of Great Britain which preſents to mankind ſo many political leſſons, both of the moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and exemplary kind, and which has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conſulted in the courſe of theſe enquiries, corroborates the reſult of the reflections which we have juſt made. The number of inhabitants in the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, cannot be ſtated at leſs than eight millions. The repreſentatives of theſe eight millions in the houſe of commons, amount to five hundred fifty eight. Of this number one ninth are elected by three hundred and ſixty four perſons, and one half by five thouſand ſeven hundred and twenty three perſons<note n="*" place="bottom">Burgh's Political Diſquiſitions.</note>. It cannot be ſuppoſed that the half thus elected, and who do not even reſide among the people at large, can add any thing either to the ſecurity of the people againſt the government, or to the knowledge of their circumſtances and intereſts, in the legiſlative councils. On the contrary it is notorious that they are more frequently the repreſentatives and inſtruments of the executive magiſtrate, than the guardians und advocates of the popular rights. They might therefore with great
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:021127_0389_0FB2506EEEF6C808"/>
propriety be conſidered as ſomething more than a mere deduction from the real repreſentatives of the nation. We will however conſider them, in this light alone, and will not extend the deduction, to a conſiderable number of others, who do not reſide among their conſtituents, are very faintly connected with them, and have very little particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their affairs. With all theſe conceſſions two hundred and ſeventy nine perſons only will be the depoſitary of the ſafety, intereſt and happineſs of eight millions; that is to ſay; there will be one repreſentative only to maintain the rights and explain the ſituation <hi>of twenty-eight thouſand ſix hundred and ſeventy</hi> conſtituents, in an aſſembly expoſed to the whole force of executive influence, and extending its authority to every object of legiſlation within a nation whoſe affairs are in the higheſt degree diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified and complicated. Yet it is very certain not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been preſerved under all theſe circumſtances, but that the defects in the Britiſh code are chargeable in a very ſmall proportion, on the ignorance of the legiſlature concerning the circumſtances of the people. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this caſe the weight which is due to it; and comparing it with that of the houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as above explained, it ſeems to give the fulleſt aſſurance that a repreſentative for every <hi>thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inhabitants</hi> will render the latter both a ſafe and competent guardian of the intereſts which will be confided to it.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>third</hi> charge againſt the houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives is, that it will be taken from that claſs of citizens which will have leaſt ſympathy with the maſs of the people, and be moſt likely to aim at an ambitious ſacrifice of the many to the aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the few.</p>
                     <p>Of all the objections which have been framed againſt the federal conſtitution, this is perhaps the moſt extraordinary. Whilſt the objection itſelf is levelled againſt a pretended oligarchy, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of it ſtrikes at the very root of republican government.</p>
                     <p>The aim of every political conſtitution is, or ought to be, firſt, to obtain for rulers men who poſſeſs moſt wiſdom to diſcern, and moſt virtue to purſue the common good of the ſociety; and in the next place, to take the moſt effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous, whilſt they continue to hold their public truſt. The elective mode of obtaining rulers is the characteriſtic policy of republican government. The means relied on in this form of government for preventing their degeneracy, are numerous and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The moſt effectual one is ſuch a limitation of the term of appointments, as will maintain a proper reſponſibility to the people.</p>
                     <p>Let me now aſk what circumſtance there is in the conſtitution of the houſe of repreſentatives, that violates the principles of republican government; or favors the elevation of the few on the ruins of the many? Let me aſk whether every circumſtance is not, on the contrary, ſtrictly conformable to theſe
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:021127_0391_0FB2478500722E78"/>
principles; and ſcrupulouſly impartial to the rights and pretenſions of every claſs and deſcription of citizens?</p>
                     <p>Who are to be the electors of the federal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives? Not the rich more than the poor; not the learned more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of diſtinguiſhed names, more than the humble ſons of obſcure and unpropitious fortune. The elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are to be the great body of the people of the United States. They are to be the ſame who exerciſe the right in every ſtate of electing the correſpondent branch of the legiſlature of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Who are to be the objects of popular choice? Every citizen whoſe merit may recommend him to the eſteem and confidence of his country. No qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profeſſion, is permitted to fetter the judgment or diſappoint the inclination of the people.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the ſituation of the men on whom the free ſuffrages of their fellow citizens may confer the repreſentative truſt, we ſhall find it involving every ſecurity which can be deviſed or deſired for their fidelity to their conſtituents.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, as they will have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the preference of their fellow citizens, we are to preſume, that in general, they will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſtinguiſhed alſo, by thoſe qualities which entitle them to it, and which promiſe a ſincere and ſcrupulous regard to the nature of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, they will enter into the public ſervice under circumſtances which cannot fail to produce a temporary affection at leaſt to their conſtituents. There is in every breaſt a ſenſibility to marks of honour, of favour, of eſteem, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which, apart from all conſiderations of intereſts, is ſome pledge for grateful and benevolent returns. Ingratitude is a common topic of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt human nature; and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:021127_0392_0FB2477F104DBC90"/>
that inſtances of it are but too frequent and flagrant both in public and in private life. But the univerſal and extreme indignation which it inſpires, is itſelf a proof of the energy and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the contrary ſentiment.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, thoſe ties which bind the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative to his conſtituents are ſtrengthened by motives of a more ſelfiſh nature. His pride and vanity attach him to a form of government which favors his pretenſions, and gives him a ſhare in its honors and diſtinctions. Whatever hopes or projects might be entertained by a few aſpiring characters, it muſt generally happen that a great proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the people, would have more to hope from a preſervation of the favor, than from inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in the government ſubverſive of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the people.</p>
                     <p>All theſe ſecurities however would be found very inſufficient without the reſtraint of frequent elections. Hence, in the fourth place, the houſe of repreſentatives is ſo conſtituted as to ſupport in the members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people. Before the ſentiments impreſſed on their minds by the mode of their elevation, can be effaced by the exerciſe of power, they will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power is to ceaſe, when their exerciſe of it is to be reviewed, and when they muſt deſcend to the level from which they were raiſed; there for ever to remain, unleſs a faithful diſcharge of their truſt ſhall have eſtabliſhed their title to a renewal of it.</p>
                     <p>I will add as a fifth circumſtance in the ſituation of the houſe of repreſentatives, reſtraining them from oppreſſive meaſures, that they can make no law which will not have its full operation on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their friends, as well as on the great maſs of the ſociety. This has always been deemed one of the ſtrongeſt bonds by which human policy can
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:021127_0393_0FB2478129FBD550"/>
connect the rulers and the people together. It creates between them that communion of intereſt and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of ſentiments of which few governments have furniſhed examples; but without which every government degenerates into tyranny. If it be aſked what is to reſtrain the houſe of repreſentatives from making legal diſcriminations in favor of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and a particular claſs of the ſociety? I anſwer, the genius of the whole ſyſtem, the nature of juſt and conſtitutional laws, and above all the vigilant and manly ſpirit which actuates the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, a ſpirit which nouriſhes freedom, and in return is nouriſhed by it.</p>
                     <p>If this ſpirit ſhall ever be ſo far debaſed as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legiſlature as well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate any thing but liberty.</p>
                     <p>Such will be the relation between the houſe of repreſentatives and their conſtituents. Duty, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, intereſt, ambition itſelf, are the cords by which they will be bound to fidelity and ſympathy with the great maſs of the people. It is poſſible that theſe may all be inſufficient to control the caprice and wickedneſs of men. But are they not all that government will admit, and that human prudence can deviſe? Are they not the genuine and the characteriſtic means by which republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment provides for the liberty and happineſs of the people? Are they not the indentical means on which every ſtate government in the union, relies for the attainment of theſe important ends? What then are we to underſtand by the objection which this paper has combated? What are we to ſay to the men who profeſs the moſt flaming zeal for republican government, yet boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be champions for the right and the capacity of the people to chuſe their own rulers, yet maintain that they will prefer thoſe only
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:021127_0394_0FB24786F0211350"/>
who will immediately and infallibly betray the truſt committed to them?</p>
                     <p>Were the objection to be read by one who had not ſeen the mode preſcribed by the conſtitution for the choice of repreſentatives, he could ſuppoſe nothing leſs than that ſome unreaſonable qualification of property was annexed to the right of ſuffrage; or that the right of eligibility was limited to perſons of particular families or fortunes; or at leaſt that the mode preſcribed by the ſtate conſtitutions was in ſome reſpect or other very groſsly departed from. We have ſeen how far ſuch a ſuppoſition would err as to the two firſt points. Nor would it in fact be leſs erroneous as to the laſt. The only difference diſcoverable between the two caſes is, that each repreſentative of the United States will be elected by five or ſix thouſand citizens; whilſt in the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſtates the election of a repreſentative is left to about as many hundred. Will it be pretended that this difference is ſufficient to juſtify an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſtate governments and an abhorrence to the federal government? If this be the point on which the objection turns it deſerves to be examined.</p>
                     <p>Is it ſupported by <hi>reaſon?</hi> This cannot be ſaid, without maintaining that five or ſix thouſand citizens are leſs capable of chuſing a fit repreſentative, or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one, than five or ſix hundred. Reaſon, on the contrary aſſures us, that as in ſo great a number, a fit repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive would be moſt likely to be found, ſo the choice would be leſs likely to be diverted from him, by the intrigues of the ambitious, or the bribes of the rich.</p>
                     <p>Is the <hi>conſequence</hi> from this doctrine admiſſible? If we ſay that five or ſix hundred citizens are as many as can jointly exerciſe their right of ſuffrage, muſt we not deprive the people of the immediate choice of their public ſervants in every inſtance where the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the government does not require as many
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:021127_0395_0FB24788A86F70C0"/>
of them as will amount to one for that number of citizens?</p>
                     <p>Is the doctrine warranted by <hi>facts?</hi> It was ſhewn in the laſt paper, that the real repreſentation in the Britiſh houſe of commons very little exceeds the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of one for every thirty thouſand inhabitants. Beſides a variety of powerful cauſes, not exiſting here and which favor in that country, the pretenſions of rank and wealth, no perſon is eligible as a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of a county, unleſs he poſſeſs real eſtate of the clear value of ſix hundred pounds ſterling per year; nor of a city or borough, unleſs he poſſeſs a like eſtate of half that annual value. To this qualification on the part of the county repreſentatives, is added another on the part of the county electors, which reſtrains the right of ſuffrage to perſons having a freehold eſtate of the annual value of more than twenty pounds ſterling, according to the preſent rate of money. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe unfavourable circumſtances, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome very unequal laws in the Britiſh code, it cannot be ſaid that the repreſentatives of the nation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many.</p>
                     <p>But we need not reſort to foreign experience on this ſubject. Our own is explicit and deciſive. The diſtricts in New-Hampſhire in which the ſenators are choſen immediately by the people, are nearly as large as will be neceſſary for her repreſentatives in the congreſs. Thoſe of Maſſachuſetts are larger than will be neceſſary for that purpoſe. And thoſe of New-York ſtill more ſo. In the laſt ſtate the members of aſſembly, for the cities and counties of New-York and Albany, are elected by very nearly as many voters as will be entitled to a repreſentative in the congreſs, calculating on the number of ſixty-five repreſentatives only. It makes no difference that in theſe ſenatorial diſtricts and counties, a number of repreſentatives are voted for by each elector at the ſame time. If the ſame electors, at the ſame time, are capable of
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:021127_0396_0FB2478A30123E70"/>
chooſing four or five repreſentatives, they cannot be incapable of chooſing one. Pennſylvania is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional example. Some of her counties which elect her ſtate repreſentatives, are almoſt as large as her diſtricts will be by which her federal repreſentatives will be elected. The city of Philadelphia is ſuppoſed to contain between fifty and ſixty thouſand ſouls. It will therefore form nearly two diſtricts for the choice of federal repreſentatives. It forms however but one county, in which every elector votes for each of its repreſentatives in the ſtate legiſlature. And what may appear to be ſtill more directly to our purpoſe, the whole city actually elects a <hi>ſingle member</hi> for the executive council. This is the caſe in all the other counties of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Are not theſe facts the moſt ſatisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been employed againſt the branch of the federal government under conſideration? Has it appeared on trial that the ſenators of New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts and New-York; or the executive council of Pennſylvania; or the members of the aſſembly in the two laſt ſtates, have betrayed any peculiar diſpoſition to ſacrifice the many to the few; or are in any reſpect leſs worthy of their places than the repreſentatives and magiſtrates appointed in other ſtates, by very ſmall diviſions of the people?</p>
                     <p>But there are caſes of a ſtronger complexion than any which I have yet quoted. One branch of the legiſlature of Connecticut is ſo conſtituted that each member of it is elected by the whole ſtate. So is the governor of that ſtate, of Maſſachuſetts, and of this ſtate, and the preſident of New-Hampſhire. I leave every man to decide whether the reſult of any one of theſe experiments can be ſaid to countenance a ſuſpicion that a diffuſive mode of chuſing repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people tends to elevate traitors, and to undermine the public liberty.</p>

                     <p>THE remaining charge againſt the houſe of repreſentatives which I am to examine, is grounded on a ſuppoſition that the number of members will not be augmented from time to time, as the progreſs of population may demand.</p>
                     <p>It has been admitted that this objection, if well ſupported, would have great weight. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſervations will ſhew that like moſt other objections againſt the conſtitution, it can only proceed from a partial view of the ſubject; or from a jealouſy which diſcolours and disfigures every object which is beheld.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thoſe who urge the objection ſeem not to have recollected that the federal conſtitution will not ſuffer by a compariſon with the ſtate conſtitutions, in the ſecurity provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of repreſentatives. The number which is to prevail in the firſt inſtance is declared to be temporary. Its duration is limited to the ſhort term of three years.</p>
                     <p>Within every ſucceſſive term of ten years, a cenſus of inhabitants is to be repeated. The unequivocal objects of theſe regulations are, firſt, to re-adjuſt from time to time the apportionment of repreſentatives to the number of inhabitants; under the ſingle exception that each ſtate ſhall have one repreſentative at leaſt: Secondly, to augment the number of repreſentatives at the ſame periods; under the ſole limitation, that the whole number ſhall not exceed one for every thirty thouſand inhabitants. If we review the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the ſeveral ſtates, we ſhall find that ſome of them contain no determinate regulations on this ſubject; that others correſpond pretty much on this

As far as experience has taken place on this ſubject, a gradual increaſe of repreſentatives under the ſtate conſtitutions, has at leaſt kept pace with that of the conſtituents; and it appears that the former have been as ready to concur in ſuch meaſures, as the latter have been to call for them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is a peculiarity in the federal conſtitution which enſures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and of their repreſentatives, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional augmentation of the latter. The pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity lies in this, that one branch of the legiſlature is a repreſentation of citizens; the other of the ſtates: In the former, conſequently the larger ſtates will have moſt weight; in the latter, the advantage will be in favor of the ſmaller ſtates. From this circumſtance it may with certainty be inferred, that the larger ſtates will be ſtrenuous advocates for increaſing the number and weight of that part of the legiſlature in which their influence predominates. And it ſo happens that four only of the largeſt, will have a majority of the whole votes in the houſe of repreſentatives. Should the repreſentatives or people therefore of the ſmaller ſtates oppoſe at any time a reaſonable addition of members, a coalition of a very few ſtates will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to overrule the oppoſition; a coalition, which notwithſtanding the rivalſhip and local prejudices which might prevent it on ordinary occaſions, would not fail to take place, when not merely prompted by common intereſt but juſtified by equity and the principles of the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>It may be alledged, perhaps, that the ſenate would be prompted by like motives to an adverſe coalition; and as their concurrence would be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable, the juſt and conſtitutional views of the other branch might be defeated. This is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which has probably created the moſt ſerious
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:021127_0399_0FB2479308D4BA18"/>
apprehenſions in the jealous friends of a numerous repreſentation. Fortunately it is among the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which, exiſting only in appearance, vaniſh on a cloſe and accurate inſpection. The following reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will, if I miſtake not, be admitted to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive and ſatisfactory on this point.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the equal authority which will ſubſiſt between the two houſes on all legiſlative ſubjects, except the originating of money bills, it cannot be doubted that the houſe compoſed of the greater number of members, when ſupported by the more powerful ſtates, and ſpeaking the known and determined ſenſe of a majority of the people, will have no ſmall advantage in a queſtion depending on the comparative firmneſs of the two houſes.</p>
                     <p>This advantage muſt be increaſed by the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs felt by the ſame ſide, of being ſupported in its demands, by right, by reaſon, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and the conſciouſneſs on the oppoſite ſide, of contending againſt the force of all theſe ſolemn conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>It is farther to be conſidered that in the gradation between the ſmalleſt and largeſt ſtates, there are ſeveral which, though moſt likely in general to arrange themſelves among the former, are too little removed in extent and population from the latter, to ſecond an oppoſition to their juſt and legitimate pretenſions. Hence it is by no means certain that a majority of votes, even in the ſenate; would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number of repreſentatives.</p>
                     <p>It will not be looking too far to add, that the ſenators from all the new ſtates may be gained over to the juſt views of the houſe of repreſentatives, by an expedient too obvious to be overlooked. As theſe ſtates will for a great length of time advance in population with peculiar rapidity, they will be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in frequent re-apportionments of the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives to the number of inhabitants. The large ſtates
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:021127_0400_0FB247966A751848"/>
therefore, who will prevail in the houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, will have nothing to do, but to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apportionments and augmentations mutually condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of each other; and the ſenators from all the moſt growing ſtates will be bound to contend for the latter, by the intereſt which their ſtates will feel in the former.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations ſeem to afford ample ſecurity on this ſubject; and ought alone to ſatisfy all the doubts and fears which have been indulged with regard to it. Admitting however, that they ſhould all be inſufficient to ſubdue the unjuſt policy of the ſmaller ſtates, or their predominant influence in the councils of the ſenate; a conſtitutional and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſource ſtill remains with the larger ſtates, by which they will be able at all times to accompliſh their juſt purpoſes. The houſe of repreſentatives can not only refuſe, but they alone can propoſe the ſupplies requiſite for the ſupport of government. They in a word hold the purſe; that powerful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which we behold in the hiſtory of the Britiſh conſtitution, an infant and humble repreſentation of the people, gradually enlarging the ſphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it ſeems to have wiſhed, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This power over the purſe, may in fact be regarded as the moſt compleat and effectual weapon with which any conſtitution can arm the immediate repreſentatives of the people, for obtaining a redreſs of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every juſt and ſalutary meaſure.</p>
                     <p>But will not the houſe of repreſentatives be as much intereſted as the ſenate in maintaining the government in its proper functions, and will they not therefore be unwilling to ſtake its exiſtence for its reputation on the pliancy of the ſenate? Or if ſuch a trial of firmneſs between the two branches were hazarded, would not the one be as likely firſt
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:021127_0401_0FB24B862FF661A0"/>
to yield as the other? Theſe queſtions will create no difficulty with thoſe who reflect, that in all caſes the ſmaller the number and the more permanent and conſpicuous the ſtation of men in power, the ſtronger muſt be the intereſt which they will individually feel in whatever concerns the government. Thoſe who repreſent the dignity of their country in the eyes of other nations, will be particularly ſenſible to every proſpect of public danger or of a diſhonorable ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in public affairs. To thoſe cauſes we are to aſcribe the continual triumph of the Britiſh houſe of commons over the other branches of the government, whenever the engine of a money bill has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. An abſolute inflexibility on the ſide of the latter, although it could not have failed to involve every department of the ſtate in the general confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, has neither been apprehended nor experienced. The utmoſt degree of firmneſs that can be diſplayed by the federal ſenate or preſident will not be more than equal to a reſiſtance in which they will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by conſtitutional and patriotic principles.</p>
                     <p>In this review of the conſtitution of the houſe of repreſentatives, I have paſſed over the circumſtance of economy, which in the preſent ſtate of affairs might have had ſome effect in leſſening the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary number of repreſentatives; and a diſregard of which would probably have been as rich a theme of declamation againſt the conſtitution as has been furniſhed by the ſmallneſs of the number propoſed. I omit alſo any remarks on the difficulty which might be found, under preſent circumſtances, in engaging in the federal ſervice, a large number of ſuch characters as the people will probably elect. One obſervation however, I muſt be permitted to add on this ſubject, as claiming in my judgment a very ſerious attention. It is, that in all legiſlative aſſemblies, the greater the number compoſing them may be, the fewer will be the men who will in fact direct their proceedings. In the firſt place, the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:021127_0402_0FB24B87B64032E8"/>
more numerous any aſſembly may be, of whatever characters compoſed, the greater is known to be the aſcendancy of paſſion over reaſon. In the next place, the larger the number, the greater will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of members of limited information and of weak capacities. Now it is preciſely on characters of this deſcription that the eloquence and addreſs of the few are known to act with all their force. In the antient republics, where the whole body of the people aſſembled in perſon, a ſingle orator, or an artful ſtateſman, was generally ſeen to rule with as compleat a ſway, as if a ſceptre had been placed in his ſingle hands. On the ſame principle the more multitudinous a repreſentative aſſembly may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more it will partake of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will be the dupe of cunning; and paſſion the ſlave of ſophiſtry and declamation. The people can never err more than in ſuppoſing that by multiplying their repreſentatives beyond a certain limit, they ſtrengthen the barrier againſt the government of a few. Experience will forever admoniſh them that on the contrary, <hi>after ſecuring a ſufficient number for the purpoſes of ſafety, of local information, and of diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſympathy with the whole ſociety,</hi> they will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract their own views by every addition to their repreſentatives. The countenance of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may become more democratic; but the ſoul that animates it will be more oligarchic. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine will be enlarged, but the fewer, and often the more ſecret, will be the ſprings by which its motions are directed.</p>
                     <p>As connected with the objection againſt the number of repreſentatives, may properly be here noticed, that which has been ſuggeſted againſt the number made competent for legiſlative buſineſs. It has been ſaid that more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum, and in particular caſes, if not in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a deciſion.
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:021127_0403_0FB24B89CDCD91C0"/>
That ſome advantages might have reſulted from ſuch a precaution, cannot be denied. It might have been an additional ſhield to ſome particular intereſts, and another obſtacle generally to haſty and partial meaſures. But theſe conſiderations are outweighed by the inconveniencies in the oppoſite ſcale. In all caſes where juſtice or the general good might require new laws to be paſſed, or active meaſures to be purſued, the fundamental principle of free government would be reverſed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule; the power would be transferred to the minority. Were the defenſive privilege limited to particular caſes, an intereſted minority might take advantage of it to ſkreen themſelves from equitable ſacrifices to the general weal, or in particular emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies to extort unreaſonable indulgences. Laſtly, it would facilitate and foſter the baneful practice of ſeceſſions; a practice which has ſhewn itſelf even in ſtates where a majority only is required; a practice ſubverſive of all the principles of order and regular government; a practice which leads more directly to public convulſions, and the ruin of popular governments, than any other which has yet been diſplayed among us.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER LIX. Concerning the Regulation of Elections.</head>
                     <p>THE natural order of the ſubject leads us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in this place, that proviſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which authoriſes the national legiſlature to regulate in the laſt reſort the election of its own members. It is in theſe words—
<q>The <hi>times, places</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of holding elections for ſenators and repreſentatives, ſhall be preſcribed in each ſtate
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:021127_0404_0FB24B8AA47CD5E8"/>
by the legiſlature thereof; but the congreſs may at any time by law, make or alter <hi>ſuch regulations</hi> except as to <hi>places</hi> of chooſing ſenators<note n="*" place="bottom">1ſt Clauſe, 4th Section of the 1ſt Article.</note>.</q>
This proviſion has not only been declaimed againſt by thoſe who condemn the conſtitution in the groſs; but it has been cenſured by thoſe, who have objected with leſs latitude and greater moderation; and in one inſtance, it has been thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himſelf the advocate of every other part of the ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>I am greatly miſtaken, notwithſtanding, if there be any article in the whole plan more completely defenſible than this. Its propriety reſts upon the evidence of this plain propoſition, that <hi>every govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to contain in itſelf the means of its own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</hi> Every juſt reaſoner will at firſt ſight approve an adherence to this rule in the work of the convention; and will diſapprove every deviation from it, which may not appear to have been dictated by the neceſſity of incorporating into the work ſome particular ingredient, with which a rigid conformity to the rule was incompatible. Even in this caſe, though he may acquieſce in the neceſſity, yet he will not ceaſe to regard a departure from ſo fundamental a principle, as a portion of imperfection in the ſyſtem which may prove the feed of future weakneſs and perhaps anarchy.</p>
                     <p>It will not be alledged than an election law could have been framed and inſerted into the conſtitution, which would have been applicable to every probable change in the ſituation of the country; and it will therefore not be denied that a diſcretionary power over elections ought to exiſt ſomewhere. It will, I preſume, be as readily conceded, that there were only three ways, in which this power could have been reaſonably modified and diſpoſed, that it muſt either have been lodged wholly in the national legiſlature, or wholly in the ſtate legiſlatures, or primarily in
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:021127_0405_0FB24B90218BA968"/>
the latter, and ultimately in the former. The laſt mode has with reaſon been preferred by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. They have ſubmitted the regulation of elections for the federal government in the firſt inſtance to the local adminiſtrations; which in ordinary caſes, and when no improper views prevail, may be both more convenient and more ſatisfactory; but they have reſerved to the national authority a right to interpoſe, whenever extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might render that interpoſition neceſſary to its ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power of regulating elections for the national government, in the hands of the ſtate legiſlatures, would leave the exiſtence of the union entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment annihilate it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of perſons to adminiſter its affairs. It is to little purpoſe to ſay that a neglect or omiſſion of this kind, would not be likely to take place. The conſtitutional poſſibility of the thing, without an equivalent for the riſk, is an unanſwerable objection. Nor has any ſatisfactory reaſon been yet aſſigned for incurring that riſk. The extravagant ſurmiſes of a diſtempered jealouſy can never be dignified with that character. If we are in a humour to preſume abuſes of power, it is as fair to preſume them on the part of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as on the part of the general government. And as it is more conſonant to the rules of a juſt theory to intruſt the union with the care of its own exiſtence, than to transfer that care to any other hands; if abuſes of power are to be hazarded on the one ſide or on the other, it is more rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be placed, than where it would unnaturally be placed.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe an article had been introduced into the conſtitution, empowering the United States to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the elections for the particular ſtates, would any man have heſitated to condemn it, both as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:021127_0406_0FB24B916A7A2158"/>
tranſpoſition of power, and as a preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated engine for the deſtruction of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? The violation of principle in this caſe would have required no comment; and to an unbiaſſed obſerver, it will not be leſs apparent in the project of ſubjecting the exiſtence of the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a ſimilar reſpect to the pleaſure of the ſtate governments. An impartial view of the matter cannot fail to reſult in a conviction, that each, as far as poſſible ought to depend on itſelf for its own preſervation.</p>
                     <p>As an objection to this poſition, it may be remarked that the conſtitution of the national ſenate, would involve in its full extent the danger which it is ſuggeſted might flow from an excluſive power in the ſtate legiſlatures to regulate the federal elections. It may be alledged, that by declining the appointment of ſenators, they might at any time give a fatal blow to the union; and from this it may be infered, that as its exiſtence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in ſo eſſential a point, there can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to entruſting them with it, in the particular caſe under conſideration. The intereſt of each ſtate, it may be added, to maintain its repreſentation in the national councils, would be a complete ſecurity againſt an abuſe of the truſt.</p>
                     <p>This argument, though ſpecious, will not upon examination be found ſolid. It is certainly true, that the ſtate legiſlatures, by forbearing the appointment of ſenators, may deſtroy the national government. But it will not follow, that becauſe they have the power to do this in one inſtance, they ought to have it in every other. There are caſes in which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious tendency of ſuch a power may be far more deciſive, without any motive, equally cogent with that which muſt have regulated the conduct of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, in reſpect to the conſtruction of the ſenate, to recommend their admiſſion into the ſyſtem. So far as that conſtruction may expoſe the union to the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:021127_0407_0FB24B92E3DB8120"/>
poſſibility of injury from the ſtate legiſlatures, it is an evil; but it is an evil, which could not have been avoided without excluding the ſtates, in their political capacities, wholly from a place in the organization of the national government. If this had been done, it would doubtleſs have been interpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal principle; and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have deprived the ſtate governments of that abſolute ſafe-guard, which they will enjoy under this proviſion. But however wiſe it may have been, to have ſubmitted in this inſtance to an inconvenience, for the attainment of a neceſſary advantage or a greater good, no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the evil, where no neceſſity urges, nor any greater good invites.</p>
                     <p>It may eaſily be diſcerned alſo, that the national government would run a much greater riſk from a power in the ſtate legiſlatures over the elections of its houſe of repreſentatives, than from their power of appointing the members of its ſenate. The ſenators are to be choſen for the period of ſix years; there is to be a rotation, by which the ſeats of a third part of them are to be vacated, and repleniſhed every two years; and no ſtate is to be entitled to more than two ſenators: A quorum of the body is to conſiſt of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen members. The joint reſult of theſe circumſtances would be, that a temporary combination of a few ſtates, to intermit the appointment of ſenators, could neither annul the exiſtence nor impair the activity of the body: And it is not from a general and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent combination of the ſtates, that we can have any thing to fear. The firſt might proceed from ſiniſter deſigns in the leading members of a few of the ſtate legiſlatures; the laſt would ſuppoſe a fixed and rooted diſaffection in the great body of the people; which will either never exiſt at all, or will in all probability proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the general government to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:021127_0408_0FB24B9B288B0358"/>
of their happineſs; in which event no good citizen could deſire its continuance.</p>
                     <p>But with regard to the federal houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, there is intended to be a general election of members once in two years. If the ſtate legiſlatures were to be inveſted with an excluſive power of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating theſe elections, every period of making them would be a delicate criſis in the national ſituation; which might iſſue in a diſſolution of the union, if the leaders of a few of the moſt important ſtates ſhould have entered into a previous conſpiracy to prevent an election.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not deny that there is a degree of weight in the obſervation, that the intereſt of each ſtate to be repreſented in the federal councils will be a ſecurity againſt the abuſe of a power over its elections in the hands of the ſtate legiſlatures. But the ſecurity will not be conſidered as complete, by thoſe who attend to the force of an obvious diſtinction between the intereſts of the people in the public felicity, and the intereſt of their local rulers in the power and conſequence of their offices. The people of America may be warmly attached to the government of the union at times, when the particular rulers of particular ſtates, ſtimulated by the natural rivalſhip of power, and by the hopes of perſonal aggrandiſement, and ſupported by a ſtrong faction in each of thoſe ſtates, may be in a very oppoſite temper. This diverſity of ſentiment, between a majority of the people, and the individuals who have the greateſt credit, in their councils, is exemplified in ſome of the ſtates, at the preſent moment, on the preſent queſtion. The ſcheme of ſeparate confederacies, which will always multiply the chances of ambition, will be a never failing bait to all ſuch influential characters in the ſtate admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations as are capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the public weal. With ſo effectual a weapon in their hands as the excluſive power of regulating elections for the national
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:021127_0409_0FB24B9D37370280"/>
government, a combination of a few ſuch men, in a few of the moſt conſiderable ſtates, where the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will always be the ſtrongeſt, might accompliſh the deſtruction of the union; by ſeizing the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſome caſual diſſatisfaction among the people, (and which perhaps they may themſelves have excited) to diſcontinue the choice of members for the federal houſe of repreſentatives. It ought never to be forgotten, that a firm union of this country, under an efficient government, will probably be an encreaſing object of jealouſy to more than one nation of Europe; and that enterpriſes to ſubvert it will ſometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers, and will ſeldom fail to be patroniſed and abbetted by ſome of them. Its preſervation therefore ought in no caſe, that can be avoided, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the guardianſhip of any but thoſe, whoſe ſituation will uniformly beget an immediate intereſt in the faithful and vigilant performance of the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WE have ſeen that an incontrolable power over the elections for the federal government could not, without hazard be committed to the ſtate legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures. Let us now ſee what would be the dangers on the other ſide; that is, from confiding the ultimate right of regulating its own elections to the union itſelf. It is not pretended, that this right would ever be uſed for the excluſion of any ſtate from its ſhare in the repreſentation. The intereſt of all would in this reſpect at leaſt be the ſecurity of all. But it is alledged that it might be employed in ſuch a manner as to promote the election of ſome favourite claſs of men in
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:021127_0410_0FB24BA220EA3948"/>
excluſion of others; by confining the places of election to particular diſtricts, and rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in the choice. Of all chimerical ſuppoſitions, this ſeems to be the moſt chimerical. On the one hand no rational calculation of probabilities would lead us to imagine, that the diſpoſition, which a conduct ſo violent and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary would imply, could ever find its way into the national councils; and on the other, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with certainty, that if ſo improper a ſpirit ſhould ever gain admittance into them, it would diſplay itſelf in a form altogether different and far more deciſive.</p>
                     <p>The improbability of the attempt may be ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily inferred from this ſingle reflection, that it could never be made without cauſing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people, headed and directed by the ſtate governments. It is not difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this characteriſtic right of freedom may, in certain turbulent and factious ſeaſons, be violated in reſpect to a particular claſs of citizens by a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious majority; but that ſo fundamental a privilege, in a country ſituated and enlightened as this is, ſhould be invaded to the prejudice of the great maſs of the people, by the deliberate policy of the government, without occaſioning a popular revolution, is altogether inconceivable and incredible.</p>
                     <p>In addition to this general reflection, there are conſiderations of a more preciſe nature, which forbid all apprehenſion on the ſubject. The diſſimilarity in the ingredients, which will compoſe the national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſtill more in the manner in which they will be brought into action in its various branches, muſt form a powerful obſtacle to a concert of views, in any partial ſcheme of elections. There is ſufficient diverſity in the ſtate of property, in the genius, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and habits of the people of the different parts of the union, to occaſion a material diverſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in their repreſentatives towards the different
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:021127_0411_0FB24BA371D76258"/>
ranks and conditions in ſociety. And though an intimate intercourſe under the ſame government will promote a gradual aſſimilation of temper and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet there are cauſes as well phyſical as moral, which may in a greater or leſs degree permanently nouriſh different propenſities and inclinations in this particular. But the circumſtance which will be likely to have the greateſt influence in the matter, will be the diſſimilar modes of conſtituting the ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent parts of the government. The houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives being to be elected immediately by the people; the ſenate by the ſtate legiſlatures; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident by electors choſen for that purpoſe by the people; there would be little probability of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt to cement theſe different branches in a predilection for any particular claſs of electors.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſenate it is impoſſible that any regulation of "time and manner," which is all that is propoſed to be ſubmitted to the national government in reſpect to that body, can affect the ſpirit which will direct the choice of its members. The collective ſenſe of the ſtate legiſlatures can never be influenced by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous circumſtances of that ſort: A conſideration which alone ought to ſatisfy us that the diſcrimination apprehended would never be attempted. For what inducement could the ſenate have to concur in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in which itſelf would not be included? Or to what purpoſe would it be eſtabliſhed in reference to one branch of the legiſlature, if it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the other? The compoſition of the one would in this caſe counteract that of the other. And we can never ſuppoſe that it would embrace the appointments to the ſenate, unleſs we can at the ſame time ſuppoſe the voluntary co-operation of the ſtate legiſlatures. If we make the latter ſuppoſition, it then becomes immaterial where the power in queſtion is placed; whether in their hands or in thoſe of the union.</p>

                        <pb n="175" facs="unknown:021127_0412_0FB24BA4E4DFE160"/>But what is to be the object of this capricious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in the national councils? Is it to be exerciſed in a diſcrimination between the different departments of induſtry, or between the different kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or between the different degrees of property? Will it lean in favor of the landed intereſt, or the monied intereſt, or the mercantile intereſt, or the manufacturing intereſt? Or, to ſpeak in the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able language of the adverſaries of the conſtitution, will it court the elevation of the
<q>wealthy and the well born</q>
to the excluſion and debaſement of all the reſt of the ſociety?</p>
                     <p>If this partiality is to be exerted in favour of thoſe who are concerned in any particular deſcription of induſtry or property, I preſume it will readily be admitted that the competition for it will lie between landed men and merchants. And I ſcruple not to affirm, that it is infinitely leſs likely that either of them ſhould gain an aſcendant in the national councils, than that the one or the other of them ſhould predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in all the local councils. The inference will be, that a conduct tending to give an undue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to either, is much leſs to be dreaded from the former than from the latter.</p>
                     <p>The ſeveral ſtates are in various degrees addicted to agriculture and commerce. In moſt, if not all of them, agriculture is predominant. In a few of them, however, commerce nearly divides its empire, and in moſt of them has a conſiderable ſhare of influence. In proportion as either prevails, it will be conveyed into the national repreſentation; and for the very reaſon that this will be an emanation from a greater variety of intereſts, and in much more various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, than are to be found in any ſingle ſtate, it will be much leſs apt to eſpouſe either of them, with a decided partiality, than the repreſentation of any ſingle ſtate.</p>
                     <p>In a country conſiſting chiefly of the cultivators of land where the rules of an equal repreſentation
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:021127_0413_0FB24BAB5BF37CB0"/>
obtain the landed intereſt muſt upon the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate in the government. As long as this intereſt prevails in moſt of the ſtate legiſlatures, ſo long it muſt maintain a correſpondent ſuperiority in the national ſenate, which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of thoſe aſſemblies. It cannot therefore be preſumed that a ſacrifice of the landed to the mercantile claſs will ever be a favorite object of this branch of the federal legiſlature. In applying thus particularly to the ſenate a general obſervation ſuggeſted by the ſituation of the country, I am governed by the conſideration, that the credulous votaries of ſtate power, cannot upon their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſuſpect that the ſtate legiſlatures would be warped from their duty by any external influence. But as in reality the ſame ſituation muſt have the ſame effect in the primitive compoſition at leaſt of the federal houſe of repreſentatives; an improper byaſs towards the mercantile claſs is as little to be expected from this quarter or from the other.</p>
                     <p>In order perhaps to give countenance to the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at any rate, it may be aſked, is there not danger of an oppoſite byaſs in the national government, which may diſpoſe it to endeavour to ſecure a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly of the federal adminiſtration to the landed claſs? As there is little likelihood that the ſuppoſition of ſuch a byaſs will have any terrors for thoſe who would be immediately injured by it, a laboured anſwer to this queſtion will be diſpenſed with. It will be ſufficient to remark, firſt, that for the reaſons elſewhere aſſigned, it is leſs likely that any decided partiality ſhould prevail in the councils of the union than in thoſe of any of its members. Secondly that there would be no temptation to violate the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in favor of the landed claſs, becauſe that claſs would in the natural courſe of things enjoy as great a preponderancy as itſelf could deſire. And thirdly that men accuſtomed to inveſtigate the ſources of public proſperity, upon a large ſcale, muſt be too well
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:021127_0414_0FB24BACF1A64FD8"/>
convinced of the utility of commerce, to be inclined to inflict upon it ſo deep a wound as would be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the entire excluſion of thoſe who would beſt underſtand its intereſts from a ſhare in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. The importance of commerce in the view of revenue alone muſt effectually guard it againſt the enmity of a body which would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually importuned in its favor by the urgent calls of public neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>I the rather conſult brevity in diſcuſſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of a preference founded upon a diſcrimination between the different kinds of induſtry and property, becauſe, as far as I underſtand the meaning of the objectors, they contemplate a diſcrimination of another kind. They appear to have in view, as the objects of the preference with which they endeavour to alarm us, thoſe whom they deſignate by the deſcription of the "wealthy and the well born." Theſe, it ſeems, are to be exalted to an odious pre-eminence over the reſt of their fellow citizens. At one time however their elevation is to be a neceſſary conſequence of the ſmallneſs of the repreſentative body; at another time it is to be effected by depriving the people at large of the opportunity of exerciſing their right of ſuffrage in the choice of that body.</p>
                     <p>But upon what principle is the diſcrimination of the places of election to be made in order to anſwer the purpoſe of the meditated preference? Are the wealthy and the well born, as they are called, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to particular ſpots in the ſeveral ſtates? Have they by ſome miraculous inſtinct or foreſight ſet apart in each of them a common place of reſidence? Are they only to be met with in the towns and the cities? Or are they, on the contrary ſcattered over the face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to caſt their own lot, or that of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors? If the latter is the caſe, (as every intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent man knows it to be<note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly in the Southern States and in this State.</note>) is it not evident that the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:021127_0415_0FB24BADE80A5208"/>
policy of confining the places of elections to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſtricts would be as ſubverſive of its own aim as it would be exceptionable on every other account? The truth is that there is no method of ſecuring to the rich the preference apprehended, but by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing qualifications of property either for thoſe who may elect, or be elected. But this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government. Its authority would be expreſsly reſtricted to the regulation of the <hi>times,</hi> the <hi>places,</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> of elections. The qualifications of the perſons who may chooſe or be choſen, as has been remarked upon another occaſion, are defined and fixed in the conſtitution; and are unalterable by the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>Let it however be admitted, for argument ſake, that the expedient ſuggeſted might be ſucceſsful; and let it at the ſame time be equally taken for granted that all the ſcruples which a ſenſe of duty or an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the danger of the experiment might inſpire, were overcome in the breaſts of the national rulers; ſtill, I imagine, it will hardly be pretended, that they could ever hope to carry ſuch an enterpriſe into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, without the aid of a military force ſufficient to ſubdue the reſiſtance of the great body of the people. The improbability of the exiſtence of a force equal to that object, has been diſcuſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in different parts of theſe papers; but that the futility of the objection under conſideration may appear in the ſtrongeſt light, it ſhall be conceded for a moment that ſuch a force might exiſt; and the national government ſhall be ſuppoſed to be in the actual poſſeſſion of it. What will be the concluſion? With a diſpoſition to invade the eſſential rights of the community, and with the means of gratifying that diſpoſition, is it preſumable that the perſons who were actuated by it would amuſe themſelves in the ridiculous taſk of fabricating election laws for ſecuring a preference to a favourite claſs of men? Would they
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:021127_0416_0FB24BAF8F561DF0"/>
not be likely to prefer a conduct better adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement? Would they not rather boldly reſolve to perpetuate themſelves in office by one deciſive act of uſurpation, than to truſt to precarious expedients, which in ſpite of all the precautions that might accompany them, might ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in the diſmiſſion, diſgrace and ruin of their authors? Would they not fear that citizens not leſs tenacious than conſcious of their rights would flock from the remoteſt extremes of their reſpective ſtates to the places of election, to overthrow their tyrants, and to ſubſtitute men who would be diſpoſed to avenge the violated majeſty of the people?</p>

                     <p>THE more candid oppoſers of the proviſion reſpecting elections contained in the plan of the convention, when preſſed in argument, will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concede the propriety of that proviſion; with this qualification however that it ought to have been accompanied with a declaration that all elections ſhould be had in the counties where the electors reſided. This ſay they, was a neceſſary precaution againſt an abuſe of the power. A declaration of this nature, would certainly have been harmleſs: So far as it would have had the effect of quieting apprehenſions, it might not have been undeſirable. But it would in fact have afforded little or no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſecurity againſt the danger apprehended; and the want of it will never be conſidered by an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and judicious examiner as a ſerious, ſtill leſs, as an inſuperable objection to the plan. The different views taken of the ſubject in the two preceding
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:021127_0417_0FB24BB66D3610F0"/>
papers muſt be ſufficient to ſatisfy all diſpaſſionate and diſcerning men, that if the public liberty ſhould ever be the victim of the ambition of the national rulers, the power under examination at leaſt will be guiltleſs of the ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe who are inclined to conſult their jealouſy only would exerciſe it in a careful inſpection of the ſeveral ſtate conſtitutions, they would find little leſs room for diſquietude and alarm from the latitude which moſt of them allow in reſpect to elections, than from the latitude which is propoſed to be allowed to the national government in the ſame reſpect. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of their ſituation, in this particular, would tend greatly to remove any ill impreſſions which may remain in regard to this matter. But as that review would lead into lengthy and tedious details, I ſhall content myſelf with the ſingle example of the ſtate in which I write. The conſtitution of New-York makes no other proviſion for <hi>locality</hi> of elections, than that the members of the aſſembly ſhall be elected in the <hi>counties,</hi> thoſe of the ſenate in the great diſtricts into which the ſtate is or may be divided; theſe at preſent are four in number, and comprehend each from two to ſix counties. It may readily be perceived, that it would not be more difficult to the legiſlature of New-York to defeat the ſuffrages of the citizens of New-York, by confining elections to particular places, than to the legiſlature of the United States to defeat the ſuffrages of the citizens of the union, by the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. Suppoſe, for inſtance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the ſole place of election for the county and diſtrict of which it is a part, would not the inhabitants of that city ſpeedily become the only electors of the members both of the ſenate and aſſembly, for that county and diſtrict? Can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the electors who reſide in the remote ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the county of Albany, Saratoga, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, &amp;c. or in any part of the county of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery, would take the trouble to come to the city
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:021127_0418_0FB24BB8C8830808"/>
of Albany to give their votes for members of the aſſembly or ſenate, ſooner than they would repair to the city of New-York, to participate in the choice of the members of the federal houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives? The alarming indifference diſcoverable in the exerciſe of ſo invaluable a privilege under the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws, which afford every facility to it, furniſhes a ready anſwer to this queſtion. And, abſtracted from any experience on the ſubject, we can be at no loſs to determine that when the place of election is at an <hi>inconvenient diſtance</hi> from the elector, the effect upon his conduct will be the ſame whether that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be twenty miles or twenty thouſand miles. Hence it muſt appear that objections to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will in ſubſtance apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the conſtitution of this ſtate; and for this reaſon it will be impoſſible to acquit the one and to condemn the other. A ſimilar compariſon would lead to the ſame conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in reſpect to the conſtitutions of moſt of the other ſtates.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be ſaid that defects in the ſtate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions furniſh no apology for thoſe which are to be found in the plan propoſed; I anſwer, that as the former have never been thought chargeable with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention to the ſecurity of liberty, where the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations thrown on the latter can be ſhewn to be applicable to them alſo, the preſumption is that they are rather the cavilling refinements of a predetermined oppoſition, than the well founded inferences of a candid reſearch after truth. To thoſe who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſider, as innocent omiſſions in the ſtate conſtitutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemiſhes in the plan of the convention, nothing can be ſaid; or at moſt they can only be aſked to aſſign ſome ſubſtantial reaſon why the repreſentatives of the people in a ſingle ſtate ſhould be more impregnable to the luſt of power or other ſiniſter motives, than the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:021127_0419_0FB24BBDE0950C98"/>
repreſentatives of the people of the United States? If they cannot do this, they ought at leaſt to prove to us, that it is eaſier to ſubvert the liberties of three millions of people, with the advantage of local governments to head their oppoſition, than of two hundred thouſand people, who are deſtitute of that advantage. And in relation to the point immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under conſideration, they ought to convince us that it is leſs probable a predominant faction in a ſingle ſtate, ſhould in order to maintain its ſuperiority, incline to a preference of a particular claſs of electors, than that a ſimilar ſpirit ſhould take poſſeſſion of the repreſentatives of thirteen ſtates ſpread over a vaſt region, and in ſeveral reſpects diſtinguiſhable from each other by a diverſity of local circumſtances, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and intereſts.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto my obſervations have only aimed at a vindication of the proviſion in queſtion, on the ground of theoretic propriety, on that of the danger of placing the power elſewhere, and on that of the ſafety of placing it in the manner propoſed. But there remains to be mentioned a poſitive advantage which will accrue from this diſpoſition, and which could not as well have been obtained from any other: I allude to the circumſtance of uniformity in the time of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the federal houſe of repreſentatives. It is more than poſſible, that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of great importance to the public welfare; both as a ſecurity againſt the perpetuation of the ſame ſpirit in the body, and as a cure for the diſeaſes of faction. If each ſtate may chooſe its own time of election, it is poſſible there may be at leaſt as many different periods as there are months in the year. The times of election in the ſeveral ſtates as they are now eſtabliſhed for local purpoſes, vary between extremes as wide as March and November. The conſequence of this diverſity would be, that there could never happen a total diſſolution or renovation of the body at one time. If an improper ſpirit of
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:021127_0420_0FB24BBF31C05018"/>
any kind ſhould happen to prevail in it, that ſpirit would be apt to infuſe itſelf into the new members as they came forward in ſucceſſion. The maſs would be likely to remain nearly the ſame; aſſimilating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to itſelf its gradual accretions. There is a contagion in example which few men have ſufficient force of mind to reſiſt. I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a total diſſolution of the body at the ſame time, might be leſs formidable to liberty, than one third of that duration ſubject to gradual and ſucceſſive alterations.</p>
                     <p>Uniformity in the time of elections ſeems not leſs requiſite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the ſenate; and for conveniently aſſembling the legiſlature at a ſtated period in each year.</p>
                     <p>It may be aſked, why then could not a time have been fixed in the conſtitution? As the moſt zealous adverſaries of the plan of the convention in this ſtate, are in general not leſs zealous admirers of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the ſtate, the queſtion may be retorted, and it may be aſked, why was not a time for the like purpoſe fixed in the conſtitution of this ſtate? No better anſwer can be given, than that it was a matter which might ſafely be entruſted to legiſlative diſcretion, and that if a time had been appointed, it might upon experiment have been found leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient than ſome other time. The ſame anſwer may be given to the queſtion put on the other ſide. And it may be added, that the ſuppoſed danger of a gradual change being merely ſpeculative, it would have been hardly adviſable upon that ſpeculation to eſtabliſh, as a fundamental point, what would deprive ſeveral ſtates of the convenience of having the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their own governments, and for the national government, at the ſame epoch.</p>

                     <p>HAVING examined the conſtitution of the houſe of repreſentatives, and anſwered ſuch of the objections againſt it as ſeemed to merit notice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I enter next on the examination of the ſenate. The heads into which this member of the government may be conſidered, are—I. the qualifications of ſenators—II. the appointment of them by the ſtate legiſlatures—III. the equality of repreſentation in the ſenate—IV. the number of ſenators, and the term for which they are to be elected—V. the powers veſted in the ſenate.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The qualifications propoſed for ſenators, as diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of repreſentatives, conſiſt in a more advanced age, and a longer period of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenſhip. A ſenator muſt be thirty years of age at leaſt; as a repreſentative, muſt be twenty-five. And the former muſt have been a citizen nine years; as ſeven years are required for the latter. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of theſe diſtinctions is explained by the nature of the ſenatorial truſt; which requiring greater extent of information and ſtability of character, requires at the ſame time that the ſenator ſhould have reached a period of life moſt likely to ſupply theſe advantages; and which participating immediately in tranſactions with foreign nations, ought to be exerciſed by none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and habits incident to foreign birth and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The term of nine years appears to be a prudent
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:021127_0422_0FB24BC688AEC740"/>
mediocrity between a total excluſion of adopted citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whoſe merit and talents may claim a ſhare in the public confidence; and an indiſcriminate and haſty admiſſion of them, which might create a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel for foreign influence on the national councils.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is equally unneceſſary to dilate on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of ſenators by the ſtate legiſlatures. Among the various modes which might have been deviſed for conſtituting this branch of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that which has been propoſed by the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is probably the moſt congenial with the public opinion. It is recommended by the double advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of favoring a ſelect appointment, and of giving to the ſtate governments ſuch an agency in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the federal government, as muſt ſecure the authority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the two ſyſtems.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The equality of repreſentation in the ſenate is another point, which, being evidently the reſult of compromiſe between the oppoſite pretenſions of the large and the ſmall ſtates, does not call for much diſcuſſion. If indeed it be right that among a people thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every diſtrict ought to have a <hi>proportional</hi> ſhare in the government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that among independent and ſovereign ſtates bound together by a ſimple league, the parties how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unequal in ſize, ought to have an <hi>equal</hi> ſhare in the common councils, it does not appear to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reaſon, that in a compound republic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking both of the national and federal character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture of the principles of proportional and equal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it is ſuperfluous to try by the ſtandard of theory, a part of the conſtitution which is allowed on all hands to be the reſult not of theory, but
<q>of a ſpirit of amity, and that mutual deference and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion which the peculiarity of our political ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rendered indiſpenſable.</q>
A common govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with powers equal to its objects, is called for
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:021127_0423_0FB24BC79646BA70"/>
by the voice, and ſtill more loudly by the political ſituation of America. A government founded on principles more conſonant to the wiſhes of the larger ſtates, is not likely to be obtained from the ſmaller ſtates. The only option then for the former lies between the propoſed government and a government ſtill more objectionable. Under this alternative the advice of prudence muſt be, to embrace the leſſer evil; and inſtead of indulging a fruitleſs anticipation of the poſſible miſchiefs which may enſue, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template rather the advantageous conſequences which may qualify the ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>In this ſpirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to each ſtate, is at once a conſtitutional recognition of the portion of ſovereignty remaining in the individual ſtates, and an inſtrument for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that reſiduary ſovereignty. So far the equality ought to be no leſs acceptable to the large than to the ſmall ſtates; ſince they are not leſs ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to guard by every poſſible expedient againſt an improper conſolidation of the ſtates into one ſimple republic.</p>
                     <p>Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the conſtitution of the ſenate, is the additional impediment it muſt prove againſt improper acts of legiſlation. No law or reſolution can now be paſſed without the concurrence firſt of a majority of the people, and then of a majority of the ſtates. It muſt be acknowledged that this complicated check on legiſlation may in ſome inſtances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar defence which it involves in favor of the ſmaller ſtates would be more rational, if any intereſts common to them, and diſtinct from thoſe of the other ſtates, would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be expoſed to peculiar danger. But as the larger ſtates will always be able by their power over the ſupplies, to defeat unreaſonable exertions of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the leſſer ſtates; and as the facility and exceſs of law making ſeem to be the diſeaſes to
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:021127_0424_0FB24BCE44D79408"/>
which our governments are moſt liable, it is not impoſſible that this part of the conſtitution may be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in contemplation.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The number of ſenators and the duration of their appointment come next to be conſidered. In order to form an accurate judgment on both theſe points, it will be proper to enquire into the purpoſes which are to be anſwered by a ſenate; and in order to aſcertain theſe it will be neceſſary to review the inconveniencies which a republic muſt ſuffer from the want of ſuch an inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a leſs degree than to other governments, that thoſe who adminiſter it, may forget their obligations to their conſtituents, and prove unfaithful to their important truſt. In this point of view, a ſenate, as a ſecond branch of the legiſlative aſſembly, diſtinct from, and dividing the power with, a firſt, muſt be in all caſes a ſalutary check on the government. It doubles the ſecurity to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two diſtinct bodies in ſchemes of uſurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one, would otherwiſe be ſufficient. This is a precaution founded on ſuch clear principles, and now ſo well underſtood in the United States, that it would be more than ſuperfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark that as the improbability of ſiniſter combinations will be in proportion to the diſſimilarity in the genius of the two bodies; it muſt be politic to diſtinguiſh them from each other by every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which will conſiſt with a due harmony in all proper meaſures, and with the genuine principles of republican government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second.</hi> The neceſſity of a ſenate is not leſs indicated by the propenſity of all ſingle and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aſſemblies, to yield to the impulſe of ſudden and violent paſſions, and to be ſeduced by factious
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:021127_0425_0FB24BD5ABEAFB20"/>
leaders into intemperate and pernicious reſolutions. Examples on this ſubject might be cited without number; and from proceedings within the United States, as well as from the hiſtory of other nations. But a poſition that will not be contradicted need not be proved. All that need be remarked is that a body which is to correct this infirmity ought itſelf be free from it, and conſequently ought to be leſs numerous. It ought moreover to poſſeſs great firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conſequently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of conſiderable duration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Third.</hi> Another defect to be ſupplied by a ſenate lies in a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of legiſlation. It is not poſſible that an aſſembly of men called for the moſt part from purſuits of a private nature, continued in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a ſhort time, and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a ſtudy of the laws, the affairs and the comprehenſive intereſts of their country, ſhould, if left wholly to themſelves, eſcape a variety of important errors in the exerciſe of their legiſlative truſt. It may be affirmed, on the beſt grounds, that no ſmall ſhare of the preſent embarraſſments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our governments; and that theſe have proceeded from the heads rather than the hearts of moſt of the authors of them. What indeed are all the repealing, explaining and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws, which fill and diſgrace our voluminous codes, but ſo many monuments of deficient wiſdom; ſo many impeachments exhibited by each ſucceeding, againſt each preceding ſeſſion; ſo many admonitions to the people of the value of thoſe aids which may be expected from a well conſtituted ſenate?</p>
                     <p>A good government implies two things; firſt, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happineſs of the people; ſecondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be beſt attained. Some governments are deficient in both theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:021127_0426_0FB24BD67031EBD0"/>
Moſt governments are deficient in the firſt. I ſcruple not to aſſert that in the American governments, too little attention has been paid to the laſt. The federal conſtitution avoids this error; and what merits particular notice, it provides for the laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> mode which increaſes the ſecurity for the firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourth.</hi> The mutability in the public councils, ariſing from a rapid ſucceſſion of new members, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever qualified they may be, points out in the ſtrongeſt manner, the neceſſity of ſome ſtable inſtitution in the government. Every new election in the ſtates, is found to change one half of the repreſentatives. From this change of men muſt proceed a change of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a change of meaſures. But a continual change even of good meaſures is inconſiſtent with every rule of prudence, and every proſpect of ſucceſs. The remark is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in private life, and becomes more juſt as well as more important, in national tranſactions.</p>
                     <p>To trace the miſchievous effects of a mutable government would fill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a ſource of innumerable others.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place it forfeits the reſpect and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of other nations, and all the advantages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with national character. An individual who is obſerved to be inconſtant to his plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all, is marked at once by all prudent people, as a ſpeedy victim to his own unſteadineſs and folly. His more friendly neighbours may pity him; but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his; and not a few will ſeize the opportunity of making their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes out of his. One nation is to another what one individual is to another; with this melancholy diſtinction perhaps, that the former with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer reſtraints alſo from taking undue advantage of
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:021127_0427_0FB24BDD62994108"/>
the indiſcretions of each other. Every nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, whoſe affairs betray a want of wiſdom and ſtability, may calculate on every loſs which can be ſuſtained from the more ſyſtematic policy of its wiſer neighbours. But the beſt inſtruction on this ſubject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own ſituation. She finds that ſhe is held in no reſpect by her friends; that ſhe is the deriſion of her enemies; and that ſhe is a prey to every nation which has an intereſt in ſpeculating on her fluctuating councils and embarraſſed affairs.</p>
                     <p>The internal effects of a mutable policy are ſtill more calamitous. It poiſons the bleſſings of liberty itſelf. It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be ſo voluminous that they cannot be read, or ſo incoherent that they cannot be underſtood; if they be repealed or reviſed before they are promulged, or undergo ſuch inceſſant changes that no man who knows what the law is to day can gueſs what it will be to morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known and leſs fixed?</p>
                     <p>Another effect of public inſtability is the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable advantage it gives to the ſagacious, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing and the moneyed few, over the induſtrious and uninformed maſs of the people. Every new regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation concerning commerce or revenue; or in any manner affecting the value of the different ſpecies of property, preſents a new harveſt to thoſe who watch the change and can trace its conſequences; a harveſt reared not by themſelves but by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow citizens. This is a ſtate of things in which it may be ſaid with ſome truth that laws are made for the <hi>few</hi> not for the <hi>many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In another point of view great injury reſults from an unſtable government. The want of confidence in the public councils damps every uſeful undertaking;
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:021127_0428_0FB24BDEB3FF6E90"/>
the ſucceſs and profit of which may depend on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of exiſting arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce, when he knows not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? What farmer or manufacturer will lay himſelf out for the encouragement given to any particular cultivation or eſtabliſhment, when he can have no aſſurance that his preparatory labours and advances will not render him a victim to an inconſtant govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? In a word, no great improvement or lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enterpriſe can go forward, which requires the auſpices of a ſteady ſyſtem of national policy.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt deplorable effect of all is that dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of attachment and reverence which ſteals into the hearts of the people, towards a political ſyſtem which betrays ſo many marks of infirmity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints ſo many of their flattering hopes. No government any more than an individual will long be reſpected, without being truly reſpectable, nor be truly reſpectable without poſſeſſing a certain portion of order and ſtability.</p>

                     <p>A FIFTH deſideratum illuſtrating the utility of a ſenate, is the want of a due ſenſe of national character. Without a ſelect and ſtable member of the government, the eſteem of ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eign powers will not only by forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the cauſes already mentioned;
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:021127_0429_0FB24BE19A5CB3F8"/>
but the national councils will not poſſeſs that ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not leſs neceſſary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its reſpect and confidence.</p>
                     <p>An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every government for two reaſons: The one is, that independently of the merits of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular plan or meaſure, it is deſirable on various accounts, that it ſhould appear to other nations as the offspring of a wiſe and honorable policy: The ſecond is, that in doubtful caſes, particularly where the national councils may be warped by ſome ſtrong paſſion, or momentary intereſt, the preſumed or known opinion of the impartial world, may be the beſt guide that can be followed. What has not America loſt by her want of character with foreign nations? And how many errors and follies would ſhe not have avoided, if the juſtice and propriety of her meaſures had in every inſtance been previouſly tried by the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiaſſed part of mankind.</p>
                     <p>Yet however requiſite a ſenſe of national character may be, it is evident that it can never b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſufficiently poſſeſſed by a numerous and changeable body. It can only be found in a number ſo ſmall, that a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible degree of the praiſe and blame of public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures may be the portion of each individual; or in an aſſembly ſo durably inveſted with public truſt, that the pride and conſequence of its members may be ſenſibly incorporated with the reputation and proſperity of the community. The half-yearly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of Rhode-Iſland, would probably have been little affected in their deliberations on the iniquitous meaſures of that ſtate, by arguments drawn from the light in which ſuch meaſures would be viewed by foreign nations, or even by the ſiſter ſtates; whilſt it can ſcarcely be doubted, that if the concurrence of a ſelect and ſtable body had been neceſſary, a regard to national character alone,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:021127_0430_0FB24BE7534B9340"/>
would have prevented the calamities under which that miſguided people is now labouring.</p>
                     <p>I add as a <hi>ſixth</hi> defect, the want in ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant caſes of a due reſponſibility in the government to the people, ariſing from that frequency of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which in other caſes produces this reſponſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The remark will perhaps appear not only new but paradoxical. It muſt neverthele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, when explained, to be as undeniable as it is important.</p>
                     <p>Reſponſibility in order to be reaſonable muſt be limited to objects within the power of the reſponſible party; and in order to be effectual, moſt relate to operations of that power, of which a ready and proper judgement can be formed by the conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uents. The objects of government may be divided into two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral claſſes; the one depending on meaſures which have ſingly an immediate and ſenſible operation; the other depending on a ſucceſſion of well choſen and well connected meaſures, which have a gradual and perhaps unobſerved operation. The importance of the latter deſcription to the collective and permanent welfare of every country needs no explanation. And yet it is evident, that an aſſembly elected for ſo ſhort a term as to be unable to provide more than one or two links in a chain of meaſures, on which the general welfare may eſſentially depend, ought not to be anſwerable for the final reſult, any more than a ſteward or tenant, engaged for one year, could be juſtly made to anſwer for places or improvements, which could not be accompliſhed in leſs than half a dozen years. Nor is it poſſible for the people to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the <hi>ſhare</hi> of influence which their annual aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies may reſpectively have on events reſulting from the mixed tranſactions of ſeveral years. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently difficult, at any rate, to preſerve a perſonal reſponſibility in the members of a <hi>numerous</hi> body, for ſuch acts of the body as have an immediate, detached and palpable operation on its conſtituents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="unknown:021127_0431_0FB24BEA0E86A4A8"/>The proper remedy for this defect muſt be an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional body in the legiſlative department, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient permanency to provide for ſuch objects as require a continued attention, and a train of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, may be juſtly and effectually anſwerable for the attainment of thoſe objects.</p>
                     <p>Thus far I have conſidered the circumſtances which point out the neceſſity of a well conſtructed ſenate, only as they relate to the repreſentatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by prejudice, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by flattery, as thoſe whom I addreſs, I ſhall not ſcruple to add, that ſuch an inſtitution may be ſometimes neceſſary, as a defence to the people againſt their own temporary errors and deluſions. As the cool and deliberate ſenſe of the community ought in all governments, and actually will in all free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; ſo there are particular moments in public affairs, when the people ſtimulated by ſome irregular paſſion, or ſome illicit advantage, or miſled by the artful miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of intereſted men, may call for meaſures which they themſelves will afterwards be the moſt ready to lament and condemn. In theſe critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how ſalutary will be the interference of ſome temperate and reſpectable body of citizens, in order to check the miſguided career, and to ſuſpend the blow meditated by the people againſt themſelves, until rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, juſtice and truth, can regain their authority over the public mind? What bitter anguiſh would not the people of Athens have often eſcaped, if their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had contained ſo provident a ſafeguard againſt the tyranny of their own paſſions? Popular liberty might then have eſcaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the ſame citizens, the hemlock on one day, and ſtatues on the next.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſuggeſted that a people ſpread over an extenſive region, cannot like the crouded inhabitants of a ſmall diſtrict, be ſubject to the infection of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions; or to the danger of combining in the
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:021127_0432_0FB24BECA516D3C8"/>
purſuit of unjuſt meaſures. I am far from denying that this is a diſtinction of peculiar importance. I have on the contrary endeavoured in a former paper to ſhew that it is one of the principle recomendations of a confederated republic. At the ſame time this advantage ought not to be conſidered as ſuperſeding the uſe of auxiliary precautions. It may even be remarked that the ſame extended ſituation which will exempt the people of America from ſome of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers incident to leſſer republics, will expoſe them to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time, under the influence of thoſe miſrepreſentations which the combined induſtry of intereſted men may ſucceed in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſtributing among them.</p>
                     <p>It adds no ſmall weight to all theſe conſiderations, to recollect, that hiſtory informs us of no long lived republic which had not a ſenate. Sparta, Rome and Carthage are in fact the only ſtates to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two firſt there was a ſenate for life. The conſtitution of the ſenate in the laſt, is leſs known. Circumſtantial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence makes it probable that it was not different in this particular from the two others. It is at leaſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it had ſome quality or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>her which rendered it an anchor againſt popular fluctuations; and that a ſmaller council drawn out of the ſenate was appointed not only for life, but filled up vacancies itſelf. Theſe examples, though as unfit for the imitation as they are repugnant to the genius of America, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when compared with the fugitive and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent exiſtence of other antient republics, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive proofs of the neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y of ſome inſtitution that will blend ſtability with liberty. I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware of the circumſtances which diſtinguiſh the American from other popular governments, as well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as modern; and which render extreme circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection neceſſary in reaſoning from the one caſe to the other. But after allowing due weight to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, it may ſtill be maintained that there are
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:021127_0433_0FB24BF4A0C01FF0"/>
many points of ſimilitude which render theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not unworthy of our attention. Many of the defects as we have ſeen, which can only be ſupplied by a ſenatorial inſtitution, are common to a numerous aſſembly frequently elected by the people, and to the people themſelves. There are others peculiar to the former, which require the controul of ſuch an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The people can never wilfully betray their own intereſts: but they may poſſibly be betrayed by the repreſentatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legiſlative truſt is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the concurrence of ſeparate and diſſimilar bodies is required in every public act.</p>
                     <p>The difference moſt relied on between the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can and other republics, conſiſts in the principle of repreſentation, which is the pivot on which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer move, and which is ſuppoſed to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the latter, or at leaſt to the antient part of them. The uſe which has been made of this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in reaſonings contained in former papers, will have ſhewn that I am diſpoſed neither to deny its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtance nor to undervalue its importance. I feel the leſs reſtraint therefore in obſerving that the poſition concerning the ignorance of the antient governments on the ſubject of repreſentation is by no means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely true in the latitude commonly given to it. Without entering into a diſquiſition which here would be miſplaced, I will refer to a few known facts in ſupport of what I advance.</p>
                     <p>In the moſt pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive functions were performed not by the people themſelves, but by officers elected by the people, and <hi>repreſenting</hi> the people in their <hi>executive</hi> capacity.</p>
                     <p>Prior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine archons, annually <hi>elected by the people at large.</hi> The degree of power delegated to them ſeems to be left in great obſcurity. Subſequent to that period,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:021127_0434_0FB24BF6AACD7948"/>
we find an aſſembly firſt of four and afterwards of ſix hundred members, annually <hi>elected by the people</hi>; and <hi>partially</hi> repreſenting them in their <hi>legiſlative</hi> capacity, ſince they were not only aſſociated with the people in the function of making laws; but had the excluſive right o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> originating legiſlative propoſitions to the people. The ſenate of Carthage alſo, whatever might be its power or the duration of its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appears to have been elective by the ſuffrages of the people. Similar inſtances might be traced in moſt if not all the popular governments of antiquity.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly in Sparta, we meet wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h the ephori, and in Rome with the tribunes; two bodies, ſmall indeed in number, but annually <hi>elected by the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

The coſme of Crete were alſo annually <hi>elected by the people:</hi> and have been conſidered by ſome authors as an inſtitution analogous to thoſe of Sparta and Rome, with this difference only, that in the election of that repreſentative body the right of ſuffrage was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to a part only of the people.</p>
                     <p>From theſe facts, to which many others might be added, it is clear that the principle of repreſentation was neither unknown to the ancients, nor wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked in their political conſtitutions. The true diſtinction between theſe and the American govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lies <hi>in the total excluſion of the people in their collective capacity</hi> from any ſhare in the <hi>latter,</hi> and not in the <hi>total excluſion of the repreſentatives of the people,</hi> from the adminiſtration of the <hi>former.</hi> The d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſtinction however thus qualified muſt be admitted to leave a moſt advantageous ſuperiority in favour of the United States. But to enſure to this advantage its full effect, we muſt be careful not to ſeparate it from the other advantage, of an extenſive territory. For it cannot be believed that any form of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative government, could have ſucceeded within

                        </gap> there are numerous inſtances of the former as well as of the latter; and that the former rather than the latter is apparently moſt to be apprehended by the United States. But a more particular reply may be given.</p>
                     <p>Before ſuch a revolution can be effected, the ſenate, it is to be obſerved, muſt in the firſt place corrupt itſelf; muſt next corrupt the ſtate legiſlatures, muſt then corrupt the houſe of repreſentatives, and muſt finally corrupt the people at large. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the ſenate muſt be firſt corrupted, before it can attempt an eſtabliſhment of tyranny. Without corrupting the legiſlatures, it cannot proſecute the attempt, becauſe the periodical change of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers would otherwiſe regenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal ſucceſs on the houſe of repreſentatives, the oppoſition of that co-equal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and without corrupting the people themſelves, a ſucceſſion of new repreſentatives would ſpeedily reſtore all things to their priſtine order. Is there any man who can ſeriouſly perſuade himſelf that the propoſed ſenate can, by any poſſible means within the compaſs of human addreſs, arrive at the object of a lawleſs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, through all theſe obſtructions?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="unknown:021127_0436_0FB24BFD659648B0"/>If reaſon condemns the ſuſpicion, the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronounced by experience. The conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Maryland furniſhes the moſt appoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The ſenate of that ſtate is elected, as the federal ſenate will be, indirectly by the people; and for a term leſs by one year only, than the federal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. It is diſtinguiſhed alſo by the remarkable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of filling up its own vacancies within the term of its appointment; and at the ſame time, is not under the control of any ſuch rotation, as is provided for the federal ſenate. There are ſome other leſſer diſtinctions, which would expoſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to colorable ſubjections that do not lie againſt the latter. If the federal ſenate therefore really contained the danger which has been ſo loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, ſome ſymptoms at leaſt of a like danger ought by this time to have been betrayed by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Maryland; but no ſuch ſymptoms have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. On the contrary the jealouſies at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by men of the ſame deſcription with thoſe who view with terror the correſpondent part of the federal conſtitution, have been gradually extinguiſhed by the progreſs of the experiment; and the Maryland conſtitution is daily deriving from the ſalutary oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this part of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled by that of any ſtate in the union.</p>
                     <p>But if any thing could ſilence the jealouſies on this ſubject, it ought to be the Britiſh example. The ſenate there, inſtead of being elected for a term of ſix years, and of being unconfined to particular families or fortunes, is an hereditary aſſembly of opulent nobles. The houſe of repreſentatives, inſtead of being elected for two years, and by the whole body of the people, is elected for ſeven years; and in very great proportion, by a very ſmall proportion of the people. Here unqueſtionably ought to be ſeen in full diſplay, the ariſtocratic uſurpations and tyranny, which are at ſome future period to be exemplified in
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:021127_0437_0FB24BFEEA8F0118"/>
the United States. Unfortunately however for the antifederal argument, the Britiſh hiſtory informs us, that this hereditary aſſembly has not even been able to defend itſelf againſt the continual encroachments of the houſe of repreſentatives; and that it no ſooner loſt the ſupport of the monarch, than it was actually cruſhed by the weight of the popular branch.</p>
                     <p>As far as antiquity can inſtruct us on this ſubject, its examples ſupport the reaſoning which we have employed. In Sparta the ephori, the annual repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, were found an overmatch for the ſenate for life, continually gained on its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and finally drew all power into their own hands. The tribunes of Rome, who were the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, prevailed, it is well known, in almoſt every conteſt with the ſenate for life, and in the end gained the moſt complete triumph over it. This fact is the more remarkab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, as unanimity was required in every act of the tribunes, even after their number was augmented to ten. It proves the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable force poſſeſſed by that branch of a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has the people on its ſide. To theſe examples might be added that of Carthage, whoſe ſenate, according to the teſtimony of Polybius, inſtead of drawing all power into its vortex, had at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the ſecond punic war, loſt almoſt the whole of its original portion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the concluſive evidence reſulting from this aſſemblage of facts, that the federal ſenate will never be able to transform itſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

elections by the people in their collective capacity, where the activity of party zeal taking advantage of the ſupineſs, the ignorance, and the hopes and fears of the unwary and intereſted, often places men in office by the votes of a ſmall proportion of the electors.</p>
                     <p>As the ſelect aſſemblies for chooſing the preſident, as well as the ſtate legiſlatures who appoint the ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will in general be compoſed of the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reſpectable citizens, there is reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that their attention and their votes will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to thoſe men only who have become the moſt diſtinguiſhed by their abilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive juſt grounds for confidence. The conſtitution manifeſts very particular attention to this object. By excluding men under thirty five from the firſt office, and thoſe under thirty from the ſecond, it confines the elections to men of whom the people have had time to form a judgment, and with reſpect to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With ſuch men the power of making treaties may be ſafely lodged.</p>

                        <pb n="203" facs="unknown:021127_0440_0FB24C0E75F431E0"/>Although the abſolute neceſſity of ſyſtem in the conduct of any buſineſs is univerſally known and acknowledged, yet the high importance of it in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional affairs has not yet become ſufficiently impreſſed on the public mind. They who wiſh to commit the power under conſideration to a popular aſſembly, compoſed of members conſtantly coming and going in quick ſucceſſion, ſeem not to recollect that ſuch a body muſt neceſſarily be inadequate to the attainment of thoſe great objects, which require to be ſteadily contemplated in all their relations and circumſtances, and which can only be approached and atchieved by meaſures, which not only talents, but alſo exact infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and often much time are neceſſary to concert and to execute. It was wiſe therefore in the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to provide not only that the power of making treaties ſhould be committed to able and honeſt men, but alſo that they ſhould continue in place a ſuffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ent time to become perfectly acquainted with our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal concerns, and to form and introduce a ſyſtem for the management of them. The duration preſcribed is ſuch as will give them an opportunity of greatly extending their political informations and of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their accumulating experience more and more beneficial to their country. Nor has the convention diſcovered leſs prudence in providing for the frequent elections of ſenators in ſuch a way, as to obviate the inconvenience of periodically transferring thoſe great affairs entirely to new men, for by leaving a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reſidue of the old ones in place, uniformity and order, as well as a conſtant ſucceſſion of official infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, will be preſerved.</p>
                     <p>There are few who will not admit that the affairs of trade and navigation ſhould be regulated by a ſyſtem cautiouſly formed and ſteadily purſued; and that both our treaties and our laws ſhould correſpond with, and be made to promote it. It is of much conſequence that this correſpondence and conformity be carefully maintained, and they who aſſent to the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:021127_0441_0FB24C1643F083B0"/>
truth of this poſition, will ſee and confeſs that it is well provided for by making the concurrence of the ſenate neceſſary both to treaties and to laws.</p>
                     <p>It ſeldom happens in the negotiation of treaties of whatever nature, but that perfect <hi>ſecrecy</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>diſpatch</hi> are ſometimes requiſite. There are caſes where the moſt uſeful intelligence may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if the perſons poſſeſſing it can be relieved from apprehenſions of diſcovery. Thoſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will operate on thoſe perſons, whether they are actuated by mercenary or friendly motives, and there doubtleſs are many of both deſcriptions, who would rely on the ſecrecy of the preſident, but who would not confide in that of the ſenate, and ſtill leſs in that of a large popular aſſembly. The conven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion have done well therefore in ſo diſpoſing of the power of making treaties, that although the preſident muſt, in forming them, act by the advice and conſent of the ſenate, yet he will be able to manage the buſineſs of intelligence in ſuch manner as prudence may ſuggeſt.</p>
                     <p>They who have turned their attention to the affairs of men, muſt have perceived that there are tides in them. Tides, very irregular in their duration, ſtrength and direction, and ſeldom found to run twice exactly in the ſame manner or meaſure. To diſcern and to profit by theſe tides in national affairs, is the buſineſs of thoſe who preſide over them; and they who have had much experience on this head inform us, that there frequently are occaſions when days, nay even when hours are precious. The loſs of a battle, the death of a prince, the removal of a miniſter, or other circumſtances intervening to change the preſent poſture and aſpect of affairs, may turn the moſt favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable tide into a courſe oppoſite to our wiſhes. As in the field, ſo in the cabinet, there are moments to be ſeized as they paſs, and they who preſide in either, ſhould be left in capacity to improve them. So often and ſo eſſentially have we heretofore ſuffered, from the want of ſecrecy and diſpatch, that the conſtitution
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:021127_0442_0FB24C1C246BE9E0"/>
would have been inexcuſibly defective if no attention had been paid to thoſe objects. Thoſe matters which in negotiations uſually require the moſt ſecrecy and the moſt diſpatch, are thoſe preparatory and auxiliary meaſurer which are no otherways important in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional view, then as they tend to facilitate the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the objects of the negotiation. For theſe the preſident will find no deficulty to provide, and ſhould any circumſtance occur which requires the advice and conſent of the ſenate, he may at any time convene them. Thus we ſee that the conſtitution provides that our negotiations for treaties ſhall have every advantage which can be derived from talents, information, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and deliberate inveſtigations on the one hand, and from ſecrecy and diſpatch on the other.</p>
                     <p>But to this plan as to moſt others that have ever appeared, objections are contrived and urged.</p>
                     <p>Some are diſpleaſed with it, not on account of any errors or defects in it, but becauſe as the treaties when made are to have the force of laws, they ſhould be made only by men inveſted with legiſlative authority. Theſe gentlemen ſeem not to conſider that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our courts, and the commiſſions conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally given by our governor, are as valid and as binding on all perſons whom they concern, as the laws paſſed by our legiſlature are. All conſtitutional acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as if they proceeded from the legiſlature, and therefore whatever name be given to the power of making treaties, or however obligatory they may be when made, certain it is that the people may with much propriety commit the power to a diſtinct body from the legiſlature, the executive or the judicial. It ſurely does not follow that becauſe they have given the power of making laws to the legiſlature, that therefore they ſhould likewiſe give them power to do every other act of ſovereignty by which the citizens are to be bound and affected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="unknown:021127_0443_0FB24C1F317C9C10"/>Others, though content that treaties ſhould be made in the mode propoſed, are averſe to their being the <hi>ſupreme</hi> laws of the land. They inſiſt and profeſs to believe, that treaties, like acts of aſſembly, ſhould be repealable at pleaſure. This idea ſeems to be new and peculiar to this country, but new errors as well as new truths often appear. Theſe gentlemen would do well to reflect that a treaty is only another name for a bargain; and that it would be impoſſible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us, which ſhould be binding on them <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but on us only ſo long and ſo far as we may think proper to be bound by it. They who make laws may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt amend or repeal them, and it will not be diſputed that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them; but ſtill let us not forget that treaties are made not by only one of the contracting parties but by both, and conſequently that as the conſent of both was eſſential to their formation at firſt, ſo muſt it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them. The propoſed conſtitution therefore has not in the leaſt extended the obligation of treaties. They are juſt as binding, and juſt as far beyond the lawful reach of legiſlative acts now, as they will be at any future period, or under any form of government.</p>
                     <p>However uſeful jealouſy may be in republics, yet when, like bile in the natural, it abounds too much in the body politic; the eyes of both become very liable to be deceived by the deluſive appearances which that malady caſts on ſurrounding objects. From this cauſe probably proceed the fears and apprehenſions of ſome, that the preſident and ſenate may make treaties without an equal eye to the intereſts of all the ſtates. Others ſuſpect that the two-thirds will oppreſs the remaining third, and aſk whether thoſe gentlemen are made ſufficiently reſponſible for their conduct— whether if they act corruptly they can be puniſhed; and if they make diſadvantageous treaties, how are we to get rid of thoſe treaties?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="unknown:021127_0444_0FB24C20B56B8598"/>As all the ſtates are equally repreſented in the ſenate, and by men the moſt able and the moſt willing to promote the intereſt of their conſtituents, they will all have an equal degree of influence in that body, eſpecially while they continue to be careful in appointing proper perſons, and to inſiſt on their punctual attendance. In proportion as the United States aſſume a national form, and a national character, ſo will the good of the whole be more and more an object of attention; and the government muſt be a weak one indeed, if it ſhould forget that the good of the whole can only be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members which compoſe the whole. It will not be in the power of the preſident and ſenate to make any treaties, by which they and their families and eſtates will not be equally bound and affected with the reſt of the community; and having no private intereſt diſtinct from that of the nation, they will be under no temptations to neglect the latter.</p>
                     <p>As to corruption, the caſe is not ſuppoſeable, he muſt either have been very unfortunate in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the world, or poſſeſs a heart very ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of ſuch impreſſions, who can think it probable that the preſident and two-thirds of the ſenate will ever be capable of ſuch unworthy conduct. The idea is too groſs and too invidious to be entertained. But in ſuch a caſe, if it ſhould ever happen, the treaty ſo obtained from us would, like all other fraudulent contracts, be null and void by the laws of nations.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to their reſponſibility, it is difficult to conceive how it could be encreaſed. Every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that can influence the human mind, ſuch as honour, oaths, reputat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In ſhort, as the conſtitution has taken the utmoſt care that they ſhall be men of talents and integrity, we have reaſon to be perſuaded that the treaties they make will be

as advantageous as all circumſtances conſidered, could be made; and ſo far as the fear of puniſhment and diſgrace can operate, that motive to good behaviour is amply afforded by the article on the ſubject of impeachments.</p>

or leſs friendly, or inimical, to the accuſed. In many caſes, it will connect itſelf with the pre-exiſting fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will inliſt all their animoſities, partialities, influence and intereſt on one ſide, or on the other; and in ſuch caſes there will always be the greateſt danger, that the deciſion will be regulated more by the comparative ſtrength of parties than by the real demonſtrations of innocence or guilt.</p>
                     <p>The delicacy and magnitude of a truſt, which ſo deeply concerns the political reputation and exiſtence of every man engaged in the adminiſtration of public affairs, ſpeak for themſelves. The difficulty of placing it rightly in a government reſting entirely on the baſis of periodical electons will as readily be perceived, when it is conſidered that the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous characters in it will, from that circumſtance, be too often the leaders, or the tools of the moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or the moſt numerous faction; and on this account can hardly be expected to poſſeſs the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite neutrality towards thoſe whoſe conduct may be the ſubject of ſcrutiny.</p>
                     <p>The convention, it appears, thought the ſenate the moſt fit depoſitary of this important truſt. Thoſe who can beſt diſcern the intrinſic difficulty of the thing, will be leaſt haſty in condemning that opinion; and will be moſt inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be ſuppoſed to have produced it.</p>
                     <p>What it may be aſked, is the true ſpirit of the inſtitution itſelf? Is it not deſigned as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of public men? If this be the deſign of it, who can ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be the inquiſitors for the nation as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the nation themſelves? It is not diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the power of originating the inquiry, or in other words, of preferring the impeachment ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body; will not the reaſons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement, ſtrongly plead for an
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:021127_0447_0FB24C3E878CFFA8"/>
admiſſion of the other branch of that body to a ſhare of the inquiry? The model, from which the idea of this inſtitution has been borrowed, pointed out that courſe to the convention. In Great-Britain, it is the province of the houſe of commons to prefer the impeachment; and of the houſe of lords to decide upon it. Several of the ſtate conſtitutions have followed the example. As well the latter as the former ſeem to have regarded the practice of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, as a bridle in the hands of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body upon the executive ſervants of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded?</p>
                     <p>Where elſe, than in the ſenate, could have been found a tribunal ſufficiently dignified, or ſufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel <hi>confidence enough in its own ſituation,</hi> to preſerve unawed and uninfluenced the neceſſary impartiality between an <hi>individual</hi> accuſed, and the <hi>repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people, his accuſers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Could the ſupreme court have been relied upon as anſwering this deſcription? It is much to be doubted whether the members of that tribunal would, at all times, be endowed, with ſo eminent a portion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as would be called for in the execution of ſo difficult a taſk, and it is ſtill more to be doubted, whether they would poſſeſs the degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain occaſions be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable, towards reconciling the people to a deciſion that ſhould happen to claſh with an accuſation brought by their immediate repreſentatives. A deficiency in the firſt would be fatal to the accuſed, in the laſt, dangerous to the public tranquility. The hazard in both theſe reſpects could only be avoided, if at all, by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would conſiſt with a reaſonable attention to economy. The neceſſity of a numerous court for the trial of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is equally dictated by the nature of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. This can never be tied down by ſuch ſtrict
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:021127_0448_0FB24C3F687DD840"/>
rules, either in the delineation of the offence by the proſecutors, or in the conſtruction of it by the judges as in common caſes ſerve to limit the diſcretion of courts in favour of perſonal ſecurity. There will be no jury to ſtand between the judges, who are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſentence of the law and the party who is to receive or ſuffer it. The awful diſcretion, which a court of impeachments muſt neceſſarily have, to doom to honour or to infamy the moſt confidential and the moſt diſtinguiſhed characters of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, forbids the commitment of the truſt to a ſmall number of perſons.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations ſeem alone ſufficient to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe a concluſion that the ſupreme court would have been an improper ſubſtitute for the ſenate, as a court of impeachments. There remains a further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which will not a little ſtrengthen this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. It is this—The puniſhment, which may be the conſequence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the chaſtiſement of the offender. After having been ſentenced to a perpetual oſtraciſm from the eſteem and confidence, and honors and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments of his country, he will ſtill be liable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and puniſhment in the ordinary courſe of law. Would it be proper that the perſons, who had diſpoſed of his fame and his moſt valuable rights as a citizen in one trial, ſhould in another trial, for the fame offence, be alſo the diſpoſers of his life and his fortune? Would there not be the greateſt reaſon to apprehend, that error in the firſt ſentence would be the parent of error in the ſecond ſentence? That the ſtrong bias of one deciſion would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights, which might be brought to vary the complexion of another deciſion? Thoſe, who know any thing of human nature, will not heſitate to anſwer theſe queſtions in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; and will be at no loſs to perceive, that by making the ſame perſons judges in both caſes, thoſe who might happen to be the objects of proſecution
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:021127_0449_0FB24C40E86A8EC0"/>
would in a great meaſure be deprived of the double ſecurity intended them by a double trial. The loſs of life and eſtate would often be virtually included in a ſentence, which, in its terms, imported nothing more than diſmiſſion from a preſent, and diſqualification for a future office. It may be ſaid, that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a jury, in the ſecond inſtance, would obviate the danger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of judges. They are ſometimes induced to find ſpecial verdicts which refer the main queſtion to the deciſion of the court. Who would be willing to ſtake his life and his eſtate upon the verdict of a jury, acting under the auſpices of judges, who had predetermined his guilt?</p>
                     <p>Would it have been an improvement of the plan to have united the ſupreme court with the ſenate in the formation of the court of impeachments? This union would certainly have been attended with ſeveral advantages; but would they not have been overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by the ſignal diſadvantage, already ſtated, ariſing from the agency of the ſame judges in the double proſecution to which the offender would be liable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that union will be obtained from making the chief juſtice of the ſupreme court, the preſident of the court of impeachments, as is propoſed to be done in the plan of the convention; while the inconveniencies of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be ſubſtantially avoided. This was perhaps the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mean. I forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamour, againſt the judiciary, which ſo conſiderable an augmentation of its authority would have afforded.</p>
                     <p>Would it have been deſirable to have compoſed the court for the trial of impeachments of perſons wholly diſtinct from the other departments of the government? There are weighty arguments, as well againſt, as in favour of ſuch a plan. To ſome minds, it will not appear a trivial objection, that it would tend to
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:021127_0450_0FB24C428B778818"/>
increaſe the complexity of the political machine, and to add a new ſpring to the government, the utility of which would at beſt be queſtionable. But an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is this.—A court formed upon ſuch a plan would either be attended with heavy expence, or might in practice be ſubject to a variety of caſualities and inconveniencies. It muſt either conſiſt of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent officers ſtationary at the ſeat of government, and of courſe entitled to fixed and regular ſtipends, or of certain officers of the ſtate governments, to be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending. It will not be eaſy to imagine any third mode materially different, which could rationally be propoſed. As the court, for reaſons already given, ought to be numerous; the firſt ſcheme will be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by every man, who can compare the extent of the public wants, with the means of ſupplying them; the ſecond will be eſpouſed with caution by thoſe, who will ſeriouſly conſider the difficulty of collecting men diſperſed over the whole union; the injury to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, from the procraſtinated determination of the charges which might be brought againſt them; the advantage to the guilty, from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption, and in ſome caſes the detriment to the ſtate, from the prolonged inaction of men, whoſe firm and faithful execution of their duty might have expoſed them to the perſecution of an intemperate or deſigning majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the houſe of repreſentatives. Though this latter ſuppoſition may ſeem harſh, and might not be likely often to be verified; yet it ought not to be forgotten, that the demon of faction will at certain ſeaſons extend his ſceptre over all numerous bodies of men.</p>
                     <p>But though one or the other of the ſubſtitutes which have been examined, or ſome other that might be deviſed, ſhould be thought preferable to the plan, in this reſpect, reported by the convention, it will not
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:021127_0451_0FB24C7348C9C950"/>
follow that the conſtitution ought for this reaſon to be rejected. If mankind were to reſolve to agree in no inſtitution of government, until every part of it had been adjuſted to the moſt exact ſtandard of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſociety would ſoon become a general ſcene of anarchy, and the world a deſert. Where is the ſtandard of perfection to be found? Who will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to unite the diſcordant opinions of a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, in the ſame judgement of it; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon one conceited projector to renounce his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> criterion, for the <hi>fallible</hi> criterion of his more <hi>conceited neighbour?</hi> To anſwer the purpoſe of the adverſaries of the conſtitution, they ought to prove not merely, that particular proviſions in it are not the beſt, which might have been imagined; but that the plan upon the whole is bad and pernicious.</p>

                     <p>A REVIEW of the principal objections that have appeared againſt the propoſed court for the trial of impeachments, will not improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impreſſions which may ſtill exiſt, in regard to this matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe objections is, that the proviſion in queſtion confounds legiſlative and judiciary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the ſame body, in violation of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and well-eſtabliſhed maxim, which requires a ſeparation between the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fferent departments of power. The true meaning of this maxim has been diſcuſſed and aſcertained in another place, and has been ſhewn to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of thoſe departments for ſpecial pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, preſerving them in the main diſtinct and
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:021127_0452_0FB24C7D5CC65540"/>
unconnected. This partial intermixture is even in ſome caſes not only proper, but neceſſary to the mutual defence of the ſeveral members of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt each other. An abſolute or qualified negative in the executive, upon the acts of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative body, is admitted by the ableſt adepts in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſcience, to be an indiſpenſable barrier againſt the encroachments of the latter upon the former. And it may perhaps with not leſs reaſon, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the powers relating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an eſſential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive. The diviſion of them between the two branches of the legiſlature; aſſigning to one the right of accuſing, to the other the right of judging; avoids the inconvenience of making the ſame perſons both accuſers and judges; and guards againſt the danger of perſecution from the prevalency of a factious ſpirit in either of thoſe branches. As the concurrence of two-thirds of the ſenate will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to a condemnation, the ſecurity to innocence, from this additional circumſtance, will be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete as itſelf can deſire.</p>
                     <p>It is curious to obſerve with what vehemence this part of the plan is aſſailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by men who profeſs to admire without exception the conſtitution of this ſtate; while that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution makes the ſenate, together with the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and judges of the ſupreme court, not only a court of impeachments, but the higheſt judicatory in the ſtate in all cauſes, civil and criminal. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in point of numbers, of the chancellor and judges to the ſenators, is ſo inconſiderable, that the judiciary authority of New-York in the laſt reſort may, with truth, be ſaid to reſide in its ſenate. If the plan of the convention be in this reſpect chargeable with a departure from the celebrated maxim which has been ſo often mentioned, and ſeems to be ſo little
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:021127_0453_0FB24C7E6AB18120"/>
underſtood, how much more culpable muſt be the conſtitution of New-York<note n="*" place="bottom">In that of New-Jerſey alſo the final judiciary authority is in a branch of the legiſlature. In New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts, Pennſylvania and South-Carolina, one branch of the legiſlative is the court for the trial of impeachments.</note>?</p>
                     <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> objection to the ſenate, as a court of impeachments, is, that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that body, tending to give to the government a countenance too ariſtocratic. The ſenate it is obſerved, is to have concurrent authority with the executive in the formation of treaties, and in the appointment to offices: If, ſay the objectors, to theſe prerogatives is added that of determining in all caſes of impeachment, it will give a decided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy to ſenatorial influence. To an objection ſo little preciſe in itſelf, it is not eaſy to find a very preciſe anſwer. Where is the meaſure or criterion to which we can appeal, for eſtimating what will give the ſenate too much, too little, or barely the proper degree of influence? Will it not be more ſafe, as well as more ſimple, to diſmiſs ſuch vague and uncertain calculations, to examine each power by itſelf, and to decide on general principles where it may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with moſt advantage and leaſt inconvenience?</p>
                     <p>If we take this courſe it will lead to a more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, if not to a more certain reſult. The diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the power of making treaties, which has obtained in the plan of the convention, will then, if I miſtake not, appear to be fully juſtified by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ſtated in a former number, and by others which will occur under the next head of our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The expediency of the junction of the ſenate with the executive in the power of appointing to offices will, I truſt, be placed in a light not leſs ſatisfactory, in the diſquiſitions under the ſame head. And I flatter myſelf the obſervations in my laſt paper muſt have gone no inconſiderable way towards proving that it was not eaſy, if practicable, to find a more fit receptacle for the power of determining impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:021127_0454_0FB24C80258DE828"/>
than that which has been choſen. If this be truly the caſe, the hypothetical danger of the too great weight of the ſenate ought to be diſcarded from our reaſonings.</p>
                     <p>But this hypotheſis, ſuch as it is, has already been refuted in the remarks applied to the duration in office preſcribed for the ſenators. It was by them ſhewn, as well on the credit of hiſtorical examples, as from the reaſon of the thing, that the moſt <hi>popular</hi> branch of every government, partaking of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican genius, by being generally the favourite of the people, will be as generally a full match, if not an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match, for every other member of the government.</p>
                     <p>But independent of this moſt active and operative principle; to ſecure the equilibrium of the national houſe of repreſentatives, the plan of the convention has provided in its favour, ſeveral important counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſes to the additional authorities, to be conferred upon the ſenate. The excluſive privilege of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating money bills will belong to the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. The ſame houſe will poſſeſs the ſole right of inſtituting impeachments: Is not this a complete counterballance to that of determining them?—The ſame houſe will be the umpire in all electons of the preſident, which do not unite the ſuffrages of a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole number of electors; a caſe which it cannot be doubted will ſometimes, if not frequently happen. The conſtant poſſibility of the thing muſt be a fruitful ſource of influence to that body. The more it is contemplated, the more important will appear this ultimate, though contingent power of deciding the competitions of the moſt illuſtrious citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the union, for the firſt office in it. It would not perhaps be raſh to predict, that as a mean of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it will be found to outweigh all the peculiar attributes of the ſenate.</p>
                     <p>A third objection to the ſenate as a court of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments is drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office. It is imagined
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:021127_0455_0FB24E0D62F4F980"/>
that they would be too indulgent judges of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of men, in whoſe official creation they had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated. The principle of this objection would condemn a practice, which is to be ſeen in all the ſtate governments, if not in all the governments, with which we are acquainted: I mean that of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thoſe, who hold offices during pleaſure, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the pleaſure of thoſe, who appoint them. With equal plauſibility might it be alledged in this caſe that the favouritiſm of the latter would always be an aſylum for the miſbehaviour of the former. But that practice, in contradiction to this principle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon the preſumption, that the reſponſibility of thoſe who appoint, for the fitneſs and competency of the perſons, on whom they beſtow their choice, and the intereſt they have in the reſpectable and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous adminiſtration of affairs, will inſpire a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſpoſition, to diſmiſs from a ſhare in it, all ſuch who, by their conduct, may have proved themſelves unworthy of the confidence repoſed in them. Though facts may not always correſpond with this preſumption yet if it be in the main juſt, it muſt deſtroy the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the ſenate, who will merely ſanction the choice of the executive, ſhould feel a byaſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the objects of that choice, ſtrong enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt ſo extroardinary as to have induced the repreſentatives of the nation to become its accuſers.</p>
                     <p>If any further argument were neceſſary to evince the improbability of ſuch a byaſs, it might be found in the nature of the agency of the ſenate, in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of appointments. It will be the office of the preſident to <hi>nominate,</hi> and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate to <hi>appoint.</hi> There will of courſe be no exertion of <hi>choice</hi> on the part of the ſenate. They may defeat one choice of the executive, and oblige him to make another; but they cannot themſelves <hi>chooſe</hi>—they can only ratify or reject the choice, he may have made. They might even entertain a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:021127_0456_0FB24E0EB98E4890"/>
to ſome other perſon, at the very moment they were aſſenting to the one propoſed; becauſe there might be no poſitive ground of oppoſition to him; and they could not be ſure, if they withheld their aſſent, that the ſubſequent nomination would fall upon their own favourite, or upon any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in their eſtimation more meritorious than the one rejected. Thus it could hardly happen that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the ſenate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment, than ſuch, as the appearances of merit, might inſpire, and the proofs of the want of it, deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>A fourth objection to the ſenate, in the capacity of a court of impeachments, is derived from their union with the executive in the power of making treaties. This, it has been ſaid, would conſtitute the ſenators their own judges, in every caſe of a corrupt or perfidious execution of that truſt. After having combined with the executive in betraying the intereſts of the nation in a ruinous treaty, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it is aſked, would there be of their being made to ſuffer the puniſhment, they would deſerve, when they were themſelves to decide upon the accuſation brought againſt them for the treachery of which they had been guilty?</p>
                     <p>This objection has been circulated with more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and with greater ſhew of reaſon, than any other which has appeared againſt this part of the plan; and yet I am deceived if it does not reſt upon an erroneous foundation.</p>
                     <p>The ſecurity eſſentially intended by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties, is to be ſought for in the numbers and characters of thoſe who are to make them. The JOINT AGENCY of the chief magiſtrate of the union, and of two thirds of the members of a body ſelected by the collective wiſdom of the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, is deſigned to be the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this particular.
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:021127_0457_0FB24E185CC91078"/>
The convention might with propriety have meditated the puniſhment of the executive, for a deviation from the inſtructions of the ſenate, or a want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in the conduct of the negotiations committed to him: They might alſo have had in view the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a few leading individuals in the ſenate, who ſhould have proſtituted their influence in that body, as the mercenary inſtruments of foreign cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: But they could not with more or with equal propriety have contemplated the impeachment and puniſhment of two thirds of the ſenate, conſenting to an improper treaty, than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the national legiſlature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to a pernicious or unconſtitutional law: a principle which I believe has never been admitted into any government. How in fact could a majority of the houſe of repreſentatives, impeach themſelves? Not better, it is evident, than two thirds of the ſenate might try themſelves. And yet what reaſon is there, that a majority of the houſe of repreſentatives, ſacrificing the intereſts of the ſociety, by an unjuſt and tyrannical act of legiſlation, ſhould eſcape with impunity more than two-thirds of the ſenate, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing the ſame intereſts in an injurious treaty with a foreign power? The truth is, that in all ſuch caſes it is eſſential to the freedom and to the neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of the deliberations of the body, that the members of it ſhould be exempt from puniſhment for acts done in a collective capacity; and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the the ſociety muſt depend on the care which is taken to confide the truſt to proper hands, to make it their intereſt to execute it with fidelity, and to make it as difficult as poſſible for them to combine in any intereſt oppoſite to that of the public good.</p>
                     <p>So far as might concern the miſbehaviour of the executive in perverting the inſtructions, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening the views of the ſenate, we need not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the want of a diſpoſition in that body to puniſh the abuſe of their confidence, or to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:021127_0458_0FB24E1986CC8250"/>
their own authority. We may thus far count upon their pride, if not upon their virtue. And ſo far even as might concern the corruption of leading members, by whoſe arts and influence the majority may have been inveigled into meaſures odious to the community; if the proofs of that corruption ſhould be ſatisfactory, the uſual propenſity of human nature will warrant us in concluding, that there would be commonly no defect of inclination in the body, to divert the public reſentment from themſelves, by a ready ſacrifice of the authors of their miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſgrace.</p>

Calculating upon the averſion of the people to monarchy, they have endeavoured to inliſt all their jealouſies and apprehenſions in oppoſition to the intended preſident of the United States; not merely as the embryo but as the full grown progeny of that deteſted parent. To eſtabliſh the pretended
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:021127_0459_0FB24E1B02BA9008"/>
affinity they have not ſcrupled to draw reſources even from the regions of fiction. The authorities of a magiſtrate, in few inſtances greater, and in ſome inſtances leſs than thoſe of a governor of New-York, have been magnified into more than royal preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. He has been decorated with attributes ſuperior in dignity and ſplendor to thoſe of a king of Great-Britain. He has been ſhewn to us with the diadem ſparkling on his brow, and the imperial purple flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his train. He has been ſeated on a throne ſurrounded with minions and miſtreſſes; giving audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the envoys of foreign potentates, in all the ſupercilious pomp of majeſty. The images of Aſiatic deſpotiſm and voluptuouſneſs have ſcarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated ſcene. We have been almoſt taught to tremble at the terrific viſages of murdering janiſſaries; and to bluſh at the unveiled myſteries of a future ſeraglio.</p>
                     <p>Attempts ſo extravagant as theſe to disfigure, or it might rather be ſaid, to metamorphoſe the object, render it neceſſary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form; in order as well to aſcertain its true aſpect and genuine appearance, as to unmaſk the diſingenuity and expoſe the fallacy of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit reſemblances which have been ſo inſidiouſly as well as induſtriouſly propagated.</p>
                     <p>In the execution of this taſk there is no man, who would not find it an arduous effort, either to behold with moderation or to treat with ſeriouſneſs the devices not leſs weak than wicked, which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the ſubject. They ſo far exceed the uſual, though unjuſtifiable, licenſes of party-artifice, that even in a diſpoſition the moſt candid and tolerant they muſt force the ſentiments which favor an indulgent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the conduct of political adverſaries to give place to a voluntary and unreſerved indignation. It is impoſſible not to beſtow the imputation of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate impoſture and deception upon the groſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:021127_0460_0FB24E22EBEA4F40"/>
of a ſimilitude between a king of Great-Britain and a magiſtrate of the character marked out for that of the preſident of the United States. It is ſtill more impoſſible to withold that imputation from the raſh and barefaced expedients which have been employed to give ſucceſs to the attempted impoſition.</p>
                     <p>In one inſtance, which I cite as a ſample of the general ſpirit, the temerity has proceeded ſo far as to aſcribe to the preſident of the United States a power, which by the inſtrument reported is <hi>expreſsly</hi> allotted to the executives of the individual ſtates.— I mean the power of filling caſual vacancies in the ſenate.</p>
                     <p>This bold experiment upon the diſcernment of his countrymen, has been hazarded by a writer who (whatever may be his real merit) has had no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare in the applauſes of his party<note n="*" place="bottom">See Cato, No. 5.</note>;—and who upon his falſe and unfounded ſuggeſtion, has built a ſeries of obſervations equally falſe and unfounded. Let him now be confronted with the evidence of the fact; and let him, if he be able, juſtify or extenuate the ſhameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond clauſe of the ſecond ſection of the ſecond article empowers the preſident of the United States
<q>to nominate, and by and with the adviſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſenate to appoint ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls, judges of the ſupreme court, and all other <hi>officers</hi> of the United States, whoſe appointments are <hi>not</hi> in the conſtitution <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provided for,</hi> and <hi>which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by law.</hi>
                        </q>
Immediately after this clauſe follows another in theſe words—
<q>The preſident ſhall have power to fill up all <hi>vacancies</hi> that may happen <hi>during the receſs of the ſenate,</hi> by granting commiſſions which ſhall <hi>expire at the end of their next ſeſſion.</hi>
                        </q>
It is from this laſt proviſion that the pretended power of
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:021127_0461_0FB24E265799CB38"/>
the preſident to fill vacancies in the ſenate has been deduced. A ſlight attention to the connection of the clauſes and to the obvious meaning of the terms will ſatisfy us that the deduction is not even colourable.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe two clauſes it is clear only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides a mode for appointing ſuch officers,
<q>whoſe appointments are <hi>not otherwiſe provided for</hi> in the conſtitution, and which <hi>ſhall be eſtabliſhed by law</hi>;</q>
of courſe it cannot extend to the appointment of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators; whoſe appointments are <hi>otherwiſe provided for</hi> in the conſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">Article 1. § 3. Clauſe 1.</note>, and who are <hi>eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution,</hi> and will not require a future eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by law. This poſition will hardly be conteſted.</p>
                     <p>The laſt of theſe two clauſes, it is equally clear, cannot be underſtood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the ſenate, for the following reaſons:—<hi>Firſt.</hi> The relation in which that clauſe ſtands to the other, which declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be nothing more than a ſupplement to the other; for the purpoſe of eſtabliſhing an auxiliary method of appointment, in caſes to which the general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of appointment is confided to the preſident and ſenate <hi>jointly,</hi> and can therefore only be exerciſed during the ſeſſion of the ſenate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in ſeſſion for the appointment of officers; and as vacancies might happen <hi>in their receſs,</hi> which it might be neceſſary for the public ſervice to fill without delay; the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe is evidently intended to authoriſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, <hi>ſingly,</hi> to make temporary appointments
<q>during the receſs of the ſenate, by granting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions which ſhould expire at the end of their next ſeſſion.</q>
                        <hi>Second.</hi> If this clauſe is to be conſidered as ſupplementary to the one which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, the <hi>vacancies</hi> of which it ſpeaks muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to relate to the "officers" deſcribed in the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:021127_0462_0FB24E2962F4B718"/>
preceding one; and this we have ſeen excludes from its deſcription the members of the ſenate.—<hi>Third.</hi> The time within which the power is to operate, "during the receſs of the ſenate," and the duration of the appointments, "to the end of the next ſeſſion" of that body, conſpire to elucidate the ſenſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which if it had been intended to comprehend ſenators, would naturally have refered the temporary power of filling vacancies to the receſs of the ſtate legiſlatures, who are to make the permanent appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not to the receſs of the national ſenate, who are to have no concern in thoſe appointments; and would have extended the duration in office of the temporary ſenators to the next ſeſſion of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſtate, in whoſe repreſentation the vacancies had happened, inſtead of making it to expire at the end of the enſuing ſeſſion of the national ſenate. The circumſtances of the body authoriſed to make the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent appointments, would of courſe have governed the modification of a power which related to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary appointments; and as the national ſenate is the body whoſe ſituation is alone contemplated in the clauſe upon which the ſuggeſtion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to reſpect thoſe officers, in whoſe appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the preſident. But, <hi>laſtly,</hi> the firſt and ſecond clauſes of the third ſection of the firſt article, not only obviate the poſſibility of doubt, but deſtroy the pretext of miſconception. The former provides that
<q>the ſenate of the United States ſhall be compoſed of two ſenators from each ſtate, choſen <hi>by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof</hi> for ſix years;</q>
and the latter directs, that
<q>if vacancies in that body ſhould happen by reſignation or otherwiſe, <hi>during the receſs of the legiſlature of</hi> ANY STATE, the executive THEREOF may make temporary appointments until the <hi>next meeting of the legiſlature,</hi> which ſhall then fill ſuch vacancies.</q>
Here is an expreſs power given, in
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:021127_0463_0FB24E2AC2E155D0"/>
clear and unambiguous terms, to the ſtate executives, to fill the caſual vacancies in the ſenate, by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary appointments; which not only invalidates the ſuppoſition that the clauſe before conſidered could have been intended to confer that power upon the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States, but proves that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, deſtitute as it is even of the merit of plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, muſt have originated in an intention to deceive the people, too palpable to be obſcured by ſophiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The moſt plauſible of theſe, who has appeared in the print, has even deigned to admit, that the election of the preſident is pretty well guarded<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Federal Farmer.</note>. I venture ſomewhat further, and heſitate not to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at leaſt excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the union of which was to be deſired.</p>
                     <p>It was deſireable, that the ſenſe of the people ſhould operate in the choice of the perſon to whom ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a truſt was to be confided, This end will be anſwered by committing the right of making it, not to any pre-eſtabliſhed body, but to men, choſen by the people for the ſpecial purpoſe, and at the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conjuncture,</p>
                     <p>It was equally deſireable, that the immediate elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be made by men moſt capable of analiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the qualities adapted to the ſtation, and acting under circumſtances favourable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the reaſons and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements that were proper to govern their choice. A ſmall number of perſons, ſelected by their fellow citizens from the general maſs, will be moſt likely to poſſeſs the information and diſcernment requiſite to ſo complicated an inveſtigation.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo peculiarly deſireable, to afford as little opportunity as poſſible to tumult and diſorder. This evil was not leaſt to be dreaded in the election of a magiſtrate, who was to have ſo important an agency in the adminiſtration of the government, as the preſident of the United States. But the precautions which have been ſo happily concerted in the ſyſtem under conſideration, promiſe an effectual ſecurity againſt this miſchief. The choice of <hi>ſeveral</hi> to form an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate body of electors, will be much leſs apt to convulſe the community, with any extroardinary or violent movements, than the choice of <hi>one</hi> who was himſelf to be the final object of the public wiſhes. And as the electors, choſen in each ſtate, are to
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:021127_0465_0FB24E3481FBA508"/>
aſſemble and vote in the ſtate, in which they are choſen, this detached and divided ſituation will expoſe them much leſs to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.</p>
                     <p>Nothing was more to be deſired, than that every practicable obſtacle ſhould be oppoſed to cabal, intrigue and corruption. Theſe moſt deadly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the deſire in foreign powers to gain an improper aſcendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raiſing a creature of their own to the chief magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy of the un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on? But the convention have guarded againſt all danger of this ſort with the moſt provident and judicious attention. They have not made the appointment of the preſident to depend on any pre-exiſting bodies of men who might be tampered with beforehand to proſtitute their votes; but they have referred it in the firſt inſtance to an immediate act of the people of America, to be exerted in the choice of perſons for the temporary and ſole purpoſe of making the appointment. And they have excluded from elegibility to this truſt, all thoſe who from ſituation might be ſuſpected of too great devotion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in office. No ſenator, repreſentative, or other perſon holding a place of truſt or profit under the United States, can be of the number of the electors. Thus, without corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at leaſt enter upon the taſk, free from any ſiniſter byaſs. Their tranſient exiſtence, and their detached ſituation, already taken notice of, afforded a ſatisfactory proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their continuing ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, to the concluſion of it. The buſineſs of corruption, when it is to embrace ſo conſiderable a number of men, requires time, as well as means. Nor would it be found eaſy ſuddenly to
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:021127_0466_0FB24E35EF2722F0"/>
embark them, diſperſed, as they would be over thirteen ſtates, in any combinations founded upon motives, which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be of a nature to miſlead them from their duty.</p>
                     <p>Another and no leſs important deſideratum was, that the executive ſhould be independent for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in office on all, but the people themſelves. He might otherwiſe be tempted to ſacrifice his duty to his complaiſance for thoſe whoſe favor was neceſſary to the duration of his official conſequence. This advantage will alſo be ſecured, by making his re-election to depend on a ſpecial body of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, deputed by the ſociety for the ſingle purpoſe of making the important choice.</p>
                     <p>All theſe advantages will be happily combined in the plan deviſed by the convention, which is, that the people of each ſtate ſhall chooſe a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as electors, equal to the number of ſenators and repreſentatives of ſuch ſtate in the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who ſhall aſſemble within the ſtate and vote for ſome fit perſon as preſident. Their votes, thus given, are to be tranſmitted to the ſeat of the national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the perſon who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes, will be the preſident. But as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre on one man, and as it might be unſafe to permit leſs than a majority to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, it is provided, that in ſuch a contingency, the houſe of repreſentatives ſhall ſelect out of the candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, who ſhall have the five higheſt numbers of votes, the man who in their opinion may be beſt qualified for the office.</p>
                     <p>This proceſs of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of preſident, will never fall to the lot of any man, who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requiſite qualifications. Talents for low in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue and the little arts of popularity may alone ſuffice to elevate a man to the firſt honours in a ſingle ſtate,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:021127_0467_0FB24E3E36EC9F88"/>
but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to eſtabliſh him in the eſteem and confidence of the whole union, or of ſo conſiderable a portion of it as would be neceſſary to make him a ſucceſsful candidate for the diſtinguiſhed office of preſident of the United States. It will not be too ſtrong to ſay, that there will be a conſtant probability of ſeeing the ſtation filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no inconſiderable recommendation of the conſtitution, by thoſe, who are able to eſtimate the ſhare, which the executive in every government muſt neceſſarily have in its good or ill adminiſtration. Though we cannot acquieſce in the political hereſy of the poet who ſays—</p>
                     <l>"For forms of government let fools conteſt—</l>
                     <l>"That which is beſt adminiſtred is beſt."</l>
                     <p>—yet we may ſafely pronounce, that the true teſt of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>The vice-preſident is to be choſen in the ſame manner with the preſident; with this difference, that the ſenate is to do, in reſpect to the former, what is to be done by the houſe of repreſentatives, in reſpect to the latter.</p>
                     <p>The appointment of an extroardinary perſon, as vice-preſident, has been objected to as ſuperfluous, if not miſchievous. It has been alledged, that it would have been preferable to have authoriſed the ſenate to elect out of their own body an officer, anſwering to that deſcription. But two conſiderations ſeem to juſtify the ideas of the convention in this reſpect. One is, that to ſecure at all times the poſſibility of a definitive reſolution of the body, it is neceſſary that the preſident ſhould have only a caſting vote. And to take the ſenator of any ſtate from his ſeat as ſenator, to place him in that of preſident of the ſenate, would be to exchange, in regard to the ſtate from which he came, a conſtant for a contingent
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:021127_0468_0FB24E3FEC82F560"/>
vote. The other conſideration is, that as the vice-preſident may occaſionally become a ſubſtiſtute for the preſident, in the ſupreme executive magiſtracy, all the reaſons, which recommend the mode of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſcribed for the one, apply with great, if not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable, that in this as in moſt other inſtances, the objection which is made, would lie againſt the conſtitution of this ſtate. We have a lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-governor choſen by the people at large, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the ſenate, and is the conſtitutional ſubſtitute for the governor in caſualties ſimilar to thoſe, which would authoriſe the vice-preſident to exerciſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and diſcharge the duties of the preſident.</p>

                     <p>The firſt thing which ſtrikes our attention is, that the executive authority, with few exceptions, is to be veſted in a ſingle magiſtrate. This will ſcarcely, however, be conſidered as a point upon which any compariſon can be grounded; for if in this par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That magiſtrate is to be elected for <hi>four</hi> years; and is to be re-eligible as often as the people of the
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:021127_0469_0FB24E48CBD5E840"/>
United States ſhall think him worthy of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In theſe circumſtances, there is a total diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude between <hi>him</hi> and a king of Great-Britain; who is an <hi>hereditary</hi> monarch, poſſeſſing the crown as a patrimony deſcendible to his heirs forever; but there is a cloſe analogy between <hi>him</hi> and a governor of New-York, who is elected for <hi>three</hi> years, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermiſſion. If we conſider how much leſs time would be requiſite for eſtabliſhing a dangerous influence in a ſingle ſtate, than for eſtabliſhing a like influence throughout the United States, we muſt conclude that a duration of <hi>four</hi> years for the chief magiſtrate of the union, is a degree of permanency far leſs to be dreaded in that office, than a duration of <hi>three</hi> years for a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent office in a ſingle ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The preſident of the United States would be liable to be impeached, tried, and upon conviction of treaſon, bribery, or other high crimes or miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to proſecution and puniſhment in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of law. The perſon of the king of Great-Britain is ſacred and inviolable: There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no puniſhment to which he can be ſubjected without involving the criſis of a national revolution. In this delicate and important circumſtance of perſonal reſponſibility, the preſident of confederated America would ſtand upon no better ground than a governor of New-York, and upon worſe ground than the governors of Virginia and Delaware.</p>
                     <p>The preſident of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which ſhall have paſſed the two branches of the legiſlature, for re-conſideration; and the bill ſo returned is not to become a law, unleſs upon that re-conſideration it be approved by two thirds of both houſes. The king of Great-Britain, on his part has an abſolute negative upon the acts of the two houſes of parliament. The diſuſe of that power for
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:021127_0470_0FB24E4A3283D6C8"/>
a conſiderable time paſt, does not affect the reality of its exiſtence; and is to be aſcribed wholly to the crown's having found the means of ſubſtituting influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to authority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of the two houſes, to the neceſſity of exerting a prerogative which could ſeldom be exerted without hazarding ſome degree of national agitation. The qualified negative of the preſident differs widely from this abſolute negative of the Britiſh ſovereign; and tallies exactly with the reviſionary authority of the council of reviſion of this ſtate, of which the governor is a conſtituent part. In this reſpect, the power of the preſident would exceed that of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of New-York; becauſe the former would poſſeſs ſingly what the latter ſhares with the chancellor and judges: But it would be preciſely the ſame with that of the governor of Maſſachuſetts, whoſe conſtitution, as to this article, ſeems to have been the original from which the convention have copied.</p>
                     <p>The preſident is to be the
<q>commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the ſeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is to have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences againſt the United States <hi>except in caſes of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; to recommend to the conſideration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſuch meaſures as he ſhall judge neceſſary and expedient; to convene on extraordinary occaſions both houſes of the legiſlature, or either of them, and in caſe of diſagreement between them <hi>with reſpect to the time of adjournment,</hi> to adjourn them to ſuch time as he ſhall think proper; to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and to commiſſion all officers of the United States.</q>
In moſt of theſe particulars the power of the preſident will reſemble equally that of the king of Great-Britain and of the governor of New-York. The moſt material points of difference are theſe:—<hi>Firſt.</hi> The preſident will have only the occaſional command of ſuch part of the

militia of the nation, as by legiſlative proviſion may be called into the actual ſervice of the union. The king of Great-Britain and the governor of New-York, have at all times the entire command of all the militia within their ſeveral juriſdictons. In this article therefore the power of the preſident would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor. <hi>Second.</hi> The preſident is to be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States. In his reſpect his authority would be nominally the ſame with that of the king of Great-Britain, but in ſubſtance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the ſupreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as firſt general and admiral of the confederacy; while that of the Britiſh king extends to the <hi>declaring</hi> of war, and to the <hi>raiſing</hi> and <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> of fleets and armies; all which by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution under conſideration, would appertain to the legiſla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The truth is on the contrary, that his prerogative in this reſpect is immemorial, and was only diſputed
<q>contrary to all reaſon and precedent,</q>
as Blackſtone, vol. 1. page 262, expreſſes it, by the long parliament of Charles Firſt; but by the ſtatute the 13th of Charles Second, chap. 6. it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the ſole ſupreme government and command of the militia within his majeſty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by ſea and land, and of all forts and places of ſtrength, EVER WAS AND IS the undoubted right of his majeſty and his royal predeceſſors kings and queens of England, and that both or either houſe of parliament cannot nor ought to pretend to the ſame.</note> The governor of New-York, on the other hand, is by the conſtitution of the ſtate veſted only with the command of its militia and navy. But the conſtitutions of ſeveral of the ſtates, expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their governors to be commanders in chief as well of the army as navy; and it may well be a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether thoſe of New-Hampſhire and Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, in particular, do not in this inſtance confer larger powers upon their reſpective governors, than could be claimed by a preſident of the United States.

Is not the power of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in this article, on a calculation of political conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, greater than that of the preſident? All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and plots againſt the government, which have not been matured into actual treaſon, may be ſcreened from puniſhment of every kind, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the prerogative of pardoning. If a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of New-York therefore ſhould be at the head of any ſuch conſpiracy, until the deſign had been ripened into actual hoſtility, he could enſure his accomplices and adherents an entire impunity. A preſident of the union on the other hand, though he may even pardon treaſon, when proſecuted in the ordinary courſe of law, could ſhelter no offender in any degree from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not the proſpect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary ſteps be a greater temptation to undertake and perſevere in an enterpriſe againſt the public liberty than the mere proſpect of an exemption from death and confiſcation, if the final execution of the deſign, upon an actual appeal to arms, ſhould miſcarry? Would this laſt expectation have any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all, when the probability was computed that the perſon who was to afford that exemption might himſelf be involved in the conſequences of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and might be incapacitated by his agency in it, from affording the deſired impunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be neceſſary to recollect that by the propoſed conſtitution the offence of treaſon is limited
<q>to levying war upon the United States, and adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort,</q>
and that by the laws of New-York it is confined within ſimilar bounds.—<hi>Fourth.</hi> The preſident can only adjourn the national legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the ſingle caſe of diſagreement about the time
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:021127_0473_0FB24E4F8811B068"/>
of adjournment. The Britiſh monarch may prorogue or even diſſolve the parliament. The governor of New-York may alſo prorogue the legiſlature of this ſtate for a limited time; a power which in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſituations may be employed to very important purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The preſident is to have power with the advice and conſent of the ſenate to make treaties; provided two thirds of the ſenators preſent concur. The king of Great-Britain is the ſole and abſolute repreſentative of the nation in all foreign tranſactions. He can of his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every other deſcription. It has been inſinuated, that his authority in this reſpect is not concluſive, and that his conventions with foreign powers are ſubject to the reviſion, and ſtand in need of the ratification of parliament. But I believe this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was never heard of till it was broached upon the preſent occaſion. Every juriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Blackſtone's Commentaries, vol. 1. page 257.</note> of that kingdom and every other man acquainted with its conſtitution knows, as an eſtabliſhed fact, that the prerogative of making treaties exiſts in the crown in its utmoſt ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude; and that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the moſt complete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other ſanction. The parliament, it is true, is ſometimes ſeen employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in altering the exiſting laws to conform them to the ſtipulations in a new treaty; and this may have poſſibly given birth to the imagination that its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation was neceſſary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary interpoſition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a different cauſe; from the neceſſity of adjuſting a moſt artificial and intricate ſyſtem of revenue and commercial laws to the changes made in them by the operation of the treaty; and of adapting new proviſions and precautions to the new ſtate of things, to keep the machine from running into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In this reſpect therefore, there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:021127_0474_0FB24E50FB69BF50"/>
between the intended power of the preſident, and the actual power of the Britiſh ſovereign. The one can perform alone what the other can only do with the concurrence of a branch of the legiſlature. It muſt be admitted that in this inſtance the power of the federal executive would exceed that of any ſtate executive. But this ariſes naturally from the excluſive poſſeſſion by the union of that part of the ſovereign power which relates to treaties. If the confederacy were to be diſſolved, it would become a queſtion, whether the executives of the ſeveral ſtates were not ſolely inveſted with that delicate and important prerogative.</p>
                     <p>The preſident is alſo to be authoriſed to receive ambaſſadors and other public miniſters. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which will be without conſequence in the adminiſtration of the government; and it was far more convenient that it ſhould be arranged in this manner, than that there ſhould be a neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening the legiſlature, or one of its branches, upon every arrival of a foreign miniſter; though it were merely to take the place of a departed predeceſſor.</p>
                     <p>The preſident is to nominate, and <hi>with the advice and conſent of the ſenate</hi> to appoint ambaſſadors and other public miniſters, judges of the ſupreme court, and in general all officers of the United States eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by law, and whoſe appointments are not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provided for by the conſtitution. The king of Great-Britain is emphatically and truly ſtiled the fountain of honor. He not only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can confer titles of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity at pleaſure; and has the diſpoſal of an immenſe number of church preferments. There is evidently a great inferiority, in the power of the preſident in this particular, to that of the Britiſh king; nor is it equal to that of the governor of New-York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the conſtitution of the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:021127_0475_0FB24E55E1A57EB0"/>
ſtate by the practice which has obtained under it. The power of appointment is with us lodged in a council compoſed of the governor and four members of the ſenate choſen by the aſſembly. The governor <hi>claims</hi> and has frequently <hi>exerciſed</hi> the right of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and is <hi>entitled</hi> to a caſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this reſpect equal to that of the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and exceeds it in the article of the caſting vote.

                     <p>Hence it appears, that except as to the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent authority of the preſident in the article of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it would be difficult to determine whether that magiſtrate would in the aggregate poſſeſs more or leſs power than the governor of New-York. And it

appears yet more unequivocally that there is no pretence for the parallel which has been attempted between him and the king of Great-Britain.

                     <p>THERE is an idea, which is not without its advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, that a vigorous executive is inconſiſtent with the genius of republican government. The enlightened well wiſhers to this ſpecies of government muſt at leaſt hope that the ſuppoſition is deſtitute of foundation; ſince they can never admit its truth, without at the ſame time admitting the condemnation of their own principles. Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is eſſential to the protection of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity againſt foreign attacks: It is not leſs eſſential to the ſteady adminiſtration of the laws, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of property againſt thoſe irregular and high-handed combinations, which ſometimes interrupt the ordinary courſe of juſtice, to the ſecurity of liberty againſt the enterpriſes and aſſaults of ambition, of faction and of anarchy. Every man the leaſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Roman ſtory, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the abſolute power of a ſingle man, under the formidable title of dictator, as well againſt the intrigues of ambitious individuals, who aſpired to the tyranny, and the ſeditions of whole claſſes of the community, whoſe conduct threatened the exiſtence of all government, as againſt
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:021127_0478_0FB24E650EACBAA8"/>
the invaſions of external enemies, who menaced the conqueſt and deſtruction of Rome.</p>
                     <p>There can be no need however, to multiply argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or examples on this head. A feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the government. A feeble execution is but another phraſe for a bad exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: And a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, muſt be in practice a bad government.</p>
                     <p>Taking it for granted, therefore, that all men of ſenſe will agree in the neceſſity of an energetic exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, it will only remain to inquire, what are the ingredients which conſtitute this energy—how far can they be combined with thoſe other ingredients which conſtitute ſafety in the republican ſenſe? And how far does this combination characteriſe the plan which has been reported by the convention?</p>
                     <p>The ingredients which conſtitute energy in the executive, are, unity—duration—an adequate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for its ſupport—competent powers.</p>
                     <p>The ingredients which conſtitute ſafety in the republican ſenſe are, a due dependence on the people—a due reſponſibility.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe politicians and ſtateſmen, who have been the moſt celebrated for the ſoundneſs of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and for the juſtneſs of their views, have declared in favor of a ſingle executive and a numerous legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative.

in a much more eminent degree than the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of any greater number; and in proportion as the number is increaſed, theſe qualities will be diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>This unity may be deſtroyed in two ways; either by veſting the power in two or more mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of the firſt the two conſuls of Rome may ſerve as an example; of the laſt we ſhall find examples in the conſtitutions of ſeveral of the ſtates.

<pb n="243" facs="unknown:021127_0480_0FB24E6E11DAB1A8"/>
policy pointed out by the circumſtances of the ſtate, and purſued by the conſuls, of making a diviſion of the government between them. The patricians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a perpetual ſtruggle with the plebeians for the preſervation of their antient authorities and dignities; the conſuls, who were generally choſen out of the former body, were commonly united by the perſonal intereſt they had in the defence of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of their order. In addition to this motive of union, after the arms of the republic had conſiderably expanded the bounds of its empire, it became an eſtabliſhed cuſtom with the conſuls to divide the adminiſtration between themſelves by lot; one of them remaining at Rome to govern the city and its environs; the other taking the command in the more diſtant provinces. This expedient muſt no doubt have had great influence in preventing thoſe colliſions and rivalſhips, which might otherwiſe have embroiled the republic.</p>
                     <p>But quitting the dim light of hiſtorical reſearch, and attaching ourſelves purely to the dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and good ſenſe, we ſhall diſcover much greater cauſe to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the executive, under any modification whatever.</p>
                     <p>Wherever two or more perſons are engaged in any common enterprize or purſuit, there is always danger of difference of opinion. If it be a public truſt or office in which they are cloathed with equal dignity and authority, there is peculiar danger of perſonal emulation and even animoſity. From either and eſpecially from all theſe cauſes, the moſt bitter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions are apt to ſpring. Whenever theſe happen, they leſſen the reſpectability, weaken the authority, and diſtract the plans and operations of thoſe whom they divide. If they ſhould unfortunately aſſail the ſupreme executive magiſtracy of a country, conſiſting of a plurality of perſons, they might impede or fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the moſt important meaſures of the government in the moſt critical emergencies of the ſtate. And

what is ſtill worſe they might ſplit the community into violent and irreconciliable factions, adhering differently to the different individuals who compoſed the magiſtracy.</p>
                     <p>Men often oppoſe a thing merely becauſe they have had no agency in planning it, or becauſe it may have been planned by thoſe whom they diſlike But if they have been conſulted and have happened to diſapprove, oppoſition then becomes in their eſtimation an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty of ſelf love. They ſeem to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in honor, and by all the motives of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal infallibility to defeat the ſucceſs of what has been reſolved upon, contrary to their ſentiments. Men of upright and benevolent tempers have too many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of remarking with horror, to what deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate lengths this diſpoſition is ſometimes carried, and how often the great intereſts of ſociety are ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the vanity, to the conceit and to the obſtinacy of individvals, who have credit enough to make their paſſions and their caprices in er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſting to mankind. Perhaps the queſtion now before the public may in its conſequences afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this deſpicable frailty, or rather deteſtable vice in the human character.</p>
                     <p>Upon the principles of a free government, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies from the ſource juſt mentioned muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſubmitted to in the formation of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature; but it is unneceſſary and therefore unwiſe to introduce them into the conſtitution of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive. It is here too that they may be moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. In the legiſlature, promptitude of deciſion is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the government, though they may ſometimes obſtruct ſalutary plans, yet often promote diliberation and circumſpection; and ſerve to check exceſſes in the majority. When a reſolution too is once taken, the oppoſition muſt be at an end. That reſolution is a law, and reſiſtance to it puniſhable. But no favourable
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:021127_0482_0FB24E72AFDC3A50"/>
circumſtances palliate or atone for the diſadvantages of diſſention in the executive department. Here they are pure and unmixed. There is no point at which they ceaſe to operate. They ſerve to embarraſs and weaken the execution of the plan or meaſure, to which they relate, from the firſt ſtep to the final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of it. They conſtantly counteract thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the executive, which are the moſt neceſſary ingredients in its compoſition, vigour and expedition, and this without any counterballancing good. In the conduct of war, in which the energy of the executive is the bulwark of the national ſecurity, every thing would be to be apprehended from its plural<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be confeſſed that theſe obſervations apply with principal weight to the firſt caſe ſuppoſed, that is to a plurality of magiſtrates of equal dignity and authority; a ſcheme the advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous ſect: But they apply, though not with equal, yet with conſiderable weight, to the project of a council, whoſe concurrence is made conſtitutionally neceſſary to the operations of the oftenſible executive. An artful cabal in that council would be able to diſtract and to enervate the whole ſyſtem of adminiſtration. If no ſuch cabal ſhould exiſt, the mere diverſity of views and opinions would alone be ſufficient to tincture the exerciſe of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive authority with a ſpirit of habitual feebleneſs and dilatorineſs.</p>
                     <p>But one of the weightieſt objections to a plurality in the executive, and which lies as much againſt the laſt as the firſt plan, is that it tends to conceal faults, and deſtroy reſponſibility. Reſponſibility is of two kinds, to cenſure and to puniſhment. The firſt is the moſt important of the two; eſpecially in an elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive office. Men, in public truſt, will much oftener act in ſuch a manner as to render them unworthy of being any longer truſted, than in ſuch a manner as to make them obnoxious to legal puniſhment. But the multiplication of the executive adds to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:021127_0483_0FB24E742E878B78"/>
of detection in either caſe. It often becomes impoſſible, amidſt mutual accuſations, to determine on whom the blame or the puniſhment of a pernicious meaſure, or ſeries of pernicious meaſures ought really to fall. It is ſhifted from one to another with ſo much dexterity, and under ſuch plauſible appearances, that the public opinion is left in ſuſpenſe about the real author. The circumſtances which may have led to any national miſcarriage or misfortune are ſometimes ſo complicated, that where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may clearly ſee upon the whole that there has been miſmanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whoſe account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I was overruled by my council. The council were ſo divided in their opinions, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtain any better reſolution on the point.</q>
Theſe and ſimilar pretexts are conſtantly at hand, whether true or falſe. And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium of a ſtrict ſcrutiny into the ſecret ſprings of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromiſing taſk, if there happen to be a colluſion between the parties concerned, how eaſy is it to cloath the circumſtances with ſo much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the preciſe conduct of any of thoſe parties?</p>
                     <p>In the ſingle inſtance in which the governor of this ſtate is coupled with a council, that is in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to offices, we have ſeen the miſchiefs of it in the view now under conſideration. Scandalous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments to important offices have been made. Some caſes indeed have been ſo flagrant, that ALL PARTIES have agreed in the impropriety of the thing. When enquiry has been made, the blame has been laid by the governor on the members of the council; who on their part have charged it upon his nomination: While the people remain altogether
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:021127_0484_0FB24E75B92EB7B8"/>
at a loſs to determine by whoſe influence their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts have been committed to hands ſo unqualified, and ſo manifeſtly improper. In tenderneſs to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, I forbear to deſcend to particulars.</p>
                     <p>It is evident from theſe conſiderations, that the plurality of the executive tends to deprive the people of the two greateſt ſecurities they can have for the faithful exerciſe of any delegated power. <hi>Firſt.</hi> The reſtraints of public opinion, which loſe their efficacy as well on account of the diviſion of the cenſure atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on bad meaſures among a number, as on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the opportunity of diſcovering with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and clearneſs the miſconduct of the perſons they truſt, in order either to their removal from office, or to their actual puniſhment, in caſes which admit of it.</p>
                     <p>In England the king is a perpetual magiſtrate; and it is a maxim which has obtained for the ſake of the public peace, that he is unaccountable for his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and his perſon ſacred. Nothing therefore can be wiſer in that kingdom than to annex to the king a conſtitutional council, who may be reſponſible to the nation for the advice they give. Without this there would be no reſponſibility whatever in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive department, an idea inadmiſſible in a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But even there the king is not bound by the reſolutions of his council, though they are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the advice they give. He is the abſolute maſter of his own conduct in the exerciſe of his office; and may obſerve or diſregard the counſel given to him at his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>le diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>But in a republic, where every magiſtrate ought to be perſonally reſponſible for his behaviour in office, the reaſon which in the Britiſh conſtitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only ceaſes to apply, but turns againſt the inſtitution. In the monarchy of Great-Britain, it furniſhes a ſubſtitute for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited reſponſibility of the chief magiſtrate; which
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:021127_0485_0FB24E7736B42A68"/>
ſerves in ſome degree as a hoſtage to the national juſtice for his good behaviour. In the American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public it would ſerve to deſtroy, or would greatly diminiſh the intended and neceſſary reſponſibility of the chief magiſtrate himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The idea of a council to the executive, which has ſo generally obtained in the ſtate conſtitutions, has been derived from that maxim of republican jealouſy which conſiders power as ſafer in the hands of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men than of a ſingle man. It the maxim ſhould be admitted to be applicable to the caſe, I ſhould contend that the advantage on that ſide would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> counterballance the numerous diſadvantages on the oppoſite ſide. But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion in this particular with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be
<q>deep, ſolid and ingenious,</q>
that
<q>the executive power is more eaſily confined when it is ONE<note n="*" place="bottom">De Loime.</note>:</q>
That it is far more ſafe here ſhould be a ſingle object for the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and watchfulneſs of the people; and in a word, that all multiplication of the executive is rather dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than friendly to liberty.</p>
                     <p>A little conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ration will ſatisfy us, that the ſpecies of ſecurity ſought for in the multiplication of the executive is unattainable. Numbers muſt be ſo great as to render combination difficult; or they are rather a ſource of danger than of ſecurity The united credit and influence of ſeveral individuals muſt be more formidable to liberty than the credit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of either of them ſeparately. When power therefore is placed in the hands of ſo ſmall a number of men, as to admit of their intereſts and views being eaſily combined in a common enterprize, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abuſe, and more dangerous when abuſed, than if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very circumſtance

The decemvirs of Rome, whoſe name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes their number<note n="*" place="bottom">Ten.</note>, were more to be dreaded in their uſurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No perſon would think of propoſing an executive much more numerous than that body; from ſix to a dozen have been ſuggeſted for the number of the council. The extreme of theſe numbers is not too great for an eaſy combination; and from ſuch a combination America would have more to fear, than from the ambition of any ſingle individual. A council to a magiſtrate, who is himſelf reſponſible for what he does, are generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions; are often the inſtruments and accomplices of his bad, and are almoſt always a cloak to his faults.</p>

                     <p>DURATION in office has been mentioned as the ſecond requiſite to the energy of the executive authority. This has relation to two objects: To the perſonal firmneſs of the executive magiſtrate in the employment of his conſtitutional powers; and to the ſtability of the ſyſtem of adminiſtration which may have been adopted under his auſpices. With regard to the firſt, it muſt be evident, that the longer the duration in office, the greater will be the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of obtaining ſo important an advantage. It is a general principle of human nature, that a man will be intereſted in whatever he poſſeſſes, in proportion to the firmneſs or precariouſneſs of the tenure, by which he holds it; will be leſs attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain title, than to what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys by a durable or certain title; and of courſe will be willing to riſk more for the ſake of the one, than for the ſake of the other. This remark is not leſs applicable to a political privilege, or honor, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uſt, than to any article of ordinary property. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from it is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief magiſtrate, under a conſciouſneſs, that in a very ſhort time he <hi>muſt</hi> lay down his office, will be apt to feel himſelf too little intereſted in it, to hazard any material cenſure or perplexity, from the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent exertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however tranſient, which may happen to prevail either in a conſiderable part of the ſociety itſelf, or even in a predominant faction in the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative body. If the caſe ſhould only be, that he <hi>might</hi> lay it down, unleſs continued by a new choice; and if he ſhould be deſirous of being continued, his

But ſuch men entertain very crude notions, as well of the purpoſes for which government was inſtituted, as of the true means by which the public happineſs may be promoted. The republican principle demands, that the deliberate ſenſe of the community ſhould govern the conduct of thoſe to whom they intruſt the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Inſtances might be cited, in which a conduct of this kind has ſaved the people from very fatal conſequences of their own

miſtakes, and has procured laſting monuments of their gratitude to the men, who had had courage and magnanimity enough to ſerve them at the peril of their diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But however inclined we might be to inſiſt upon an unbounded complaiſance in the executive to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the people, we can with no propriety contend for a like complaiſance to the humors of the legiſlature. The atter may ſometimes ſtand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former; and at other times the people may be intirely neutral. In either ſuppoſition, it is certainly deſireable that the executive ſhould be in a ſituation to dare to act his own opinion with vigour and deciſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſame rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power, teaches likewiſe that this partition ought to be ſo contrived as to rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To what purpoſe ſeparate the executive or the judiciary from the legſliative, if both the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive and the judiciary are ſo conſtituted as to be at the abſolute devotion of the legiſlative? Such a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt be merely nominal, and incapable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the ends for which it was eſtabliſhed. It is one thing to be ſubordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent on the leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The firſt comports with, the laſt violates, the fundamental principles of good government; and whatever may be the forms of the conſtitution, unites all power in the ſame hands. The tendency of the legiſlative authority to abſorb every other, has been fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played and illuſtrated by examples in ſome preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this tendency is almoſt irreſiſtable.

judiciary were a breach of their privilege and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to their dignity. They often appear diſpoſed to exert an imperious controul over the other depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as they commonly have the people on their ſide, they always act with ſuch momentum, as to make it very difficult for the other members of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to maintain the balance of the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>It may perhaps be aſked, how the ſhortneſs of the duration in office can affect the independence of the executive on the legiſlative, unleſs the one were poſſeſſed of the power of appointing or diſplacing the other? One anſwer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked, that is, from the ſlender intereſt a man is apt to take in a ſhort lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expoſe himſelf on account of it to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable inconvenience or hazard. Another anſwer, perhaps more obvious, though not more concluſive, will reſult from the conſideration of the influence of the legiſlative body over the people, which might be employed to prevent the re-election of a man, who by an upright reſiſtance to any ſiniſter project of that body, ſhould have made himſelf obnoxious to its reſentment.</p>
                     <p>It may be aſked alſo whether a duration of four years would anſwer the end propoſed, and if it would not, whether a leſs period which would at leaſt be recommended by greater ſecurity againſt ambitious deſigns, would not for that reaſon be preferable to a longer period, which was at the ſame time too ſhort for the purpoſe of inſpiring the deſired firmneſs and independence of the magiſtrate?</p>
                     <p>It cannot be affirmed, that a duration of four years or any other limited duration would completely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end propoſed; but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material influence upon the ſpirit and character of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Between the commencement and termination of ſuch a period there would always be a conſiderable
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:021127_0491_0FB247A12EDD0E18"/>
interval, in which the proſpect of annihilation would be ſufficiently remote not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man endued with a tolerable portion of fortitude; and in which he might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably promiſe himſelf, that there would be time enough before it arrived, to make the community ſenſible of the propriety of the meaſures he might incline to purſue. Though it be probable, that as he approached the moment when the public were by a new election to ſignify their ſenſe of his conduct, his confidence, and with it, his firmneſs would decline; yet both the one and the other would derive ſupport from the opportunities, which his previous continuance in the ſtation had afforded him of eſtabliſhing himſelf in the eſteem and good will of his conſtituents. He might then hazard with ſafety, in proportion to the proofs he had given of his wiſdom and integrity, and to the title he had acquired to the reſpect and attachment of his fellow citizens. As on the one hand, a duration of four years will contribute to the firmneſs of the executive in a ſufficient degree to render it a very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable ingredient in the compoſition; ſo on the other it is not long enough to juſtify any alarm for the public liberty. If a Britiſh houſe of commons, from the moſt feeble beginnings, <hi>from the mere power of aſſenting or diſagreeing to the impoſition of a new tax,</hi> have by rapid ſtrides, reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a free government; while they raiſed themſelves to the rank and conſequence of a co-equal branch of the legiſlature; if they have been able in one inſtance to aboliſh both the royalty and the ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy, and to overturn all the antient eſtabliſhments as well in the church as ſtate; if they have been able on a recent occaſion to make the monarch tremble at the proſpect of an innovation<note n="*" place="bottom">This was the caſe with reſpect to Mr. Fox's India bill which was carried in the houſe of commons, and rejected in the houſe of lords, to the entire ſatisfaction, as it is ſaid, of the people.</note> attempted by them;

what would be to be feared from an elective magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of four years duration, with the confined autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of a preſident of the United States?

                     <p>THE ADMINISTRATION of government, in its largeſt ſenſe, comprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether legiſlative, executive or judiciary, but in its moſt uſual and perhaps in its moſt preciſe ſignification, it is limited to executive details, and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department. The actual conduct of foreign negotiations, the preparatory plans of finance, the application and diſburſement of the public monies, in conformity to the general appropriations of the legiſlature, the arrangement of the army and navy, the direction of the operations of war; theſe and other matters of a like nature conſtitute what ſeems to be moſt properly underſtood by the adminiſtration of government. The perſons therefore, to whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate management theſe different matters are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ought to be conſidered as the aſſiſtants or deputies of the chief magiſtrate; and, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they ought to derive their offices from his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, at leaſt from his nomination, and ought to be ſubject to his ſuperintendence. This view of the ſubject will at once ſuggeſt to us the intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:021127_0493_0FB24799F5253598"/>
between the duration of the executive magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate in office, and the ſtability of the ſyſtem of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. To reverſe and undo what has been done by a predeceſſor is very often conſidered by a ſucceſſor, as the beſt proof he can give of his own capacity and deſert; and, in addition to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, where the alteration has been the reſult of public choice, the perſon ſubſtituted is warranted in ſuppoſing, that the diſmiſſion of his predeceſſor has proceeded from a diſlike to his meaſures, and that the leſs he reſembles him the more he will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf to the favour of his conſtituents. Theſe conſiderations, and the influence of perſonal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and attachments, would be likely to induce every new preſident to promote a change of men to fill the ſubordinate ſtations; and theſe cauſes together could not fail to occaſion a diſgraceful and ruinous mutability in the adminiſtration of the government.</p>
                     <p>With a poſitive duration of conſiderable extent, I connect the circumſtance of re-elegibility. The firſt is neceſſary to give the officer himſelf the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and the reſolution to act his part well, and to the community time and leiſure to obſerve the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his meaſures, and thence to form an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental eſtimate of their merits. The laſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enable the people, when they ſee reaſon to approve of his conduct, to continue him in the ſtation, in order to prolong the utility of his talents and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and to ſecure to the government, the advantage of permanency in a wiſe ſyſtem of adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>Nothing appears more plauſible at firſt ſight, nor more ill founded upon cloſe inſpection, than a ſcheme which in relation to the preſent point has had ſome reſpectable advocates — I mean that of continuing the chief magiſtrate in office for a certain time, and then excluding him from it, either for a limited period or for ever after. This excluſion whether temporary or perpetual would have nearly the ſame effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:021127_0494_0FB2479B67BC4D60"/>
theſe effects would be for the moſt part rather perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than ſalutary.</p>
                     <p>One ill effect of the excluſion would be a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the inducements to good behaviour. There are few men who would not feel much leſs zeal in the diſcharge of a duty, when they were conſcious that the advantage of the ſtation, with which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, muſt be relinquiſhed at a determinate period, then when they were permitted to entertain a hope of <hi>obtaining</hi> by <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eriting</hi> a continuance of them. This poſition will not be diſputed, ſo long as it is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the deſire of reward is one of the ſtrongeſt incentives of human conduct, or that the beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the fidelity of mankind is to make their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt coincide with their duty. Even the love of fame, the ruling paſſion of the nobleſt minds, which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extenſive and arduous enterpriſes for the public benefit, requiring conſiderable time to mature and perfect them, if he could flatter himſelf with the proſpect of being allowed to finiſh what he had begun, would on the contrary deter him from the undertaking, when he foreſaw that he muſt quit the ſcene, before he could accompliſh the work, and muſt commit that, together with his own reputation, to hands which might be unequal or unfriendly to the taſk. The moſt to be expected from the generality of men, in ſuch a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is the negative merit of not doing harm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the poſitive merit of doing good.</p>
                     <p>Another ill effect of the excluſion would be the temptation to ſordid views, to peculation, and in ſome inſtances, to uſurpation. An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he muſt at all events yield up the advantages he enjoyed, would feel a propenſity, not eaſy to be reſiſted by ſuch a man, to make the beſt uſe of his opportunities, while they laſted; and might not ſcruple to have recourſe to the moſt corrupt expedients to make the harveſt as abundant
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:021127_0495_0FB247A31D6279E8"/>
as it was tranſitory; though the ſame man probably with a different proſpect before him, might content himſelf with the regular emoluments of his ſtation, and might even be unwilling to riſk the conſequences of an abuſe of his opportunities. His avarice might be a guard upon his avarice. Add to this, that the ſame man might be vain or ambitious as well as ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious. And if he could expect to prolong his honors, by his good conduct, he might heſitate to ſacrifice his appetite for them to his appetite for gain. But with the proſpect before him of approaching and inevitable annihilation, his avarice would be likely to get the victory over his caution, his vanity or his ambition.</p>
                     <p>An ambitious man too, finding himſelf ſeated on the ſummit of his country's honors, looking forward to the time at which he muſt deſcend from the exalted eminence forever, and reflecting that no exertion of merit on his part could ſave him from the unwelcome reverſe, would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favourable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power, at every perſonal hazard, than if he had the probability of anſwering the ſame end by doing his duty.</p>
                     <p>Would it promote the peace of the community, or the ſtability of the government, to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to raiſe themſelves to the ſeat of the ſupreme magiſtracy, wandering among the people like diſcontented ghoſts, and ſighing for a place which they were deſtined never more to poſſeſs?</p>
                     <p>A third ill effect of the excluſion would be the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magiſtrate in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his office. That experience is the parent of wiſdom is an adage, the truth of which is recognized by the wiſeſt as well as the ſimpleſt of mankind. What more deſirable or more eſſential than this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the governors of nations? Where more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or more eſſential than in the firſt magiſtrate of a
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:021127_0496_0FB247A5F38623C8"/>
nation? Can it be wiſe to put this deſirable and eſſential quality under the ban of the conſtitution; and to declare that the moment it is acquired, its poſſeſſor ſhall be compelled to abandon the ſtation in which it was acquired, and to which it is adapted? This nevertheleſs is the preciſe import of all thoſe regulations which exclude men from ſerving their country, by the choice of their fellow citizens, after they have, by a courſe of ſervice fitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for doing it with a greater degree of utility.</p>
                     <p>A fourth ill effect of the excluſion would be the baniſhing men from ſtations, in which in certain emergencies of the ſtate then preſence might be of the greateſt moment to the public intereſt or ſafety. There is no nation which has not at one period or another experienced an abſolute neceſſity of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of particular men, in particular ſituations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it would not be too ſtrong to ſay, to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of its p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>litical exiſtence. How unwiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be every ſuch ſelf-denying ordinance, as ſerves to prohibit a nation from making uſe of its own citizens, in the manner beſt ſuited to its exigences and circumſtances! Without ſuppoſing the perſonal eſſentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of the chief magiſtrate, at the breaking out of a war, or any ſimilar criſis, for another even of equal merit, would at all times be detrimental to the community; inaſmuch as it would ſubſtitute inexperience to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and would tend to unhinge and let afloat the already ſettled train of the adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>A fifth ill effect of the excluſion would be, that it would operate as a conſtitutional interdiction of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the adminiſtration. By <hi>neceſſitating</hi> a change of men, in the firſt office in the nation, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate a mutability of meaſures. It is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be expected, that men will vary; and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures remain uniform. The contrary is the uſual courſe of things. And we need not be apprehenſive that there will be too much ſtability, while there is
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:021127_0497_0FB249B73A197D48"/>
even the option of changing; nor need we deſire to prohibit the people from continuing their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where they think it may be ſafely placed, and where by conſtancy on their part, they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſome of the diſadvantages, which would flow from the principle of excluſion. They apply moſt forcibly to the ſcheme of a perpetual excluſion; but when we conſider that even a partial one would always render the re-admiſſion of the perſon a remote and precarious object, the obſervations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one caſe as to the other.</p>
                     <p>What are the advantages promiſed to counter-ballance theſe diſadvantages? They are repreſented to be—1ſt. Greater independence in the magiſtrate: 2d. Greater ſecurity to the people. Unleſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion be perpetual, there will be no pretence to infer the firſt advantage. But even in that caſe, may he have no object beyond his preſent ſtation to which he may ſacrifice his independence? May he have no connections, no friends, for whom he may ſacrifice it? May he not be leſs willing, by a firm conduct, to make perſonal enemies, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>acts under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that a time is faſt approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but MUST be expoſed to their reſentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon an inferior footing? It is not an eaſy point to determine whether his independence would be moſt promoted or impaired by ſuch an arrangement.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond ſuppoſed advantage, there is ſtill greater reaſon to entertain doubts concerning it, eſpecially if the excluſion were to be perpetual. In this caſe, as already intimated, a man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could be reaſon in any caſe to entertain apprehenſions, would with infinite reluctance yield to the neceſſity of taking his leave for ever of a poſt, in which his paſſion for power and
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:021127_0498_0FB249B9E2E92DF8"/>
pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit. And if he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good will of the people, he might induce them to conſider as a very odious and unjuſtifiable reſtraint upon themſelves, a proviſion which was calculated to debar them of the right of giving a freſh proof of their attachment to a favorite. There may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived circumſtances in which this diſguſt of the people, ſeconding the thwarted ambition of ſuch a favorite, might occaſion greater danger to liberty, than could ever reaſonably be dreaded from the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a perpetuation in office, by the voluntary ſuffrages of the community, exerciſing a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional privilege.</p>
                     <p>There is an exceſs of refinement in the idea of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the people to continue in office men, who had entitled themſelves, in their opinion, to approbation and confidence; the advantages of which are at beſt ſpeculative and equivoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l, and are overbalanced by diſadvantages far more certain and deciſive.</p>

                     <p>THE third ingredient towards conſtituting the vigour of the executive authority is an adequate proviſion for its ſupport. It is evident that without proper attention to this article, the ſeparation of the executive from the legiſlative department would be merely nominal and nugatory. The legiſlature, with a diſcretionary power over the ſalary and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments of the chief magiſtrate, could render him as obſequious to their will, as they might think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make him. They might in moſt caſes either
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:021127_0499_0FB249BCEBD511C0"/>
reduce him by famine, or tempt him by largeſſes, to ſurrender at diſcretion his judgment to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Theſe expreſſions taken in all the latitude of the terms would no doubt convey more than is intended. There are men who could neither be diſtreſſed nor won into a ſacrifice of their duty; but this ſtern virtue is the growth of few ſoils: And in the main it will be found, that a power over a man's ſupport is a power over his will. If it were neceſſary to confirm ſo plain a truth by facts, examples would not be wanting, even in this country, of the intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or ſeduction of the executive by the terrors, or allurements, of the pecuniary arrangements of the legiſlative body.</p>
                     <p>It is not eaſy therefore to commend too highly the judicious attention which has been paid to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the propoſed conſtitution. It is there provided that
<q>The preſident of the United States ſhall at ſtated times receive for his ſervice a compenſation, <hi>which ſhall neither be increaſed nor diminiſhed, during the period for which he ſhall have been elected,</hi> and he ſhall <hi>not receive within that period any other emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument</hi> from the United States or any of them.</q>
It is impoſſible to imagine any proviſion which would have been more eligible than this. The legiſlature on the appointment of a preſident is once for all to declare what ſhall be the compenſation for his ſervices during the time for which he ſhall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to alter it either by increaſe or diminution, till a new period of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by a new election commences. They can neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon his neceſſities; not corrupt his integrity, by appealing to his avarice. Neither the union nor any of its members will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty to receive any other emolument, than that which may have been determined by the firſt act. He can of courſe have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or deſert the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence intended for him by the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="263" facs="unknown:021127_0500_0FB249BFC17D64B8"/>The laſt of the requiſites to energy which have been enumerated are competent powers. Let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider thoſe which are propoſed to be veſted in the preſident of the United States.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing that offers itſelf to our obſervation, is the qualified negative of the preſident upon the acts or reſolutions of the two houſes of the legiſlature; or in other words his power of returning all bills with objections; to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws, unleſs they ſhould afterwards be ratified by two thirds of each of the component mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the legiſlative body.</p>
                     <p>The propenſity of the legiſlative department to intrude upon the rights and to abſorb the powers of the other departments, has been already more than once ſuggeſted; the inſufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has alſo been remarked upon; and the neceſſity of furniſhing each with conſtitutional arms for its own defence, has been inferred and proved. From theſe clear and indubitable principles reſults the propriety of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, either abſolute or qualified, in the executive, upon the acts of the legiſlative branches. Without the one or the other, the former would be abſolutely unable to defend himſelf againſt the depredations of the latter. He might gradually be ſtripped of his authorities by ſucceſſive reſolutions, or annihilated by a ſingle vote. And in the one mode or the other, the legiſlative and executive powers might ſpeedily come to be blended in the ſame hands. If even no propenſity had ever diſcovered itſelf in the legiſlative body, to invade the rights of the executive, the rules of juſt reaſoning and theoretic propriety would of themſelves teach us, that the one ought not to be left at the mercy of the other, but ought to poſſeſs a conſtitutional and effectual power of ſelf defence.</p>
                     <p>But the power in queſtion has a further uſe. It not only ſerves as a ſhield to the executive, but it furniſhes an additional ſecurity againſt the enaction
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:021127_0501_0FB249C1F989B4B0"/>
of improper laws. It eſtabliſhes a ſalutary check upon the legiſlative body calculated to guard the community againſt the effects of faction, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, or of any impulſe unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body.</p>
                     <p>The propriety of a negative, has upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions been combated by an obſervation, that it was not to be preſumed a ſingle man would poſſeſs more virtue or wiſdom, than a number of men; and that unleſs this preſumption ſhould be entertained, it would be improper to give the executive magiſtrate any ſpecies of controul over the legiſlative body.</p>
                     <p>But this obſervation, when examined, will appear rather ſpecious than ſolid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the ſuppoſition of ſuperior wiſdom or virtue in the executive; but upon the ſuppoſition that the legiſlative will not be infallible: That the love of power may ſometimes betray it into a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to encroach upon the rights of the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the government; that a ſpirit of faction may ſometimes pervert its deliberations; that impreſſions of the moment may ſometimes hurry it into meaſures which itſelf, on maturer reflection, would condemn. The primary inducement to conferring the power in queſtion upon the executive, is to enable him to defend himſelf; the ſecondary one is to encreaſe the chances in favour of the community againſt the paſſing of bad laws, through haſte, inadvertence, or deſign. The oftener a meaſure is brought under examination, the greater the diverſity in the ſituations of thoſe who are to examine it, the leſs muſt be the danger of thoſe errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of thoſe miſteps which proceed from the contagion of ſome common paſſion or intereſt. It is far leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that culpable views of any kind ſhould infect all the parts of the government, at the ſame moment and in relation to the ſame object, than that they ſhould by turns govern and miſlead every one of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="265" facs="unknown:021127_0502_0FB249C548066D98"/>It may perhaps be ſaid, that the power of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones; and may be uſed to the one purpoſe as well as to the other. But this objection will have little weight with thoſe who can properly eſtimate the miſchiefs of that inconſtancy and mutability in the laws which form the greateſt blemiſh in the character and genius of our governments. They will conſider every inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion calculated to reſtrain the exceſs of law-making, and to keep things in the ſame ſtate in which they may happen to be at any given period, as much more likely to do good than harm; becauſe it is favorable to greater ſtability in the ſyſtem of legiſlation. The injury which may poſſibly be done by defeating a few good laws will be amply compenſated by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of preventing a number of bad ones.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this all. The ſuperior weight and influence of the legiſlative body in a free government, and the hazard to the executive in a trial of ſtrength with that body, afford a ſatisfactory ſecurity, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative would generally be employed with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that there would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of raſhneſs, in the exerciſe of it. A king of Great Britain, with all his train of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign attributes, and with all the influence he draws from a thouſand ſources, would at this day heſitate to put a negative upon the joint reſolutions of the two houſes of parliament. He would not fail to exert the utmoſt reſources of that influence to ſtrangle a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſagreeable to him, in its progreſs to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of riſking the diſpleaſure of the nation, by an oppoſition to the ſenſe of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body. Nor is it probable that he would ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately venture to exert his prerogative, but in a caſe of manifeſt propriety, or extreme neceſſity. All well informed men in that kingdom will accede to the juſtneſs of this remark. A very conſiderable

                     <p>It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not uſing his power when neceſſary, than of his uſing it too often, or too much. An argument indeed againſt its expediency has been drawn from this very ſource. It has been repreſented on this account as a power odious in appearance, uſeleſs in practice. But it will not follow, that becauſe it might be rarely exerciſed, it would never be exerciſed. In the caſe for which it is chiefly deſigned, that of an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate attack upon the conſtitutional rights of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, or in a caſe in which the public good was evidently and palpably ſacrificed, a man of tolerable firmneſs would avail himſelf of his conſtitutional means of defence, and would liſten to the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of duty and reſponſibility. In the former ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, his fortitude would be ſtimulated by his immediate intereſt in the power of his office; in the latter by the probability of the ſanction of his conſtituents; who though they would naturally incline to the legiſlative body in a doubtful caſe, would hardly ſuffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain caſe. I ſpeak now with an eye to a magiſtrate poſſeſſing only a common ſhare of firmneſs. There are men, who under any circumſtances will have the courage to do their duty at every hazard.</p>
                     <p>But the convention have purſued a mean in this buſineſs; which will both facilitate the exerciſe of the power veſted in this reſpect in the executive magiſtrate, and make its efficacy to depend on the ſenſe of a conſiderable part of the legiſlative body.

Inſtead of an abſolute negative, it is propoſed to give the executive the qualified negative already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. This is a power, which would be much more readily exerciſed than the other. A man who might be afraid to defeat a law by his ſingle VETO, might not ſcruple to return it for re-conſideration; ſubject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one third of each houſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He would be encouraged by the reflection, that if his oppoſition ſhould prevail, it would embark in it a very reſpectable proportion of the legiſlative body, whoſe influence would be united with his in ſupporting the propriety of his conduct, in the public opinion. A direct and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical negative has ſomething in the appearance of it more harſh, and more apt to irri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In proportion as it would be leſs apt to offend, it would be more apt to be exerciſed; and for this very reaſon it may in practice be found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it will not often happen, that improper views will govern ſo large a proportion as two-thirds of both branches of the legiſlature at the ſame time; and this too in defiance of the counterpoiſing weight of the executive. It is at any rate far leſs probable, that this ſhould be the caſe, than that ſuch views ſhould taint the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conduct of a bare majority.

One is that the judges, who are to be the interpreters of the law, might receive an improper bias from having given a previous opinion in their reviſionary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The other is, that by being often aſſociated with the executive they might be induced to embark too far in the political views of that magiſtrate, and thus a dangerous combination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and judiciary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. It is impoſſible to keep the judges too diſtinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws. It is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a ſituation to be either corrupted or influenced by the executive.</p>

Humanity and good policy conſpire to dictate, that the benign pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of pardoning ſhould be as little as poſſible fettered or embarraſſed. The criminal code of every country partakes ſo much of neceſſary ſeverity, that without an eaſy acceſs to exceptions in favor of unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate guilt, juſtice would wear a countenance too ſanguinary and cruel. As the ſenſe of reſponſibility is always ſtrongeſt in proportion as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a ſingle man would be moſt ready to attend to the force of thoſe motives, which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and leaſt apt to yield to conſiderations, which were calculated to ſhelter a fit object of its vengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow creature depended on his <hi>ſole fiat,</hi> would naturally inſpire
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:021127_0507_0FB249D2F6DC8E40"/>
ſcrupulouſneſs and caution: The dread of being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of weakneſs or connivance would beget equal circumſpection, though of a different kind. On the other hand, as men generally derive confidence from their numbers, they might often encourage each other in an act of obduracy, and might be leſs ſenſible to the apprehenſion of ſuſpicion or cenſure for an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious or affected clemency. On theſe accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible diſpenſer of the mercy of the government than a body of men.</p>
                     <p>The expediency of veſting the power of pardoning in the preſident has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I miſtake not, been only conteſted in relation to the crime of treaſon. This, it has been urged, ought to have depended upon the aſſent of one or both of the branches of the legiſlative body. I ſhall not deny that there are ſtrong reaſons to be aſſigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that body, or of a part of it. As treaſon is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the ſociety, when the laws have once aſcertained the guilt of the offender, there ſeems a fitneſs in refering the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the legiſlature. And this ought the rather to be the caſe, as the ſuppoſition of the connivance of the chief magiſtrate ought not to be entirely excluded. But there are alſo ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to ſuch a plan. It is not to be doubted that a ſingle man of prudence and good ſenſe, is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which may plead for and againſt the remiſſion of the puniſhment, than any numerous body what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. It deſerves particular attention, that treaſon will often be connected with ſeditions, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a large proportion of the community; as lately happened in Maſſachuſetts. In every ſuch caſe, we might expect to ſee the repreſentation of the people tainted with the ſame ſpirit which had given birth to the offence. And when parties were pretty equally matched, the ſecret ſympathy of the friends and
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:021127_0508_0FB249D3ED752D30"/>
favorers of the condemned, availing itſelf of the good nature and weakneſs of others, might fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beſtow impunity where the terror of an example was neceſſary. On the other hand, when the ſedition had proceeded from cauſes which had inflamed the reſentments of the major party, they might, often be found obſtinate and inexorable, when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. But the principal argument for repoſing the power of pardoning in this caſe in the chief magiſtrate is this; in ſeaſons of inſurrection or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, there are often critical moments, when a well-timed offer of pardon to the inſurgents or rebels may reſtore the tranquility of the commonwealth; and which, if ſuffered to paſs unimproved, it may never be poſſible afterwards to recall. The dilatory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of convening the legiſlature, or one of its branches, for the purpoſe of obtaining its ſanction to the meaſure, would frequently be the occaſion of letting ſlip the golden opportunity. The loſs of a week, a day, an hour, may ſometimes be fatal. If it ſhould be obſerved that a diſcretionary power with a view to ſuch contingencies might be occaſionally confered upon the preſident; it may be anſwered in the firſt place, that it is queſtionable whether, in a limited conſtitution, that power could be delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by law; and in the ſecond place, that it would generally be impolitic before-hand to take any ſtep which might hold out the proſpect of impunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the uſual courſe, would be likely to be conſtrued into an argument of timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity or of weakneſs, and would have a tendency to embolden guilt.</p>

                     <p>THE preſident is to have power
<q>by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties provided two-thirds of the ſenators preſent concur.</q>
Though this proviſion has been aſſailed on different grounds, with no ſmall degree of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, I ſcruple not to declare my firm perſuaſion, that it is one of the beſt digeſted and moſt unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable parts of the plan. One ground of objection is, the trite topic of the intermixture of powers; ſome contending that the preſident ought alone to poſſeſs the power of making treaties; and others, that it ought to have been excluſively depoſited in the ſenate. Another ſource of objection is derived from the ſmall number of perſons by whom a treaty may be made: Of thoſe who eſpouſe this objection, a part are of opinion that the houſe of repreſentatives ought to have been aſſociated in the buſineſs, while another part ſeem to think that nothing more was neceſſary than to have ſubſtituted two-thirds of <hi>all</hi> the members of the ſenate to two-thirds of the members <hi>preſent.</hi> As I flatter myſelf the obſervations made in a preceding number, upon this part of the plan, muſt have ſufficed to place it to a diſcerning eye in a very favourable light, I ſhall here content myſelf with offering only ſome ſupplementary remarks, principally with a view to the objections which have been juſt ſtated.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the intermixture of powers, I ſhall rely upon the explanations already given, in other places, of the true ſenſe of the rule, upon which that objection is founded; and ſhall take it for granted, as an inference from them, that the union of the executive with the ſenate, in the article of treaties, is no infringment of that rule. I venture to add that
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:021127_0510_0FB249DCA0BF0E80"/>
the particular nature of the power of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union. Though ſeveral writers on the ſubject of government place that power in the claſs of executive authorities, yet this is evidently an arbitrary diſpoſition: For if we attend carefully to its operation, it will be found to partake more of the legiſlative than of the executive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, though it does not ſeem ſtrictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The eſſence of the legiſlative authority is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nact laws, or in other words to preſcribe rules for the regulation of the ſociety. While the execution of the laws and the employment of the common ſtrength, either for this purpoſe or for the common defence, ſeem to compriſe all the functions of the executive magiſtrate. The power of making treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the ſubſiſting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones, and ſtill leſs to an exertion of the common ſtrength. Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the ſovereign to the ſubject, but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between ſovereign and ſovereign. The power in queſtion ſeems therefore to form a diſtinct depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to belong properly neither to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nor to the executive. The qualities elſewhere detailed, as indiſpenſable in the management of foreign negociations, point out the executive as the moſt fit agent in thoſe tranſactions; while the vaſt importance of the truſt, and the operation of treaties as laws, plead ſtrongly for the participation of the whole or a part of the legiſlative body in the office of making them.</p>
                     <p>However proper or ſafe it may be in governments where the executive magiſtrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to him the entire power of making treaties, it would be utterly unſafe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to entruſt that power to an elective magiſtrate
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:021127_0511_0FB249E188104CF0"/>
of four years duration. It has been remarked upon another occaſion, and the remark is unqueſtionably juſt, that an hereditary monarch, though often the oppreſſor of his people, has perſonally too much at ſtake in the government to be in any material dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But that a man raiſed from the ſtation of a private citizen to the rank of chief magiſtrate, poſſeſſed of but a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or ſlender fortune, and looking forward to a period not very remote, when he may probably be obliged to return to the ſtation from which he was taken, might ſometimes be under temptations to ſacrifice his duty to his intereſt, which it would require ſuperlative virtue to withſtand. An avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man might be tempted to betray the intereſts of the ſtate to the acquiſition of wealth. An ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his conſtituents. The hiſtory of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which would make it wiſe in a nation to commit intereſts of ſo delicate and momentous a kind as thoſe which concern its intercourſe with the reſt of the world to the ſole diſpoſal of a magiſtrate, created and circumſtanced, as would be a preſident of the United States.</p>
                     <p>To have entruſted the power of making treaties to the ſenate alone, would have been to relinquiſh the benefits of the conſtitutional agency of the preſident, in the conduct of foreign negotiations. It is true, that the ſenate would in that caſe have the option of employing him in this capacity; but they would alſo have the option of letting it alone; and pique or cabal might induce the latter rather than the former. Beſides this, the miniſterial ſervant of the ſenate could not be expected to enjoy the confidence and reſpect of foreign powers in the ſame degree with the conſtitutional repreſentative of the nation; and of courſe would not be able to act with an equal degree
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:021127_0512_0FB249E2F48CD1E0"/>
of weight or efficacy. While the union would from this cauſe loſe a conſiderable advantage in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of its external concerns, the people would loſe the additional ſecurity, which would reſult from the co-operation of the executive. Though it would be imprudent to confide in him ſolely ſo important a truſt; yet it cannot be doubted, that his participation in it would materially add to the ſafety of the ſociety. It muſt indeed be clear to a demonſtration, that the joint poſſeſſion of the power in queſtion by the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſenate would afford a greater proſpect of ſecurity, than the ſeparate poſſeſſion of it by either of them. And whoever has maturely weighed the circumſtances, which muſt concur in the appointment of a preſident will be ſatisfied, that the office will always bid fair to be filled by men of ſuch characters as to render their concurrence in the formation of treaties peculiarly deſirable, as well on the ſcore of wiſdom as on that of integrity.</p>
                     <p>The remarks made in a former number, which has been alluded to in another part of this paper, will apply with concluſive force againſt the admiſſion of the houſe of repreſentatives to a ſhare in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treaties. The fluctuating, and taking its future increaſe into the account, the multitudinous compoſition of that body, forbid us to expect in it thoſe qualities which are eſſential to the proper exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch a truſt. Accurate and comprehenſive knowledge of foreign politics; a ſteady and ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic adherence to the ſame views; a nice and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſenſibility to national character, deciſion, <hi>ſecrecy</hi> and diſpatch; are incompatible with the genius of a body ſo variable and ſo numerous. The very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the buſineſs by introducing a neceſſity of the concurrence of ſo many different bodies, would of itſelf afford a ſolid objection. The greater frequency of the calls upon the houſe of repreſentatives, and the greater length of time which it would often be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to keep them together when convened, to obtain
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:021127_0513_0FB249E467B6DEC0"/>
their ſanction in the progreſſive ſtages of a treaty, would be ſource of ſo great inconvenience and expence as alone ought to condemn the project.</p>
                     <p>The only objection which remains to be canvaſſed is that which would ſubſtitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members compoſing the ſenatorial body, to that of two thirds of the members <hi>preſent.</hi> It has been ſhewn under the ſecond head of our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that all proviſions which require more than the majority of any body to its reſolutions have a direct tendency to embarraſs the operations of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and an indirect one to ſubject the ſenſe of the majority to that of the minority. This conſideration ſeems ſufficient to determine our opinion, that the convention have gone as far in the endeavour to ſecure the advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as could have been reconciled either with the activity of the public councils or with a reaſonable regard to the major ſenſe of the community. If two thirds of the whole number of members had been required, it would in many caſes from the non-atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a part amount in practice to a neceſſity of unanimity. And the hiſtory of every political eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in which this principle has prevailed is a hiſtory of impotence, perplexity and diſorder. Proofs of this poſition might be adduced from the examples of the Roman tribuneſhip, the Poliſh diet and the ſtates general of the Netherlands; did not an example at home render foreign precedents unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>To require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not in all probability contribute to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a numerous agency, better than merely to require a proportion of the attending members. The former by increaſing the difficulty of reſolutions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the minority diminiſhes the motives to punctual attendance. The latter by making the capacity of the body to depend on a <hi>proportion</hi> which may be varied by the abſence or preſence of a ſingle member, has the contrary effect. And as, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:021127_0514_0FB249ED91097B10"/>
punctuality, it tends to keep the body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, there is great likelihood that its reſolutions would generally be dictated by as great a number in this caſe as in the other; while there would be much fewer occaſions of delay. It ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that under the exiſting confederation two members <hi>may</hi> and uſually <hi>do</hi> repreſent a ſtate; whence it happens that congreſs, who now are ſolely inveſted with <hi>all the powers</hi> of the union, rarely conſiſts of a greater number of perſons than would compoſe the intended ſenate. If we add to this, that as the members vote by ſtates, and that where there is only a ſingle member preſent from a ſtate, his vote is loſt, it will juſtify a ſuppoſition that the active voices in the ſenate, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e the members are to vote individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, would rarely fall ſhort in number of the active voices in the exiſting congreſs. When in addition to theſe conſiderations we take into view the co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the preſident, we ſhall not heſitate to infer that the people of America would have greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt an improper uſe of the power of making treaties, under the new conſtitution, than they now enjoy under the confederation. And when we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſtill one ſtep further, and look forward to the probable augmentation of the ſenate, by the erection of new ſtates we ſhall not only perceive ample ground of confidence in the ſufficiency of the numbers, to whoſe agency that power will be entruſted; but we ſhall probably be led to conclude that a body more numerous than the ſenate would be likely to become, would be very little fit for the proper diſcharge of the truſt.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER LXXVI. The ſame View continued, in Relation to the Appointment of the Officers of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
                     <p>THE preſident is
<q>to <hi>nominate</hi> and by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate to appoint ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls, judges of the ſupreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whoſe appointments are not otherwiſe provided for in the conſtitution. But the congreſs may by law veſt the appointment of ſuch inferior officers as they think proper in the preſident alone, or in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. The preſident ſhall have power to fill up <hi>all vacancies</hi> which may happen <hi>during the receſs of the ſenate,</hi> by granting commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ſhall <hi>expire</hi> at the end of their next ſeſſion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It has been obſerved in a former paper that
<q>the true teſt of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good adminiſtration.</q>
If the juſtneſs of this obſervation be admitted, the mode of appointing the officers of the United States contained in the foregoing clauſes, muſt, when examined, be allowed to be entitled to particular commendation. It is not eaſy to conceive a plan better calculated than this, to promote a judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the union; and it will not need proof that on this point muſt eſſentially depend the character of its adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>It will be agreed on all hands, that the power of appointment in ordinary caſes can be properly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified only in one of three ways. It ought either to be veſted in a ſingle man—or in a <hi>ſelect</hi> aſſembly of a moderate number—or in a ſingle man with the
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:021127_0516_0FB249F267A7EE88"/>
concurrence of ſuch an aſſembly. The exerciſe of it by the people at large, will be readily admitted to be impracticable; as, waving every other conſideration it would leave them little time to do any thing elſe. When therefore mention is made in the ſubſequent reaſonings of an aſſembly or body of men, what is ſaid muſt be underſtood to relate to a ſelect body or aſſembly of the deſcription already given. The people collectively from their number and from their diſperſed ſituation cannot be regulated in their move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by that ſyſtematic ſpirit of cabal and intrigue, which will be urged as the chief objections to repoſing the power in queſtion in a body of men.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have themſelves reflected upon the ſubject, or who have attended to the obſervations made in other parts of theſe papers, in relation to the appointment of the preſident, will, I preſume, agree to the poſition that there would always be great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of having the place ſupplied by a man of abilities, at leaſt reſpectable. Premiſing this, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to lay it down as a rule, that one man of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment is better fitted to analiſe and eſtimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than a body of men of equal, or perhaps even of ſuperior diſcernment.</p>
                     <p>The ſole and undivided reſponſibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier ſenſe of duty and a more exact regard to reputation. He will on this account feel himſelf under ſtronger obligations, and more intereſted to inveſtigate with care the qualities requiſite to the ſtations to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the perſons who may have the faireſt pretenſions to them. He will have <hi>fewer</hi> perſonal attachments to gratify than a body of men, who may each be ſuppoſed to have an equal number, and will be ſo much the leſs liable to be miſled by the ſentiments of friendſhip and of affection. There is nothing ſo apt to agitate the paſſions of mankind as perſonal conſiderations, whether they relate to
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:021127_0517_0FB249F387C6B130"/>
ourſelves or to others, who are to be the objects of our choice or preference. Hence, in every exerciſe of the power of appointing to offices by an aſſembly of men, we muſt expect to ſee a full diſplay of all the private and party likings and diſlikes, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities and antipathies, attachments and animoſities, which are felt by thoſe who compoſe the aſſembly. The choice which may at any time happen to be made under ſuch circumſtances will of courſe be the reſult either of a victory gained by one party over the other, or of a compromiſe between the parties. In either caſe, the intrinſic merit of the candidate will be too often out of ſight. In the firſt, the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications beſt adapted to uniting the ſuffrages of the party will be more conſidered than thoſe which fit the perſon for the ſtation. In the laſt, the coalition will commonly turn upon ſome intereſted equivalent,
<q>Give us the man we wiſh for this office, and you ſhall have the one you wiſh for that.</q>
This will be the uſual condition of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the advancement of the public ſervice will be the primary object either of party victories or of party negotiations.</p>
                     <p>The truth of the principles here advanced ſeems to have been felt by the moſt intelligent of thoſe who have found fault with the proviſion made in this re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pect by the convention. They contend that the preſident ought ſolely to have been authoriſed to make the appointments under the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it is eaſy to ſhew that every advantage to be expected from ſuch an arrangement would in ſubſtance be derived from the power of <hi>nomination,</hi> which is propoſed to be conferred upon him; while ſeveral diſadvantages which might attend the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided. In the act of nomination, his judgment alone would be exerciſed; and as it would be his ſole duty to point out the man, who with the approbation of the ſenate ſhould fill an office, his
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:021127_0518_0FB249F51390BE48"/>
reſponſibility would be as complete as if he were to make the final appointment. There can in this view be no difference between nominating and appointing. The ſame motives which would influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a proper diſcharge of his duty in one caſe, would exiſt in the other. And as no man could be appointed, but upon his previous nomination, every man who might be appointed would be in fact his choice.</p>
                     <p>But his nomination may be overruled:—This it certainly may, yet it can only be to make place for another nomination by himſelf. The perſon ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately appointed muſt be the object of his preference though perhaps not in the firſt degree. It is alſo not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled. The ſenate could not be tempted by the preference they might feel to another to reject the one propoſed; becauſe they could not aſſure themſelves that the perſon they might wiſh would be brought forward by a ſecond or by any ſubſequent nomination. They could not even be certain that a future nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would preſent a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them: And as their diſſent might caſt a kind of ſtigma upon the individual rejected; and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgement of the chief magiſtrate; it is not likely that their ſanction would often be refuſed, where there were not ſpecial and ſtrong reaſons for the refuſal.</p>
                     <p>To what purpoſe then require the co-operation of the ſenate? I anſwer that the neceſſity of their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence would have a powerful, though in general a ſilent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a ſpirit of favoritiſm in the preſident, and would tend greatly to preventing the appointment of unfit cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters from ſtate prejudice, from family connection, from perſonal attachment, or from a view to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. And, in addition to this, it would be an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious ſource of ſtability in the adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="unknown:021127_0519_0FB249F7E961FE80"/>It will readily be comprehended, that a man, who had himſelf the ſole diſpoſition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and intereſts, than when he was bound to ſubmit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his choice to the diſcuſſion and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a different and independent body; and that body an entire branch of the legiſlature. The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of rejection would be a ſtrong motive to care in propoſing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the caſe of an elective magiſtrate, to his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical exiſtence, from betraying a ſpirit of favoritiſm, or an unbecoming purſuit of popularity, to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a body, whoſe opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both aſhamed and afraid to bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the moſt diſtinguiſhed or lucrative ſtations, candidates who had no other merit than that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſame ſtate to which he particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, or of being in ſome way or other perſonally allied to him, or of poſſeſſing the neceſſary inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficance and pliancy to render them the obſequious inſtruments of his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>To this reaſoning, it has been objected, that the preſident, by the influence of the power of nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may ſecure the complaiſance of the ſenate to his views. The ſuppoſition of univerſal venality in human nature, is little leſs an error in political rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning than the ſuppoſition of univerſal rectitude. The inſtitution of delegated power implies that there is a portion of virtue and honour among mankind, which may be a reaſonable foundation of confidence. And experience juſtifies the theory: It has been found to exiſt in the moſt corrupt periods of the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt governments. The venality of the Britiſh houſe of commons has been long a topic of accuſation againſt that body, in the country to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, as well as in this; and it cannot be doubted that the charge is to a conſiderable extent well
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:021127_0520_0FB249F99E9B1D10"/>
founded. But it is as little to be doubted that there is always a large proportion of the body, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of independent and public ſpirited men, who have an influential weight in the councils of the nation. Hence it is (the preſent reign not excepted) that the ſenſe of that body is often ſeen to control the inclinations of the monarch, both with regard to men and to meaſures. Though it might therefore be allowable to ſuppoſe that the executive might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally influence ſome individuals in the ſenate, yet the ſuppoſition that he could in general purchaſe the integrity of the whole body, would be forced and improbable. A man diſpoſed to view human nature as it is, without either flattering its virtues or exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating its vices, will ſee ſufficient ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the probity of the ſenate, to reſt ſatisfied not only that it will be impracticable to the executive to corrupt or ſeduce a majority of its members; but that the neceſſity of its co-operation in the buſineſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments will be a conſiderable and ſalutary reſtraint upon the conduct of that magiſtrate. Nor is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the ſenate the only reliance. The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has provided ſome important guards againſt the danger of executive influence upon the legiſlative body: It declares that
<q>no ſenator or repreſentative ſhall, during the time <hi>for which he was elected,</hi> be appointed to any civil office under the United States, which ſhall have been created, or the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments whereof ſhall have been encreaſed during ſuch time; and no perſon holding any office under the United States, ſhall be a member of either houſe during his continuance in office.</q>

                     <head>NUMBER LXXVII. The View of the Conſtitution of the Preſident concluded, with a further Conſideration of the Power of Appointment, and a conciſe Examination of his remaining Powers.</head>
                     <p>IT has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the ſenate, in the buſineſs of appointments, that it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the ſtability of the adminiſtration. The conſent of that body would be neceſſary to diſplace as well as to appoint. A change of the chief magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate therefore would not occaſion ſo violent or ſo general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected if he were the ſole diſpoſer of offices. Where a man in any ſtation had given ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory evidence of his fitneſs for it, a new preſident would be reſtrained from attempting a change, in favor of a perſon more agreeable to him, by the apprehenſion that the diſcountenance of the ſenate might fruſtrate the attempt, and bring ſome degree of diſcredit upon himſelf. Thoſe who can beſt eſtimate the value of a ſteady adminiſtration will be moſt diſpoſed to prize a proviſion, which connects the official exiſtence of public men with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or diſapprobation of that body, which from the greater permanency of its own compoſition, will in all probability be leſs ſubject to inconſtancy, than any other member of the government.</p>
                     <p>To this union of the ſenate with the preſident, in the article of appointments, it has in ſome caſes been objected, that it would ſerve to give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident an undue influence over the ſenate; and in others, that it would have an oppoſite tendency; a ſtrong proof that neither ſuggeſtion is true.</p>
                     <p>To ſtate the firſt in its proper form is to refute it. It amounts to this; the preſident would have an
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:021127_0522_0FB24A044C0393A8"/>
improper <hi>influence over</hi> the ſenate; becauſe the ſenate would have the power of <hi>reſtraining</hi> him. This is an abſurdity in terms. It cannot admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to eſtabliſh a dangerous empire over that body, than a mere power of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſubject to their control.</p>
                     <p>Let us take a view of the converſe of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, "The ſenate would influence the executive." As I have had occaſion to remark in ſeveral other inſtances, the indiſtinctneſs of the objection forbids a preciſe anſwer. In what manner is this influence to be exerted? In relation to what objects? The power of influencing a perſon, in the ſenſe in which it is here uſed, muſt imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him. How could the ſenate confer a benefit upon the preſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent by the manner of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their right of negative upon his nominations? If it be ſaid they might ſometimes gratify him by an acquieſcence in a favourite choice, when public motives might dictate a different conduct; I anſwer that the inſtances in which the preſident could be perſonally intereſted in the reſult, would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the ſenate. Beſides this, it is evident that the POWER which can <hi>originate</hi> the diſpoſition of honors and emoluments, is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the POWER which can merely obſtruct their courſe. If by influencing the preſident be meant <hi>reſtraining</hi> him, this is preciſely what muſt have been intended. And it has been ſhewn that the reſtraint would be ſalutary, at the ſame time that it would not be ſuch as to deſtroy a ſingle advantage to be looked for from the uncontroled agency of that magiſtrate. The right of nomination would produce all the good, without the ill.</p>
                     <p>Upon a compariſon of the plan for the appointment of the officers of the propoſed government with that
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:021127_0523_0FB24A062D3F05E8"/>
which is eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution of this ſtate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> decided preference muſt be given to the former. In that plan the power of nomination is unequivocally veſted in the executive. And as there would be a neceſſity for ſubmitting each nomination to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an entire branch of the legiſlative, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending an appointment, from the mode of conducting it, would naturally become matters of notoriety; and the public could be at no loſs to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what part had been performed by the different actors. The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the preſident ſingly and abſolutely. The cenſure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the ſenate; aggravated by the conſideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the executive. If an ill appointment ſhould be made the executive for nominating and the ſenate for approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would participate though in different degrees in the opprobrium and diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>The reverſe of all this characteriſes the manner of appointment in this ſtate. The council of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts of from three to five perſons, of whom the governor is always one. This ſmall body, ſhut up in a private apartment, impenetrable to the public eye, proceed to the execution of the truſt committed to them. It is known that the governor claims the right of nomination, upon the ſtrength of ſome ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous expreſſions in the conſtitution; but it is not known to what extent, or in what manner he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes it; nor upon what occaſions he is contradicted or oppoſed. The cenſure of a bad appointment, on account of the uncertainty of its author, and for want of a determinate object, has neither poignancy nor duration. And while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open, all idea of reſponſibility is loſt. The moſt that the public can know is, that the governor claims the right of nomination: That <hi>two</hi> out of the conſiderable number of <hi>four</hi> men can too often be managed without much difficulty: That if
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:021127_0524_0FB24A07B18B2AA0"/>
ſome of the members of a particular council ſhould happen to be of an uncomplying character, it is frequently not impoſſible to get rid of their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by regulating the times of meeting in ſuch a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient: And that, from whatever cauſe it may proceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made. Whether a governor of this ſtate avails himſelf of the aſcendant he muſt neceſſarily have, in this delicate and important part of the adminiſtration, to prefer to offices men who are beſt qualified for them: Or whether he proſtitutes that advantage to the advancement of perſons, whoſe chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will, and to the ſupport of a deſpicable and dangerous ſyſtem of perſonal influence, are queſtions which unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for the community can only be the ſubjects of ſpeculation and conjecture.</p>
                     <p>Every mere council of appointment, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, will be a conclave, in which cabal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue will have their full ſcope. Their number, without an unwarrantable increaſe of expence, cannot be large enough to preclude a facility of combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for, the deſire of mutual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification will beget a ſcandalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places. The private attachments of one man might eaſily be ſatisfied; but to ſatisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or of twenty men, would occaſion a monopoly of all the principal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the government, in a few families, and would lead more directly to an ariſtocracy or an oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy, than any meaſure that could be contrived. If to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequent change in the perſons who were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the council, this would involve the miſchiefs of a mutable adminiſtration in their full extent. Such a council would alſo be more liable to executive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence than the ſenate, becauſe they would be fewer
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:021127_0525_0FB24A09ABD66598"/>
in number, and would act leſs immediately under the public inſpection. Such a council in fine as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for the plan of the convention, would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of an increaſe of expence, a multiplication of the evils which ſpring from favoritiſm and intrigue in the diſtribution of the public honors, a decreaſe of ſtability in the adminiſtration of the government, and a diminution of the ſecurity againſt an undue influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the executive. And yet ſuch a council has been warmly contended for as an eſſential amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the propoſed conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>I could not with propriety conclude my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the ſubject of appointments, without taking notice of a ſcheme, for which there has appeared ſome, though but a few advocates; I mean that of uniting the houſe of repreſentatives in the power of making them. I ſhall however do little more than mention it, as I cannot imagine that it is likely to gain the countenance of any conſiderable part of the community. A body ſo fluctuating, and at the ſame time ſo numerous, can never be deemed proper for the exerciſe of that power. Its unfitneſs will appear manifeſt to all, when it is recollected that in half a century it may conſiſt of three or four hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. All the advantages of the ſtability, both of the executive and of the ſenate, would be defeated by this union; and infinite delays and embarraſſments would be occaſioned. The example of moſt of the ſtates in their local conſtitutions, encourages us to reprobate the idea.</p>
                     <p>The only remaining powers of the executive, are comprehended in giving information to congreſs of the ſtate of the union; in recommending to their conſideration ſuch meaſures as he ſhall judge expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; in convening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary occaſions; in adjourning them when they cannot themſelves agree upon the time of adjournment; in receiving ambaſſadors and other public miniſters; in faithfully executing the laws;

                        </gap> It required indeed an inſatiable avidity for cenſure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to. In regard to the power of convening either houſe of the legiſlature, I ſhall barely remark, that in reſpect to the ſenate at leaſt, we can readily diſcover a good reaſon for it. As this body has a concurrent power with the executive in the article of treaties, it might often be neceſſary to call it together with a view to this object, when it would be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and improper to convene the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. As to the reception of ambaſſadors, what I have ſaid in a former paper will furniſh a ſufficient anſwer.</p>
                     <p>We have now compleated a ſurvey of the ſtructure and powers of the executive department, which, I have endeavoured to ſhew, combines, as far as repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican principles will admit, all the requiſites to energy. The remaining enquiry is—does it alſo combine the requiſites to ſafety in the republican ſenſe—a due dependence on the people—a due reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility? The anſwer to this queſtion has been anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated in the inveſtigation of its other characteriſtics, and is ſatisfactorily deducible from theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the election of the preſident once in four years by perſons immediately choſen by the people for that purpoſe; and his being at all times liable to impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, trial, diſmiſſion from office, incapacity to ſerve in any other; and to the forfeiture of life and eſtate by ſubſequent proſecution in the common courſe of law. But theſe precautions, great as they are, are not the only ones, which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public ſecurity. In the only inſtances in which the abuſe of the executive

authority was materially to be feared, the chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the United States would by that plan be ſubjected to the control of a branch of the legiſlative body. What more can an enlightened and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people deſire?</p>

                     <head>NUMBER LXXVIII. A View of the Conſtitution of the Judicial Department, in Relation to the Tenure of good Behaviour.</head>
                     <p>WE proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the propoſed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>In unfolding the defects of the exiſting confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the utility and neceſſity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. It is the leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to recapitulate the conſiderations there urged; as the propriety of the inſtitution in the abſtract is not diſputed: The only queſtions which have been raiſed being relative to the manner of conſtituting it, and to its extent. To theſe points therefore our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be confined.</p>
                     <p>The manner of conſtituting it ſeems to embrace theſe ſeveral objects—1ſt. The mode of appointing the judges—2d. The tenure by which they are to hold their places—3d. The partition of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> As to the mode of appointing the judges; This is the ſame with that of appointing the officers of the union in general, and has been ſo fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in the two laſt numbers, that nothing can be ſaid here which would not be uſeleſs repetition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second.</hi> As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places: This chiefly concerns their
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:021127_0528_0FB24A13306D6A48"/>
duration in office; the proviſions for their ſupport; and the precautions for their reſponſibility.</p>
                     <p>According to the plan of the convention, all the judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices <hi>during good behaviour,</hi> which is conformable to the moſt approved of the ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and among the reſt, to that of this ſtate. Its propriety having been drawn into queſtion by the adverſaries of that plan, is no light ſymptom of the rage for objection which diſorders their imaginations and judgments. The ſtandard of good behaviour for the continuance in office of the judicial magiſtracy is certainly one of the moſt valuable of the modern im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in the practice of government. In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the deſpotiſm of the prince: In a republic it is a no leſs excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppreſſions of the repreſentative body And it is the beſt expedient which can be deviſed in any government, to ſecure a ſteady, upright and impartial adminiſtration of the laws.</p>
                     <p>Whoever attentively conſiders the different depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of power muſt perceive, that in a government in which they are ſeparated from each other, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the leaſt dangerous to the political rights of the conſtitution; becauſe it will be leaſt in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The executive not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes the honors, but holds the ſword of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The legiſlative not only commands the purſe, but preſcribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary on the contrary has no influence over either the ſword or the purſe, no direction either of the ſtrength or of the wealth of the ſociety, and can take no active reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution whatever. It may truly be ſaid to have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and muſt ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="292" facs="unknown:021127_0529_0FB24A15CEB42518"/>This ſimple view of the matter ſuggeſts ſeveral important conſequences. It proves inconteſtibly that the judiciary is beyond compariſon the weakeſt of the three departments of power<note n="*" place="bottom">The celebrated Monteſquieu ſpeaking of them ſays,
<q>of the three powers above mentioned, the JUDICIARY is next to nothing.</q>

                        </gap>eſs either of the other two; and that all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care is requiſite to enable it to defend itſelf againſt their attacks. It equally proves, that though indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual oppreſſion may now and then proceed from the courts of juſtice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter: I mean, ſo long as the judiciary remains truly diſtinct from both the legiſlative and executive. For I agree that
<q>there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the legiſlative and executive powers<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem. page 181.</note>.</q>
And it proves, in the laſt place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of ſuch an union muſt enſue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithſtanding a nominal and apparent ſeparation; that as from the natural feebleneſs of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed or influenced by its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate branches; and that as nothing can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſo much to its firmneſs and independence, as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be juſtly regarded as an indiſpenſable ingredient in its conſtitution; and in a great meaſure as the citadel of the public juſtice and the public ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>The complete independence of the courts of juſtice is peculiarly eſſential in a limited conſtitution. By a limited conſtitution I underſtand one which contains certain ſpecified exceptions to the legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſuch for inſtance as that it ſhall paſs no bills of attainder, no <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> laws, and the like. Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this kind can be preſerved in practice no
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:021127_0530_0FB24A18EFB3E230"/>
other way than through the medium of the courts of juſtice; whoſe duty it muſt be to declare all acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the manifeſt tenor of the conſtitution void. Without this, all the reſervations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Some perplexity reſpecting the right of the courts to pronounce legiſlative acts void, becauſe contrary to the conſtitution, has ariſen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a ſuperiority of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary to the legiſlative power. It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, muſt neceſſarily be ſuperior to the one whoſe acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in all the American conſtitutions, a brief diſcuſſion of the grounds on which it reſts cannot be unacceptable.</p>
                     <p>There is no poſition which depends on clearer prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commiſſion under which it is exerc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſed, is void. No legiſlative act therefore contrary to the conſtitution can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the ſervant is above his maſter; that the repreſentatives of the people are ſuperior to the peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e themſelves; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authoriſe, but what they forbid.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid that the legiſlative body are themſelves the conſtitutional judges of their own powers, and that the conſtruction they put upon them is concluſive upon the other departments, it may be anſwered, that this cannot be the natural preſumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular proviſions in the conſtitution. It is not otherwiſe to be ſuppoſed that the conſtitution could intend to enable the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people to ſubſtitute their <hi>will</hi> to that of their conſtituents. It is far more rational to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the courts were deſigned to be an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate body between the people and the legiſlature, in
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:021127_0531_0FB24A1A68267910"/>
order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits aſſigned to their authority. The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A conſtitution is in fact, and muſt be, regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to aſcertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legiſlative body. If there ſhould happen to be an irreconcileable variance between the two, that which has the ſuperior obligation and validity ought of courſe to be prefered; or in other words, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ought to be prefered to the ſtatute, the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people to the intention of their agents.</p>
                     <p>Nor does this concluſion by any means ſuppoſe a ſuperiority of the judicial to the legiſlative power. It only ſuppoſes that the power of the people is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to both; and that where the will of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature declared in its ſtatutes, ſtands in oppoſition to that of the people declared in the conſtitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to regulate their deciſions by the fundamental laws, rather than by thoſe which are not fundamental.</p>
                     <p>This exerciſe of judicial diſcretion in determining between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar inſtance. It not uncommonly happens, that there are two ſtatutes exiſting at one time, claſhing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clauſe or expreſſion. In ſuch a caſe, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation: So far as they can by any fair conſtruction be reconciled to each other; reaſon and law conſpire to dictate that this ſhould be done: Where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of neceſſity to give effect to one, in excluſion of the other. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is that the laſt in order of time ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the firſt. But this is mere rule of conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:021127_0532_0FB24A1BEBF6AF38"/>
not derived from any poſitive law, but from the nature and reaſon of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legiſlative proviſion, but adopted by themſelves, as conſonant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the law. They thought it reaſonable, that between the interfering acts of an <hi>equal</hi> authority, that which was the laſt indication of its will, ſhould have the preference.</p>
                     <p>But in regard to the interfering acts of a ſuperior and ſubordinate authority, of an original and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative power, the nature and reaſon of the thing indicate the converſe of that rule as proper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a ſuperior ought to be prefered to the ſubſequent act of an inferior and ſubordinate authority; and that, accordingly, whenever a particular ſtatute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travenes the conſtitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the former.</p>
                     <p>It can be of no weight to ſay, that the courts on the pretence of a repugnancy, may ſubſtitute their own pleaſure to the conſtitutional intentions of the legiſlature. This might as well happen in the caſe of two contradictory ſtatutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any ſingle ſtatute. The courts muſt declare the ſenſe of the law; and if they ſhould be diſpoſed to exerciſe WILL inſtead of JUDGMENT, the conſequence would equally be the ſubſtitution of their pleaſure to that of the legiſlative body. The obſervation, if it proved any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges diſtinct from that body.</p>
                     <p>If then the courts of juſtice are to be conſidered as the bulwarks of a limited conſtitution againſt legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative encroachments, this conſideration will afford a ſtrong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, ſince nothing will contribute ſo much as this to that independent ſpirit in the judges, which
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:021127_0533_0FB24A1DE95B72B8"/>
muſt be eſſential to the faithful performance of ſo arduous a duty.</p>
                     <p>This independence of the judges is equally requiſite to guard the conſtitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of thoſe ill humours which the arts of deſigning men, or the influence of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conjunctures ſometimes diſſeminate among the people themſelves, and which, though they ſpeedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency in the mean time to occaſion dangerous innovations in the government, and ſerious oppreſſions of the minor party in the community. Though I truſt the friends of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed conſtitution will never concur with its enemies<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Proteſt of the minority of the convention of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Martin's ſpeech, &amp;c.</note> in queſtioning that fundamental principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or aboliſh the eſtabliſhed conſtitution whenever they find it inconſiſtent with their happineſs; yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the repreſentatives of the people, whenever a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their conſtituents incompatible with the proviſions in the exiſting conſtitution, would on that account be juſtifiable in a violation of thoſe proviſions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this ſhape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the repreſentative body. Until the people have by ſome ſolemn and authoritative act annul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed or changed the eſtabliſhed form, it is binding upon themſelves col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, as well as individually; and no preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or even knowledge of their ſentiments, can warrant their repreſentatives in a departure from it, prior to ſuch an act. But it is eaſy to ſee that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the conſtitution, where legiſlative invaſions of it
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:021127_0534_0FB24A1F91C86DE0"/>
had been inſtigated by the major voice of the community.</p>
                     <p>But it is not with a view to infractions of the conſtitution only that the independence of the judges may be an eſſential ſafeguard againſt the effects of occaſional ill humours in the ſociety. Theſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular claſſes of citizens, by unjuſt and partial laws. Here alſo the firmneſs of the judicial magiſtracy is of vaſt importance in miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the ſeverity, and confining the operation of ſuch laws. It not only ſerves to moderate the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate miſchiefs of thoſe which may have been paſſed, but it operates as a check upon the legiſlative body in paſſing them; who, perceiving that obſtacles to the ſucceſs of an iniquitous intention are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the ſcruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled by the very motives of the injuſtice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circumſtance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of. The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more ſtates than one; and though they may have diſpleaſed thoſe whoſe ſiniſter expectations they may have diſappointed, they muſt have commanded the eſteem and applauſe of all the virtuous and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted. Conſiderate men of every deſcription ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts; as no man can be ſure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a ſpirit of injuſtice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. And every man muſt now feel that the inevitable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of ſuch a ſpirit is to ſap the foundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its ſtead, univerſal diſtruſt and diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the conſtitution and of individuals, which we perceive to be indiſpenſable in the courts of
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:021127_0535_0FB24A235A240FF8"/>
juſtice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commiſſion. Perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical appointments, however regulated, or by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever made, would in ſome way or other be fatal to their neceſſary independence. If the power of making them was committed either to the executive or legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, there would be danger of an improper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to the branch which poſſeſſed it; if to both, there would be an unwillingneſs to hazard the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of either; if to the people, or to perſons choſen by them for the ſpecial purpoſe, there would be too great a diſpoſition to conſult popularity, to juſtify a reliance that nothing would be conſulted but the conſtitution and the laws.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a further and a weighty reaſon for the permanency of the judicial offices; which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniencies neceſſarily connected with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a free government. To avoid an arbitrary diſcretion in the courts, it is indiſpenſable that they ſhould be bound down by ſtrict rules and precedents, which ſerve to define and point out their duty in every particular caſe that comes before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which grow out of the folly and wickedneſs of mankind, that the records of thoſe precedents muſt unavoidably ſwell to a very conſiderable bulk, and muſt demand long and laborious ſtudy to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Hence it is that there can be but few men in the ſociety, who will have ſufficient ſkill in the laws to qualify them for the ſtations of judges. And making the proper deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number muſt be ſtill ſmaller of thoſe who unite the requiſite integrity with the requiſite knowledge. Theſe conſiderations appriſe us, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can have no great option between fit cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:021127_0536_0FB24A2428700530"/>
and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally diſcourage ſuch characters from quiting a lucrative line of practice to accept a ſeat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw the adminiſtration of juſtice into hands leſs able, and leſs well qualified to conduct it with utility and dignity. In the preſent circumſtances of this country, and in thoſe in which it is likely to be for a long time to come, the diſadvantages on this ſcore would be greater than they may at firſt fight appear; but it muſt be confeſſed that they are far inferior to thoſe which preſent themſelves under the other aſpects of the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wiſely in copying from the models of thoſe conſtitutions which have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed <hi>good behaviour</hi> as the tenure of their judicial offices in point of duration; and that ſo far from being blameable on this account, their plan would have been inexcuſeably defective if it had wanted this important feature of good government. The experience of Great Britain affords an illuſtrious comment on the excellence of the inſtitution.</p>

It will readily be underſtood, that the fluctuations in the value of money, and in the ſtate of ſociety, rendered a fixed rate of compenſation in the conſtitution inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible. What might be extravagant to day, might in half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore neceſſary to leave it to the diſcretion of the legiſlature to vary its proviſions in conformity to the variations in circumſtances; yet under ſuch reſtrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the worſe. A man may then be ſure of the ground upon which he ſtands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehenſion of being placed in a leſs eligible ſituation. The clauſe which has been quoted combines both advantages. The ſalaries of judicial offices may from time to time be altered, as occaſion
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:021127_0538_0FB24A315BCFDF80"/>
ſhall require, yet ſo as never to leſſen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in reſpect to him. It will be obſerved that a difference has been made by the convention between the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the preſident and of the judges. That of the former can neither be increaſed nor diminiſhed. That of the latter can only not be diminiſhed. This probably aroſe from the difference in the duration of the reſpective offices. As the preſident is to be elected for no more than four years, it can rarely happen that an adequate ſalary, fixed at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of that period, will not continue to be ſuch to the end of it. But with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will be ſecured in their places for life, it may well happen, eſpecially in the early ſtages of the government, that a ſtipend, which would be very ſufficient at their firſt appointment, would become too ſmall in the progreſs of their ſervice.</p>
                     <p>This proviſion for the ſupport of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be ſafely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better proſpect of their independence than is diſcoverable in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of any of the ſtates, in regard to their own judges.</p>
                     <p>The precautions for their reſponſibility are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the article reſpecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached for mal-conduct by the houſe of repreſentatives, and tried by the ſenate, and if convicted, may be diſmiſſed from office and diſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for holding any other. This is the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion on the point, which is conſiſtent with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary independence of the judicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own conſtitution in reſpect to our own judges.</p>
                     <p>The want of a proviſion for removing the judges on account of inability, has been a ſubject of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. But all conſiderate men will be ſenſible that
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:021127_0539_0FB24A33F9EB5CB0"/>
ſuch a proviſion would either not be practiſed upon, or would be more liable to abuſe than calculated to anſwer any good purpoſe. The menſuration of the faculties of the mind has, I believe, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would much oftener give ſcope to perſonal and party attachments and enmities, than advance the intereſts of juſtice, or the public good. The reſult, except in the caſe of inſanity, muſt for the moſt part be arbitrary; and inſanity without any formal or expreſs proviſion, may be ſafely pronounced to be a virtual diſqualification.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution of New-York, to avoid inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that muſt forever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the criterion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability. No man can be a judge beyond ſixty. I believe there are few at preſent, who do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of this proviſion. There is no ſtation in relation to which it is leſs proper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing faculties generally preſerve their ſtrength much beyond that period, in men who ſurvive it; and when in addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this circumſtance, we conſider how few there are who outlive the ſeaſon of intellectual vigour, and how improbable it is that any conſiderable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bench, whether more or leſs numerous, ſhould be in ſuch a ſituation at the ſame time, we ſhall be ready to conclude that limitations of this ſort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where fortunes are not affluent, and penſions not expedient, the diſmiſſion of men from ſtations in which they have ſerved their country long and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, on which they depend for ſubſiſtence, and from which it will be too late to reſort to any other occupation for a livelihood, ought to have ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apology to humanity, than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a ſuperannuated bench.</p>

                     <head>NUMBER LXXX. A further View of the Judicial Department, in Relation to the Extent of its Powers.</head>
                     <p>TO judge with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature, it will be neceſſary to conſider in the firſt place what are its proper objects.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems ſcarcely to admit of controverſy that the judiciary authority of the union ought to extend to theſe ſeveral deſcriptions of cauſes. 1ſt. To all thoſe which ariſe out of the laws of the United States, paſſed in purſuance of their juſt and conſtitutional powers of legiſlation; 2d. to all thoſe which concern the execution of the proviſions expreſsly contained in the articles of union; 3d. to all thoſe in which the United States are a party; 4th. to all thoſe which involve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY, whether they relate to the intercourſe between the United States and foreign nations, or to that between the States themſelves; 5th. to all thoſe which originate on the high ſeas, and are of admiralty or maritime juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and laſtly, to all thoſe in which the ſtate tribunals cannot be ſuppoſed to be impartial and unbiaſſed.</p>
                     <p>The firſt point depends upon this obvious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that there ought always to be a conſtitutional method of giving efficacy to conſtitutional proviſions. What for inſtance would avail reſtrictions on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſtate legiſlatures, without ſome conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional mode of enforcing the obſervance of them? The ſtates, by the plan of the convention are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited from doing a variety of things; ſome of which are incompatible with the intereſts of the union, and others with the principles of good government. The impoſition of duties on imported articles, and the emiſſion of paper money, are ſpecimens of each kind. No man of ſenſe will believe that ſuch prohibitions
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:021127_0541_0FB24A36FA8F93C0"/>
would be ſcrupulouſly regarded, without ſome effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power in the government to reſtrain or correct the infractions of them. This power muſt either be a direct negative on the ſtate laws, or an authority in the federal courts, to over-rule ſuch as might be in manifeſt contravention of the articles of union. There is no third courſe that I can imagine. The latter appears to have been thought by the convention pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the former, and I preſume will be moſt agreeable to the ſtates.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond point, it is impoſſible by any argument or comment to make it clearer than it is in itſelf. If there are ſuch things as political axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government being co-extenſive with its legiſlative, may be ranked among the number. The mere neceſſity of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the interpretation of the national laws, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the queſtion. Thirteen independent courts of final juriſdiction over the ſame cauſes, ariſing upon the ſame laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confuſion can proceed.</p>
                     <p>Still leſs need be ſaid in regard to the third point. Controverſies between the nation and its members or citizens, can only be properly referred to the national tribunals. Any other plan would be contrary to reaſon, to precedent, and to decorum.</p>
                     <p>The fourth point reſts on this plain propoſition, that the peace of the WHOLE ought not to be left at the diſpoſal of a PART. The union will undoubtedly be anſwerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members. And the reſponſibility for an injury ought ever to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it. As the denial or perverſion of juſtice by the ſentences of courts, as well as in any other manner, is with reaſon claſſed among the juſt cauſes of war, it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all cauſes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned. This is not leſs eſſential to the preſervation of the public faith, than to the
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:021127_0542_0FB24A3868EF8DA0"/>
ſecurity of the public tranquility. A diſtinction may perhaps be imagined between caſes ariſing upon treaties and the laws of nations, and thoſe which may ſtand merely on the footing of the municipal law. The former kind may be ſuppoſed proper for the federal juriſdiction, the latter for that of the ſtates. But it is at leaſt problematical whether an unjuſt ſentence againſt a foreigner, where the ſubject of controverſy was wholly relative to the <hi>lex loci,</hi> would not, if unredreſſed, be an aggreſſion upon his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, as well as one which violated the ſtipulations in a treaty or the general laws of nations. And a ſtill greater objection to the diſtinction would reſult from the immenſe difficulty, if not impoſſibility, of a practical diſcrimination between the caſes of one complection and thoſe of the other. So great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the caſes in which foreigners are parties involve national queſtions, that it is by far moſt ſafe and moſt expedient to refer all thoſe in which they are concerned to the national tribunals.</p>
                     <p>The power of determining cauſes between two ſtates, between one ſtate and the citizens of another, and between the citizens of different ſtates, is perhaps not leſs eſſential to the peace of the union than that which has been juſt examined. Hiſtory gives us a horrid picture of the diſſentions and private wars which diſtracted and deſolated Germany prior to the inſtitution of the IMPERIAL CHAMBER by Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian, towards the cloſe of the fifteenth century; and informs us at the ſame time of the vaſt influence of that inſtitution in appeaſing the diſorders and eſtabliſhing the tranquillity of the empire. This was a court inveſted with authority to decide finally all differences between the members of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manic body.</p>
                     <p>A method of terminating territorial diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtates, under the authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even in the imperfect ſyſtem by which they have been hitherto held to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:021127_0543_0FB24A39F138DC50"/>
But there are many other ſources, beſides interfering claims of boundary, from which bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and animoſities may ſpring up among the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the union. To ſome of theſe we have been witneſſes in the courſe of our paſt experience. It will readily be conjectured that I allude to the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent laws which have been paſſed in too many of the ſtates. And though the propoſed conſtitution eſtabliſhes particular guards againſt the repetition of thoſe inſtances which have heretofore made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the ſpirit which produced them will aſſume new ſhapes that could not be foreſeen, nor ſpecifically provided againſt. Whatever practices may have a tendency to diſturb the harmony between the ſtates, are proper objects of federal ſuperintendence and control.</p>
                     <p>It may be eſteemed the baſis of the union, that
<q>the citizens of each ſtate ſhall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the ſeveral ſtates.</q>
And if it be a juſt principle that every government <hi>ought to poſſeſs the means of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting its own proviſions by its own authority,</hi> it will follow, that in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought to preſide in all caſes in which one ſtate or its citizens are oppoſed to another ſtate or its citizens. To ſecure the full effect of ſo fundamental a proviſion againſt all evaſion and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge, it is neceſſary that its conſtruction ſhould be committed to that tribunal, which, having no local attachments, will be likely to be impartial between the different ſtates and their citizens, and which, owing its official exiſtence to the union, will never be likely to feel any bias inauſpicious to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which it is founded.</p>
                     <p>The fifth point will demand little animadverſion. The moſt bigotted idolizers of ſtate authority have not thus far ſhewn a diſpoſition to deny the national
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:021127_0544_0FB24A3C7AB488B0"/>
judiciary the cognizance of maritime cauſes. Theſe ſo generally depend on the laws of nations, and ſo commonly affect the rights of foreigners, that they fall within the conſideration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which are relative to the public peace. The moſt important part of them are by the preſent confederation ſubmitted to federal juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>The reaſonableneſs of the agency of the national courts in caſes in which the ſtate tribunals cannot be ſuppoſed to be impartial, ſpeaks for itſelf. No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cauſe, or in any cauſe in reſpect to which he has the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or bias. This principle has no inconſiderable weight in deſignating the federal courts as the proper tribunals for the determination of controverſies between different ſtates and their citizens. And it ought to have the ſame operation in regard to ſome caſes between the citizens of the ſame ſtate. Claims to land under grants of different ſtates, founded upon adverſe pretenſions of boundary, are of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The courts of neither of the granting ſtates could be expected to be unbiaſſed. The laws may have even prejudged the queſtion, and tied the courts down to deciſions in favour of the grants of the ſtate to which they belonged. And even where this had not been done, it would be natural that the judges, as men, ſhould feel a ſtrong predilection to the claims of their own government.</p>
                     <p>Having thus laid down and diſcuſſed the principles which ought to regulate the conſtitution of the federal judiciary, we will proceed to teſt, by theſe principles, the particular powers of which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the plan of the convention, it is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. It is to comprehend,
<q>all caſes in law and equity ariſing under the conſtitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which ſhall be made under their authority; to all caſes affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls; to all caſes of admiralty and maritime
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:021127_0545_0FB24A3F2663D1E0"/>
juriſdiction; to controverſies to which the United States ſhall be a party; to controverſies between two or more ſtates, between a ſtate and citizens of another ſtate, between citizens of different ſtates, between citizens of the ſame ſtate claiming lands under grants of different ſtates, and between a ſtate or the citizens thereof, and foreign ſtates, citizens and ſubjects.</q>
This conſtitutes the entire maſs of the judicial authority of the union. Let us now review it in detail. It is then to extend,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> To all caſes in law and equity <hi>ariſing under the conſtitution</hi> and <hi>the laws of the United States.</hi> This correſponds to the two firſt claſſes of cauſes which have been enumerated as proper for the juriſdiction of the United States. It has been aſked what is meant by "caſes ariſing under the conſtitution," in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction from thoſe
<q>ariſing under the laws of the United States.</q>
The difference has been already explained. All the reſtrictions upon the authority of the ſtate legiſlatures, furniſh examples of it. They are not, for inſtance, to emit paper money; but the interdiction reſults from the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should paper money, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, be emitted, the controverſies concerning it would be caſes ariſing upon the conſtitution, and not upon the laws of the United States, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſignification of the terms. This may ſerve as a ſample of the whole.</p>
                     <p>It has alſo been aſked, what need of the word "equity"? What equitable cauſes can grow out of the conſtitution and laws of the United States? There is hardly a ſubject of litigation between indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. which may not involve thoſe ingredients of <hi>fraud, accident, truſt</hi> or <hi>hardſhip,</hi> which would render the matter an object of equitable, rather than of legal juriſdiction, as the diſtinction is known and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in ſeveral of the ſtates. It is the peculiar province, for inſtance, of a court of equity to relieve
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:021127_0546_0FB24A4290F17A88"/>
againſt what are called hard bargains: Theſe are contracts, in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit, ſufficient to invalidate them in a court of law; yet there may have been ſome undue and unconſcionable advantage taken of the neceſſities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of equity would not tolerate. In ſuch caſes, where foreigners were concerned on either ſide, it would be impoſſible for the federal judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories to do juſtice without an equitable, as well as a legal juriſdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of different ſtates, may afford another example of the neceſſity of an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table juriſdiction in the federal courts. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning may not be ſo palpable in thoſe ſtates where the formal and technical diſtinction between LAW and EQUITY is not maintained as in this ſtate, where it is exemplified by every day's practice.</p>
                     <p>The judiciary authority of the union is to extend—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second.</hi> To treaties made, or which ſhall be made under the authority of the United States, and to all caſes affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls. Theſe belong to the fourth claſs of the enumerated caſes, as they have an evident connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the preſervation of the national peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Third.</hi> To caſes of admiralty and maritime juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Theſe form altogether the fifth of the enumerated claſſes of cauſes proper for the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the national courts.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixth.</hi> To caſes between the citizens of the ſame ſtate, <hi>claiming lands under grants of different ſtates.</hi>
                        <pb n="310" facs="unknown:021127_0547_0FB24A44667E8DA0"/>
Theſe fall within the laſt claſs, and <hi>are the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which the propoſed conſtitution directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates the cognizance of diſputes between the citizens of the ſame ſtate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventh.</hi> To caſes between a ſtate and the citizens thereof, and foreign ſtates, citizens, or ſubjects. Theſe have been already explained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated claſſes, and have been ſhewn to be in a peculiar manner the proper ſubjects of the national judicature.</p>
                     <p>From this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the conſtitution, it appears, that they are all conformable to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which ought to have governed the ſtructure of that department, and which were neceſſary to the perfection of the ſyſtem. If ſome partial inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies ſhould appear to be connected with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legiſlature will have ample authority to make ſuch <hi>exceptions</hi> and to preſcribe ſuch regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove theſe inconveniencies. The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of particular miſchiefs can never be viewed by a well-informed mind as a ſolid objection to a general principle, which is calculated to avoid ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral miſchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>LET us now return to the partition of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The judicial power of the United States is (by the plan of the convention) to be veſted in one ſupreme court, and in ſuch inferior courts as the
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:021127_0548_0FB24A487B31E288"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>That there ought to be one court of ſupreme and final juriſdiction is a propoſition which has not been, and is not likely to be conteſted. The reaſons for it have been aſſigned in another place, and are too obvious to need repetition. The only queſtion that ſeems to have been raiſed concerning it, is whether it ought to be a diſtinct body, or a branch of the legiſlature. The ſame contradiction is obſervable in regard to this matter, which has been remarked in ſeveral other caſes. The very men who object to the ſenate as a court of impeachments, on the ground of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper intermixture of powers, advocate, by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at leaſt, the propriety of veſting the ultimate deciſion of all cauſes in the whole, or in a part of the legiſlative body.</p>
                     <p>The arguments or rather ſuggeſtions, upon which this charge is founded, are to this effect:
<q>The authority of the propoſed ſupreme court of the United States, which is to be a ſeparate and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent body, will be ſuperior to that of the legiſlature. The power of conſtruing the laws, according to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the conſtitution, will enable that court to mould them into whatever ſhape it may think proper; eſpecially as its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions will not be in any manner ſubject to the reviſion or correction of the legiſlative body. This is as unprecedented as it is dangerous. In Britain, the judicial power in the laſt reſort, reſides in the houſe of lords, which is a branch of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; and this part of the Britiſh government has been imitated in the ſtate conſtitutions in general. The parliament of Great-Britain, and the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, can at any time rectify by law, the exceptionable deciſions of their reſpective courts. But the errors and uſurpations of the ſupreme court of the United
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:021127_0549_0FB24A4D0705D230"/>
States will be uncontrolable and remedileſs.</q>
This, upon examination, will be found to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether made up of falſe reaſoning upon miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived fact.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, there is not a ſyllable in the plan under conſideration, which <hi>directly</hi> empowers the national courts to conſtrue the laws according to the ſpirit of the conſtitution, or which gives them any greater latitude in this reſpect, than may be claimed by the courts of every ſtate. I admit however, that the conſtitution ought to be the ſtandard of conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the laws, and that wherever there is an evident oppoſition, the laws ought to give place to the conſtitution. But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumſtance peculiar to the plan of the convention; but from the general theory of a limited conſtitution; and as far as it is true, is equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to moſt, if not to all the ſtate governments. There can be no objection therefore, on this account, to the federal judicature, which will not lie againſt the local judicatures in general, and which will not ſerve to condemn every conſtitution that attempts to ſet bounds to the legiſlative diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to conſiſt in the particular organization of the propoſed ſupreme court; in its being compoſed of a diſtinct body of magiſtrates, inſtead of being one of the branches of the legiſlature, as in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great-Britain and in that of this ſtate. To inſiſt upon this point, the authors of the objection muſt renounce the meaning they have laboured to annex to the celebrated maxim requiring a ſeparation of the departments of power. It ſhall nevertheleſs be conceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the courſe of theſe papers, that it is not violated by veſting the ultimate power of judging in a <hi>part</hi> of the legiſlative body. But though this be not an abſolute violation of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rule; yet it verges ſo nearly upon it, as on this
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:021127_0550_0FB24A5065DF4448"/>
account alone to be leſs eligible than the mode preferred by the convention. From a body which had had even a partial agency in paſſing bad laws, we could rarely expect a diſpoſition to temper and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them in the application. The ſame ſpirit, which had operated in making them, would be too apt to operate in interpreting them: Still leſs could it be expected, that men who had infringed the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the character of legiſlators, would be diſpoſed to repair the breach, in the character of judges. Nor is this all:—Every reaſon, which recommends the tenure of good behaviour for judicial offices, militates againſt placing the judiciary power in the laſt reſort in a body compoſed of men choſen for a limited pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. There is an abſurdity in referring the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of cauſes in the firſt inſtance to judges of permanent ſtanding, and in the laſt to thoſe of a temporary and mutable conſtitution. And there is a ſtill greater abſurdity in ſubjecting the deciſions of men ſelected for their knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious ſtudy, to the reviſion and control of men, who for want of the ſame advantage cannot but be deficient in that knowledge. The members of the legiſlature will rarely be choſen with a view to thoſe qualifications which fit men for the ſtations of judges; and as on this account there will be great reaſon to apprehend all the ill conſequences of defective information; ſo on account of the natural propenſity of ſuch bodies to party diviſions, there will be no leſs reaſon to fear, that the peſtilential breath of faction may poiſon the fountains of juſtice. The habit of being continually marſhalled on oppoſite ſides, will be too apt to ſtifle the voice both of law and of equity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations teach us to applaud the wiſdom of thoſe ſtates, who have committed the judicial power in the laſt reſort, not to a part of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, but to diſtinct and independent bodies of men. Contrary to the ſuppoſition of thoſe, who have repreſented the plan of the convention in this
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:021127_0551_0FB24A512CCC52A0"/>
reſpect as novel and unprecedented, it is but a copy of the conſtitutions of New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts, Pennſylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which has been given to theſe models is highly to be commended.</p>
                     <p>It is not true, in the ſecond place, that the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great Britain, or the legiſlatures of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtates, can rectify the exceptionable deciſions of their reſpective courts, in any other ſenſe than might be done by a future legiſlature of the United States. The theory neither of the Britiſh, nor the ſtate conſtitutions, authoriſes the reviſal of a judicial ſentence, by a legiſlative act. Nor is there any thing in the propoſed conſtitution more than in either of them, by which it is forbidden. In the former as well as in the latter, the impropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and reaſon, is the ſole obſtacle. A legiſlature without exceeding its province cannot reverſe a determination once made, in a particular caſe; though it may preſcribe a new rule for future caſes. This is the principle, and it applies in all its conſequences, exactly in the ſame manner and extent, to the ſtate governments, as to the national government, now under conſideration. Not the leaſt difference can be pointed out in any view of the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>It may in the laſt place be obſerved that the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative authority, which has been upon many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular miſconſtructions and contraventions of the will of the legiſlature may now and then happen; but they can never be ſo extenſive as to amount to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, or in any ſenſible degree to affect the order of the political ſyſtem. This may be inferred with certainty from the general nature of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial power; from the objects to which it relates; from the manner in which it is exerciſed; from its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:021127_0552_0FB24A52AE14C4A8"/>
weakneſs, and from its total incapacity to ſupport its uſurpations by force. And the inference is greatly fortified by the conſideration of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſtitutional check, which the power of inſtituting impeachments, in one part of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative body, and of determining upon them in the other, would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department. This is alone a complete ſecurity. There never can be danger that the judges, by a ſeries of deliberate uſurpations on the authority of the legiſlature, would hazard the united reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body entruſted with it, while this body was poſſeſſed of the means of puniſhing their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption by degrading them from their ſtations. While this ought to remove all apprehenſions on the ſubject, it affords at the ſame time a cogent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for conſtituting the ſenate a court for the trial of impeachments.</p>
                     <p>Having now examined, and I truſt removed the objections to the diſtinct and independent organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſupreme court, I proceed to conſider the propriety of the power of conſtituting inferior courts,<note n="*" place="bottom">This power has been abſurdly repreſented as intended to aboliſh all the county courts in the ſeveral ſtates, which are commonly called inferior courts. But the expreſſions of the conſtitution are to conſtitute
<q>tribunals INFERIOR TO THE SUPREME COURT,</q>
and the evident deſign of the proviſion is to enable the inſtitution of local courts ſubordinate to the ſupreme, either in ſtates or larger diſtricts. It is ridiculous to imagine that county courts were in contemplation.</note> and the relations which will ſubſiſt between theſe and the former.</p>
                     <p>The power of conſtituting inferior courts is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently calculated to obviate the neceſſity of having recourſe to the ſupreme court, in every caſe of federal cognizance. It is intended to enable the national government to inſtitute or <hi>authoriſe</hi> in each ſtate or diſtrict of the United States, a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of national juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within its limits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="unknown:021127_0553_0FB24A542AFB95F8"/>But why, it is aſked, might not the ſame purpoſe have been accompliſhed by the inſtrumentality of the ſtate courts? This admits of different anſwers. Though the fitneſs and competency of thoſe courts ſhould be allowed in the utmoſt latitude; yet the ſubſtance of the power in queſtion, may ſtill be regarded as a neceſſary part of the plan, if it were only to empower the national legiſlature to commit to them the cognizance of cauſes ariſing out of the national conſtitution. To confer the power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ſuch cauſes upon the exiſting courts of the ſeveral ſtates, would perhaps be as much
<q>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute tribunals,</q>
as to create new courts with the like power. But ought not a more direct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit proviſion to have been made in favour of the ſtate courts? There are, in my opinion, ſubſtantial reaſons againſt ſuch a proviſion: The moſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot foreſee how far the prevalency of a local ſpirit may be found to diſqualify the local tribunals for the juriſdiction of national cauſes; whilſt every man may diſcover that courts conſtituted like thoſe of ſome of the ſtates, would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the union. State judges, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their offices during pleaſure, or from year to year, will be too little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the national laws. And if there was a neceſſity for confiding the original cognizance of cauſes ariſing under thoſe laws to them, there would be a correſpondent neceſſity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as poſſible. In proportion to the grounds of confidence in, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the ſubordinate tribunals, ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals. And well ſatisfied as I am of the propriety of the appellate juriſdiction in the ſeveral claſſes of cauſes to which it is extended by the plan of the convention, I ſhould conſider every thing calculated to give in practice, an <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained courſe</hi> to appeals as a ſource of public and private inconvenience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="317" facs="unknown:021127_0554_0FB24A563466C798"/>I am not ſure but that it will be found highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient and uſeful to divide the United States into four or five, or half a dozen diſtricts; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a federal court in each diſtrict, in lieu of one in every ſtate. The judges of theſe courts, with the aid of the ſtate judges, may hold circuits for the trial of cauſes in the ſeveral parts of the reſpective diſtricts. Juſtice through them may be adminiſtered with eaſe and diſpatch; and appeals may be ſafely circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within a very narrow compaſs. This plan appears to me at preſent the moſt eligible of any that could be adopted, and in order to it, it is neceſſary that the power of conſtituting inferior courts ſhould exiſt in the full extent in which it is to be found in the propoſed conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reaſons ſeem ſufficient to ſatisfy a candid mind, that the want of ſuch a power would have been a great defect in the plan. Let us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted between the ſupreme and the inferior courts of the union.</p>
                     <p>The ſupreme court is to be inveſted with original juriſdiction, only
<q>in caſes affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls, and thoſe in which A STATE ſhall be a party.</q>
Public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of every claſs, are the immediate repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of their ſovereigns. All queſtions in which they are concerned, are ſo directly connected with the public peace, that as well for the preſervation of this, as out of reſpect to the ſovereignties they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, it is both expedient and proper, that ſuch queſtions ſhould be ſubmitted in the firſt inſtance to the higheſt judicatory of the nation. Though conſuls have not in ſtrictneſs a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they belong, the ſame obſervation is in a great meaſure applicable to them. In caſes in which a ſtate might happen to be a party, it would ill ſuit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="318" facs="unknown:021127_0555_0FB24A5B45E2F540"/>Though it may rather be a digreſſion from the immediate ſubject of this paper, I ſhall take occaſion to mention here, a ſuppoſition which has excited ſome alarm upon very miſtaken grounds: It has been ſuggeſted that an aſſignment of the public ſecurities of one ſtate to the citizens of another, would enable them to proſecute that ſtate in the federal courts for the amount of thoſe ſecurities. A ſuggeſtion which the following conſiderations prove to be without foundation.</p>
                     <p>It is inherent in the nature of ſovereignty, not to be amenable to the ſuit of an individual <hi>without its conſent.</hi> This is the general ſenſe and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of ſovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every ſtate in the union. Unleſs therefore, there is a ſurrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the ſtates, and the danger intimated muſt be merely ideal. The circumſtances which are neceſſary to produce an alienation of ſtate ſovereignty, were diſcuſſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the article of taxation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there eſtabliſhed will ſatisfy us, that there is no colour to pretend that the ſtate governments, would by the adoption of that plan, be diveſted of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every conſtraint but that which flows from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of good faith. The contracts between a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and individuals are only binding on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the ſovereign, and have no pretenſions to a compulſive force. They confer no right of action independent of the ſovereign will. To what purpoſe would it be to authoriſe ſuits againſt ſtates, for the debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident that it could not be done without waging war againſt the contracting ſtate; and to aſcribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a pre-exiſting right of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:021127_0556_0FB24A5F373C9C18"/>
a power which would involve ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, would be altogether forced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable.</p>
                     <p>Let us reſume the train of our obſervations; we have ſeen that the original juriſdiction of the ſupreme court would be confined to two claſſes of cauſes, and thoſe of a nature rarely to occur. In all other cauſes of federal cognizance, the original juriſdiction would appertain to the inferior tribunals, and the ſupreme court would have nothing more than an appellate juriſdiction,
<q>with ſuch <hi>exceptions,</hi> and under ſuch <hi>regulations</hi> as the congreſs ſhall make.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The propriety of this appellate juriſdiction has been ſcarcely called in queſtion in regard to matters of law; but the clamours have been loud againſt it as applied to matters of fact. Some well intentioned men in this ſtate, deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to conſider it as an implied ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedure of the trial by jury, in favour of the civil law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, probates and chancery. A technical ſenſe has been affixed to the term "appellate", which in our law parlance is commonly uſed in reference to appeals in the courſe of the civil law. But if I am not miſinformed, the ſame meaning would not be given to it in any part of New-England. There an appeal from one jury to another is familiar both in language and practice, and is even a matter of courſe, until there have been two verdicts on one ſide. The word "appellate" therefore will not be underſtood in the ſame ſenſe in New-England as in New-York, which ſhews the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the juriſprudence of any particular ſtate. The expreſſion taken in the abſtract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or both. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient cuſtom or legiſlative proviſion, (in a new
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:021127_0557_0FB24A60F1BDFE58"/>
government it muſt depend on the latter) and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may be judged adviſeable. If therefore the re-examination of a fact, once determined by a jury, ſhould in any caſe be admitted under the propoſed conſtitution, it may be ſo regulated as to be done by a ſecond jury, either by remanding the cauſe to the court below for a ſecond trial of the fact, or by directing an iſſue immediately out of the ſupreme court.</p>
                     <p>But it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once aſcertained by a jury, will be permitted in the ſupreme court. Why may it not be ſaid, with the ſtricteſt propriety, when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a ſuperior court of law in this ſtate, that the latter has juriſdiction of the fact, as well as the law? It is true it cannot inſtitute a new enquiry concerning the fact, but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record, and pronounces the law ariſing upon it.<note n="*" place="bottom">This word is a compound of JUS and DICTIO, juris, dictio, or a ſpeaking or pronouncing of the law.</note> This is juriſdiction of both fact and law, nor is it even poſſible to ſeparate them. Though the common law courts of this ſtate aſcertain diſputed facts by a jury, yet they unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably have juriſdiction of both fact and law; and accordingly, when the former is agreed in the pleadings, they have no recourſe to a jury, but proceed at once to judgment. I contend therefore on this ground, that the expreſſions,
<q>appellate juriſdiction, both as to law and fact,</q>
do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily imply a re-examination in the ſupreme court of facts decided by juries in the inferior courts.</p>
                     <p>The following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the convention in relation to this particular proviſion. The appellate juriſdiction of the ſupreme court (may it have been argued) will extend to cauſes determinable in different modes, ſome in the courſe of the COMMON LAW, and others in the courſe of the CIVIL LAW. In the former,
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:021127_0558_0FB24A627021DE70"/>
the reviſion of the law only, will be, generally ſpeaking, the proper province of the ſupreme court; in the latter, the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to uſage, and in ſome caſes, of which prize cauſes are an example, might be eſſential to the preſervation of the public peace. It is therefore neceſſary, that the appellate juriſdiction ſhould, in certain caſes, extend in the broadeſt ſenſe to matters of fact. It will not anſwer to make an expreſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of caſes, which ſhall have been originally tried by a jury, becauſe in the courts of ſome of the ſtates, <hi>all cauſes</hi> are tried in this mode;<note n="*" place="bottom">I hold that the ſtates will have concurrent juriſdiction with the ſubordinate federal judicatories, in many caſes of federal cognizance, as will be explained in my next paper.</note> and ſuch an exception would preclude the reviſion of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper, as where it might be improper. To avoid all inconveniencies, it will be ſafeſt to declare generally, that the ſupreme court ſhall poſſeſs appellate juriſdiction, both as to law and <hi>fact,</hi> and that this juriſdiction ſhall be ſubject to ſuch <hi>exceptions</hi> and regulations as the national legiſlature may preſcribe. This will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the government to modify it in ſuch a manner as will beſt anſwer the ends of public juſtice and ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>This view of the matter, at any rate puts it out of all doubt that the ſuppoſed <hi>abolition</hi> of the trial by jury, by the operation of this proviſion, is, fallacious and untrue. The legiſlature of the United States would certainly have full power to provide that in appeals to the ſupreme court there ſhould be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in the original cauſes by juries. This would certainly be an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed exception; but if for the reaſon already inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated it ſhould be thought too extenſive, it might be qualified with a limitation to ſuch cauſes only as are determinable at common law in that mode of trial.</p>

                        <pb n="323" facs="unknown:021127_0560_0FB24A656A6F1150"/>Such queſtions accordingly have ariſen upon the plan propoſed by the convention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and particularly concerning the judiciary department. The principal of theſe reſpect the ſituation of the ſtate courts in regard to thoſe cauſes, which are to be ſubmitted to federal juriſdiction. Is this to be excluſive, or are thoſe courts to poſſeſs a concurrent juriſdiction? If the latter, in what relation will they ſtand to the national tribunals? Theſe are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of ſenſe, and which are certainly intitled to attention.</p>
                     <p>The principles eſtabliſhed in a former paper<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. 1. No. XXXII.</note> teach us, that the ſtates will retain all <hi>pre-exiſting</hi> authorities, which may not be excluſively delegated to the federal head; and that this excluſive delegation can only exiſt in one of three caſes; where an excluſive autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is in expreſs terms granted to the union; or where a particular authority is granted to the union, and the exerciſe of a like authority is prohibited to the ſtates, or where an authority is granted to the union with which a ſimilar authority in the ſtates would be utterly incompatible. Though theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may not apply with the ſame force to the judiciary as to the legiſlative power; yet I am inclined to think that they are in the main juſt with reſpect to the former as well as the latter. And under this impreſſion I ſhall lay it down as a rule that the ſtate courts will <hi>retain</hi> the juriſdiction they now have, unleſs it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes.</p>
                     <p>They only thing in the propoſed conſtitution, which wears the appearance of confining the cauſes of federal cognizance to the federal courts is contained in this paſſage—
<q>The JUDICIAL POWER of the United States <hi>ſhall be veſted</hi> in one ſupreme court, and in <hi>ſuch</hi> inferior courts as the congreſs ſhall from time to time ordain and eſtabliſh</q>
—This might either be conſtrued to ſignify, that the ſupreme and
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:021127_0561_0FB24A677347F9B8"/>
ſubordinate courts of the union ſhould alone have the power of deciding thoſe cauſes, to which their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to extend; or ſimply to denote that the organs of the national judiciary ſhould be one ſupreme court and as many ſubordinate courts as congreſs ſhould think proper to appoint, or in other words, that the United States ſhould exerciſe the judicial power with which they are to be inveſted through one ſupreme tribunal and a certain, number of inferior ones to be inſtituted by them. The firſt excludes, the laſt admits the concurrent juriſdiction of the ſtate tribunals: And as the firſt would amount to an alienation of ſtate power by implication, the laſt appears to me the moſt natural and the moſt defenſible conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>But this doctrine of concurrent juriſdiction is only clearly applicable to thoſe deſcriptions of cauſes of which the ſtate courts have previous cognizance. It is not equally evident in relation to caſes which may grow out of, and be <hi>peculiar</hi> to the conſtitution to be eſtabliſhed: For not to allow the ſtate courts a right of juriſdiction in ſuch caſes can hardly be conſidered as the abridgement of a pre-exiſting authority. I mean not therefore to contend that the United States in the courſe of legiſlation upon the objects entruſted to their direction may not commit the deciſion of cauſes ariſing upon a particular regulation to the federal courts ſolely, if ſuch a meaſure ſhould be deemed expedient; but I hold that the ſtate courts will be diveſted of no part of their primitive juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion, that in every caſe in which they were not expreſsly excluded by the future acts of the national legiſlature, they will of courſe take cognizance of the cauſes to which thoſe acts may give birth. This I infer from the nature of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary power, and from the general genius of the ſyſtem. The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:021127_0562_0FB24A692C4705A0"/>
civil caſes lays hold of all ſubjects of litigation between parties within its juriſdiction though the cauſes of diſpute are relative to the laws of the moſt diſtant part of the globe. Thoſe of Japan not leſs than of New-York may furniſh the objects of legal diſcuſſion to our courts. When in addition to this, we conſider the ſtate governments and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional governments as they truly are, in the light of kindred ſyſtems and as parts of ONE WHOLE, the inference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeems to be concluſive that the ſtate courts would have a concurrent juriſdiction in all caſes ariſing under the laws of the union, where it was not expreſsly prohibited.</p>
                     <p>Here another queſtion occurs—what relation would ſubſiſt between the national and ſtate courts in theſe inſtances of concurrent juriſdiction? I anſwer that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter to the ſupreme court of the United States. The conſtitution in direct terms, gives an appellate juriſdiction to the ſupreme court in all the enumerated caſes of federal cognizance, in which it is not to have an original one; without a ſingle expreſſion to confine its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the inferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. From this circumſtance and from the reaſon of the thing it ought to be conſtrued to extend to the ſtate tribunals. Either this muſt be the caſe, or the local courts muſt be excluded from a concurrent juriſdiction in matters of national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, elſe the judiciary authority of the union may be eluded at the pleaſure of every plantiff or proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor. Neither of theſe conſequences ought without evident neceſſity to be involved; the latter would be intirely inadmiſſible, as it would defeat ſome of the moſt important and avowed purpoſes of the propoſed government, and would eſſentially embarraſs its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Nor do I perceive any foundation for ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Agreeably to the remark already made, the national and ſtate ſyſtems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE. The courts of the latter will of courſe be
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:021127_0563_0FB24A6FDA54A578"/>
natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal, which is deſtined to uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                        </gap>d aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate the principles of national juſtice and the rules of national deciſions. The evident aim of the plan of the convention is that all the cauſes of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified claſſes, ſhall for weighty public reaſons receive their original or final determination in the courts of the union. To confine therefore the general expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions giving appellate juriſdiction to the ſupreme court to appeals from the ſubordinate federal courts, inſtead of allowing their extenſion to the ſtate courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the terms, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the intent, contrary to every ſound rule of interpretation.</p>
                     <p>But could an appeal be made to lie from the ſtate courts to the ſubordinate federal judicatories? This is another of the queſtions which have been raiſed, and of greater difficulty than the former. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations countenance the affirmative. The plan of the convention in the firſt place authoriſes the national legiſlature
<q>to conſtitute tribunals infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the ſupreme court<note n="*" place="bottom">Section 8th. Article 1ſt.</note>
                        </q>
It declares in the next place that,

and it then proceeds to enumerate the caſes to which this judicial power ſhall extend. It afterwards divides the juriſdiction of the ſupreme court into original and appellate, but gives no defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of that of the ſubordinate courts. The only outlines deſcribed for them are that they ſhall be "inferior to the ſupreme court" and that they ſhall not exceed the ſpecified limits of the federal judiciary. Whether their authority ſhall be original or appellate or both is not declared. All this ſeems to be left to the diſcretion of the legiſlature. And this being the caſe, I perceive at preſent no impediment to the eſtabliſhment of an appeal from the ſtate courts
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:021127_0564_0FB24A750B8EF430"/>
to the ſubordinate national tribunals; and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>. It would diminiſh the motives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate juriſdiction of the ſupreme court. The ſtate tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals may then be left with a more entire charge of federal cauſes; and appeals in moſt caſes in which they may be deemed proper inſtead of being carried to the ſupreme court, may be made to lie from the ſtate courts to diſtrict courts of the union.</p>

                     <p>THE objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with moſt ſucceſs in this ſtate, and perhaps in ſeveral of the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>her ſtates, is <hi>that</hi> relative to <hi>the want of a conſtitutional proviſion</hi> for the trial by jury in civil caſes. The diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous form in which this objection is uſually ſtated, has been repeatedly adverted to and expoſed; but continues to be purſued in all the converſations and writings of the opponents of the plan. The mere ſilence of the conſtitution in regard to <hi>civil cauſes,</hi> is repreſented as an abolition of the trial by jury; and the declamations to which it has afforded a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, are artfully calculated to induce a perſuaſion that this pretended abolition is complete and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; extending not only to every ſpecies of civil, but even to <hi>criminal cauſes.</hi> To argue with reſpect to the latter, would, however, be as vain and fruitleſs, as to attempt the ſerious proof of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> or to demonſtrate any of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which by their own internal evidence force
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:021127_0565_0FB24A774C97E850"/>
conviction, when expreſſed in language adapted to convey their meaning.</p>
                     <p>With regard to civil cauſes, ſubtleties almoſt too contemptible for refutation, have been adopted to countenance the ſurmiſe that a thing, which is only <hi>not provided for,</hi> is entirely <hi>aboliſhed.</hi> Every man of diſcernment muſt at once perceive the wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>abolition.</hi> But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to ſupport it by certain <hi>legal maxims</hi> of interpretation, which they have perverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly uſeleſs to explore the ground they have taken.</p>
                     <p>The maxim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> on which they rely are of this nature,
<q>a ſpecification of particulars is an excluſion of generals;</q>
or,
<q>the expreſſion of one thing is the excluſion of another.</q>
Hence, ſay they, as the conſtitution has eſtabliſhed the trial by jury in criminal caſes, and is ſilent in reſpect to civil, this ſilence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter.</p>
                     <p>The rules of legal interpretation are rules of <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> adopted by the courts in the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws. The true teſt therefore, of a juſt application of them, in its conformity to the ſource from which they are derived. This being the caſe, let me aſk if it is conſiſtent with reaſon or common ſenſe to ſuppoſe, that a proviſion obliging the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power to commit the trial of criminal cauſes to juries, is a privation of its right to authoriſe or permit that mode of trial in other caſes? Is it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to ſuppoſe, that a command to do one thing, is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the thing commanded to be done? If ſuch a ſuppoſition would be unnatural and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, it cannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain caſes is an interdiction of it in others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="unknown:021127_0566_0FB24A78291D9E98"/>A power to conſtitute courts, is a power to preſcribe the mode of trial; and conſequently, if nothing was ſaid in the conſtitution on the ſubject of juries, the legiſlature would be at liberty either to adopt that inſtitution, or to let it alone. This diſcretion in regard to criminal cauſes is abridged by the expreſs injunction of trial by jury in all ſuch caſes; but it is of courſe left at large in relation to civil cauſes, there being a total ſilence on this head. The ſpecification of an obligation to try all criminal cauſes in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or neceſſity of employing the ſame mode in civil cauſes, but does not abridge <hi>the power</hi> of the legiſlature to exerciſe that mode if it ſhould be thought prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r. The pretence therefore, that the national legiſlature would not be at full liberty to ſubmit all the civil cauſes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries, is a pretence deſtitute of all juſt foundation.</p>
                     <p>From theſe obſervations, this concluſion reſults, that the trial by jury in civil caſes would not be aboliſhed, and that the uſe attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to reaſon and common ſenſe, and therefore not admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Even if theſe maxims had a preciſe technical ſenſe, correſponding with the ideas of thoſe who employ them upon the preſent occaſion, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is not the caſe, they would ſtill be inapplicable to a conſtitution of government. In relation to ſuch a ſubject, the natural and obvious ſenſe of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Having now ſeen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the uſe made of them, let us endeavour to aſcertain their proper uſe and true meaning. This will be beſt done by examples. The plan of the convention declares that the power of congreſs or in other words of the <hi>national legiſlature,</hi> ſhall extend to certain enumerated caſes. This ſpecification of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars evidently excludes all pretenſion to a general
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:021127_0567_0FB24A7A2B9D5050"/>
legiſlative authority; becauſe an affirmative grant of ſpecial powers would be abſurd as well as uſeleſs, if a general authority was intended.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the judicial authority of the federal judicatures, is declared by the conſtitution to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend certain caſes particularly ſpecified. The expreſſion of thoſe caſes marks the preciſe limits beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their juriſdiction; becauſe the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the ſpecification would be nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory if it did not exclude all ideas of more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive authority.</p>
                     <p>Theſe examples might be ſufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned, and deſignate the manner in which they ſhould be uſed. But that there may be no poſſibility of miſapprehenſion upon this ſubject I ſhall add one caſe more, to demonſtrate the proper uſe of theſe maxims, and the abuſe which has been made of them.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſuppoſe that by the laws of this ſtate, a married woman was incapable of conveying her eſtate, and that the legiſlature, conſidering this as an evil, ſhould enact that ſhe might diſpoſe of her property by deed executed in the preſence of a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. In ſuch a caſe there can be no doubt but the ſpecification would amount to an excluſion of any other mode of conveyance; becauſe the woman having no previous power to alienate her property, the ſpecification determines the particular mode which ſhe is, for that purpoſe, to avail herſelf of. But let us further ſuppoſe that in a ſubſequent part of the ſame act it ſhould be declared that no woman ſhould diſpoſe of any eſtate of a determinate value without the conſent of three of her neareſt relations, ſignified by their ſigning the deed; could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value? The poſition is too abſurd to merit a refutation, and yet this is
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:021127_0568_0FB24A7B25BF6808"/>
preciſely the poſition which thoſe muſt eſtabliſh who contend that the trial by juries, in civil caſes, is aboliſhed, becauſe it is expreſsly provided for in caſes of a criminal nature.</p>
                     <p>From theſe obſervations it muſt appear unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably true that trial by jury is in no caſe aboliſhed by the propoſed conſtitution, and it is equally true that in thoſe controverſies between individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be intereſted, that inſtitution will remain preciſely in the ſame ſituation in which it is placed by the ſtate conſtitutions, and will be in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. The foundation of this aſſertion is that the national judiciary will have no cognizance of them, and of courſe they will remain determinable as heretofore by the ſtate courts only, and in the manner which the ſtate conſtitutions and laws pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. All land cauſes, except where claims under the grants of different ſtates come into queſtion, and all other controverſies between the citizens of the ſame ſtate, unleſs where they depend upon poſitive violations of the articles of union by acts of the ſtate legiſlatures, will belong excluſively to the juriſdiction of the ſtate tribunals. Add to this that admiralty cauſes, and almoſt all thoſe which are of equity juriſdiction are determinable under our own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from the whole will be that this inſtitution, as it exiſts with us at preſent, cannot poſſibly be affected to any great extent by the propoſed alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in our ſyſtem of government.</p>
                     <p>The friends and adverſaries of the plan of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, if they agree in nothing elſe, concur a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="332" facs="unknown:021127_0569_0FB24A86ED936F48"/>
the operation of the inſtitution has fallen under my obſervation, the more reaſon I have diſcovered for holding it in high eſtimation; and it would be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuperfluous to examine to what extent it deſerve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to be eſteemed uſeful or eſſential in a repreſentative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to as a defence againſt the oppreſſions of an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary monarch, than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magiſtrates in a popular government. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all are ſatisfied of the utility of the inſtitution, and of its friendly aſpect to liberty. But I muſt acknowledge that I cannot readily diſcern the inſeparable connection between the exiſtence of liberty and the trial by jury in civil caſes. Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary impeachments, arbitrary methods of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting pretended offences, and arbitrary puniſhments upon arbitrary convictions have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial deſpotiſm; and theſe have all relation to criminal proceedings. The trial by jury in criminal caſes, aided by the <hi>habeas corpus</hi> act, ſeems therefore to be alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the queſtion. And both of theſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in the moſt ample manner in the plan of the convention.</p>
                     <p>It has been obſerved, that trial by jury is a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard againſt an oppreſſive exerciſe of the power of taxation. This obſervation deſerves to be canvaſſed.</p>
                     <p>It is evident that it can have no influence upon the legiſlature, in regard to the <hi>amount</hi> of the taxes to be laid, to the <hi>objects</hi> upon which they are to be impoſed, or to the <hi>rule</hi> by which they are to be apportioned. If it can have any influence therefore, it muſt be upon the mode of collection, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the officers entruſted with the execution of the revenue laws.</p>
                     <p>As to the mode of collection in this ſtate, under our own conſtitution, the trial by jury is in moſt caſes out of uſe. The taxes are uſually levied by the
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:021127_0570_0FB24A892C965268"/>
more ſummary proceeding of diſtreſs and ſale, as in caſes of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is eſſential to the efficacy of the revenue laws. The dilatory courſe of a trial at law to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the taxes impoſed on individuals, would neither ſuit the exigencies of the public, nor promote the convenience of the citizens. It would often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an accumulation of coſts, more burthenſome than the original ſum of the tax to be levied.</p>
                     <p>And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the proviſion in favor of trial by jury in criminal caſes, will afford the ſecurity aimed at. Wilful abuſes of a public authority, to the oppreſſion of the ſubject, and every ſpecies of official extortion, are offences againſt the government; for which, the perſons who commit them, may be indicted and puniſhed according to the circumſtances of the caſe.</p>
                     <p>The excellence of the trial by jury in civil caſes, appears to depend on circumſtances foreign to the preſervation of liberty. The ſtrongeſt argument in its favour is, that it is a ſecurity againſt corruption. As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a ſtanding body of magiſtrates than with a jury ſummoned for the occaſion, there is room to ſuppoſe, that a corrupt influence would more eaſily find its way to the former than to the latter. The force of this conſideration, is however, diminiſhed by others. The ſheriff who is the ſummoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts who have the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpecial juries, are themſelves ſtanding officers, and acting individually, may be ſuppoſed more acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a collective body. It is not difficult to ſee that it would be in the power of thoſe officers to ſelect jurors who would ſerve the purpoſe of the party as well as a corrupted bench. In the next place, it may fairly be ſuppoſed that there would be leſs difficulty in gaining ſome of the jurors promiſcuouſly taken from the public maſs, than in gaining men who had been choſen by
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:021127_0571_0FB24A8A46FF5608"/>
the government for their probity and good character. But making every deduction for theſe conſiderations the trial by jury muſt ſtill be a valuable check upon corruption. It greatly multiplies the impediments to its ſucceſs. As matters now ſtand, it would be neceſſary to corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have gone evidently wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial, and it would be in moſt caſes of little uſe to practice upon the jury, unleſs the court could be likewiſe gained. Here then is a double ſecurity; and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preſerve the purity of both inſtitutions. By increaſing the obſtacles to ſucceſs, it diſcourages attempts to ſeduce the integrity of either. The temptations to proſtitution, which the judges might have to ſurmount, muſt certainly be much fewer while the co-operation of a jury is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, than they might be if they had themſelves the excluſive determination of all cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding therefore the doubts I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as to the eſſentiality of trial by jury, in civil caſes, to liberty, I admit that it is in moſt caſes, under proper regulations, an excellent method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining queſtions of property; and that on this account alone it would be entitled to a conſtitutional proviſion in its favour, if it were poſſible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended. There is however, in all caſes, great difficulty in this; and men not blinded by enthuſiaſm, muſt be ſenſible that in a federal government which is a compoſition of ſocieties whoſe ideas and inſtitutions in relation to the matter materially vary from each other, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty muſt be not a little augmented. For my own part, at every new view I take of the ſubject, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more convinced of the reality of the obſtacles, which we are authoritatively informed, prevented the inſertion of a proviſion on this head in the plan of the convention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="335" facs="unknown:021127_0572_0FB24A8BA8A303E0"/>The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different ſtates is not generally underſtood. And as it muſt have conſiderable influence on the ſentence we ought to paſs upon the omiſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, in regard to this point, an explanation of it is neceſſary. In this ſtate our judicial eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſemble more nearly, than in any other, thoſe of Great-Britain. We have courts of common law, courts of probates (analogous in certain matters to the ſpiritual courts in England) a court of admiralty, and a court of chancery. In the courts of common law only the trial by jury prevails, and this with ſome exceptions In all the others a ſingle judge preſides and proceeds in general either according to the courſe of the cannon or civil law, without the aid of a jury.<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been erroneouſly inſinuated, with regard to the court of chancery, that this court generally tries diſputed facts by a jury. The truth is, that references to a jury in that court rarely happen, and are in no caſe neceſſary, but where the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a deviſe of land comes into queſtion.</note> In New-Jerſey there is a court of chancery which proceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty, nor of probates, in the ſenſe in which theſe laſt are eſtabliſhed with us. In that ſtate the courts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law have the cognizance of thoſe cauſes, which with us are determinate in the courts of admiralty and of probates, and of courſe the jury trial is more extenſive in New-Jerſey than in New-York. In Pennſylvania this is perhaps ſtill more the caſe, for there is no court of chancery in that ſtate, and its common law courts have equity juriſdiction. It has a court of admiralty, but none of probates, at leaſt on the plan of ours. Delaware has in theſe reſpects imitated Pennſylvania. Maryland approaches more nearly to New-York, as does alſo Virginia, except that the latter has a plurality of chancellors. North-Carolina bears moſt affinity to Pennſylvania; South-Carolina to Virginia. I believe however that in ſome of thoſe ſtates which have diſtinct courts of admiralty, the cauſes depending in them are triable by juries.
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:021127_0573_0FB24A8DAE680140"/>
In Georgia there are none but common law courts, and an appeal of courſe lies from the verdict of one jury to another, which is called a ſpecial jury, and for which a particular mode of appointment is marked out. In Connecticut they have no diſtinct courts, either of chancery or of admiralty, and their courts of probates have no juriſdiction of cauſes. Their common law courts have admiralty, and to a certain extent, equity juriſdiction. In caſes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance their general aſſembly is the only court of chancery. In Connecticut therefore the trial by jury extends in <hi>practice</hi> further than in any other ſtate yet mentioned. Rhode Iſland is I believe in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular pretty much in the ſituation of Connecticut. Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, in regard to the blending of law, equity and admiralty, juriſdictions are in a ſimiliar predicament. In the four eaſtern ſtates the trial by jury not only ſtands upon a broader foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than in the other ſtates, but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown in its full extent to any of them. There is an appeal <hi>of courſe</hi> from one jury to another till there have been two verdicts out of three on one ſide.</p>
                     <p>From this ſketch it appears, that there is a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial diverſity as well in the modification as in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the inſtitution of trial by jury in civil caſes in the ſeveral ſtates; and from this fact, theſe obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflections flow. Firſt, that no general rule could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have correſponded with the circumſtances of all the ſtates; and ſecondly, that more, or at leaſt as much might have been hazarded, by taking the ſyſtem of any one ſtate for a ſtandard, as by omitting a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion altogether, and leaving the matter as it has been left, to legiſlative regulation.</p>
                     <p>The propoſitions which have been made for ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the omiſſion, have rather ſerved to illuſtrate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing. The minority of Pennſylvania have propoſed this mode of expreſſion
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:021127_0574_0FB24A8EA5FCD2B0"/>
for the purpoſe—
<q>trial by jury ſhall be as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore</q>
—and this I maintain would be abſolutely ſenſeleſs and nugatory. The United States, in their united or collective capacity, are the OBJECT to which all general proviſions in the conſtitution muſt neceſſarily be conſtrued to refer. Now it is evident, that though trial by jury with various limitations is known in each ſtate individually, yet in the United States <hi>as ſuch,</hi> it is at this time altogether unknown, becauſe the preſent federal government has no judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary power whatever; and conſequently there is no proper antecedent or previous eſtabliſhment to which the term <hi>heretofore</hi> could relate. It would therefore be deſtitute of a preciſe meaning, and inoperative from its uncertainty.</p>
                     <p>As on the one hand, the form of the proviſion would not fulfil the intent of its propoſers; ſo on the other, if I apprehend that intent rightly, it would be in itſelf inexpedient. I preſume it to be, that cauſes in the federal courts ſhould be tried by jury, if in the ſtate where the courts ſat, that mode of trial would obtain in a ſimiliar caſe in the ſtate courts—that is to ſay admiralty cauſes ſhould be tried in Connecticut by a jury, and in New-York without one. The capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious operation of ſo diſſimilar a method of trial in the ſame caſes, under the ſame government, is of itſelf ſufficient to indiſpoſe every well regulated judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards it. Whether the cauſe ſhould be tried with or without a jury, would depend in a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of caſes, on the accidental ſituation of the court and parties.</p>
                     <p>But this is not in my eſtimation the greateſt objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I feel a deep and deliberate conviction, that there are many caſes in which the trial by jury is an ineligible one. I think it ſo particularly in caſes which concern the public peace with foreign nations; that is in moſt caſes where the queſtion turns wholly on the laws of nations. Of this nature among others are all prize cauſes. Juries cannot be ſuppoſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:021127_0575_0FB24A966585CDF0"/>
to inveſtigations, that require a thorough know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the laws and uſages of nations, and they will ſometimes be under the influence of impreſſions which will not ſuffer them to pay ſufficient regard to thoſe conſiderations of public policy which ought to guide their enquiries. There would of courſe be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their deciſions, ſo as to afford occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of repriſal and war. Though the proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of juries be to determine matters of fact, yet in moſt caſes legal conſequences are complicated with fact in ſuch a manner as to render a ſeparation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.</p>
                     <p>It will add great weight to this remark in relation to prize cauſes to mention that the method of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of Europe, and that purſuant to ſuch treaties they are determinable in Great-Britain in the laſt reſort before the king himſelf in his privy council, where the fact as well as the law undergoes a re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. This alone demonſtrates the impolicy of inſerting a fundamental proviſion in the conſtitution which would make the ſtate ſyſtems a ſtandard for the national government in the article under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and the danger of incumbering the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with any conſtitutional proviſions, the propriety of which is not indiſputable.</p>
                     <p>My convictions are equally ſtrong that great advantages reſult from the ſeparation of the equity from the law juriſdiction; and that the cauſes which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries. The great and primary uſe of a court of equity is to give relief <hi>in extraordinary caſes,</hi> which are <hi>exceptions</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">It is true that the principles by which that relief is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned are now reduced to a regular ſyſtem, but it is not the leſs true that they are in the main, applicable to SPECIAL cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which form exceptions to general rules.</note> to general rules. To unite the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſuch caſes with the ordinary juriſdiction
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:021127_0576_0FB24A98AB32FD90"/>
muſt have a tendency to unſettle the general rules and to ſubject every caſe that ariſes to a <hi>ſpecial</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. While the ſeparation of the one from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a ſentinel over the other, and of keeping each within the expedient limits. Beſides this the circumſtances that conſtitute caſes proper for courts of equity, are in many inſtances ſo nice and intricate, that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury. They require often ſuch long, deliberate and critical inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as would be impracticable to men called from their occupations and obliged to decide before they were permitted to return to them. The ſimplicity and expedition which form the diſtinguiſhing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided ſhould be reduced to ſome ſingle and obvious point; while the litigations uſual in chancery fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently comprehend a long train of minute and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent particulars.</p>
                     <p>It is true that the ſeparation of the equity from the legal juriſdiction is peculiar to the Engliſh ſyſtem of juriſprudence; which is the model that has been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in ſeveral of the ſtates. But it is equally true, that the trial by jury has been unknown in every caſe in which they have been united. And the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is eſſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the extenſion of its juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to matters of law, but it is not a little to be ſuſpected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the attempt to extend the juriſdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery, on the plan upon which they are eſtabliſhed in this ſtate, but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law, and to undermine the trial by jury, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing queſtions too complicated for a deciſion in that mode.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="340" facs="unknown:021127_0577_0FB24A9B6BF7D430"/>Theſe appear to be concluſive reaſons againſt incorporating the ſyſtems of all the ſtates in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the national judiciary; according to what may be conjectured to have been the intent of the Pennſylvania minority. Let us now examine how far the propoſition of Maſſachuſetts is calculated to remedy the ſuppoſed defect.</p>
                     <p>It is in this form—
<q>In civil actions between ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of different ſtates, every iſſue of fact, ariſing in <hi>actions at common law,</hi> may be tried by a jury, if the parties, or either of them, requeſt it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This at beſt is a proportion confined to one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of cauſes; and the inference is fair either that the Maſſachuſetts convention conſidered that as the only claſs of federal cauſes, in which the trial by jury would be proper; or that if deſirous of a more extenſive proviſion, they found it impracticable to deviſe one which would properly anſwer the end. If the firſt, the omiſſion of a regulation reſpecting ſo partial an object, can never be conſidered as a material im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the ſyſtem. If the laſt, it affords a ſtrong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all: If we advert to the obſervations already made reſpecting the courts that ſubſiſt in the ſeveral ſtates of the union, and the different powers exerciſed by them, it will appear, that there are no expreſſions more vague and indeterminate than thoſe which have been employed to characteriſe <hi>that</hi> ſpecies of cauſes which it is intended ſhall be entitled to a trial by jury. In this ſtate the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction are aſcertained in conformity to the rules which prevail in England upon that ſubject. In many of the other ſtates, the boundaries are leſs preciſe. In ſome of them, every cauſe is to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ied in a court of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, and upon that foundation every action may be conſidered as an action at common law, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by a jury, if the parties or either of them
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:021127_0578_0FB24A9D20B39CD0"/>
chuſe it. Hence the ſame irregularity and confuſion would be introduced by a compliance with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that I have already noticed as reſulting from the regulation propoſed by the Pennſylvania minority. In one ſtate a cauſe would receive its determination from a jury, if the parties or either of them requeſted it; but in another ſtate a cauſe exactly ſimilar to the other muſt be decided without the intervention of a jury, becauſe the ſtate judicatories varied as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>It is obvious therefore that the Maſſachuſetts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, upon this ſubject, cannot operate as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral regulation until ſome uniform plan, with reſpect to the limits of common law and equitable juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be adopted by the different ſtates. To deviſe a plan of that kind is a taſk arduous in itſelf, and which it would require much time and reflection to mature. It would be extremely difficult, if not impoſſible, to ſuggeſt any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the ſtates in the union, or that would perfectly quadrate with the ſeveral ſtate inſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>It may be aſked, why could not a reference have been made to the conſtitution of this ſtate, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a good one, as a ſtandard for the United States? I anſwer that it is not very probable the other ſtates ſhould entertain the ſame opinion of our inſtitutions which we do ourſelves. It is natural to ſuppoſe that they are hitherto more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to their own, and that each would ſtruggle for the preference. If the plan of taking one ſtate as a model for the whole had been thought of in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, it is to be preſumed that the adoption of it in that body, would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each repreſentation in favour of its own government; and it muſt be uncertain which of the ſtates would have been taken as the model. It has been ſhewn that many of them would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ones. And I leave it to conjecture whether,
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:021127_0579_0FB24AA0C681E4C0"/>
under all circumſtances, it is moſt likely that New-York or ſome other ſtate would have been preferred. But admit that a judicious ſelection could have been effected in the convention, ſtill there would have been great danger of jealouſy and diſguſt in the other ſtates, at the partiality which had been ſhewn to the inſtitutions of one. The enemies of the plan would have been furniſhed with a fine pretext for raiſing a hoſt of local prejudices againſt it, which perhaps might have hazarded in no inconſiderable degree, its final eſtabliſhment.</p>
                     <p>To avoid the embarraſſments of a definition of the caſes which the trial by jury ought to embrace, it is ſome times ſuggeſted by men of enthuſiaſtic tempers, that a proviſion might have been inſerted for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing it in all caſes whatſoever. For this I believe no precedent is to be found in any member of the union; and the conſiderations which have been ſtated in diſcuſſing the propoſition of the minority of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, muſt ſatisfy every ſober mind that the eſtabliſhment of the trial by jury in <hi>all</hi> caſes, would have been an unpardonable error in the plan.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the more it is conſidered, the more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous will appear the taſk of faſhioning a proviſion in ſuch a form, as not to expreſs too little to anſwer the purpoſe, or too much to be adviſeable; or which might not have opened other ſources of oppoſition to the great and eſſential object of introducing a firm national government.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but perſuade myſelf on the other hand, that the different lights in which the ſubject has been placed in the courſe of theſe obſervations, will go far towards removing in candid minds, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions they may have entertained on the point. They have tended to ſhew that the ſecurity of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal caſes, which is provided for in the moſt ample manner in the plan of the convention; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="343" facs="unknown:021127_0580_0FB24AA48798B3C0"/>
thoſe in which the great body of the community is intereſted, that mode of trial will remain in its full force, as eſtabliſhed in the ſtate conſtitutions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and unaffected by the plan of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That it is no caſe aboliſhed <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide No. LXXXI, in which the ſuppoſition of its being aboliſhed by the appellate juriſdiction in matters of fact being veſted in the ſupreme court is examined and refuted.</note> by that plan; and that there are great if not inſurmountable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the way of making any preciſe and proper proviſion for it in a conſtitution for the United States.</p>
                     <p>The beſt judges of the matter will be the leaſt anxious for a conſtitutional eſtabliſhment of the trial by jury in civil caſes, and will be the moſt ready to admit that the changes which are continually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in the affairs of ſociety, may render a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mode of determining queſtions of property, preferable in many caſes, in which that mode of trial now prevails. For my own part, I acknowledge myſelf to be convinced that even in this ſtate, it might be advantageouſly extended to ſome caſes to which it does not at preſent apply, and might as advantageouſly be abridged in others. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by all reaſonable men, that it ought not to obtain in all caſes. The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in theſe ſtates as in Great-Britain, afford a ſtrong preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that its former extent has been found inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; and give room to ſuppoſe that future expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may diſcover the propriety and utility of other exceptions. I ſuſpect it to be impoſſible in the nature of the thing, to fix the ſalutary point at which the operation of the inſtitution ought to ſtop; and this is with me a ſtrong argument for leaving the matter to the diſcretion of the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>This is now clearly underſtood to be the caſe in Great-Britain, and it is equally ſo in the ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut; and yet it may be ſafely affirmed, that more numerous encroachments have been made upon
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:021127_0581_0FB24AA6C5A3B5D8"/>
the trial by jury in this ſtate ſince the revolution, though provided for by a poſitive article of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, than has happened in the ſame time either in Connecticut or Great-Britain. It may be added that theſe encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavour to perſuade the people they are the warmeſt defenders of popular liberty, but who have rarely ſuffered conſtitutional obſtacles to arreſt them in a favourite career. The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be ſubſtantially relied upon for permanent effects. Particular proviſions, though not altogether uſeleſs, have far l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There however remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head, or were forgotten in their proper places. Theſe
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:021127_0582_0FB24AA8296F3938"/>
ſhall now be diſcuſſed; but as the ſubject has been drawn into great length, I ſhall ſo far conſult brevity as to compriſe all my obſervations on theſe miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneous points in a ſingle paper.</p>
                     <p>The moſt conſiderable of theſe remaining objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is, that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights. Among other anſwers given to this, it has been upon different occaſions remarked, that the conſtitutions of ſeveral of the ſtates are in a ſimilar predicament. I add, that New-York is of this number. And yet the oppoſers of the new ſyſtem in this ſtate, who profeſs an unlimited admiration for its conſtitution, are among the moſt intemperate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans of a bill of rights. To juſtify their zeal in this matter, they alledge two things; one is, that though the conſtitution of New-York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet it contains in the body of it various proviſions in favour of particular privileges and rights, which in ſubſtance amount to the ſame thing; the other is, that the conſtitution adopts in their full extent the common and ſtatute law of Great-Britain, by which many other rights not expreſſed in it are equally ſecured.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt I anſwer, that the conſtitution propoſed by the convention contains, as well as the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this ſtate, a number of ſuch proviſions.</p>
                     <p>Independent of thoſe, which relate to the ſtructure of the government, we find the following:—Article I. ſection 3. clauſe 7.
<q>Judgment in caſes of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not extend further than to removal from office, and diſqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honour, truſt or profit under the United States; but the party convicted ſhall nevertheleſs be liable and ſubject to indictment, trial, judgment and puniſhment, according to law.</q>
—Section 9. of the ſame article, clauſe 2.
<q>The privilege of the writ of <hi>habeas corpus</hi> ſhall not be ſuſpended, unleſs when in caſes of rebellion or invaſion the public ſafety may require it.</q>
—Clauſe 3.

— Clauſe 7.
<q>No title of nobility ſhall be granted by the United States: And no perſon holding any office of profit or truſt under them, ſhall, without the conſent of the congreſs, accept of any preſent, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign ſtate.</q>
—Article III. ſection 2. clauſe 3.
<q>The trial of all crimes, except in caſes of impeachment, ſhall be by jury; and ſuch trial ſhall be held in the ſtate where the ſaid crimes ſhall have been committed; but when not committed within any ſtate, the trial ſhall be at ſuch place or places as the congreſs may by law have directed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </q>
—Section 3, of the ſame article,
<q>Treaſon againſt the United States ſhall conſiſt only in levying war againſt them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No perſon ſhall be convicted of treaſon unleſs on the teſtimony of two witneſſes to the ſame overt act, or on confeſſion in open court.</q>
—And clauſe 3, of the ſame ſection.
<q>The congreſs ſhall have power to declare the puniſhment of treaſon, but no attainder of treaſon ſhall work corruption of blood, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, except during the life of the perſon attainted.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may well be a queſtion whether theſe are not upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the conſtitution of this ſtate. The eſtabliſhment of the writ of <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, <hi>to which we have no correſponding provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in our conſtitution,</hi> are perhaps greater ſecurities to liberty and republicaniſm than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commiſſion of the fact, or in other words, the ſubjecting of men to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary impriſonments have been in all ages the favourite and moſt formidable inſtruments of tyranny. The

obſervations of the judicious Blackſtone<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Blackſtone's Commentaries, vol. 1, page 136.</note> in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital.
<q>To bereave a man of life (ſays he) or by violence to confiſcate his eſtate, without accuſation or trial, would be ſo groſs and notorious an act of deſpotiſm, as muſt at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the perſon by ſecretly hurrying him to goal, where his ſufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a leſs public, a leſs ſtriking, and therefore <hi>a more dangerous engine</hi> of arbitrary government.</q>
And as a remedy for this fatal evil, he is every where peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the <hi>babeas corpus</hi> act, which in one place he calls <q>the BULWARK of the Britiſh conſtitution.<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem, vol. 4, page 438.</note>

                     <p>To the ſecond, that is, to the pretended eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the common and ſtatute law by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I anſwer, that they are expreſsly made ſubject

They are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legiſlative power, and of courſe have no conſtitutional ſanction. The only uſe of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law, and to remove doubts which might have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the revolution. This conſequently can be conſidered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our conſtitutions muſt be intended as limitations of the power of the government itſelf.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſeveral times truly remarked, that bills of rights are in their or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="348" facs="unknown:021127_0585_0FB24AACAE6A2FD8"/>
kings and their ſubjects, abrigements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reſervations of rights not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by the Barons, ſword in hand, from king John. Such were the ſubſequent confirmations of that charter by ſubſequent princes. Such was the <hi>petition of right</hi> aſſented to by Charles the Firſt, in the beginning of his reign. Such alſo was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of right preſented by the lords and commons to the prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament, called the bill of rights. It is evident, therefore, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their primitive ſignification, they have no application to conſtitutions profeſſedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate repreſentatives and ſervants. Here, in ſtrictneſs, the people ſurrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular reſervations,

Here is a better recognition of popular rights than volumes of thoſe aphoriſms which make the principal figure in ſeveral of our ſtate bills of rights, and which would ſound much better in a treatiſe of ethics than in a conſtitution of government.</p>
                     <p>But a minute detail of particular rights is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly far leſs applicable to a conſtitution like that under conſideration, which is merely intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the general political intereſts of the nation, than to a conſtitution which has the regulation of every ſpecies of perſonal and private concerns. If therefore the loud clamours againſt the plan of the convention on this ſcore, are well founded, no epithet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of reprobation will be too ſtrong for the conſtitution of this ſtate. But the truth is, that both of them contain all, which in relation to their objects, is reaſonably to be deſired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="349" facs="unknown:021127_0586_0FB24AAE34CA38A0"/>I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the ſenſe and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unneceſſary in the propoſed conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things ſhall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for inſtance, ſhould it be ſaid, that the liberty of the preſs ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, when no power is given by which reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be impoſed? I will not contend that ſuch a proviſion would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furniſh, to men diſpoſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſurp, a plauſible pretence for claiming that power. They might urge with a ſemblance of reaſon, that the conſtitution ought not to be charged with the abſurdity of providing againſt the abuſe of an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which was not given, and that the proviſion againſt reſtraining the liberty of the preſs afforded a clear implication, that a power to preſcribe proper regulations concerning it, was intended to be veſted in the national government. This may ſerve as a ſpecimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of conſtructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.</p>
                     <p>On the ſubject of the liberty of the preſs, as much has been ſaid, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: In the firſt place, I obſerve that there is not a ſyllable concerning it in the conſtitution of this ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the next, I contend that whatever has been ſaid about it in that of any other ſtate, amounts to nothing. What ſignifies a declaration that
<q>the liberty of the preſs ſhall be inviolably preſerved?</q>
What is the liberty of the preſs? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmoſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for evaſion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from this, I infer, that its ſecur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ſaid that duties may be laid upon publications ſo high as to amount to a prohibition. I know not by what logic it could be maintained that the declarations in the ſtate conſtitutions, in favour of the freed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <desc>•</desc>

The ſame invaſions of it may be effected under the ſtate conſtitutions which contain thoſe declarations through the means of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There remai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s but one other view of this matter to conclude the point. The truth is, after all the declamation we have heard, that the conſtitution is itſelf in every rational ſenſe, and to every uſeful purpoſe, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The ſeveral bills of rights, in Great-Britain, form its conſtitution, and converſely the conſtitution of each ſtate is its bill of rights. And the propoſed conſtitution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the union. Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and ſpecify the political privile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es of the citizens in the ſtructure and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the government? This is done in the moſt ample and preciſe manner in the plan of the convention, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mprehending various precautions for the public ſecurity, which are not to be found in any of the ſtate conſtitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:021127_0588_0FB24AB2B0B41038"/>
proceeding, which are relative to perſonal and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate concerns? This we have ſeen has alſo been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, in a variety of caſes, in the ſame plan. Adverting therefore to the ſubſtantial meaning of a bill of rights, it is abſurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention. It may be ſaid that it does not go far enough, though it will not be eaſy to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no ſuch thing. It certainly muſt be immaterial what mode is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any part of the inſtrument which eſtabliſhes the government. And hence it muſt be apparent t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t much of what has been ſaid on this ſubject re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> merely on verbal and nominal diſtinctions, which are entirely foreign from the ſubſtance of the thing.</p>
                     <p>Another objection, which has been made, and which from the frequency of its repetition it is to be preſumed is relied on, is of this nature:—It is improper (ſay the objectors) to confer ſuch large powers, as are propoſed, upon the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe the ſeat of that government muſt of neceſſity be too remote from many of the ſtates to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent, of the conduct of the repreſentative body. This argument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no general government whatever. For the powers which it ſeems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be veſted in the union, cannot be ſafely intruſted to a body which is not under every requiſite controul. But there are ſatisfactory reaſons to ſhew that the objection is in reality not well founded. There is in moſt of the arguments which relate to diſtance a palpable illuſion of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. What are the ſources of information by which the people in Montgomery county muſt regulate their judgment of the conduct of their repreſentatives in the ſtate legiſlature? Of perſonal obſervation they can
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:021127_0589_0FB24AB42DBFCAC0"/>
have no benefit. This is confined to the citizens on the ſpot. They muſt therefore depend on the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of intelligent men, in whom they confide— and how muſt theſe men obtain their information? Evidently from the complection of public meaſures, from the public prints, from correſpondences with their repreſentatives, and with other perſons who reſide at the place of their deliberation. This does not apply to Montgomery county only, but to all the counties, at any conſiderable diſtance from the ſeat of government.</p>
                     <p>It is equally evident that the ſame ſources of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation would be open to the people, in relation to the conduct of their repreſentatives in the general government; and the impediments to a prompt communication which diſtance may be ſuppoſed to create, will be overballanced by the effects of the vigilance of the ſtate governments. The executive and legiſlative bodies of each ſtate will be ſo many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>entinels over the perſons employed in every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the national adminiſtration; and as it will be in their power to adopt and purſue a regular and effectual ſyſtem of intelligence, they can never be at a loſs to know the behaviour of thoſe who repreſent their conſtituents in the national councils, and can readily communicate the ſame knowledge to the people. Their diſpoſition to appriſe the community of whatever may prejudice its intereſts from another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only from the rivalſhip of power. And we may conclude with the fulleſt aſſurance, that the people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional repreſentatives, than they can be by any means they now poſſeſs of that of their ſtate repreſentatives.</p>
                     <p>It ought alſo to be remembered, that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will in all queſtions that affect the general liberty and proſperity, have the ſame intereſt with thoſe who are at a diſtance; and that they will ſtand
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:021127_0590_0FB24ABB24E68880"/>
ready to ſound the alarm when neceſſary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project. The public papers will be expeditious meſſengers of intelligence to the moſt remote inhabitants of the union.</p>
                     <p>Among the many extraordinary objections which have appeared againſt the propoſed conſtitution, the moſt extraordinary and the leaſt colourable one, is derived from the want of ſome proviſion reſpecting the debts due <hi>to</hi> the United States. This has been repreſented as a tacit relinquiſhment of thoſe debts, and as a wicked contrivance to ſcreen public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulters. The newſpapers have teemed with the moſt inflammatory railings on this head; and yet there is nothing clearer than that the ſuggeſtion is entirely void of foundation, and is the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme diſhoneſty. In addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the remarks I have made upon the ſubject in another place, I ſhall only obſerve, that as it is a plain dictate of common ſenſe, ſo it is alſo an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed doctrine of politioal law, that
<q>States neither loſe any of their rights, nor are diſcharged from any of their obligations by a change in the form of their civil government.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Rutherford's Inſtitutes, vol. 2. book 11. chap. x. ſect. xiv. and xv.—Vice alſo Grotius, book 11. chap. ix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſect. viii. and ix.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt objection of any conſequence which I at preſent recollect, turns upon the article of expence. If it were even true that the adoption of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed government would occaſion a conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of expence, it would be an objection that ought to have no weight againſt the plan. The great bulk of the citizens of America, are with reaſon convinced that union is the baſis of their political happineſs. Men of ſenſe of all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preſerved under the preſent ſyſtem, nor without radical alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; that new and extenſive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that theſe require
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:021127_0591_0FB247B2B6903B30"/>
a different organization of the federal government, a ſingle body being an unſafe depoſitory of ſuch ample authorities. In conceding all this, the queſtion of expence muſt be given up, for it impoſſible, with any degree of ſafety, to narrow the foundation upon which the ſyſtem is to ſtand. The two branches of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> legiſlature are in the firſt inſtance, to conſiſt of only ſixty-five perſons, which is the ſame number of which congreſs, under the exiſting confederation, may be compoſed. It is true that this number is intended to be increaſed; but this is to keep pace with the increaſe of the population and reſources of the country. It is evident, that a leſs number would, even in the firſt inſtance, have been unſafe; and that a continuance of the preſent number would, in a more advanced ſtage of population, be a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate repreſentation of the people.</p>
                     <p>Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expence to ſpring? One ſource pointed out, is the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of offices under the new government. Let us examine this a little.</p>
                     <p>It is evident that the principal departments of the adminiſtration under the preſent government, are the ſame which will be required under the new. There are now a ſecretary at war, a ſecretary for foreign affairs, a ſecretary for domeſtic affairs, a board of treaſury conſiſting of three perſons, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, aſſiſtants, clerks, &amp;c. Theſe offices are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable under any ſyſtem, and will ſuffice under the new as well as under the old. As to ambaſſadors and other miniſters and agents in foreign countries, the propoſed conſtitution can make no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, than to render their characters, where they reſide, more reſpectable, and their ſervices more uſeful. As to perſons to be employed in the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the revenues, it is unqueſtionably true that theſe will form a very conſiderable addition to the number of federal officers; but it will not follow, that this will occaſion an increaſe of public expence.
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:021127_0592_0FB247A78B76D850"/>
It will be in moſt caſes nothing more than an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſtate officers for national officers. In the collection of all duties, for inſtance, the perſons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed will be wholly of the latter deſcription. The ſtates individually will ſtand in no need of any for this purpoſe. What difference can it make in point of expence, to pay officers of the cuſtoms appointed by the ſtate, or thoſe appointed by the United States? There is no good reaſon to ſuppoſe, that either the number or the ſalaries of the latter, will be greater than thoſe of the former.</p>
                     <p>Where then are we to ſeek for thoſe additional ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of expence which are to ſwell the account to the enormous ſize that has been repreſented to us? The chief item which occurs to me, reſpects the ſupport of the judges of the United States. I do not add the preſident, becauſe there is now a preſident of congreſs, whoſe expences may not be far, if any thing, ſhort of thoſe which will be incurred on account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the United States. The ſupport of the judges will clearly be an extra expence, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in practice in regard to this matter. But it can upon no reaſonable plan amount to a ſum which will be an object of material conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Let us now ſee what there is to counterballance any extra expences that may attend the eſtabliſhment of the propoſed government. The firſt thing that preſents itſelf is, that a great part of the buſineſs, which now keeps congreſs ſitting through the year, will be tranſacted by the preſident. Even the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of foreign negociations will naturally devolve upon him according to general principles concerted with the ſenate, and ſubject to their final concurrence. Hence it is evident, that a portion of the year will ſuffice for the ſeſſion of both the ſenate and the houſe of repreſentatives: We may ſuppoſe about a fourth for the latter, and a third or perhaps a half for the former. The extra buſineſs of treaties
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:021127_0593_0FB247A8EA491E78"/>
and appointments may give this extra occupation to the ſenate. From this circumſtance we may infer, that until the houſe of repreſentatives ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed greatly beyond its preſent number, there will be a conſiderable ſaving of expence from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the conſtant ſeſſion of the preſent, and the temporary ſeſſion of the future congreſs.</p>
                     <p>But there is another circumſtance, of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the view of economy. The buſineſs of the United States has hitherto occupied the ſtate legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as well as congreſs. The latter has made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions which the former have had to provide for. Hence it has happened that the ſeſſions of the ſtate legiſlatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was neceſſary for the execution of the mere local buſineſs of the ſtates. More than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the United States. Now the members who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtate amount to two thouſand and upwards; which number has hitherto performed what under the new ſyſtem will be done in the firſt inſtance by ſixty-five perſons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or a fifth of that number. The congreſs under the propoſed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will do all the buſineſs of the United States themſelves, without the intervention of the ſtate legiſlatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular ſtates, and will not have to ſit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference, in the time of the ſeſſions of the ſtate legiſlatures, will be all clear gain, and will alone form an article of ſaving, which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expence that may be occaſioned by the adoption of the new ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>The reſult from theſe obſervations is, that the ſources of additional expence from the eſtabliſhment of the propoſed conſtitution are much fewer than may have been imagined, that they are counterbalanced
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:021127_0594_0FB247AF44D2E8B8"/>
by conſiderable objects of ſaving, and that while it is queſtionable on which ſide the ſcale will prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, it is certain that a government leſs expenſive would be incompetent to the purpoſes of the union.</p>

And a man muſt have ſlender pretenſions to conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, who can rail at the latter for imperfections

which he finds no difficulty in excuſing in the former. Nor indeed can there be a better proof of the inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and affectation of ſome of the zealous adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the plan of the convention among us, who profeſs to be the devoted admirers of the government under which they live, than the fury with which they have attacked that plan, for matters in regard to which our own conſtitution is equally, or perhaps more vulnerable.</p>
                     <p>The additional ſecurities to republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to liberty and to property, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under conſideration, conſiſt chiefly in the reſtraints which the preſervation of the union will impoſe on local factions and inſurrections, and on the ambition of powerful individuals in ſingle ſtates, who might acquire credit and influence enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the deſpots of the people; in the diminution of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to foreign intrigue, which the diſſolution of the confederacy would invite and facilitate; in the prevention of extenſive military eſtabliſhments, which could not fail to grow out of wars between the ſtates in a diſunited ſituation; in the expreſs gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee of a republican form of government to each; in the abſolute and univerſal excluſion of titles of nobility; and in the precautions againſt the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe practices on the part of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have undermined the foundations of property and credit, have planted mutual diſtruſt in the breaſts of all claſſes of citizens, and have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned an alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus have I, my fellow citizens, executed the taſk I had aſſigned to myſelf; with what ſucceſs, your conduct muſt determine. I truſt at leaſt you will admit, that I have not failed in the aſſurance I gave you reſpecting the ſpirit with which my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould be conducted. I have addreſſed myſelf purely to your judgments, and have ſtudiouſly avoided thoſe aſperities which are too apt to diſgrace

political diſputants of all parties, and which have been not a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents of the conſtitution. The charge of a conſpiracy againſt the liberties of the people, which has been indiſcriminately brought againſt the advocates of the plan, has ſomething in it too wanton and too malignant not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his own boſom a refutation of the calumny. The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy, the well-born and the great, have been ſuch as to inſpire the diſguſt of all ſenſible men. And the unwarrantable concealments and miſrepreſentations which have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all honeſt men. It is not impoſſible that theſe circumſtances may have occaſionally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me into intemperances of expreſſion which I did not intend: It is certain that I have frequently felt a ſtruggle between ſenſibility and moderation, and if the former has in ſome inſtances prevailed, it muſt be my excuſe, that it has been neither often nor much.</p>
                     <p>Let us now pauſe and aſk ourſelves whether, in the courſe of theſe papers, the propoſed conſtitution has not been ſatisfactorily vindicated from the aſperſions thrown upon it, and whether it has not been ſhewn to be worthy of the public approbation, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the public ſafety and proſperity. Every man is bound to anſwer theſe queſtions to himſelf, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of his conſcience and underſtanding, and to act agreeably to the genuine and ſober dictates of his judgment. This is a duty, from which nothing can give him a diſpenſation.—'Tis one that he is called upon, nay, conſtrained by all the obligations that form the bands of ſociety, to diſcharge ſincerely and honeſtly. — No partial motive, no particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

poſterity, an improper election of the part he is to act. Let him beware of an obſtinate adherence to party.— Let him reflect that the object upon which he is to decide is not a particular intereſt of the community, but the very exiſtence of the nation.—And let him remember that a majority of America has already given its ſanction to the plan, which he is to approve or reject.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not diſſemble, that I feel an intire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the arguments, which recommend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſyſtem to your adoption; and that I am unable to diſcern any real force in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Conceſſions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a claim to abſolute perfection, have afforded matter of no ſmall triumph to its enemies. Why, ſay they, ſhould we adopt an imperfect thing? Why not amend it, and make it perfect before it is irrevocably eſtabliſhed? This may be plauſible enough, but it is only plauſible. In the firſt place I remark, that the extent of theſe conceſſions has been greatly exaggerated They have been ſtated as amounting to an admiſſion, that the plan is radically defective; and that, without material alterations, the rights and the intereſts of the community cannot be ſafely confided to it. This, as far as I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the meaning of thoſe who make the conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is an intire perverſion of their ſenſe. No ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of the meaſure can be found who will not declare as his ſentiment, that the ſyſtem, though it may not be perfect in every part, is upon the whole a good one, is the beſt that the preſent views and circumſtances of the country will permit, and is ſuch an one as promiſes every ſpecies of ſecurity which a reaſonable people can deſire.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer in the next place, that I ſhould eſteem it the extreme of imprudence to prolong the precarious,
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:021127_0598_0FB247C00F510D10"/>
ſtate of our national affairs, and to expoſe the union to the jeopardy of ſucceſſive experiments, in the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical purſuit of a perfect plan. I never expect to ſee a perfect work from imperfect man. The reſult of the deliberations of all collective bodies muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be a compound as well of the errors and prejudices, as of the good ſenſe and wiſdom of the individuals of whom they are compoſed. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts which are to embrace thirteen diſtinct ſtates, in a common bond of amity and union, muſt as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be a compromiſe of as many diſſimilar intereſts and inclinations. How can perfection ſpring from ſuch materials?</p>
                     <p>The reaſons aſſigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately publiſhed in this city<note n="*" place="bottom">Intitled "An Addreſs, to the people of the ſtate of New-York."</note> are unanſwerable to ſhew the utter improbability of aſſembling a new conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under circumſtances in any degree ſo favourable to a happy iſſue, as thoſe in which the late convention met, deliberated and concluded. I will not repeat the arguments there uſed, as I preſume the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf has had an extenſive circulation. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly well worthy the peruſal of every friend to his country. There is however one point of light in which the ſubject of amendments ſtill remains to be conſidered; and in which it has not yet been exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to public view. I cannot reſolve to conclude, without firſt taking a ſurvey of it in this aſpect.</p>
                     <p>It appears to me ſuſceptible of abſolute demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it will be far more eaſy to obtain ſubſequent than previous amendments to the conſtitution. The moment an alteration is made in the preſent plan, it becomes, to the purpoſe of adoption, a new one, and muſt undergo a new deciſion of each ſtate. To its complete eſtabliſhment throughout the union, it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen ſtates. If, on the contrary, the conſtitution propoſed ſhould once be ratified by all the ſtates as it ſtands, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it may at any time be effected by nine ſtates.
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:021127_0599_0FB247C54241AEB8"/>
Here then the chances are as thirteen to nine<note n="*" place="bottom">It may rather be ſaid TEN, for though two-thirds may ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>This is not all. Every conſtitution for the United States muſt inevitably conſiſt of a great variety of particulars, in which thirteen independent ſtates are to be accommodated in their intereſts or opinions of intereſt. We may of courſe expect to ſee, in any body of men charged with its original formation, very different combinations of the parts upon different points. Many of thoſe who form the majority on one queſtion may become the minority on a ſecond, and an aſſociation diſſimilar to either may conſtitute the majority on a third. Hence the neceſſity of mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and arranging all the particulars which are to compoſe the whole in ſuch a manner as to ſatisfy all the parties to the compact; and hence alſo an immenſe multiplication of difficulties and caſualties in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the collective aſſent to a final act. The degree of that multiplication muſt evidently be in a ratio to the number of particulars and the number of parties.</p>
                     <p>But every amendment to the conſtitution, if once eſtabliſhed, would be a ſingle propoſition, and might be brought forward ſingly. There would then be no neceſſity for management or compromiſe, in relation to any other point, no giving nor taking.

                     <p>In oppoſition to the probability of ſubſequent amendments it has been urged, that the perſons dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the adminiſtration of the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:021127_0600_0FB247C7C3889A20"/>
will always be diſinclined to yield up any portion of the authority of which they were once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. For my own part I acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon mature conſideration, be thought uſeful, will be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the organization of the government, not to the maſs of its powers; and on this account alone, I think there is no weight in the obſervation juſt ſtated. I alſo think there is little weight in it on another account. The intrinſic difficulty of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing THIRTEEN STATES at any rate, independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public ſpirit and integrity, will, in my opinion, conſtantly <hi>impoſe</hi> on the national rulers the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a ſpirit of accommodation to the reaſonable expectations of their conſtituents. But there is yet a further conſideration, which proves beyond the poſſibility of doubt, that the obſervation is futile. It is this, that the national rulers, whenever nine ſtates concur, will have no option upon the ſubject. By the fifth article of the plan the congreſs will be <hi>obliged.</hi>
                        <q>on the application of the legiſlatures of two-thirds of the ſtates, (which at preſent amounts to nine) to call a convention for propoſing amendments, which <hi>ſhall be valid</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, as part of the conſtitution, when ratified by the legiſlatures of three-fourths of the ſtates, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof.</q>
The words of this article are peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. The congreſs "<hi>ſhall</hi> call a convention." No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this particular is left to the diſcretion of that body. And of conſequence all the declamation about their diſinclination to a change, vaniſhes in air. Nor however difficult it may be ſuppoſed to unite two-thirds or three-fourths of the ſtate legiſlatures, in amendments which may affect local intereſts, can there be any room to apprehend any ſuch difficulty in a union on points which are merely rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="364" facs="unknown:021127_0601_0FB247C92F7229F8"/>
to erect barriers againſt the encroachments of the national authority.</p>
                     <p>If the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that I am myſelf deceived by it; for it is, in my conception, one of thoſe rare inſtances in which a political truth can be brought to the teſt of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical demonſtration. Thoſe who ſee the matter in the ſame light with me, however zealous they may be for amendments, muſt agree in the propriety of a previous adoption, as the moſt direct road to their own object.</p>
                     <p>The zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the eſtabliſhment of the conſtitution, muſt abate in every man, who, is ready to accede to the truth of the following obſervations of a writer, equally ſolid and ingenious:—
<q>To balance a large ſtate or ſociety (ſays he) whether monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of ſo great difficulty, that no human genius, however comprehenſive, is able by the mere dint of reaſon and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of many muſt unite in the work: EXPERIENCE muſt guide their labour: TIME muſt bring it to perfection: And the FEEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING of inconveniences muſt correct the miſtakes which they <hi>inevitably</hi> fall into, in their firſt trials and experiments.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hume's Eſſays, vol. 1, page 128.—The riſe of arts and ſciences.</note>
                        </q>
Theſe judicious reflections contain a leſſon of moderation to all the ſincere lovers of the union, and ought to put them upon their guard againſt hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the ſtates from each other, and perhaps the military deſpotiſm of a victorious demagogue, in the purſuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from TIME and EXPERIENCE. It may be in me a defect of political fortitude, but I acknowledge, that I cannot entertain an equal tranquillity with thoſe who affect to treat the dangers of a longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in our preſent ſituation as imaginary.

NATION without a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT is, in my view, an awful ſpectacle. The eſtabliſhment of a conſtitution, in time of profound peace, by the voluntary conſent of a whole people, is a PRODIGY, to the completion of which I look forward with trembling anxiety. I can reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have, in ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous an enterpriſe, upon ſeven out of the thirteen ſtates; and after having paſſed over ſo conſiderable a part of the ground to recommence the courſe. I dread the more the conſequences of new attempts, becauſe I KNOW that POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS, in this and in other ſtates, are enemies to a general national government, in every poſſible ſhape.</p>
