            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>"EXCESSIVE Uſury," it has been ſaid,
<q>is the moſt unequivocal proof of the the imbecility of States, or ſymptom of ſome <hi>internal vice</hi> which corrodes them, and is often the harbinger of the moſt terrible cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to the adoption of this obſervation from a conſideration of the unparalleled <hi>extortions</hi> that are daily and openly practiſed in this city— <hi>in the purchaſe and ſale of Promiſſory Notes</hi>—to the diſgrace of civilization and of the national character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:030688_0003_0fe875dd2572b738"/>Where muſt this end?</p>
            <p>My enquiries into the cauſes of the preſent diſtreſſes, are frequently anſwered by a reference to the injuries and loſſes our merchants have ſuſtained by the unjuſt capture of our veſſels at ſea, and their illegal detention.</p>
            <p>Theſe evils, it cannot be diſputed, are ſerious and deeply afflictive: but it muſt not be diſguiſed that calamity is not confined to that range—it muſt be aſcribed to a cauſe, operating in various forms, no leſs fatal, though not ſo ſtriking to the public diſcernment—the ſhameful <hi>monopolizing principle</hi> adopted by the Banks, of diſcounting for thoſe only who can make large depoſits, or, as it is termed, "KEEP GOOD ACCOUNTS."</p>
            <p>When I conſider that the aggregate capital of the ſeveral Banks in this city, amounts to ſo many millions of dollars, and (making a due allowance for ſuch parts thereof as cannot but remain inactive at preſent,) hear complaints ſo univerſal, and credit ſuffering ſo intenſely every day, my aſtoniſhment at the public blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or indifference, is greater than I can expreſs!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:030688_0004_0fe875e3ede35080"/>I naturally enquire, and wonder that other men do not enquire alſo, <hi>How is this amazing ſum diſpoſed of</hi> EVERY SIXTY DAYS <hi>with ſo little general ſatisfaction</hi>—with ſuch misfortunes hourly ariſing, and ſuch funds at hand?</p>
            <p>It is in vain that I labour to find a ſatisfactory reſolution of this important queſtion: The man moſt biaſſed by intereſt cannot ſay it is impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially—no candid man that it is juſtly diſpoſed of—or that it is laid out in the manner moſt
<q>uſeful to the commerce and agriculture of the State,</q>
or to produce the moſt
<q>conſiderable advantages to <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> in general,</q>
as was contemplated by the ſeveral Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the extent of the injuries and loſſes the merchants have ſuſtained by the capture of their veſſels and other property, they muſt be conſidered as part of the conſequences flowing from their own proceedings in promoting the adoption of a Treaty, which, inſtead of healing the firſt affliction, hath confirmed it into a diſeaſe, and threatens to add diſorders ſtill more grievous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030688_0005_0fe875e573aa22a0"/>This meaſure of politics, however, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially relates to the preſent ſubject, inaſmuch, as it is only an external aggravation of diſorders, which already exiſt internally, radically pernicious, and fraught with generative deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Muſt it not be a matter of aſtoniſhment to every well informed man—muſt it not be diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to very man not totally abſorbed in <hi>avarice,</hi> to be told, that an individual of the beſt credit ſhall not be entitled to accommodation at a public inſtitution, becauſe he will not ſuffer his money to <hi>lie dead in Bank.</hi> What is the true character of ſuch a ſtrange procedure, is it not demanding <hi>a depoſit</hi> of money, and at the ſame time exacting <hi>a diſcount</hi> for the uſe of a part of it? Is it not paying intereſt to the borrower for the uſe of the lender's money!</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch are the ſhameful extortions openly avowed, notwithſtanding <hi>two</hi> of the charters of theſe public inſtitutions were granted
<q>under ſuch <hi>limitations</hi> and <hi>reſtrictions</hi> as not to become an object of <hi>jealouſy</hi> or <hi>apprehenſion</hi> to the good people of the States;</q>
—and—
<q>to the intent that <hi>the Citizens of the State</hi> might not be oppreſſed!</q>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030688_0006_0fe875ec5a46e5f0"/>A moſt eminent author <note n="(1)" place="bottom">Smith's Wealth of Nations, p. 319.</note> ſays,
<q>It is not by augmenting the capital of a country, but by rendering a greater part of that capital <hi>active</hi> and <hi>productive</hi> than would otherwiſe be ſo, that <hi>the moſt judicious operations of banking</hi> can encreaſe the induſtry of the country. That part of the capital which a dealer is obliged to keep by him <hi>unemployed</hi> and in ready money for anſwering occaſional demands, <hi>is ſo much</hi> DEAD STOCK; which, ſo long as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in this ſituation <hi>produces nothing to him or to his country.</hi> The <hi>judicious operations of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> enable him to convert his <hi>dead ſtock</hi> into <hi>active</hi> and <hi>productive ſtock.</hi>
               </q>
How contrary is this doctrine to the ſhamefully extortionate and uſurious "New invention of caſhiering" now purſued, as it has been termed by Sir Joſhua Child! How different from the principles of the "Mons Pietatis" of the Biſhop of Padua, who (in 1490) eſtabliſhed a Bank <hi>purpoſely to counteract ſimilar extortion and uſury in thoſe days</hi>!</p>
            <p>One of the principal motives for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Bank Royale</hi> of Paris was, that
<q>it would make uſury to ceaſe <note n="(2)" place="bottom">Beawe's Lex Mer. p. 328.</note>;</q>
and the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030688_0007_0fe875ede0eb69f8"/>Bank of England, we are told <note n="(3)" place="bottom">Poſtleth. Dict. Art. Banking; and 3 Anderſon Com. 141.</note>, is an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable accommodation to the community, becauſe it has a tendency <hi>to keep low the intereſt of money,</hi> and is
<q>
                  <hi>an effectual and permanent check to uſury,</hi> which is the greateſt bane to trade and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It has been ſaid <note n="(4)" place="bottom">Coxe's U.S. 480.</note> that the organization of our banks is on a plan and principles nearly uniform with, and <hi>like to thoſe of the Bank of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Why then are effects produced ſo very oppoſite and extraordinary? How comes it that the ſyſtem upon which our banks are conducted at preſent can only create further diſtreſſes <hi>among all thoſe who have not been engaged in their extortions</hi>? How comes it that they throw <hi>into the hands of uſury</hi> the means whereby to play with redoubled cruelty upon thoſe diſtreſſes which they at firſt create?</p>
            <p>I have been referred to individuals in <hi>Mulberry-ſtreet—Cheſnut-ſtreet—Second-ſtreet—Third-ſtreet— Water-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>other ſtreets,</hi> as known uſurers, or AGENTS acting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or COMPANIES OF
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030688_0008_0fe875f4c700fbe8"/>USURERS! and I have been confidently aſſured that thoſe very individuals (with ſhame be it mentioned!) <hi>can, and do obtain diſcounts regularly</hi> at <hi>two</hi> of the Banks!</p>
            <p>Whether there is cauſe for ſuſpicion that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bank Directors are intimately concerned in ſome of thoſe eſtabliſhments or not, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the following circumſtances of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which took place a few days ago. A Director was met by a Broker, whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed in languague and effect nearly as memory can collect thus,
<q>For ſhame, J—, for ſhame! why will you not purſue ſome regular buſineſs, in preference to being inſtrumental to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of your neighbours?</q>
—To which the Jew replied—
<q>Got damn! fwhat haf you to do mid it! I ſells more noteſh to Bank Tirectors dan to efry pody elſe!</q>
—I ſhould not omit adding, that this very Director has been ſince charged, as I am well informed, <hi>openly to his face,</hi> with purchaſing notes!</p>
            <p>Some Directors, influenced more by private motives, than a regard for the duties of their appointment and the credit and character of the inſtitutions, make it a practice to examine the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030688_0009_0fe875f64c759728"/>Bank Books of individuals, and where complaints are made of the <hi>reduction of diſcounts</hi> without cauſe aſſigned, to offer as a reaſon, this ſort of reply— "You trade beyond your capital;" as if a man's Bank Book ſtood in the place of his ledger! Preſumptuous Dictators! who inveſted you with the inſolent authority of inquiſitors? Have you forgot from whence each of you ſprang—that to capital you owe nothing, to <hi>credit</hi> your very exiſtence!</p>
            <p>It is allowed by all experienced men that
<q>commerce cannot exiſt without mutual and extenſive credit.</q>
—Men of the moment, be cautious!—you have ſins to anſwer for—recollect that
<q>credit is gained by cuſtom and ſeldom recovers a ſtrain</q>
—read Anderſon, and learn what <hi>Banks</hi> are.</p>
            <p>"Although like private merchants," ſays he
<q>their circumſtances may not be alike proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at all times, we can ſee no benefit that can ariſe by ſuch <hi>minute enquiries,</hi> ſo long as they, to all appearance, are proſperous and punctual in all their affairs; neither do we apprehend theſe <hi>proper to be enquired into at all,</hi> unleſs there ſhould ariſe any reaſonable ſuſpicion of fraud: for as it has been a political obſervation of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030688_0010_0fe875fd35973918"/>long ſtanding, that even the reputation of great and powerful <hi>Monarchies</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> often ſubſiſt more by common fame or opinion than by real ſtrength or ability,—<hi>magis fama quam vi</hi>—ſo it may more ſtrictly and properly be applicable to a Bank and Bankers, of which we had a moſt pregnant inſtance a few years ago, at the breaking up and dividing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of <hi>an eminent partnerſhip</hi> of a <hi>private bank</hi> in London, which, for <hi>many years,</hi> had cleared or divided <hi>ſeveral thouſand pounds yearly</hi> for the partnerſhip; when upon valuing or appraiſing all the <hi>real ſtock</hi> of the partnerſhip before the higheſt judge of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> it appeared, even to that great man's amazement, that the whole did not amount to above <hi>three or four hundred pounds,</hi> conſiſting entirely of ſhop implements, and certain houſehold furniture,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>A certain Director ſome time ſince, upon an <hi>iron merchant</hi>'s applying to him, to know what were the objections to the paper which he had offered at Bank that had not been diſcounted, was told, "<hi>You ſhould ſell your iron</hi>!" This ſapient Director had, a day or two before, been applying himſelf <hi>for the iron</hi>; but the <hi>ironmonger</hi> expecting (as the Director alſo expected) that the price of iron
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030688_0011_0fe875fec04ea4d0"/>would riſe, preferred borrowing caſh, to ſelling goods to the Director at a riſk of great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the courſe of trade.</p>
            <p>Herein may be diſcerned the power acquired and the means uſed to profit by a knowlege of the apparent ſtate of individual credit as exhibited in their <hi>Bank Books</hi>—and in this way it is that we can account for numerous objections to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting of good notes.</p>
            <p>If the Directory of a Bank can <hi>occaſionally</hi> have "<hi>twenty thouſand dollars</hi>" divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>in one day,</hi> more than is uſual and cuſtomary for them to have diſcounted (which actually happened a few days ſince) they may with great eaſe keep "<hi>good accounts,</hi>" and out of the <hi>profits only</hi> by ſuch purchaſes—hopeful Directors!— graceleſs depoſits!</p>
            <p>When the Bank of England was inſtituted there were but <hi>four</hi> great or conſiderable Banks in Europe, all of which, excepting that of Genoa alone, were <hi>ſolely for the convenience of merchants</hi> 
               <note n="(5)" place="bottom">3 Anderſon 141.</note>; but our banks, by their ſyſtem of "good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,"
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030688_0012_0fe87605a3f54ab0"/>openly and avowedly give uſury the preference to the merchant.</p>
            <p>Will this mode of proceeding
<q>make money plentiful, <hi>trade eaſy and ſecure,</hi> raiſe the price of lands, <hi>draw the ſpecies of gold and ſilver into the hands of the common people,</hi>
               </q>
as we ſee it in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Genoa, and other places? <note n="(6)" place="bottom">And. 145</note> Perhaps it might tend to cure this evil, if the Directors were obliged to take a <hi>qualification oath,</hi> as is the caſe in the Directory of the Bank of England; <note n="(7)" place="bottom">Ibid. 146.</note> and as I find they have adopted in the Bank eſtabliſhment at Baltimore.</p>
            <p>The Bank of England to ſupport the credit of mercantile houſes, advanced in one week in the year 1763, 1,600,000 pounds ſterling, a great part of it in bullion, and extended its aſſiſtance even to <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
