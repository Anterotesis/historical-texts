         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SOME ſay, becauſe Chriſt died for ALL, that ALL will be ſaved; becauſe the ſcripture ſaith <q>that the LORD will have ALL men to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth</q> And as GOD is a Being of power, to perform his will, ſo conſequently none can be loſt.</p>

HOPKINTO'S. Say, CHRIST died for the Elect only, and they only can be ſaved: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' God calls upon all men to turn, repent, and be ſaved, that he doth not intend they ſhall, for he hath before decreed, their ſin and damnation, and that God intended ſin ſhould come into the world and make a part of the creation eternally miſerable: and to prove it, they ſay, God had power to ſave all, of he pleaſed; and that he delights as much in the damnation of thoſe that are damned, as in the ſalvation of thoſe that are ſaved.</p>
            <p>The Armenians ſays, children are born free from ſin, and if they do as well as they can, God will have mercy upon them, and ſave them.</p>
            <p>Shakers ſay, that men will be damn'd, if they lodge with their own wives, and that they muſt believe God through the mother, and the elders, or they cannot be ſaved, and that they muſt obtain victory over ſin and luſt, by dancing and ſhaking.</p>
            <p>Many ſchool maſters ſay, the bible is not a ſuitable book to bring into our common ſchools, but after children have learnt to read, they ſay it is more ſuitable for them to read in ſome hiſtory, idle tales, or novels.</p>

               <p>WE read of the laſt judgment, "That the dead ſmall and great, ſtand before God, and that the Sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead that were in them; and they were judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works: and death and hell were caſt into the lake of fire, which is the ſecond death; and they that were not written in the book of life, were caſt into the lake of fire, which is the ſecond death", and we read of no reſtoration after that in the holy ſcriptures.</p>

               <p>IF God has choſen the ſin and deſtruction of thoſe that are damned, then the ſcriptures muſt be read that God hath long choſen the ſin and deſtruction of the old world, inſtead of its being read, That the long ſufferings of God, waited in the days of Noah.</p>

               <p>IS this thy care, O vain ſchool-maſter? to neglect the bible in thy ſchool, and teach mockery and novelty; wilt thou render thy ſchools ſo much like a company of ſwine, that pearls ſhould not be caſt before them? wilt thou teach them ſo much abomination, that they will abominate thoſe who inſiſt on their attention to the ſcriptures, and require them to neglect their mockery, now in their youth.</p>

               <p>Bleſt is the man that truſts in God, knows his holy word, and turns his eyes from vanity, whoſe ſoul alone on God relies.</p>
               <p>Let us learn to deſpiſe the vain flatteries of men, and truſt in God. Can men pray to the God of truth, for his bleſſing on their novelties, or on their exhibitions and plays, do ſuch miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pray to God to lead them in the way of holineſs, when they are going to the place of wickedneſs, are they turning off their eyes from beholding vanity, and meditating on the law of God.

               <p>Be not of them that do evil, that good may come, whoſe damnation is juſt. Muſt we not give an account for every idle word, at the day of judgment? Some are ſaying, this new mode of learning is to make them great men.</p>
