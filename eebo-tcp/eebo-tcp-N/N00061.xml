            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>t unto the Apostles, that they by Institution might distribute the same unto several Offices in the Church. Hence,</p>
               <p>As all Church-Officers, especially Elders, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Teaching Elders,</hi> are ordinary Successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, in their several branches of Church-power: So <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Churches</hi> are their eminent ordinary Successors, in point of Counsel, and that in several respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because in Councils there is <hi>most light,</hi> and nearest to infallibility: and the more compleat, the better; though the most compleat Council may erre, because they have not a promise of infallible assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because when the Apostles themselves had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Churches, they did guide and counsel them how to use their power; as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. the Apostle did not act the Censure himself: and so is that of <hi>Paul</hi> to be interpreted, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Satan</hi>; viz. as I did the incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> by giving such counsel to the Church, whereof they were Members.

               <p n="7">VII. The Members constituent of a Council, are <hi>Church-Messengers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The persons sent ought to be <hi>Elders,</hi> of <hi>both Orders, Teaching</hi> and <hi>Ruling,</hi> to represent the whole Church; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

themselves.</hi> And the reason hereof is, Because, as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of Learned men, is to affect a Prelacy over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: So the temptation of the Fraternity, is to affect a Morellian Democracy. And therefore the wisdome of God hath by institution ballanced all Ecclesiastical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils with Members of <hi>both sorts,</hi> that may ballance each other, by <hi>Number</hi> at least, though not in <hi>Weight,</hi> yet enough to prevent any prevalency of a temptation, either to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate the Churches under any Prelatical Usurpation of the Learned; or to elevate and intoxicate the Fraternity, to affect any inordinate power: which rather, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually tends to enervate and evacuate Government, then to preserve any Lawful and just Liberty of the Brotherhood.</p>
               <p>The end of the Churches sending these Messengers, is to manage the Ordinance of <hi>Counsel</hi> in due order.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Organick parts of a Council, whereby they are enabled to manage their affairs in Prudence and Order, are <hi>Moderators,</hi> and <hi>Notaries:</hi> the choice of whom is the first act they do, to compleat themselves to be fit for action.</p>
               <p>It may sometimes edifie, to <hi>change Moderators</hi> every new Session, partly to train up each other unto that special work of Christ, in the management of the Affairs, and in caring for the publick welfare of all the Churches; and also to take trial of mens Gifts, Spirit and Abilities unto that high service; that so, when there may be special need, they may know who is most fit to manage the Council at such a time, for the glory of God, and for the most effectual Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and publick well being of the Churches.</p>
               <p>Though Moderators may be often changed, it is not fit that the Notaries should be so often changed.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Power of Ecclesiastical Councils is onely Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or Doctrinal: Power of <hi>Censure</hi> is by the Lord fixed in the <hi>Church</hi>; and hence, when any appeal unto a Council, it is for further and more clear light from the Scripture, and for conviction thereby, but not for the Exercise of any Juridical Power.</p>

               <p>Hence in such places where, through the riches of the Grace of Christ, Churches are numerous, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that the management of these Councils should be in Order, according to the Pattern of <hi>Compleat Councils, Acts</hi> 15. For multitude unordered, by how much the greater they are, the greater is their cumber, and unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to operate in Order unto their end. Lesser Bodies are more readily ordered, and have a greater aptitude to be active in their Order unto their end. <hi>Ordo anima rerum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Order</hi> is one of the <hi>Beauties of Heaven,</hi> and so it is of the Churches. <hi>Let all things be done in Order,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.40. <hi>Jerusalem is a City compacted,</hi> Psal. 122.3. and the more orderly Bodies are, the better are they compacted. Bodies that are compacted, are so ordered by <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Measure:</hi> The <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> is the most glorious City that ever shall be on Earth; and we see that it shall be compacted by <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> Rev. 21.12, <hi>to</hi> 18. and the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Number is <hi>Twelve,</hi> as appeareth <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>The wall of the City had twelve Foundations.</hi> And this Number <hi>Twelve</hi> is multiplied by <hi>Twelve,</hi> as appeareth <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. it is square, <hi>Twelve</hi> every way, which amounteth to One hundred forty and four.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Twelve Tribes</hi> in the Old Testament, and the <hi>Twelve Apostles</hi> in the New, do make that Number famous in the Churches, and fundamental in ordering and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacting of Churches into Ecclesiasticall Combinations of Councils.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Twelve Tribes</hi> compacted in order, was the most beautiful, and heart-ravishing Camp, that ever the worlds Eye did look upon, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.2, 5, 6. The <hi>Twelve Loaves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Type, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.4. the whole Visible Church is ordered, multiplied, and sealed in this Number.

               <p n="4">IV. In the <hi>perfect Pattern</hi> (for the Word is a <hi>perfect Rule</hi>) which the holy Ghost hath left us, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. as there is a ground work for the least of Councils, in the <hi>Two Churches</hi>; so of compleat Councils, in the <hi>Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, though <hi>Herod</hi> had killed <hi>James</hi> with the sword, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.2. his Martyrdome did not remove him out of the <hi>Foundation,</hi> but rather fix him in it: And the Apostles were most of them killed for <hi>the Testimony of Jesus</hi> before <hi>John</hi> had his <hi>Revelation,</hi> and yet we finde them all written in the Foundation of the <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore what should hinder, but that in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of <hi>Compleat Councils,</hi> we should lay our foundation in the Number <hi>Twelve?</hi> and all the Orders of Councils should be raised and compacted by that Number, even from the bottom to the top.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And unto this <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Number</hi> we may the rather be induced, because here will be the <hi>Twenty four Elders,</hi> who do wait upon, and worship the holy Majesty of God in all the Churches upon earth, as he hath pleased to reveal himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. where the presence of God among the Churches is revealed: First, with his glorious Angels next him, represented by the <hi>four living Creatures,</hi> according to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.

               <p>And when <hi>Twelve Provincial Councils</hi> shall, with like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, send forth from each of them <hi>one Teaching,</hi> and <hi>one Ruling Elder,</hi> the most holy and able among them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a <hi>National Council,</hi> they will still be strictly the <hi>Twenty four Elders,</hi> representing the whole Nation, in their Ecclesiastical state, before the Lord.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Twelve National Councils</hi> shall send forth, in like manner, from each of them, <hi>one Teaching,</hi> and <hi>one Ruling Elder,</hi> the most holy and fit among them, to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> (or by what other less term it may be thought meet to call it) they will still be strictly the <hi>Twenty four Elders,</hi> representing before the Lord all the Churches in all those Nations, concurring in the Election.</p>
               <p>And why may not this ascent, and representation of all before the Lord, be part of the meaning of that Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9, 11, 12, 14?</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And this point is the more to be heeded, because Gods visible respect unto, and acceptation of any people, is according to the good aspect and condition of their <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives.</hi> There may be much dross in a Parish, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, a Nation, and in the world; yet if they have good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives before the Lord, and if they carry the Lords matters well, in his sight, that doth obtain, through Christ, a favourable acceptation of, and dispensation towards all that are so represented. And he hath instituted Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the Church on earth: <hi>Aaron</hi> represented <hi>all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael on his breast before the Lord,</hi> Exod. 28.29. And a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil consisting of <hi>Messengers of Churches,</hi> the glory of Christ, do represent the Churches who send and constitute that Council, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. Oh! how happy were it for any people, to be in such visible instituted Order on earth, as that they may be (through Christ) acceptably represented before the Lord!</p>
               <p>For God is so well pleased to see his people in Order, as that he will dwell in that place, and call it by his own Name, <hi>Jehovah-Shammah</hi>; especially when they are Civilly, as well as Ecclesiastically in good order represented before Him.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:000101_0011_0FA028E2B191F8D0"/>VIII. Furthermore, this is to be considered, that though the <hi>Twenty four Elders</hi> are so called, by the least Number that they can be, by this Constitution; yet, according as the riches of Gods grace is more abundantly poured out, they may be more in Number, though under this constituting denomination. For, one Church may send forth <hi>two Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders,</hi> as <hi>Antioch</hi> sent forth <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> or <hi>Brethren</hi> proportionably. So likewise upon the same ground, when there be more <hi>Eminent Lights</hi> in any of the Councils (as through grace it is like often to be) they may send more then one to the <hi>Provincial,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical Councils:</hi> but still they are the <hi>Twenty four Elders,</hi> because that is the <hi>Foundation Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. What if I should illustrate this Point by that of the Apostles? who are often in Scripture called <hi>the Twelve Apostles,</hi> and yet there were more Apostles then <hi>Twelve:</hi> for who doubteth but that <hi>Paul,</hi> who was none of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> yet he was <hi>an Apostle,</hi> and <hi>a chief Apostle,</hi> a great Foundation; and <hi>Barnabas</hi> was <hi>an Apostle</hi> also, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.9. But <hi>Twelve</hi> is the <hi>Foundation Number,</hi> and therefore they are so denominated.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Again, though <hi>Twelve Churches</hi> be the lowest Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>first Combination,</hi> yet they may be more then <hi>Twelve,</hi> when the pourings out of Gods grace shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; yea, they may be any Number under <hi>Twenty four Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then <hi>Twenty three Churches</hi> should be in a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Messengers sent to the <hi>first Council</hi> will be a great Number; but still they are the <hi>Twenty four Elders</hi> before the Lord, by their fundamental Constitution.</p>
               <p>So a like Number of <hi>Provincial Councils,</hi> and a like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>National Councils,</hi> though their Messengers are many, yet they are still the <hi>Twenty four Elders,</hi> growing up, through grace, and increasing unto more <hi>Orders of Councils,</hi> for the greater glory of Christ.</p>
               <p>And when (through grace) there shall be <hi>Twenty four Churches,</hi> or <hi>first Councils,</hi> or <hi>Provincial,</hi> or <hi>National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> then they must be compacted into <hi>two Orders</hi> of those Councils, because <hi>Twelve</hi> is the Foundation Number, by which they are multiplied, and compacted. And when this is done, they are reduced to be <hi>Twenty four Elders</hi> strictly, the <hi>Foundation Number.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Quest. 3. <hi>May a Church Elect Elders or Messengers out of another Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto a publick and common service of Christ and of the Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, they may: For the <hi>great Collection</hi> of the <hi>Gentile Churches,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> carried up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at his last going thither, was an act of <hi>many Churches:</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> with those that went with him to present it, were <hi>chosen by the Churches</hi> unto that service, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And there were <hi>many more Churches Contributors,</hi> then there were <hi>Messengers sent to carry it. Acts</hi> 20.4. there were but seven or eight in <hi>Pauls</hi> company, but all the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Corinth, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> were Contributors. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Churches <hi>chose Messengers</hi> who were none of their own <hi>particular Churches,</hi> unto that <hi>publick and common ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Christ, and of the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the ready subjection of all the Churches about <hi>Antioch,</hi> and other places, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.4. unto the Decrees of the Council at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> doth probably speak, That, as the trouble by those <hi>Questions,</hi> was a <hi>common case</hi> in all the Churches; so they had some <hi>fore-knowledge, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000101_0014_0FA028EA968E0C40"/>Hence, when they chuse any of the Elders within the compass of their Order, they chuse those, who, in <hi>some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> are their own, in whom they have an <hi>Ecclesiastical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> especially unto this publick service of <hi>Counsel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. 4. <hi>May many Churches Elect a few of their Elders unto some publick and common service, wherein all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches so Electing are interessed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, they may: For <hi>all the Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Macedonia,</hi> &amp;c. did Elect <hi>a few</hi> to accompany <hi>Paul</hi> in carrying their Contributions unto <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> and it is expresly said, that from the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> there were but <hi>two sent,</hi> Acts 20.4. and we know there were at least <hi>seven Churches</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> Rev. 1.4.</p>
               <p>Quest. 5. <hi>When two, or a few Elders are chosen by many Churches unto some publick and common service of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, do they represent all the Churches who did Elect them unto that service?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, they do so: For when <hi>many Churches</hi> (by <hi>Paul</hi>'s ordering) sent <hi>a few</hi> Messengers to <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.23. to fetch their Contribution, to be carried (among the Contribution of many other Churches) unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Paul,</hi> and a few others, chosen by the Churches unto that service, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.19. these <hi>few Messengers</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present <hi>all the Churches who sent them:</hi> So as that what the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> should transact <hi>afore them,</hi> is expresly said to be <hi>afore all the Churches,</hi> viz. who sent them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.24.</p>
               <p>Quest. 6. <hi>These Orders of Councils, First, Second, Third, or representing fewer or more Churches, Are they a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Touching the <hi>first Councils,</hi> consisting of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Messengers of Churches</hi> sent for that end, it is out of question that these are a <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> Acts 15.</p>
               <p>The great difficulty is, touching the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third Orders of Councils,</hi> and so higher, unto the highest <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Council,</hi> whose Members are chosen immediately by Councils, yet with the express consent of every particular Church: not immediately by the <hi>Churches,</hi> but by their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching these, in way of humble Proposal I affirm,
<hi>That they are a Divine Institution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Because their <hi>Foundation, Formation,</hi> and <hi>Constitution,</hi> is deducible from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as appeareth by laying together the foregoing <hi>Questions,</hi> and <hi>Answers</hi> thereunto, with what hath been said before.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000101_0015_0FA028EBABBCA7C0"/>2. Because this <hi>multiplying of Order upon Order,</hi> seemeth to be typified in the <hi>Ascents</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and by the multiplication of the Number <hi>Twelve</hi> in the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> Rev. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Because if there be not this <hi>multiplying of Council above Council (above,</hi> I say, not in any <hi>Political Power,</hi> but in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi>) then it doth not yet appear that there is any way or expedient, whereby there should be a <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Equal</hi> Communion of all the Churches in a Nation, wherein every Church shall be, by their own act and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, interessed and concerned.</p>
               <p>Much less can there be an <hi>Equal</hi> Communion of Churches, of several Nations.</p>
               <p>For, if several Nations should need and desire to hold <hi>Communion of Councils,</hi> who shall chuse the <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> by whom this Communion shall be held and acted?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Princes</hi> chuse them, it is not a regular Ecclesiastical Council. If <hi>Churches</hi> chuse and send them, shall <hi>some Churches</hi> onely chuse them, or <hi>all the Churches?</hi> if <hi>some</hi> onely; <hi>who?</hi> and why <hi>they,</hi> and not <hi>others?</hi> and how can their act interest and oblige all?</p>
               <p>If <hi>all</hi> the Churches must chuse, then <hi>Immediately,</hi> or <hi>by Delegates: Immediately,</hi> it is unfeizible, especially to act in knowledge and prudence; but <hi>mediately</hi> by their <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and <hi>Representatives</hi> they may.</p>
               <p>The same may be said of the Communion of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in a Nation or Province, where Elections must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Representatives. In which way, a <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Equal</hi> Election is attainable; and without it, it doth not yet appear that it is attainable.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>several Nations</hi> ought to hold Communion, and also <hi>all the Churches</hi> in a Nation, it doth appear in these Scriptures: <hi>Isa.</hi> 19.23, 24, 25. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.32, 36. Of which see more in <hi>Synod at Boston.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being commanded by God, and as yet no Way or Expedient appearing, whereby it may be duely acted, we are at a great loss. Therefore the Lord opening this way, which is so attainable, and not without Scripture Light, What if the Churches should set upon the <hi>Tryall</hi> of it, and see how the Lord may appear unto his Servants therein? As for the <hi>Episcopal Way of Government,</hi> Alas! that is most remote from this Ordinance of <hi>Communion of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>

               <p>This act of the Church hath reference, not onely to the Constitution of the <hi>first Council,</hi> but also of all the rest. For seeing Churches are the <hi>Efficient Causes</hi> of Councils, none are to be chosen to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hence also it must be carefully and expressedly put into the Vote of this <hi>first act</hi> of the Churches Election, That they are chosen to carry on the Ordinance of <hi>Counsel</hi> in all the Orders of it, both in <hi>Provincial National,</hi> and <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Councils,</hi> even unto the highest point: for though all

               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:000101_0023_0FA028F8D2F560D8"/>And though they had fixed Elders in every Church, yet they did need the visitations, and frequently made use of the counsel of the Apostles and Evangelists, who were the <hi>permanent Councils</hi> of the Primitive Churches</p>
               <p>And though it hath pleased the wisdome of our great Lawgiver, to give us but <hi>one Example</hi> of an ordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and that he hath done, to be our perpetual guide in our ordinary way; yet there be many examples of the Churches need of, and frequent use of the Apostles and Evangelists counsel, whom they had alwayes with them, or knew <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> to repair unto them for their help.</p>
               <p>And we finde by much and long experience, that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Churches</hi> do stand in as much (if not more) need of <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>stated Councils,</hi> as the primitive Churches did, or the <hi>constant presence</hi> of the Apostles and Evangelists, alwayes for their <hi>directive,</hi> and often for their <hi>corrective help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We finde by experience, that our Churches do oftener need the <hi>directive</hi> help of Councils, then the <hi>corrective,</hi> and in both respects together we need them to be always in being.</p>
               <p>Many good works for the promotion of the Gospel and Kingdom of Jesus Christ do stick long in the birth, and languish: yea, oft miscarry and vanish for want of the help of Councils.</p>
               <p>Sundry Churches also, and remote places, ly long in the dark, without rood and help, for want of the orderly care of setled Councils; <hi>Every bodies work i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Disorders likewise, and insuperable distempers, by long fretting and burning in the bosom of sundry Churches, to the great dishonour of God, and scandal to the Saints, for want of <hi>stated Councils</hi>: some or other refusing (in the time of their temptations) to submit themselves unto the remedy, especially having that advantage, that without <hi>their consent,</hi> a <hi>pro-renascent Council</hi> may not be called; or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>stated</hi> meeting of the <hi>Provincial Councils,</hi> are once every <hi>quarter</hi>: and what if two of them be the first <hi>Third day</hi> after the Sun touches the middle point of the summer and winter <hi>Solstices</hi>?

               <p>Such <hi>Occasional Meetings,</hi> if foreseen, may be appointed by the Council before they rise; if not foreseen, then they must be called by the <hi>Moderator</hi> then in being, and the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> by Letters under either of their hands, where distance of place requireth it.</p>
