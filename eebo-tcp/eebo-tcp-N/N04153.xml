            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>PREFACE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER I had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome Part of the following <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> at the publick Lecture in BOSTON; I was repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly deſired to give a Copy of the ſeveral Sermons which
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:005117_0003_1016A823B4667590"/>I had ſome Years ago preached to my own People upon this Subject. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Preach'd at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 1739.</note> And when I called to Mind the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Acceptance they met with, when preached at Home; as well as the Approbation that Part of them met with, which was delivered A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I yielded to the Requeſt.</p>
            <p>But the grand Inducement was this, that I apprehended it to be a very uſeful Subject in itſelf, and a very ſeaſonable one for the preſent Day.</p>
            <p>For when there are ſo many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes among Chriſtians; what will ſerve better to compoſe, and calm their Spirits towards each other, than to be ſenſible of this, that thro' the Weakneſs, Ignorance, and remaining
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:005117_0003_1016A823B4667590"/>Corruption in Chriſtians, it may ſo happen, that they may widely differ in ſome Points from each other; and yet be the true Children of God? And what is there that has ſuch a happy Tendency to reſtore, and preſerve Charity, Peace, and Union one with another; as a full Perſwaſion that ſome who have different Sentiments from us, may, in the general, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence of the ſame gracious Spirit with us, Friends of CHRIST, united to him by Faith as well as <hi>we,</hi> as much concerned for the Honour and Intereſt of CHRIST as <hi>we,</hi> and as much concerned to get to Heaven as <hi>we,</hi> and may have as ſure a Title to that glorious Inheritance as <hi>we?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, as there are ſo many Diſputes about the true Marks and Signs of Adoption, and as to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may be reckoned the dear
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005117_0004_1016A8269CD38C10"/>Children of GOD; it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, when the glorious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of GOD'S Children, and the great Duty of ſeeking the cleareſt Evidences of being of that happy Number, are ſet forth; at the ſame Time to point out the many falſe and uncertain Marks that People are apt to fix upon, and reſt ſatisfied with, that ſuch ſelf-flattering and ſelf-deceiving Souls, may be ſhaken off from their falſe Foundations, and build their Hopes upon no other than what is laid in CHRIST, and in his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And although all who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Children of GOD, allow that the <hi>being led and governed by the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> GOD, is the ſureſt Mark of Adoption; yet even here Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans very often differ, and are in Danger of making Miſtakes; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:005117_0004_1016A8269CD38C10"/>ſome Things to be the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD'S SPIRIT, that are not; or denying ſome Things to be the Work of the SPIRIT of GOD, which do really come from him.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, ſeveral of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes are taken up in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Matter in the trueſt and cleareſt Light I was capable of; giving the Scripture, and only the Scripture Marks and Signs of being led by the SPIRIT of GOD. And by theſe Rules I deſire every Reader would carefully examine himſelf, and not reſt ſatisfied in any Tokens of Regeneration and Adoption, ſhort hereof.</p>
            <p>In reading this little Book, you will meet with very cloſe Queſtions; I deſire you would read them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, and after a ſerious Pauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005117_0005_1016A82B48F601A0"/>on them, put them very cloſely to your ſelves, and let Conſcience ſpeak the Truth.</p>
            <p>I entreat Chriſtians of every Party, who look over theſe Diſcourſes, to do it with Candour, and let the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Author have an Intereſt in your Prayers.</p>
            <p>And may the bleſſed SPIRIT, who (I hope) aſſiſted me in compoſing, aſſiſt you in reading, and ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany theſe Things into your Hearts, as that you may know by happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, what it is to be under his bleſſed and gracious Influences. And may that SPIRIT of GOD, <hi>who ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Things, even the deep Things of</hi> GOD, aſſiſt you in the Trial of your ſelves by his own Rules, and may he ſhine upon his own Work wherever it is wrought, and carry it
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:005117_0005_1016A82B48F601A0"/>on in your Souls, from one Degree to another, 'till it ſhall be perfected in Glory.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE whole World of Mankind is divided into two Sorts, <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Sinners;</hi> the Children of God, and the Children of the wicked One. And <hi>that</hi> which diſtinguiſhes Men, and truly fixes one or the other of theſe Characters upon them, is the <hi>Spirit within,</hi> which leads and governs
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005117_0007_1016A831A30E5998"/>them. For every Man is a Child of God, or a Child of the Devil, according to the Spirit he is govern'd by. They who are under the tyrannical Power of carnal, worldly, and wicked Principles are of their Father the Devil; whilſt ſuch as are governed by a divine and gracious Principle are the Children of God. My Text leads to conſider only this latter Sort of Perſons. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God. As many,</hi> how many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or what Nation or People, of what Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Condition of Life ſoever, and what different Perſwaſion ſoever as to ſome particular Points of Chriſtianity, and whatever Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion others may have of them, or they may have of others; yet if they are led by the Spirit of God, that is, if they are under the gracious Guidance and Government of the bleſſed Spirit, they are the Children of God.</p>
            <p>And as ſo many who are thus led and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd are the Children of God, ſo there are no more to be reckoned in that happy Number. For let Men be never ſo thoro' in their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, never ſo orthodox in their Principles, let them make never ſo high a Profeſſion, and appear never ſo zealous about religious Matters, let their Character run never ſo high among Men, even as the moſt eminent Saints; yet if they be not led, if they be not inlivened and influenced by the Spirit of God, he will not own them for his Sons, or his Daughters. For
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005117_0007_1016A831A30E5998"/>if any Man have not <hi>the Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, he is none of <hi>his,</hi> as in the 9th Verſe of the Context.</p>
            <p>And now without any further Opening the Words, or taking up your Time, in ſhewing how the Words ſtand related to the preceeding or following Part of the Chapter, which might afford many profitable Thoughts to us, I ſhall proceed immediately to conſider the doctrinal Truth which lyes very obvious in the Words, <hi>viz.</hi>

The ſame divine Spirit, the ſame gracious and heavenly Principle animates and actuates every Saint. For as all thoſe who are led by the Spirit of God are his Children; ſo all his Children are led by his Spirit. There is not ſo much as one real Saint upon Earth, but what is under the gracious and powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the divine Spirit, as the prevailing governing Principle in the Soul. Every Saint and true Believer is united to God and Chriſt by the holy Spirit. They dwell in him, and he in them <hi>by the holy Spirit, that is given to them <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John 4.13.</note>. There is one Body, and there is one Spirit</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. 4.4.</note>. As one Soul or Spirit animates the humane Body, even all the Organs and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, ſo the Church, that is, the living Members thereof, which are the Body of Chriſt, are animated and govern'd by one Spirit. They are all <hi>born</hi> of the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſo have the ſame divine Life breathed into them. They have thro' Chriſt acceſs <hi>by one Spirit</hi> unto the Father <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 2.18.</note>. And every true Believer is united one to another by the ſame Spirit that dwells in them.</p>
               <p>As the Son of God, the Seed of the Woman, was promiſed immediately after the Fall, and in the Fulneſs of Time was ſent into the World, to make Attonement for Sin, and to make Way for God to pardon and ſave all that believe in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005117_0008_1016A836E1E94258"/>him: So the Spirit of God was ſent into the World to begin and carry on the Work of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace in Men's Soul's. And this Spirit has been in the World operating upon, and leading and governing the Saints in all Ages from the Beginning of the World unto this Day.</p>
               <p>Indeed we read in our Saviour's Time (which was near four thouſand Years after the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>that the Holy Ghoſt was not</hi> YET <hi>given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John 7.39.</note>. And he tells his Diſciples that it was expedient for them, that he ſhould go away, for if he did not depart, <hi>the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, would not come unto them, but if he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would ſend him unto them</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">John 16.7.</note>. Which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may at firſt Glance look as if the Holy Ghoſt or the Spirit of God, had not been in the World, nor operating upon the Hearts of Men, 'till <hi>that</hi> Time.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>that</hi> Coming of the Holy Ghoſt which Chriſt foretells and promiſes, is not to be underſtood as if the Spirit of God had never been at all manifeſted before that Time; but it doubtleſs intends the more glorious Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, in thoſe extraordinary and <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts</hi> which were beſtowed upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and other Diſciples, after Chriſt's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion: And alſo the extraordinary <hi>gracious
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005117_0009_1016A839AC3FD5C8"/>Influences</hi> which he had on the Hearts of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes at that Time.</p>
               <p>But it is by no means to be underſtood as if the Spirit of God had not been operating upon the Hearts of Men before that Time. For it is certain that the Spirit of God had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating both Gifts and Graces, thro' all the Ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>All the Prophets of Old were inſpired with the Gift of Prophecy, from <hi>the ſame Spirit;</hi> for it was when the Spirit of the Lord was upon them, that they propheſied. <hi>For the Prophecy came not in old Time by the Will of Man, but holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1.21.</note>.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>ſame divine Spirit</hi> which has wrought powerfully and effectually upon true Believers ſince the Coming of Chriſt, wrought in and upon every gracious Saint from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World to <hi>that</hi> Time. <hi>The ſame Spirit</hi> that opened the Heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> to receive the Word, opened the Eyes of the Pſalmiſt to behold the wondrous Things out of God's Law. The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> which the Pſalmiſt prays might not be <hi>taken</hi> from him, and the <hi>free Spirit</hi> which he prays God to <hi>uphold him with</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 51.11, 12.</note>, was the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> who has been with, and has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held every Chriſtian in the Ways of God, and by whoſe mighty Power they have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005117_0009_1016A839AC3FD5C8"/>thro' Faith unto Salvation. In ſhort, there have been Strivings of the Spirit of God from the Beginning: And every one that has been bro't into a State of Grace, and ſo made a Child of God, from <hi>Adam</hi> to this Day, it has been by the gracious and powerful Operations of <hi>this</hi> Spirit.</p>
               <p>And as there is that <hi>Unity of the Spirit</hi> by which every real Member of Chriſt is <hi>united</hi> to him and to one another; ſo there is a great <hi>Uniformity</hi> in the Operations of this bleſſed Spirit, upon the Soul of every Saint; that is to ſay, he in the General forms the ſame Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Diſpoſition in them; puts them under the Influence of the ſame good Principle, and leads them to the ſame gracious Views and Deſigns in their Actions, ſo that it may be ſaid that in the General there is the ſame gracious Temper and Principle, the ſame gracious Views and Deſigns in every Child of God. And therefore whatever Difference there may be in their Sentiments upon ſome religious Points, and how hardly ſoever they may judge and treat one another; yet ſay, that if they are the Children of God they are in the General under the governing Influence of the ſame bleſſed Spirit; and it may be ſaid of all of them, that a Principle of Grace wrought by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is the prevailing Principle in their Souls.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this is a very important Truth; and yet perhaps not ſo much thought upon as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005117_0010_1016A83BC0213018"/>it ſhould be, and the due Conſideration of which would ſerve very much to direct Chriſtians how to conduct themſelves one towards another, I will therefore ſpend a few Minutes in illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and confirming this Point, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the other Propoſition which I have my Eye mainly upon.</p>
               <p>Here then let me briefly ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Children of God often differ from one another in many Points, and ſometimes carry theſe Differences to a very great Length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Notwithſtanding this, they are really under the governing Influence of the ſame divine Spirit, in the General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I will then mention ſome uniform Operations of the Spirit upon their Souls and ſhew wherein they agree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Children of God often differ from one another in many Points, and ſometimes carry their Differences to a very great Length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For altho' God has favoured his Church with as clear and as full a Revelation as is needful to inſtruct us in every Thing <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be known or done; yet as to many <hi>other Things</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is not ſo particular, but it leaves Room and gives Occaſion for a great Variety of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions among the Diſciples of Chriſt: Which is too evident to need a Proof, and the Inſtances too many to pretend to mention them. The many Diſputes that have been among Chriſtians
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005117_0010_1016A83BC0213018"/>about doctrinal, yea, and practical Points from the Apoſtles Times to this Day, are a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration hereof.</p>
               <p>And theſe Differences in Opinion and in Practice, have ariſen very much from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Education, and from the different Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages Men have had for gaining Light and Knowledge; yea, and from the different Powers and Capacities of Men for ſeeing into Things, and judging upon them, ſome having a much greater Reach and Extent of Thought than others. Theſe Differences may alſo ariſe from the different Humour and Temper of Men, for there is ſuch a Difference even in Men's Conſtitutions, as inclines ſome Men to one Way of Thinking, and ſome to another Way.</p>
               <p>But then Chriſtians have not contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with having different Opinions, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Methods of practiſing in ſome particular Inſtances; but have indulged themſelves in hard Thoughts, and ſevere Cenſuring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. One has judged his Neighbour, and his Neighbour has deſpiſed him. Oh how have the Children of God thro' Weakneſs and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in themſelves been charging <hi>theſe</hi> and worſe Things upon their chriſtian Brethren! How common is it for the Children of God to place ſo much of their Religion in thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Things wherein they differ (or even they think they differ) from others, as to condemn
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005117_0011_1016A83D8CFF35A0"/>all that don't come exactly into the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and run the ſame Lengths with them? —Nay, it would be a Breach of chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not to ſuppoſe, that even God's own Children have perſecuted one another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Power that has been in their Hands: Caſting them out of their Communion, and loading them with Reproaches, and inflicting heavy Puniſhments upon them, nay, I dare not ſay to the contrary, but that God's own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have been ſo far left to their own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Ignorance and Prejudice with the other remaining Luſts, as to kill one another for their Differences in Religion, thinking herein to do God good Service.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Notwithſtanding this, all the Children of God are under the governing Influence of the ſame divine Spirit in the General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the Difference be ſometimes ſo wide between true Chriſtians as I have mentioned, yet they are united by the Spirit of God, and are in the General under the prevailing Influence of the ſame gracious Principle.</p>
               <p>But here I would not be miſtaken; I don't ſay that in the Things wherein they differ, or wherein they uncharitably cenſure or perſecute each other, that in <hi>theſe</hi> they are under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Influence of the divine Spirit. No, the judging and treating each other in ſuch a ſevere and uncharitable Manner, is frequently
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005117_0011_1016A83D8CFF35A0"/>from their Weakneſs and Ignorance, and too, too often from the Remains of Pride, Paſſion, and other Luſts, that are found in them. But what I mean is, that ſome who have gone even to ſuch extraordinary Lengths in contending about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Matters as I have mentioned, may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be under the governing Influence of the ſame good Spirit, and the ſame gracious Principle in general, with thoſe they contend with, and treat after ſuch a Manner.</p>
               <p>For altho' all the Children of God are led by the Spirit of God, yet this don't ſuppoſe the having a <hi>Spirit of Infallibility;</hi> ſo as to be led into every Truth whether neceſſary or no, or to be kept from every Error: Nor does it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe every Saint to be ſo under the governing and reſtraining Influences of the Spirit, as to be conſtantly kept from all out-breakings of Sin and Corruption, or from the Power of every Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This would be a State of Perfection which the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had not attained unto <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. 3.12.</note>, nor is it to be expected in the preſent World.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God is not concern'd to have every one that is born of the Spirit, perfectly to agree in all their Thoughts, and in all their Methods of acting, as to the Non-eſſentials of Chriſtianity; but for wiſe &amp; holy Ends ſuffers it to be otherwiſe. He don't ſee Cauſe to ſave them from every Error, that is not fatal, nor from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005117_0012_1016A8409F2F3EF0"/>every Degree of Corruption that is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a Principle of Grace. And if we don't allow this to be the Truth, I know not where to find any of the Sons of God. It is the Confeſſion of one of Chriſt's own Apoſtle's, <hi>That in many Things we offend all <note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. 3.2.</note>. And who can underſtand his Errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret Faults,</hi> was the humble Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and Prayer of the Man after God's own Heart <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 19.12.</note>.</p>
               <p>So that Men may run into ſome Errors in Judgment, and may practiſe upon theſe Errors ſo as widely to differ from one another, and hardly cenſure, and ſeverely perſecute each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet it is poſſible they may all of them have the Spirit of God leading and governing them in their general Courſe.</p>
               <p>Nay, I think I may venture to ſay, that even the gracious Principle that is within them, thro' the Ignorance and Error that God ſuffers ſtill to abide with them, may be the Means of ſome of the Contentions of chriſtian Brethren, and of their zealous Perſecutions of each other. That is, it is poſſible that the Aim and the Principle may be good in both Parties, a Concern for the Honour of God and Chriſt, and for preſerving the ſuppoſed Truths, and maintaining the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Duties of his holy Religion, may prompt both Parties to be ſevere upon one another.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005117_0012_1016A8409F2F3EF0"/>And the Error may be only in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Judgment, and ſo in applying this Concern for the Honour of God, and of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in a wrong Caſe, or in an undue Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or in an improper Method.</p>
               <p>My Meaning is, that Men who are apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in great Oppoſition to each other, may have the <hi>ſame honeſt good Principle at the Bottom.</hi> And their Ignorance, Weakneſs and Miſtake is the Cauſe of their oppoſing one another. And they are really contending for the ſame Thing ultimately, but in a different Scheme.</p>
               <p>And why ſhould it be thought an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Degree of Charity to ſuppoſe this? Don't we ſee Men purſuing the Profits of this World in very different, yea, in ſeemingly contrary Ways: And yet we have no doubt but that both of them have a ſufficient Love to the World, and real Deſires to get what they can of it. One Trader we ſhall ſee ſelling his Goods as dear as he can, thinking that to be the likelieſt Way to get an Eſtate. Another we ſhall ſee ſelling his Commodities as cheap as poſſibly he can afford, thinking this to be the moſt probable Way of increaſing his Cuſtom, and ſo that he ſhall find his Profit in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Now theſe Men may think amiſs of each other, and be offended at each other, eſpecially when their Buſineſs may interfere, but who will queſtion, but that they are both ſet upon gaining the World? And why may it not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005117_0013_1016A84637C6B790"/>ſometimes be ſo among Men as to the Things of God and of Religion? Nay, it muſt needs be ſo in many of thoſe Caſes wherein we ſee Chriſtians contending with one another. For we ſhall by an intimate Acquaintance with ſome of both Parties, be obliged in a Judgment of Charity to rank them among the Children of God.</p>
               <p>Who ever doubted but that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> were both good Men, eminently holy and good Men; and yet they who had been ſuch intimate Friends and Companions in the Service of Chriſt and of his Goſpel; differ'd at length and fell into ſuch a <hi>ſharp Contention, that they departed aſunder the one from the other</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 15.39.</note>. And whoever reads the Occaſion of it, will be led to fear that it was not owing entirely to Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Miſtake of Judgment, but that Paſſion and Self-Will and ſuch like Remnants of the <hi>old Man,</hi> had a Hand in the Quarrel, which very likely they ſaw, and were humble for afterwards.</p>
               <p>But now you will be ready to ſay, that if ſuch who are led by the ſame Spirit even the Spirit of God, do oftentimes ſo widely differ, and have ſuch fierce Oppoſitions, wherein do they agree? Or what uniform Influences of the Spirit may be found in them? And this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005117_0013_1016A84637C6B790"/>leads me to the third Thing propoſed under the firſt Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I am to mention ſome Inſtances, wherein all true Chriſtians agree, or ſome of the uniform Operations of the bleſſed Spirit upon their Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For whatever Difference or Oppoſition there is among Chriſtians; yet the divine Spirit is uniform in his Operations and Influences upon their Souls. And conſequently there muſt be in the general, the ſame Views, the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples governing thoſe to whom the Spirit of God comes in a ſaving effectual Manner. For altho' there may appear ſome Diverſity in the Operations of the Spirit; yet this Appearance ariſes from the different Tempers, the different Education, the different Capacities, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Employments, Temptations and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Perſons who are wrought upon, and not from any real Difference in the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With Reſpect to true Chriſtians (for of ſuch only am I ſpeaking) there is in all of them, the ſame Principle of</hi> FAITH <hi>in God, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, wrought by the divine Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every true Chriſtian is led by the Spirit to believe not only that <hi>God is,</hi> and that he is <hi>a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him;</hi> but is alſo led by the ſame Spirit to believe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is;</hi> and that he is the <hi>only</hi> &amp; the <hi>almighty
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005117_0014_1016A847E4268828"/>Saviour.</hi> Accordingly every true Believer is led to have his <hi>Dependance</hi> upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for Salvation.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible that true Believers may have ſome different Conceptions as to ſome Circumſtances relating to the Way of our Salvation by Chriſt, and may have different Ways of explaining their Faith in, and Dependance upon him: But they have all really the ſame Truſt in Chriſt, and hearty Acceptance of him, wrought in them by the Spirit. For this Faith according to the Goſpel Covenant is abſolutely neceſſary to the Being of a true Chriſtian, and to his find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Acceptance with God, and obtaining Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In every Child of God there is the ſame real</hi> SORROW <hi>for</hi> SIN, <hi>and</hi> HATRED <hi>of it, wrought by the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherever the Spirit of God works effectually beſure he <hi>convinces of Sin,</hi> and begets real Grief and Shame for every Thing which Conſcience accuſes the Man of as ſinful, and there is a real Hatred begotten in all ſuch, of every Thing that appears to them as ſinful, and there is a Reſolution and Care wrought in every ſuch Soul, to depart from all Manner of Sin, <hi>even from their own Iniquity</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 18.23.</note>, and ſuch a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the only Repentance unto Salvation. <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark 16.16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005117_0014_1016A847E4268828"/>
Indeed the Children of God may differ about ſome Things whether they be ſinful or no. For altho' as to moral Sins in general, eſpecially the groſſer Ones, they are ſo plainly ſet down in the Bible, that nothing but groſs Ignorance and great Careleſsneſs would lead Men into any Error as to them, yet there are ſome Things wherein the Revelation is not ſo clear, but there may very eaſily Diſputes ariſe whether <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> be a Sin or no. But in all the Children of God there is this Principle wrought, by his Spirit, heartily to mourn and grieve for all that they are ſenſible they have done amiſs, and to hate and ſtrive againſt every Thing that appears plainly to them to be contrary to the Will of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is in every Child of God the ſame Principle of</hi> SINCERE <hi>and</hi> SUPREME LOVE <hi>to God and Chriſt, by the ſame Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is abſolutely neceſſary for every true Chriſtian, and to his being ſuch an one. For <hi>to love the Lord our God with all our Heart,</hi> &amp;c. is the firſt and great Commandment <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 22.37, 38.</note>. And unleſs we love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt above every Thing in this World; yea, and above our very Lives, we cannot be his Diſciples <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke 14.26.</note>. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly every Child of God has the Love of God and of Chriſt, ſhed abroad in his Heart by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005117_0015_1016A84AE7044418"/>the Holy Ghoſt, whereby he has the higheſt Eſteem of God, and of the Redeemer, real Deſires after him, and Delight in him, and an hearty Concern for his Honour and Glory.</p>
               <p>But now a Zeal for the Honour of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, for Want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to direct it, is oftentimes the Cauſe of great Diviſions, and ſharp Contentions among chriſtian Brethren. For one thinks that by theſe Doctrines, and by theſe Methods of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, Chriſt is diſhonoured, and ſo he is zealous againſt them. The other thinks they rather tend to the Honour of Chriſt, and ſo is as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for them. In both which Caſes they may poſſibly be govern'd by the ſame Principle of Love, and have the Honour of Chriſt equally at Heart. And it is the Ignorance or Miſtake of one or both that cauſes the Difference.</p>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is in all of them the ſame Principle of</hi> SUBJECTION <hi>and</hi> OBEDIENCE <hi>to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Child of God has a Senſe of his divine Authority, and of his ſovereign Right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Laws to all his Creatures, and he looks upon the revealed Will of God in his Word, as the Rule for him to walk by, and the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of every gracious Soul is, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord my God ſhall ſay unto me, that will I do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the Children of God may differ in their Opinion in ſome leſſer, and more obſcure
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005117_0015_1016A84AE7044418"/>Points, ſo far as that one may think <hi>that</hi> a Duty, which the other thinks rather a Sin than a Duty, and ſo from the ſame Principle one may refrain from it, and the other comply with it.</p>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There is in all the Children of God the ſame Spirit of</hi> LOVE <hi>and</hi> CHARITY <hi>towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Child of God loves his Brother, and in ſome Degree comes up to the Command, of loving his Neighbour as himſelf. And altho' a great Part of what paſſes in the World for <hi>brotherly Love</hi> is mere Counterfeit, and is only <hi>in Word</hi> and <hi>in Tongue;</hi> yet I have ſo much Charity as to believe that true real Love and Charity is ſometimes concealed under ſuch Carriage and Behaviour towards one other as ſeems very oppoſite to it.</p>
               <p>For we muſt underſtand that this Charity to our Neighbour, conſiſts not only in thinking as well as we can of him, but in wiſhing well to him, and in doing thoſe Things which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend will be moſt uſeful and beneficial to him, both to his Soul and Body. And now this gives a great Latitude in the Manner of treating one another; and yet preſerving a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love at the Bottom. And the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Treatment may ariſe from the different Apprehenſions Men may have of manifeſting
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005117_0016_1016A84F000A2990"/>their Love to one another. For Charity towards our Neighbour, don't ſuppoſe, but that we may ſee his Faults, and apprehend him to be in Errors, and if ſo then the Principle of Love may work very differently, according to the different Apprehenſions Men may have as to the Manner of treating ſuch a Neighbour, ſo as will be the greateſt Kindneſs to him.</p>
               <p>Thus one who looks upon his Neighbour to be in a Fault, or in an Error, apprehends a mild and gentle Management will beſt Anſwer the End, for convincing and reclaiming a faulty Brother, and in this Way manifeſts his Love to him. Another thinks that ſuch a gentle Way of treating him, would be hurtful to the Man himſelf, and dangerous to others, and ſo from the ſame Principle of Love, proceeds in a more ſevere and rigorous Manner with him. And now ſometimes one, and ſometimes the other of theſe may be in the Wrong in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their different Means to recover their Brother that is in an Error or overtaken with a Fault: And yet they may have an equal Love to him, and an equal Deſire to recover him out of the Snare that he is fallen into.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee how that <hi>all the Children of God are under the governing Influence of the ſame Spirit, even the Spirit of God,</hi> and are animated and actuated in the general from the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and gracious Principle. And the many Differences and Oppoſitions that are among
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005117_0016_1016A84F000A2990"/>thoſe, are no ſufficient Objection againſt this Doctrine. For the Differences and Diſſentions that are among them, are about leſſer Matters and not the eſſential Points of Chriſtianity, and they ariſe from their Ignorance and Short-Sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, their Prejudices of Education; or from the Remainders of Pride and Corruption, which God for wiſe and holy Ends ſuffers to be among his Children in the preſent State.</p>
               <p>So that abating the Remains of Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Saints; and all that is neceſſary to bring them to rights; that is to a regular uniform Way of thinking and acting, according to the uniform Operations of the Spirit, is to bring them to the ſame Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Things. For they having the ſame gracious Diſpoſitions in their Hearts, if they knew as much, and tho't alike, they would manage alike. But becauſe they are weak and ignorant, they <hi>think as Children,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak as Children,</hi> and they ſcuffle, and often-times quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel as Children. And they muſt come to riper Years, to more Knowledge; yea, to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Grace, before they will entirely put away thoſe <hi>childiſh Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude at preſent, and ſo finiſh this Propoſition, by making two or three <hi>practical Reflections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Since every Child of God is under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Influence of the ſame bleſſed Spirit in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005117_0017_1016A85392C43AD0"/>general; notwithſtanding the Differences that are among them: Surely <hi>we ought to be very cautious in judging and cenſuring thoſe who in ſome Points do differ from us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more common than for Chriſtians to judge hardly of thoſe who differ from them, either in doctrinal or practical Points. For all are ready to think that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> are ſo <hi>plainly</hi> on <hi>their</hi> Side, that they cannot think thoſe to be honeſt who diſſent from them; but that they wilfully ſhut their Eyes againſt the Light. This, I ſay, is commonly the Way of all Sides, and conſequently one Side, or both, muſt needs be in the Wrong. Surely then it becomes all to be humble and modeſt wherein they differ, and not be raſh in condemning all by Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale, who don't come into the ſame Sentiments, and the ſame Methods of Management with them. For ſome of thoſe that you thus judge, may, for ought you know, be under the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſame <hi>divine Spirit,</hi> and be governed by the ſame <hi>gracious Principle,</hi> and be the <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sons of Zion,</hi> as well as you.</p>
               <p>And therefore before you judge hardly of any profeſſing Chriſtians, you muſt obſerve, as far as you can, what Spirit they appear to be governed by. But becauſe this lies very much out of your Sight, you muſt take Care that you don't aſſume the divine Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Inſtead therefore of your being ſudden, and free in your judging of others, eſpecially as to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005117_0017_1016A85392C43AD0"/>their State, conſider whether they don't appear to act from as good a Principle as you. And whether about thoſe Things wherein you agree they don't appear to be as much concerned for the Honour of God, and the Intereſt of Chriſt as you. Whether they don't appear to hate <hi>Sin,</hi> and to love Holineſs, as much as you. And in ſhort, Whether they don't appear as conſcientiouſly careful to do the Will of God as you; and if ſo, why then ſhould you not think as charitably of them as of your ſelves? Nay, and if they ſhould be ſo uncharitable as to cenſure and condemn you, and altho' this ſhould be contrary to the Word and Will of God, and ſo ſhould ariſe from their Ignorance, or remaining Corruption; yet you muſt take Heed of judging and condemning them. For altho' raſh judging be a Fault, yet the Caſe may be ſuch as that there may be ſo much Ignorance, Miſtake and Prejudice in Men's Judgments, that their cenſuring and condemning others may not be incompatible with a State of Grace. <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth, for God hath received him</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 4.3, 4, 10, 13.</note>.</p>
               <p>There are many whom a proud, uncharitable World judge and condemn whom God will receive; for he ſees and knows they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by his Spirit: And many others who are
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005117_0018_1016A855B4349408"/>applauded for eminent Saints will be rejected, becauſe Chriſt ſees they have nothing of the Spirit of God in them. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant; to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth. Why doſt thou then judge they Brother? Or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother? We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt. Let us not therefore judge one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt beware of abuſing the Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, by indulging our ſelves in Ignorance, or giving way to our Corruptions, flattering our ſelves all the while, that we are in the General under the governing Influence of the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many People are apt to imagine that they are led by the Spirit of God when they are not: And that altho' they differ from this, and the other, &amp; altho' they behave themſelves very much amiſs; yet they flatter themſelves, that all this is conſiſtent with their being <hi>led by the Spirit of God</hi> in general. But here Men muſt beware that they don't deceive themſelves, as well as others in this Way. For you muſt remember that Multitudes flatter themſelves that they are <hi>led by the Spirit of God,</hi> when they are really leſſ by the Spirit of Ignorance, and this very often wilful and allowed Ignorance: Or with a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Error and Deluſion: And this thro' Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs and Sloth, becauſe they will not take Pains to ſearch out the Truth. Sometimes Men
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005117_0018_1016A855B4349408"/>think they are inſpired with a flaming Zeal for the Glory of God, when perhaps it is all from a Spirit of Pride and Paſſion, or of a particular Party. And Perſons are oftentimes thought to be Men of Steadineſs and Conſtancy, when perhaps there has been only a wilful and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Spirit all the while. I ſay, many will flatter themſelves that they have a good Spirit, and that they do Things from an honeſt and gracious Principle, and out of Regard to God and Duty, when perhaps there was only ſome carnal, corrupt and wicked Principle at the Bottom.</p>
               <p>For as the Devil can, and does ſometimes <hi>transform</hi> himſelf <hi>into an Angel of Light,</hi> ſo by his ſubtle Devices Mens Luſts and irregular Paſſions will oftentimes ſo transform themſelves as to appear like Vertues and Graces of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>You muſt therefore beware of being deceived this Way. And you muſt conſider that altho' there may be different Opinions, and hard Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, among God's own Children; yet that many, and I may ſay, moſt of the religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Differences, are among thoſe that have the leaſt of the Spirit of God; and very commonly among thoſe that have nothing at all of that good Spirit within them.</p>
               <p>If therefore you would judge what Spirit you are of, and by what Spirit you are led, you muſt ſee whether you can find thoſe uniform Influences of the Spirit, that are found in all
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005117_0019_1016A859100DE0E8"/>good Men, and in which they all agree. You muſt ſee whether there be that Sorrow for, and real Hatred of all Sin; whether there be an hearty Faith in Chriſt, and Dependance upon him, and Subjection to him. Whether there be that ſincere and ſupreme Love to God and Chriſt, and that fervent Love and Charity to our Neighbour, which the Spirit of God works in every Soul where he dwells.</p>
               <p>And if you don't find theſe Things, you may depend upon it, that you have not the Spirit of God; how zealous ſoever you may be for ſome Things in Religion, and how earneſtly ſoever you may contend for them.</p>
               <p>And let me tell you farther, that if theſe Operations of the Spirit which are found in every Child of God are very prevalent, they will prevent a great many of the unhappy Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which are among Chriſtians. For the ſharp Contentions that are among them are not from the Strength of their Graces, but from their Ignorance, Weakneſs, and remaining Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. And the more Grace Men have, the leſs Difference in their Opinions, beſure leſs Difference in their Affection. So that when Chriſtians, good Chriſtians, are contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Matters of Religion, the more fierce and furious they are againſt one another, the leſs of the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> for this <hi>Spirit,</hi> tho' it will lead them to <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> even for the fundamental
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005117_0019_1016A859100DE0E8"/>Doctrines of Chriſtianity; yet in leſſer and lower Points it will teach them to be humble, meek and modeſt, and to exerciſe that Charity towards their chriſtian Neighbours that <hi>ſuffereth long,</hi> and is <hi>kind,</hi> that is not <hi>envious</hi> and <hi>vaunting,</hi> that is not <hi>puffed up,</hi> nor doth it <hi>behave it ſelf unſeemly,</hi>—that <hi>is not eaſily provoked,—beareth all Things, believeth all Things, hopeth all Things, endureth all Things</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 7.</note>. Now therefore when Differences are carried on among Chriſtians without any of this Charity, but inſtead thereof there is a deſpiſing, a judging, and defaming one another, and dividing and ſeparating Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are freely indulg'd, they only deceive themſelves, if they think they are led by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How earneſt ſhould we be that the Spirit of God would</hi> UNITE <hi>Chriſtians more and more in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment, which might prevent many of the ſinful and unhappy Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are among thoſe whom we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope are led by the ſame gracious Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How earneſt ſhould we be that he would ſcatter the Darkneſs and the Ignorance that is upon the Minds of ſome good Chriſtians: And free them more from the Remains of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence their Differences ariſe. And that he would give them the ſame Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005117_0020_1016674C91332320"/>and unite them in the ſame Judgment, as well as in the ſame internal Principle of Grace. For you muſt know that altho' good Men may think and act very differently in ſome Things; yet there is a true and a falſe, a right and a wrong Way. You muſt therefore pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly that the Spirit of Truth would lead you into Truth, and conduct you in the Paths of Righteouſneſs for his Name's Sake.</p>
               <p>And as ever you expect or deſire this, you muſt be honeſt and upright. <hi>For the Integrity of the Upright ſhall guide them</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. 11.3.</note>. You muſt be meek and teachable, <hi>for the meek will he guide in Judgment, the Meek will he teach his Way</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 25.9.</note>. Moreover, you muſt be ſubmiſſive and obedient to the Will of God, ready at all Times to comply with whatever appears to be his Will. <hi>If any Man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">John 7.17.</note>.</p>
               <p>In a Word, the Differences that are among good Men, (as I have told you) ariſe from Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Weakneſs, Prejudices of Education, remains of Pride, Paſſion, Self-Will, and other Corruptions: And therefore the Way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe unhappy Differences, is to get more and more from under the unhappy Influence of theſe Things. And becauſe they will not be thoro'ly purged away till we get to Heaven, ſo we muſt wait till we get to thoſe happy Regions
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005117_0020_1016674C91332320"/>of Light and Love, before we ſhall ſee a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and delightful Harmony among the Sons of God. Oh! then, <hi>my dearly Beloved!</hi> how ſhould the Thoughts of this recommend Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us, and fill us with longing Deſires after that bleſſed Place, where every Error and Miſtake among the Children of God will be rectified, where all their Ignorance will be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, where all their little Prejudices and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels will be forever laid aſide, and where they will think alike, and ſpeak alike, and inſtead of unhappy Separations and Diviſions, will all unite in perfect Love and Charity with one another, and moſt harmoniouſly agree in ſhouting forth the Praiſes of God, and of the Lamb, who <hi>has redeemed them to God by his Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>firſt Propoſition</hi> I have already ſpoken to, and ſhewed <hi>that all the Children of God are led and govern'd by one and the ſame Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under which I have told you, that the Spirit of God has been ſtriving with the Children of Men from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Days, even before as well as ſince the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt: And that there is no Child of God but what has experienced the gracious Influences of the divine Spirit upon his Soul: And that they are all in the General under the Influence of the ſame gracious Principle. That however they may differ in their Sentiments as to ſome particular <hi>Points of Doctrine,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Difference there may be in their <hi>Forms of publick Worſhip,</hi> or in their Modes of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> in the Church: And how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever they may judge, and how ſeverely ſoever they may cenſure each other; yet if they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005117_0021_1016A85EC8671F80"/>be the real Children of God, they have the ſame divine gracious Principle that they are, in the general, under the governing Influence of They, notwithſtanding all their Differences, and their Separations, are united to Chriſt, and united to one another, by one and the ſame Spirit. And I further ſhew'd you, That altho' <hi>they</hi> did ſo widely differ in their Sentiments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome particular Points, and in their Opinions of one another, and in their Practice relating to Modes of Diſcipline and Worſhip; yet there were many uniform Operations of the Spirit upon their Souls, even the ſubſtantial Parts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein they agreed. Such as <hi>Faith in God,</hi> and in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſincere and ſupreme <hi>Love</hi> of the divine Being, a Principle of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> of Sin, and of <hi>Subjection,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to God, and of ſincere and fervent <hi>Charity</hi> to their Fellow-Creatures. For as all theſe Things are neceſſary to our being true Chriſtians, ſo they are wrought in all of them by the Spirit of God. And all the unhappy Differences that are among them, ariſe from Ignorance and Weakneſs, from Prejudices of Education, from Pride, Self-will, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of other Luſts and Corruptions, which God for wiſe and holy Ends ſuffers to be in his own Children. And I further obſerved to you, That a ſerious Thought upon theſe Things would correct a great deal of that uncharitable raſh Judging that prevails in the World, and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005117_0022_1016A86322C9BF18"/>would prevent many of the fierce Contentions, the Separations and Diviſions, which have rent and torn the Church of God to Pieces.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the ſecond Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prop. II. <hi>The ſureſt, and cleareſt Evidence of our being the Children of God, is our being</hi> LED <hi>and</hi> GOVERN'D <hi>by the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> This is the very Thing that determines a profeſſing Chriſtian to be a Child of God. If he be under the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a divine and gracious Principle, he is a Child of God, and will be ſo owned and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God, let the World think never ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of him. On the other Hand, Let a Man make never ſuch a fair Shew in Religion, let his Character run never ſo high, let him be canonized as a moſt excellent Saint; yet if he has not been led by the Spirit of God, if he has not been acted from a truly gracious Principle, God will never look upon him, or own him, as one of his Children, but will treat him as a <hi>Baſtard,</hi> rather than as a <hi>Son.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Indeed it may be ſaid in ſome Reſpects, that we are all the Children of God. We are ſo by Creation, for we derived our Beings from him, and in him we <hi>live</hi> and <hi>move.</hi> This the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were ſenſible of.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 17.28.</note> And one of the Lord's <hi>Prophets</hi> ſays much the ſame: <hi>Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us?</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mal. 2.10.</note> Moreover we may all be called the Children of God, upon Account of the Care and Goodneſs of divine Providence, that is exerciſed over and towards us.

            <p>But then there are ſome who are the Children of God by <hi>ſpecial Grace.</hi> God of his meer Mercy and free Grace <hi>adopts</hi> ſome of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men for his Sons and his Daughters; whom he takes particular Notice of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſpecial and peculiar Favours upon them, beyond what he does upon the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Now they are ſuch SONS, ſuch CHILDREN of God as thoſe which my Text ſpeaks of. And THOSE have moſt glorious Privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, and are truly in the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py State of any Men in the World.

Is it any Honour to be deſcended from, or related to the Kings and Potentates of the World? How much greater Honour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the King of Heaven? What is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being born of earthly Princes, to what it is to be born of God, to be born of the Spirit of God? Is it any Honour to be Partakers of the divine Nature, to have the Image of God upon our Souls, which conſiſts in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs; and to be reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling God in all his moral Perfections? Is it any Honour to be reſtored to the primitive Rectitude, Perfection, and Glory of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, which was but <hi>little lower than the Angels, crowned with Glory and Honour?</hi> Furthermore, Is it any Honour for God to own us as his Sons, and to give us Leave to call him Father, and to have the only <hi>begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> not aſhamed to call us <hi>Brethren?</hi> Or to treat us with Freedom and Friendſhip as ſuch? Finally, Is it any Honour to be eſteemed, and loved, and honoured by God, and Chriſt, and all the Angels in Heaven, as the excellent Ones in all the Earth? Why! Such <hi>Honour</hi> have all the <hi>Saints,</hi> all the <hi>adopted Children of God.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Children of God enjoy many</hi> DISTIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUISHING PRIVILEDGES AND ADVAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGES <hi>in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God having of his free Grace adopted them into his Family, and number'd them among his
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005117_0024_1016A868CD6273E0"/>Children, he ſhews the Kindneſs, the Care, and Tenderneſs of a Father to them. He exerciſe his Wiſdom, his Power, and his Goodneſs, in contriving and bringing about Things for their Good, and in preſerving, protecting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending from the Evils of the World; or in ſupporting them under them, or in ſanctifying all unto them. <hi>As a Father pitieth his Children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him, for he knoweth our Frame,</hi> and <hi>remembreth that we are Duſt</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 103.13, 14.</note>. The Children of God are pitied by their heavenly Father, under all their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Infirmities, under all their Difficulties and Diſcouragements he always ſtands ready to ſupport, to relieve, and help them.</p>
            <p>God indeed ſuffers them to meet with Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the World, for many are the Afflictions of the Righteous, but then it is <hi>if need be that they are in Heavineſs;</hi> God ſees they need Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and in Love, and in Kindneſs to their Souls, he afflicts them: But then it is in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in Mercy. The outward Troubles they meet with are not the furious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Strokes of an Enemy who ſeeks to kill and to deſtroy; but the gentle Corrections of a wiſe and tender Father, that does not afflict willingly, nor grieve his Children.</p>
            <p>And ſuch Corrections as theſe are looked upon by the Apoſtle as Tokens of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005117_0024_1016A868CD6273E0"/>Love, and a Sign that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. If ye endure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as with Sons: For what Son is he whom the Father chaſtneth not? But if ye be without Chaſtiſement, whereof all are Partakers, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 12.6, 7, 8.</note>.</p>
            <p>But now here is the peculiar Privilege of the Children of God, that tho' he viſits their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with the <hi>Rod,</hi> and their Iniquity with <hi>Stripes,</hi> nevertheleſs his <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> he will not take from them, nor ſuffer his <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to fail. But as it is their Profit that is aimed at by the Father of Spirits when he corrects, ſo he takes Care to effect it, and turns all to their Advantage. For when he <hi>chaſtens,</hi> he <hi>teaches</hi> out of his Law, and cauſes the Rod and Reproof to give <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> He ſanctifies every Stroke of his Rod, and cauſes it to <hi>purge</hi> away <hi>Iniquity,</hi> to <hi>wean</hi> them from the World, and to cure them of their <hi>Sloth,</hi> and to <hi>quicken</hi> them in the Ways of God. And ſo altho' the Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they meet with ſeemeth for the preſent not <hi>joyous</hi> but <hi>grievous,</hi> in the End it will yield the <hi>peaceable</hi> Fruits of Righteouſneſs. And every Child of God will be obliged in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to acknowledge with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005117_0025_1016A86AC2352B98"/>know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 119.75.</note>.</p>
            <p>But then as God is abundant in Goodneſs, and delights in Mercy, and does not afflict wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; ſo this is the Privilege of all God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that he is ready to ſmile upon them, to proſper and bleſs them upon outward Accounts ſo far as he ſees they can bear it, and that it will be for their Good. <hi>Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Tim. 5.8.</note>. And God accordingly bleſſes his Children with the good Things of this Life. They acknowledge him in all Ways, and he directs their Paths for them. He ſmiles upon them in their lawful Undertakings, and he gives them Power to get Wealth, and ſurrounds them with the Bounties of his Providence. And ſome of them that he ſees can bear it, he cauſes Goodneſs and Mercy to follow them all their Days <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 23.6.</note>.</p>
            <p>But as the good Things of <hi>this Life</hi> are not the Portion that God provides for his Children, nor do they deſire their Portion in the preſent World; ſo it is not common for God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to abound with the Riches, and the great Things of this World.</p>
            <p>But then here is the diſtinguiſhing Privilege of the Children of God, that they are content
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005117_0025_1016A86AC2352B98"/>and ſatisfied with what their heavenly Father ſees cauſe to deal out to them; they are willing to be at his Diſpoſe, having Food and Raiment they are content, <hi>and Godlineſs with Contentment is great Gain</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 5.6.</note>. And God ſo bleſſes what he gives them, that it affords more Peace, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Satisfaction to them, than the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Effects of the Wicked do to them. <hi>Better is a little with the Fear of the Lord, than great Treaſures and Trouble therewith. Better is a little with Righteouſneſs, than great Revenues without Right</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 15.16. &amp; 16.8.</note>.</p>
            <p>Again, It is the diſtinguiſhing Privilege of God's Children that they have <hi>free Liberty</hi> of <hi>acceſs</hi> with Confidence to God in Prayer, even as Children to a Father able and ready to help them.</p>
            <p>The adopted Sons of God <hi>have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear, but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, Father</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 8.15.</note>. And ſo they may, and they will come with Freedom and holy Boldneſs <hi>to the Throne of Grace, to obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in Time of Need</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 4.16.</note>. No Children can poſſibly be ſo Welcome to their earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as the Children of God are to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father. And he is more ready to hear and anſwer, than they can be to aſk. And he is
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005117_0026_1016A86E21FBCC70"/>able and ready to do, and will finally do for them <hi>exceeding abundantly</hi> above what they are able to aſk, or even to think. This is their happy Privilege that they may come freely and ſpread their Caſe before him, and make known their Requeſts unto him, and God will hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all their Requeſts for Things <hi>agreeable</hi> to his <hi>Will,</hi> and for their Good, and in as mud Mercy will deny them thoſe Things that will be hurtful unto them. And whatever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in anſwer to their Prayers they are ſure to receive his Bleſſing with it. So God bleſſes their Bleſſings, and in ſuch a qualified Senſe cauſes whatſoever they do to proſper.</p>
            <p>In a Word, Theſe Children of God are the <hi>ſpecial Care and charge of divine Providence,</hi> as well as the Subjects of his ſpecial Grace. He is a tender careful Parent, watches over them by Night and by Day, to defend them from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Evils and Dangers that compaſs them about, unknown to them. And he gives his <hi>Angels</hi> charge concerning them, to encamp round about them; for they are all <hi>miniſtring Spirits</hi> ſent forth to miniſter unto theſe Heirs of Salvation. He will make every Thing in Nature and Providence inſtrumental of their Good, all his <hi>Paths</hi> will be <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> unto them. He will <hi>lead</hi> them in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> them, he will have <hi>Compaſſion</hi> on thoſe of them that are <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and <hi>got out of the Way,</hi> he will <hi>reduce</hi> them from their Errors,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005117_0026_1016A86E21FBCC70"/>he will <hi>ſupport</hi> them under their Troubles, he will <hi>comfort</hi> them under all their Sorrows, he will <hi>enlighten</hi> them in all their Darkneſſes, he will <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> them againſt Temptations, he will <hi>guard</hi> them by his Power, will <hi>ſecure</hi> them by his Grace, and <hi>uphold</hi> them with his free Spirit, and will <hi>guide</hi> them with his Counſel till he <hi>receives</hi> them ſafe to his eternal Kingdom and Glory.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe Sons or Children of God, are</hi> HEIRS <hi>to a moſt glorious Inheritance reſerved in Heaven for them, which they ſhall at length be received to the everlaſting Enjoyment of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we are told ver. 17. of the Context, And if <hi>Children</hi> then <hi>Heirs, Heirs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>joint Heirs</hi> with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that every Child of God is an <hi>Heir.</hi> But what is he an <hi>Heir</hi> to? Not to the little, fading, uncertain, and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying Inheritances of this World, that periſh in the enjoying: But to the <hi>Inheritance</hi> that is <hi>incorruptible,</hi> and <hi>undefiled,</hi> and that <hi>fadeth</hi> not away, reſerved in Heaven for them. <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi> It is an <hi>heavenly Inheritance</hi> that you are <hi>Heirs</hi> to, it is a <hi>Treaſure</hi> above the Skies that you have the Promiſe of. It is in your heavenly Father's Houſe, whither Chriſt is gone, and where he is preparing <hi>Manſions of Glory</hi> for you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:005117_0027_1016A8722D36E7C8"/>
Indeed the Children of God muſt paſs thro' the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death, before they can come to the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of their Inheritance among the Saints in Light: But the ſure and certain Hope of what they are deſigned for, will abundantly ſcatter the Fears of Death, and bring the Child of God, that has the Evidence of his good Eſtate clear upon his Soul, to be as the <hi>Apoſtle, willing,</hi> yea, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to depart, and to be with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Oh how glorious is the Inheritance they ſhall enter upon the Poſſeſſion of, immediately after Death, and eſpecially after the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Soul and Body ſhall be re-united! How magnificent are the Deſcriptions hereof in Scripture! Infinitely ſurpaſſing all the Riches, the Glories, and the Delights of the preſent World.</p>
            <p>Theſe Children, as I hinted before, are <hi>Heirs,</hi> and they are <hi>Heirs of God, Heirs</hi> of HIM, who is the great <hi>Creator</hi> and high <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of Heaven and Earth, and <hi>joint Heirs</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom the Father hath appointed <hi>Heir of all Things</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 1.2.</note>. And agreeable to this we are taught in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of <hi>John,</hi> 21.7. He that overcometh ſhall <hi>inherit</hi> ALL THINGS, <hi>and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son.</hi> So that this is the happy Privilege of all the Children of God, that <hi>all is yours</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3.21.</note>. There is nothing you can think
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005117_0027_1016A8722D36E7C8"/>of, that will afford real Happineſs, but what will be conferred upon all the Children of God in Heaven. Oh how great is that Good which is laid up for the Sons of God!</p>
            <p>They ſhall be admitted to the glorious Viſion and full Fruition of God. They ſhall ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Face to Face,</hi> and they <hi>ſhall be like him, for they ſhall ſee him as he is. They ſhall inherit the Kingdom prepared for them from the Foundation of the World,</hi> and <hi>ſhall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away. They ſhall dwell in his Preſence, where there is Fulneſs of Joys, and ſhall ſit at his right Hand, where there are Rivers of Pleaſures forevermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> is what crowns all, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Happineſs is <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and the Pleaſures <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted,</hi> and without the leaſt Alloy. Nay, it is not unlikely but that the Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be in an everlaſting Progreſſion, ſome new Diſcoveries to entertain the Mind, and ſome new Enjoyment to give freſh Pleaſures thro' out Eternity.</p>
            <p>And thus I have briefly, and very imperfectly ſpoken of the Privileges of the Sons of God, and the Happineſs they are intitled to, and will at length be brought to the Poſſeſſion of. And a perfect Deſcription hereof may not be expected, for verily <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have entred into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:005117_0028_1016A875470EEE38"/>
I now proceed to ſpeak as briefly to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond general Head, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>It is Matter of unſpeakable Comfort to have a well-grounded Evidence in our ſelves, that we are the Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if there be ſuch glorious Privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Sons of God, ſurely it muſt be Matter of great Comfort to be well ſatisfied upon a good Foundation, that we are among that happy Number. It is ſafe and happy, to be the Children of God, whether we know it or no; but unſpeakably more comfortable to our ſelves, to be ſatisfied of it in our own Minds.</p>
            <p>Many flatter themſelves they are the Children of God, when they are not. And this Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of themſelves quiets and comforts them, and ſometimes gives them conſiderable Joy; but now this is but a falſe Peace, and the <hi>Joy of the Hypocrite, which is but for a Moment,</hi> and will iſſue in dreadful Diſappointment. <hi>For what is the Hope</hi> of the ſelf-flattering and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluding <hi>Hypocrite, when God taketh away his Soul?</hi> Moreover the Peace and Quietneſs that ſuch Hypocrites have, from a vain Conceit of their being the Children of God, is exceeding dangerous, as it lulls them aſleep in carnal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and thus their Deluſion and Danger may not be diſcerned till it is too late to help the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005117_0028_1016A875470EEE38"/>Matter. And therefore it concerns all to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Foundation of their Hopes, leaſt this ſhould be their own unhappy Caſe.</p>
            <p>Others again, who are the true Children of God; yet are very doubtful in their own Minds about it, and very jealous that they are ſtill in their carnal and corrupt Eſtate. Nay, I believe I ſhould offend againſt ſome of the Generation of God's Children, if I did not allow that they were ſometimes ſo in the Dark as to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual State, as to conclude that they are in their Sins, that they are left out of the divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and fearful whether ever they ſhall find Mercy with God, and almoſt ready to ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Deſpair.</p>
            <p>And now this muſt needs be a moſt uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and diſtreſſing State, which not only takes off the Edge of all earthly Comforts; but deprives the Soul of inward Peace, and prevents the Pleaſure of ſweet Communion with God, and fills the Soul with ſuch fearful Apprehenſions of divine Wrath, as even diſtracts it. <hi>While I ſuffer thy Terrors I am diſtracted,</hi> ſays the holy Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 88.15.</p>
            <p>But now to have clear ſatisfying Evidence, upon a good Foundation, that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and entitled to all their Privileges, Oh! what Peace, what Support, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, what Joy muſt this needs afford unto the Soul!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:005117_0029_1016A87811D87370"/>
And now the Chriſtian's Evidences are upon a good Foundation, and his Hopes well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when they ariſe from his finding that he has heartily <hi>received Chriſt,</hi> and that he has the Marks of the <hi>New-Birth</hi> upon him, and that he has received the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> whereby he cries <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and has the <hi>true Temper of a Child,</hi> and behaves in ſome Meaſure with the <hi>Fear,</hi> the <hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>Love,</hi> the <hi>Truſt,</hi> the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> which becomes him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>And theſe well-grounded Evidences ariſe in the Chriſtian's Soul, by a frequent and cloſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, a conſtant and critical Obſervation of himſelf; and the inward Frame and Temper of his Mind, together with the general Tenour of his Life. And theſe Evidences come to the Soul in the moſt clear, convincing, and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manner, when the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> himſelf, is pleaſed to aſſiſt the Saint in the Trial of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to ſhine upon his own Work in the Soul, and enables the Saint clearly to diſcern it, and <hi>ſo witneſſes together with his Spirit, that he is a Child of God,</hi> as in the 16th Verſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it may be ſaid, with Reſpect to theſe Evidences of Adoption, they are very various as to their Degree in Chriſtians: Some have much clearer and ſtronger Evidences here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of than others. There is alſo a great Difference in the ſame Chriſtian at one Time and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005117_0029_1016A87811D87370"/>Sometimes the Chriſtian's Evidences are ſo beclouded, by the Remains of Sin, and the Hidings of God's Face, that he can hardly make out to himſelf that he is a Child of God, his Hopes do but juſt preponderate his Doubts and Fears. At other Times the Chriſtian has ſtronger and fuller Evidences, and does more clearly ſee the Marks of a Child of God upon him; ſo that his Doubts and Fears are very much ſcattered, and he has an inward Peace and Quietneſs of Mind ariſing, and he walks up and down in the Light of God's Countenance, and there are ſcarce any Clouds in the Way. At other Times theſe Evidences are ſtill further cleared up, ſo as not only to give a ſatisfactory Proof to the Soul, that he is a Child of God, but to remove all Doubts, to ſcatter every Cloud, and to give him the <hi>full Aſſurance of Faith and of Hope</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 6.11,—22.</note>.</p>
            <p>And now the well-grounded Evidence of our being the Children of God in the loweſt, but eſpecially in the higheſt Degree, muſt needs afford great Comfort and Satisfaction to the Soul. For as it is our higheſt Privilege, and our greateſt Happineſs to be the Children of God; ſo every truly thoughtful and conſiderate Mind will be concerned to be well ſatisfied that this is his own happy Caſe, and the clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, will afford the greateſt Comfort to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005117_0030_1016A879F2CB3C20"/>him, at all Times, in all Caſes, and under every Circumſtance, and Condition of Life. As for the ſtupid and thoughtleſs Part of Mankind, who are immerſed in the Pleaſures of Senſe, and ſwallowed up with the Vanities of the World, ſome earthly and ſenſual Enjoyment may pleaſe them better for the preſent, than the cleareſt Evidences of their being the Sons of God would do. But with every one that is a Child of God, it is not ſo. For while the <hi>many</hi> are enquiring <hi>who will ſhew us any worldly Good,</hi> the Language of the gracious Soul, is, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me; and that gives him more Joy and Gladneſs than when Corn, or Wine, or Oyl are increaſed</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 4.6, 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>Here it may be ſaid, that even in the Midſt of outward Proſperity, there is nothing affords ſuch Comfort to the gracious Soul, as the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he is a Child of God. For whilſt the Chriſtian is very jealous whether he be a Child of God or no, and his Doubts and Fears prevail above his Hopes, he will be naturally led to fear whether theſe outward good Things are the Fruit of God's fatherly Love. He will be afraid leaſt theſe earthly Goods ſhould be all his Portion, leaſt they ſhould be attended with a Curſe, leaſt they ſhould prove a Trap and a Snare to him, and be like <hi>the Proſperity of Fools which deſtroys them</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 1.32.</note>. And altho' this may be
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005117_0030_1016A879F2CB3C20"/>very ſerviceable to the Chriſtian, and make him cautious how he meddles too much, or plunges himſelf too deep in worldly Hurries, and Cares, or Pleaſures; yet it deprives him of much of that Comfort which otherwiſe he might enjoy in the good Things that God confers upon him.</p>
            <p>But now the Man who has a ſatisfactory Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he is a Child of God, in what an agreable Manner is he ready to receive the Fruits of divine Bounty? He receives them as the Tokens of God's Favour, and as the Effects of his Covenant-Love, and of his fatherly Care and Goodneſs; and as what he expects God will bleſs unto him, and what he can confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſk a Bleſſing upon; which ſerves to enlarge his Heart towards his heavenly. Father, and cauſes him to receive the divine Mercies thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and quickens him to greater Chearfulneſs in God's Service, and puts him upon improving what he receives more faithfully, to the Glory of the Giver.</p>
            <p>But then, on the other Hand, when Perſons are under <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Afflictions, Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Sorrows,</hi> what is there that can afford them ſuch <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> as the <hi>good Evidence</hi> that they are the <hi>Children of God?</hi> —</p>
            <p>For the clear Evidence hereof will at once ſuggeſt to them, that all their Afflictions are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wiſe and wholeſome Corrections of their heavenly Father, that are deſigned for, and will finally prove, very advantageous to them, to
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005117_0031_1016A87CCD6F3D50"/>
               <hi>purge away their Iniquity,</hi> and to <hi>take away their Sin,</hi> and to <hi>make them Partakers of the divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> And how wonderfully will the realizing Tho't and Belief hereof reconcile Chriſtians to every Affliction they meet withal? This will help them to ſubmit to them quietly, and bear them patiently, being perſwaded, that how grievous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are at preſent, yet that in the End they will <hi>yield the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</hi> What Support muſt the Children of God have from their being ſatisfied they are ſuch, under all their Trials; even under the foreſt of them, to think that their heavenly Father ſends them in Love, and in Mercy to their Souls, that he does not afflict them willingly, but only becauſe he ſees they have Need of them, and that he will ſanctify every ſtroke of his Rod, and cauſe <hi>theſe light Afflictions, which are but for a Moment, to work out for them a far more exceeding &amp; an eternal Weight of Glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here for Inſtance, are any of the Children of God, <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>low</hi> in the World? Why the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Evidence that they are his Children, muſt needs afford great Support and Comfort to them under all their Poverty, and will enable them to apply the Words of the Apoſtle to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and draw Comfort from them, Jam. 2.5. <hi>Hearhen, my beloved Brethren, hath not God choſen the Poor of this World, rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him?</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:005117_0031_1016A87CCD6F3D50"/>
Have you met with Loſſes and Croſſes? Have you loſt your Eſtate, or leſt your Friends, your Parents, your Children, your Huſband, or your Wife, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Why if you are but well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that you are the Children of God, and that he is your Friend and Father, this muſt needs be great Comfort to you, for you may comfort your ſelves with this, that tho' your earthly Parents forſake you, yet your heavenly Father <hi>will take you up;</hi> and that tho' all your Friends die and leave you, yet that <hi>your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth,</hi> who can and will be infinitely more to you, than Father, or Mother, or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Siſter, or Wife, or Children, or Houſes, or Lands.</p>
            <p>Again, Are you under bodily Sickneſſes and and Pains? Why the Perſwaſion that you are the Children of God, will comfort you, and quiet you under them; as it will lead you to think, how much Pain and Sorrow Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for your Sakes, and that he will at length give you Eaſe and Reſt from all your Troubles, and bring you to that bleſſed State where there will be no more Sickneſs nor Pain, and where all Tears will be wiped away from your Eyes for ever.</p>
            <p>Again, Are you defamed? Are you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably judged and cenſured as a great Sinner, as a carnal unconverted Man, and are many Anathe mas denounced againſt you? Why if you have but this Teſtimony that you have
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005117_0032_1016A880BA812858"/>pleaſed God, and that you belong to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>that</hi> is enough to ſupport you under all the uncharitable Tho'ts, the hard Speeches, and the ill Treatment you may meet withal, for then you may comfort yourſelves with what our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, Mat. 5.10, 11. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs Sake, for their's is the Kingdom of Heaven. Bleſſed are ye when Men ſhall revile you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, and ſhall ſay all Manner of Evil againſt you falſly for my ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the ſecret Witneſs, or clear Evidence that we are the Children of God, would be a ſupporting refreſhing Cordial to us, under the heavieſt Trials of Life. But now what will the Man do when he is ſurrounded with Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Trials of every Kind, and has no Evidence that God is his Friend and Father, but fears and concludes the contrary? What Support can he have under his Troubles, when he concludes they all come in a Way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and becauſe God is angry with him; and theſe appear to be but the Beginning of Sorrows? Oh how inſupportable muſt ſuch Tho'ts as theſe be! And no Wonder if he ſhould ſink under the Weight of them into Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, Diſcontent, Murmurings, and even Deſpair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> What is there which can afford ſuch <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> in a <hi>dying Hour,</hi> as the clear <hi>well-grounded Evidence</hi> that we are the Children of God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:005117_0032_1016A880BA812858"/>
As the Reality of this is the only Thing to take away the Sting of Death, ſo the full Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of this in our own Minds is the only Thing to take away the Terrors of Death, and reconcile us to the Tho't of Dying. For if we be not ſatisfied that we are the Children of God, we can't be ſatisfied of our good Eſtate. And how awful, how terrible muſt it needs be, to ſee Death approaching in good Earneſt, and we juſt launching into the Ocean of Eternity, and be very doubtful which Way we are going, whether into a happy or miſerable Eternity! Oh with what Reluctance ſhall we receive the Meſſage of Death, and how ſhall we ſhrink back when this King of Terrors begins to take hold of us, being utterly uncertain how it will fare with us for ever after! And how much more diſmal and diſtreſſing ſtill will the Caſe be, if our Fears ſhould prevail much above our Hopes, and eſpecially if in that awful Hour, we ſhould remain to us nothing but a fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation to devour us?</p>
            <p>Whereas if at ſuch a Time, we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teſtimony that we are the Children of God, and ſo the well-grounded Hopes that we are Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt, to the heavenly Inheritance; how would the Fears of Death be ſcattered, and how would it reconcile us to a Diſſolution? Nay, if the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005117_0033_1016A88244068C50"/>of our Adoption be clear, and eſpecially if it comes to the full Aſſurance of Hope, it will enable us even to triumph over Death and the Grave, ſaying with the Apoſtle, <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory! The Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law, but Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.</note> And we ſhall not only die in <hi>Peace,</hi> having <hi>the Peace of God to keep our Hearts and Minds thro' Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but ſhall even <hi>rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee of what Importance it is, not only to be really the Sons of God, but to have the ſatisfactory Evidence hereof in our own Souls.</p>
            <p>The next general Head is this viz. <hi>There are many Things which People look upon as Marks of their being the Children of God, which are falſe, at leaſt very uncertain, and by no Means to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon.</hi> But I muſt leave this for the next Diſcourſe, and conclude at preſent with ſome</p>

                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. Is it ſuch a high Priviledge and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be the Sons of God (as we have heard) hence <hi>how aſtoniſhing the Grace of God, that he ſhould bring any of the Children of Men into that happy Number?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:005117_0033_1016A88244068C50"/>
Man had by his Sin and Rebellion, caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Favour of God, and deſerved to be treated as a Rebel and a Traitor, inſtead of being admitted to the Priviledges of a Son. By Sin we diſowned and rejected God from being our God and Father, and he might have utterly diſowned us from being his Children. We loſt the Reverence and Dutifulneſs of Children, and he might have utterly withdrawn the tender Pity and Compaſſion of a Father from us, and ſo might have rejected us and caſt us off forever.</p>
               <p>But now for God, inſtead of dealing with us after ſuch a Manner, to ſhew a Father's Pity to us, and to find out, and to bring about, a Way whereby we might be reſtored to all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Sons of God, it muſt needs be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Love and Grace in God.</p>
               <p>But then the divine Love appears more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious, and more amazing, when we conſider the Method which God took, to bring us into ſuch a near and happy Relation to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus in order to our becoming the Sons, the adopted Sons of God, he ſent HIS ONLY BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOTTEN AND DEARLY BELOVED SON, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to ſuffer the deepeſt Humiliations, the greateſt Sorrows, and the moſt curſed Death, who afterwards aroſe from the Dead, aſcended up into Heaven, where he ever lives at the right Hand of the Father, to make Interceſſion for us. And by his prevailing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, he procured the ſending down the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005117_0034_1016A8859E994080"/>HOLY GHOST to apply the Redemption which Chriſt had purchaſed: To recover us out of our ſinful rebellious State, to work Repentance, and Faith, and Holineſs, and to beget a Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Temper and Diſpoſition of Soul within us; making uſe of a great Variety of Means to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this gracious Change in our Souls, ſuch as the Word, Ordinances, and Providences; all which the Holy Ghoſt uſes in converting the Soul, in making us the Children of God, and in fitting us for the Inheritance among the Saints in Light. And when he has, by his Grace fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us for, he receives us to that glorious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to thoſe bleſſed Manſions which Chriſt is preparing for us.</p>
               <p>And now when we conſider how unworthy we were of the leaſt Mercy, and what Pity, Love, and Good-will God has ſhewn to us, and and what great and glorious Things Chriſt has purchaſed for us, by his Obedience and Death, and what wonderful Things the Holy Ghoſt is doing for us, that we might be the Sons of God, and enjoy all the Privileges of ſuch, we may well cry out in Admiration and Praiſe with the Apoſtle, 1 John 3.1. <hi>Behold what Manner of Love is this, the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God!</hi> And how ſhould we pray with the Apoſtle, that <hi>we may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height, and

               </p>
               <p>Since the greateſt Privileges, the higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the moſt conſummate Happineſs, are the Portion of God's Children, who would not rejoice to be found among them? Who would not be ſtriving to the utmoſt of his Power, that he might be numbred among them, and ſo be entitled to all their Privileges? If we are really owned and accepted of God as his Sons and his Daughters, we are made, we are in the Way of all true Comforts of this Life, and of all the Glory and Happineſs of that which is to come.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Now in anſwer to this, it may be ſaid, That altho' it be of the rich and free Grace of God that any are adopted into his Family, and made his Children; yet it is upon ſome Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005117_0035_1016A8879E9A3698"/>that he ſees in Perſons, that he receives them into the Number, and gives them a Right to all the Privileges of the Sons of God. You muſt remember we are not ſpeaking of electing Love, but of adopting Love and Grace. And according to our Catechiſm, <hi>Adoption</hi> is a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that follows upon <hi>effectual Calling,</hi> and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Calling is that whereby we are enabled, by the Help of the Spirit of God, to <hi>receive and embrace the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as he is offered to us in the Goſpel.</hi> And this we are taught by the Evangeliſt, is the Pre-requiſite to our becoming the Sons of God, and enjoying the Privileges of ſuch. <hi>But as many as</hi> RECEIVED HIM, <hi>to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">John 1.12.</note> Here we ſee that <hi>receiving</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>believing on his Name,</hi> is the ſame Thing; ſo that believing on Chriſt is the Heart's receiving him and relying upon him as he is offered to us in the Goſpel. And now to all ſuch God gives the Power or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of becoming the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Well then, you ſee if you would be the Sons of God, and be entitled to all the glorious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of ſuch, you muſt believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and muſt receive him with all your Hearts as he is offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, even in every Office that he ſuſtains and executes as our Redeemer, receiving him, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005117_0035_1016A8879E9A3698"/>upon him, and ſubmitting to him as your Prince, as well as Saviour, endeavouring in all Things to conform your Hearts and lives unto his Goſpel. You muſt receive the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God with all your Heart, if you would be received among his adopted Sons. So that in this you ſee upon what Terms you are with God. Oh then of what infinite Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is it that we ſhould believe in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt as he gave us Commandment! If any of you (and it is to be feared that many of you will) fail of becoming the Sons of God, it is becauſe of your Unbelief, it is becauſe you wont heartily receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Oh then how ſhould you ſtrive againſt Unbelief, how ſhould you beg of God, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you from an evil Heart of Unbelief, and that he would enable you to believe? for Faith is not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God, and you muſt aſk it of him, and you muſt wait upon him in all the Ways he has appointed for the obtaining of this precious Faith. And as <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God;</hi>

               <p>As to compleat perfect Aſſurance (whatever ſome may pretend to and talk of) I am inclined to think it is not attainable in this Life. That great Divine, the late Reverend Mr. WILLARD, treating of Aſſurance, ſays, <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide Mr. <hi>Willard on</hi> the Catechiſm, p. 507.</note>
                  <q>That the higheſt Aſſurance in this Life is that which needs ſtrengthening, a Believer's Grace is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and his Corruptions potent, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Aſſurance is not conſiſtent with imperfect Grace: Hence Believers are put upon it, to be ever at the Work of Self-
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005117_0036_1016A88D2DBB7560"/>Trial.</q> Which (ſays the excellent Mr. FLAVEL) <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> Vol. I. p. 669.</note>
                  <q>If there be ſuch abſolute Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as to be no Doubt nor Danger, there is no Place nor Room for Examination, or far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Endeavours to make it ſurer than it is.</q> And therefore ſuch as talk of their being as ſure of their Salvation as of the Death of Chriſt; yea as ſure of their Salvation as of their own Exiſtence; they ſhew that they are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a rapturous Paſſion or vain Conceit, rather than governed by a ſolid Judgment.</p>
               <p>But then altho' we cannot attain to Perfection of Aſſurance, any more than we can attain to Perfection of Grace; yet we are to be ſtriving after it, and preſſing towards it, as we are to be ſtriving after the Perfection of Grace. Altho' we cannot in this Life attain to Perfection of Grace; yet we muſt <hi>preſs towards that Mark:</hi> So tho' we cannot attain to Perfection of Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we muſt preſs towards it, and make all as ſure as we can. We ſhould endeavour after as clear and as full Evidences of our being the Sons of God as poſſible; and muſt be giving all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to be making it ſurer and ſurer to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every Day, and that by growing in Grace, which is the ſureſt and beſt Mark of Adoption.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo much worth our making ſure as this: Nothing which will afford ſuch real Comfort and Satisfaction to the Soul, or
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005117_0037_1016A89001DCF1A8"/>that will help us to conduct and behave proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under all the Changes of Life, as the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Evidence that we are among the Sons of God. This will help us to receive outward Comforts as the Tokens of God's fatherly Love and Goodneſs: This will help us to receive Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions as the wiſe and wholeſome Corrections of our heavenly Father, deſigned for our Profit. And this is what will afford ſpiritual Support and Comfort to us at the Approach of Death. Oh what a Cordial in a dying Hour, to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in our own Minds that we are the Children of God, and ſo Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt to the Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, reſerved in Heaven for us! This will ſcatter the Fears of Death, and reconcile us to that which even Nature abhors; being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that to be abſent from the Body will be to be preſent with the Lord. What is it that we hear People wiſhing and longing for on a Death-Bed, but that they might have fuller Evidences that they are the Children of God? And their Language is, if they were but clear in this, they ſhould be willing to die whenever God calls; and all their Uneaſineſs, their Fear and Diſtreſs of Mind, ariſe from their Doubts and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties whether they are the Children of God or no; and all the World would they give if they had it, to be aſſured of this one Point. And now how ſollicitous ſhould we be to get all the Satisfaction poſſible in this Point, and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005117_0037_1016A89001DCF1A8"/>have it as plain and clear as poſſible that we are the Children of God? Oh then let us not ſpare any Labour or Pains to get a well-grounded Perſwaſion that we belong to God, and have an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. For altho' an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfect Aſſurance be not attainable; yet there is ſuch an Aſſurance of Faith and Hope attainable, as may not only afford Support and Comfort; but what may and does ſometimes fill the Soul with Joy unſpeakable. And we ought to be ſtriving after the higheſt Degrees of Aſſurance that we are capable of in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State.</p>
               <p>But here is a Caution neceſſary to be laid in, <hi>viz.</hi> That you don't work your ſelves up into a vain Confidence and a Sort of Aſſurance in your own Minds, when there is no real Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for it. This is the Way that many a poor Soul has been impoſed upon. Perſons have been eagerly deſirous of Aſſurance; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as have been led to ſuch a falſe and dangerous Doctrine, <hi>That Aſſurance was of the Eſſence of ſaving Faith,</hi> and ſo inſtead of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after a Faith of Aſſent, a Faith of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, a Faith of Reliance, and a Faith of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Chriſt; they leap over all theſe, to work themſelves up into a Faith of Aſſurance. And when they thus come to feel a Perſwaſion in their Minds that Chriſt is theirs, then they imagine they have attained ſaving Faith, and are aſſured of their Salvation. But Oh how often
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005117_0038_1016A8926D798678"/>is ſuch an Aſſurance as this built upon the Sand, that will never endure the Trial! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch an Aſſurance, ſuch a vain Confidence may hold out to Death with ſome Perſons: <hi>But what is the Hope of the Hypocrite, when God taketh away his Soul</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 27.8.</note>? Wherefore, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is not the having an Aſſurance in your own Mind barely; but it is this having Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon a Scripture Bottom, that you muſt be ſtriving after.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as there are many other Things that chriſtian Profeſſors are apt to build their Hopes upon which are falſe and uncertain, and not to be truſted to, (which I ſhall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſider in the next Diſcourſe) ſo theſe we muſt lay aſide, and muſt be ſtriving after thoſe Things which the Goſpel makes ſure and certain Marks of our Adoption, (and which may be hereafter conſider'd when I come to ſpeak of the Leadings of the Spirit.) For it is by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that we ſhall be try'd and judg'd hereafter, and not by any Titles, Rules and Marks that are framed out of Mens Fancies, <hi>the Word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him another Day</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">John 12.48.</note>.</p>
               <p>In a Word, here we muſt ſtrive after the Spirit of Adoption, the true Spirit and Temper of God's Children, and if we take up with any Marks ſhort of this, we ſhall be diſappointed:

            <p>II Prop. <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſureſt and cleareſt Mark of our being the Children of God is our being led and govern'd by</hi> HIS SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>For the illuſtrating this Propoſition I have ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That it is our higheſt Privilege, and greateſt Happineſs to be the Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That it is an unſpeakable Comfort to have a well-grounded Evidence in our ſelves that we are the Sons of God.</hi>

               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:005117_0039_1016A8969B7F46B0"/>
And now for further Illuſtration I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That there are many Things which Men are apt to take up with as Signs and Tokens of their being the Children of God, which are falſe, at leaſt very uncertain, and by no Means to be depended upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſcarce any Perſons ſo abandoned, but they are concerned at ſome Times about their future State, and deſirous to be number'd and found among the Children of God; and there are few, but what hope this is their Caſe; but alas nothing is more common than for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to build their Hopes upon the Sand, and to take up with falſe, at leaſt very uncertain Signs and Tokens of their being the Children of God. Men who are careful enough in their ſecular Affairs, to be upon a good Bottom in all their Concerns with Men, which are but Trifles: Will be oftentimes ſatisfied with very ſlender, uncertain Marks of their Adoption, which is of infinite Importance and Concern unto them.</p>
            <p>And now Men's flattering themſelves with falſe Hopes, and taking up with uncertain Marks, is owing very much to their Ignorance, to their Pride, to their Education, to ſome falſe Doctrines they have imbib'd, and as much, if not more than any Thing, to their not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Hearts affected with thoſe Things, and ſo are very careleſs about the Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:005117_0039_1016A8969B7F46B0"/>
Now what I propoſe at this Time is to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeveral of thoſe Marks and Tokens of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of God, that Perſons are very apt to ſet down ſatisfied and contented with, which are indeed falſe, or at leaſt very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Marks of our being the Children of God.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt beſeech your diligent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and cloſe Self-Application, that you may ſee how far you have been depending upon thoſe Marks, and whether you have any better to build your Hopes upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some flatter themſelves that they are the Children of God, becauſe they are deſcended from them that were ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That becauſe their Parents were pious, and had an Intereſt in the ſpecial Grace and Favour of God, they feed themſelves with Hopes that God has a ſpecial Love for them alſo.</p>
            <p>It was a very common Thing for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to allot upon great Privileges, becauſe they were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Friend of God. They conſider'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the Children of the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and looked upon all the Bleſſings conferred on him to be entail'd on them, without taking Care to be Followers of him in Faith and Obedience. They were ready to think that God would be their God and Father, becauſe he was their Father's God, whether they loved and ſerved the God of their Fathers or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:005117_0040_1016A899B78132B0"/>
And this is very much the Temper of ſome profeſſing Chriſtians, they flatter themſelves that becauſe they have deſcended from godly Anceſtors, they ſhall fare the better for it: That they ſhall be beloved for their Father's Sake: And that becauſe God was their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's or their Mother's God, he will be their God and Father alſo.</p>
            <p>And altho' Perſons would not own it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if the Matter was put to them; yet I doubt not but that there are many, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon finding Favour with God, and have nothing better to ground their Hopes upon, than that they deſcended of godly Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>But now this is a falſe and unſafe Ground to go upon; for Grace don't run in the Blood. Happy indeed is it when God is pleaſed to cauſe his Grace to deſcend from Father to Son, and ſo from Generation to Generation, which was the Caſe of <hi>Timothy</hi> and his Anceſtors, which the Apoſtle takes Notice of with Pleaſure, that the unfeigned Faith that was in his <hi>Grandmother</hi> Lois, <hi>and in his Mother</hi> Eunice, was <hi>in him alſo</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 1.5.</note>. But tho' there may be many ſuch Inſtances among us; yet this is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon. God when he adopts a Perſon into his Family and among his Children, don't oblige himſelf to adopt his Poſterity with him. And if it ſhould be ſaid, that God generally
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005117_0040_1016A899B78132B0"/>takes ſome of the Children of religious Parents into his ſpecial Favour; yet it may alſo be ſaid, that it is not common for all to be adopted by him. Seldom as to a particular Family that the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is accompliſhed, 54.13. <hi>And</hi> ALL <hi>thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> that is ſpiritually and ſavingly taught. For what is more common that to ſee profane and wicked Children in the Houſes of godly Parents? <hi>Iſaac</hi> had a profane <hi>Eſau</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 12.26.</note>, <hi>Eli</hi> was a good Man, but his Sons made themſelves vile <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Sam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that there is no Dependance upon our being deſcended from godly Parents; for altho' God has ſaid, <hi>that his Mercy is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him, and his Righteouſneſs unto Children's Children;</hi> yet it is only <hi>to ſuch as keep his Covenant, and that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Commandments to do them</hi>

Wherefore my Advice to you is the ſame with what <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> gave to the Sadduces and Phariſees that came to be baptized of him, <hi>Bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, and think not to ſay within your ſelves,</hi> WE HAVE ABRAHAM TO
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:005117_0041_1016A89B4A6E3A20"/>OUR FATHER <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 3.9.</note>. O my Hearers don't think then to ſay, that you had a good Man for your Father, and a good Woman to your Mother, and that your Grand-Parents were good alſo; for if you do not follow them wherein they followed Chriſt, their Grace and Goodneſs inſtead of being any Advantage to you, will rather aggravate your Guilt and increaſe your Puniſhment, for not taking the Advantage of their Prayers, their Counſels, and their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Some have great Dependance upon their Knowledge in religious Matters, and upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Soundneſs of their Faith, and Orthodoxneſs of their Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Men have much greater Knowledge in ſpiritual Matters than others, they have an Opportunity to read, an Inclination to Study, and a Capacity to underſtand beyond others: And it is not an uncommon Thing for Perſons to miſtake their thirſt after the Knowledge of ſpiritual Points, for Deſires after true Grace, and their Attainments in the Knowledge of ſpiritual Truths, for the Attainment of ſaving Grace. Their Underſtandings are enlarged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout divine and ſpiritual Things, by Reading and Study; and becauſe this affords ſome Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to their comtemplative and ſtudious Minds
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005117_0041_1016A89B4A6E3A20"/>they are apt to think they are truly in love with Religion, and that there is a gracious Impreſſion made upon their Hearts; whereas the Pleaſure they take therein is no other than they would take in any other Science they ſhould happen to get their Minds engaged in. And this is a Danger that Miniſters, Scholars, and other ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Men are expoſed unto. They are in danger of miſtaking the ſpeculative Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Doctrines of the Goſpel, for a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſaving Acquaintance with them. Some who have been well inſtructed in the Doctrines concerning God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that they can diſcourſe learnedly, ingeniouſly and judiciouſly of the Perfections of God, of the Perſon and Offices of Chriſt; they conclude they have that Knowledge of God and Chriſt which will be Life eternal to them. If they can diſcourſe well upon the Nature of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Converſion, they are ready from thence to flatter themſelves that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. If they can deſcribe the Nature of Faith and Repentance, they fancy that they themſelves repent and believe. And ſuch as are celebrated for their Knowledge about theſe Things, and if they are greatly eſteemed for their being ſound in their Principles, and free from the Errors that others are charged with, and are reſorted to for Counſel and Advice in Matters of a ſpiritual Nature, they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005117_0042_1016A89FEDA91E10"/>of thinking too highly of themſelves with Reſpect to their ſpiritual State.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Perſons of low Education if by any Means there be ſome new Diſcovery made to them, of ſome ſpeculative Point in Divinity, they are ſometimes apt to take it for a ſpiritual ſaving Illumination; yea when a Doctrine that they have known very well before; yet by in being ſet forth after a different Manner, and in a new Light, they have been ready to conclude that then has been the Time that God has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their Eyes in a ſaving Manner.</p>
            <p>Finally, Here it is no uncommon Thing for Perſons upon their changing their Thoughts and Notions in ſome Points of Divinity, to miſtake it for a Change of their Hearts. They are convinced that they were in an Error in ſome particular Point and now embrace the other Side for the Truth, and from hence will date their Converſion.</p>
            <p>But now theſe Things are by no Means certain Signs or Tokens of our being the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. For altho' Knowledge in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Matters, and right Notions in Points of Religion are very deſireable, and in ſome Sort neceſſary Helps to our being truly religious; yet they are not true Religion it ſelf, nor are they certain Signs of it.</p>
            <p>A Man may have great Attainments in Knowledge, and be able to diſcourſe excellently well upon all Points of Divinity, and be very
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005117_0042_1016A89FEDA91E10"/>inſtructive to others; and yet have no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Knowledge of thoſe Things himſelf. He may ſpeak very juſtly of Regeneration, and yet be an utter Stranger to the new Birth. He may be able to deſcribe juſtifying ſaving Faith much better than ſome true Believers; and yet never put forth one Act of ſuch a ſaving Faith in his Life. Nay, a Man may be much more ſound and orthodox as to the Doctrines of the Goſpel, than ſome of the true Children of God; and yet not be of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And a Man may be recovered out of Errors and Deluſions; and yet not be renewed in the Spirit of his Mind. He may put off his former Thoughts as to ſome Things, and not put off the <hi>old Man which is corrupt according to deceitful Luſts.</hi>—For Knowledge and Grace are very different Things. The Gifts and Graces of the Spirit don't always go together. A Man may have great Gifts, and no Grace, nay Men have had the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, and none of the ſpecial Grace of the Spirit. A Man may <hi>have all Knowledge, and underſtand all Myſteries, and may be able to ſpeak even with the Tongue of Angels;</hi> and yet <hi>be but as ſounding Braſs, and a tinkling Cymbal</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.1, 2.</note>, hollow within, void and empty of all true Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:005117_0043_1016A8A52FCFE610"/>
3. <hi>Some depend upon their making a publick Profeſſion, their belonging to the Church, and their conſtant Attendance upon divine Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt who live under the Goſpel do make ſome Profeſſion of Religion. Many make a publick open Profeſſion, they give themſelves up to God in Covenant, they come into the Church, and attend upon all the Ordinances of the Goſpel. They remember the Sabbath-day, and keep it externally holy; they go to the Houſe of God, and to the Table of the Lord, and are conſtant in thoſe external publick Duties; and beſides theſe keep up the Religion of the Family, and of the Cloſet, obſerving their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening Sacrifices with the Houſhold, and by themſelves apart; and many Perſons have great Dependance upon theſe Things.</p>
            <p>But alas, theſe are very uncertain Things for Perſons to depend upon: For Men may go this Length, and be very exemplary upon theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and yet all may be nothing, no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being the Children of God. For altho' a publick Profeſſion of Chriſt is a great Duty, and ſuch as live in the careleſs Neglect hereof have no Reaſon to think they are the Children of God, and little Ground to depend on the divine Favour while they go on in ſuch Neglect; yet this is no ſure Sign that we are in Favour with God, and among his Children. We muſt confeſs him before Men, for ſays Chriſt, <hi>He that confeſſeth me before Men, him
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:005117_0043_1016A8A52FCFE610"/>will I confeſs before my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my Words, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father, with his holy Angels</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark 8.38.</note> But theſe external Profeſſions, and outward Attendances, are no ſure Signs; a Man may do all theſe Things, and yet have no Grace in him. We read of Mens <hi>having a Form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power thereof</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3.5.</note>. Which is when they make an outward Profeſſion, and attend the outward Form of Religion. And Men may ſometimes abound in theſe, and there be nothing of the Power of Godlineſs. We alſo read of ſome who <hi>have a Name to live, while they are dead</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. 3.1.</note>. Which is when they attend the Externals of Religion, and make great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to Religion; but have nothing of it in their Hearts. And if the pretending to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the attending religious Duties, and the being Religious in Word and Tongue, and the being Religious in Word and Tongue, and the getting the Name of being Religious among Men would anſwer the End, it would be no ſuch difficult Thing to be truly Religious. But now what ſaith our Saviour in this Matter. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the Will of my Father which is in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:005117_0044_1016A8A6F29FCEF0"/>Heaven</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Matth. 7.21.</note> 
               <hi>Many will ſay to me in that Day of Judgment, Lord, have we not eaten and drank in thy Preſence, and thou haſt taught in our Streets, to whom he will ſay, Depart from me, I know you not, all ye that work Iniquity</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 13.26.</note> Nay further than this, ſome will plead in that Day, and ſay, <hi>We have propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out Devils, and in thy Name done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works, but Chriſt will profeſs unto them, and ſay, I never knew you, depart from me all ye that work Iniquity</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. 7.22.23.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Some depend upon their being much affected and much enlarged at ſome particular Times in Duty, as a ſure Sign that they are the Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no uncommon Thing for thoſe who are Strangers to true Grace in their Hearts, to find themſelves in very different Frames while they are attending religious Duties. Sometimes they are much more affected and enlarged, than at others. Sometimes the Word of God it ſelf, or ſome devout Writings have ſtirr'd up the Affections of Perſons in reading or hearing them. And nothing is more common than for unregenerate Perſons to be conſiderably affected with a zealous Preacher, who has ſought out ſome of the moſt awakening and terrifying Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and delivers them in a moving affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005117_0044_1016A8A6F29FCEF0"/>Manner. How common is it for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be pleaſingly affected herewith, they hear with Delight, and the Sermon deliver'd in ſuch a moving Manner, makes ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Impreſſions on them, and puts them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a greater Seriouſneſs and Thoughtfulneſs; And they may be brought hereby to weep, and even to cry out; and put upon forming ſome good Purpoſes and good Reſolutions about their future Conduct.</p>
            <p>But now all this is no certain Sign of Men's being regenerated, and ſo the Sons of God; for ſuch as are Strangers to a gracious Change may, and without Doubt have ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſomething of this Kind. — The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to the People <hi>as a very lovely Song, of one that hath a pleaſant Voice; for they heard his Words,</hi> and were pleaſed with them, <hi>but did them not</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. 33.32.</note> We alſo read of <hi>Herod</hi>'s <hi>hearing John gladly</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark 6.20.</note> And we read of ſome who hear the Word, and anon with Joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; but yet have no Root in themſelves, and ſo dure but for a while, for <hi>when Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution ariſeth, becauſe of the Word, by and by they are offended</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. 13.20, 21.</note> And there is great Uncertainty, and as much Danger for Perſons to depend merely upon their own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements in religious Duties. Some Perſons
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005117_0045_1016A8A9C762D6B0"/>find a great Freedom and Fluency in Prayer at particular Times; they ſometimes find a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and feel ſome Kind of Fervour in the Duty of Prayer; and upon it their Tho'ts are enlarged, and they perceive ſuitable pertinent Expreſſions to flow in upon them: And now ſuch Perſons apt to lay great Weight upon theſe Things, and look upon them as ſure To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their Converſion, and that the Spirit of Grace and Supplication is poured out upon them. But it is no ſure Sign at all of true Grace in the Heart, for there is a Difference between the Gift of Prayer, and the Grace of Prayer: Men may have the Gift of pouring out their Words, when they have not the Grace to pour out their Hearts before God in Prayer. A Man may have a Flow of Words, and no Flow of Grace at all in Prayer. In ſhort, a Man may, according to what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>ſpeak with the Tongues of Men, and Angels, and yet be nothing.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.11.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Some have great Dependance upon the Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenings, and Convictions, that have been ſtirred up in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are but few who have been favoured with the free Uſe of the Goſpel, and with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light Education; but what have been awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſome Concern of Soul, and have had
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:005117_0045_1016A8A9C762D6B0"/>ſome Convictions ſtirred up in them, either by the Workings of natural Conſcience, or by the common Motions of the Spirit of God, ſtirred up in them, upon ſome particular Occaſions. Thus Times of Sickneſs, and of ſore Affliction; and Times of imminent Hazard and Danger, frequently are the Occaſion of ſuch Convictions. Moreover the falling into groſs and ſcandalous Sins, will oftentimes ſtir up Conſcience ſo as to laſh the Man very ſeverely, and give him moſt dreadful Twinges, not only for the Sin he has juſt fallen into, but for other Sins alſo, which by this Means are bro't to his Remembrance.</p>
            <p>And there are alſo other Times that Perſons may be under Convictions, when there can be no external Cauſe offered for it; and theſe Convictions may ſometimes run to a very high Degree, ſo that their Sins will ſtare them in the Face, and the Wrath of God they will ſee hanging over them, and they are in great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and Concern about their eternal State, and in great Diſtreſs leſt they ſhould ſuddenly drop into the devouring Lake of Hell. And they may, at ſuch Times, be full of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Acknowledgments, both to God and Man; acknowledging they are ſome of the Chief of Sinners, and will freely ſpeak of their Pride, their Hypocrify, their Covetouſneſs, and their Carnality; and will be aſking Forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where they have offended, and will have many Purpoſes, and be making many Promiſes
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:005117_0046_1016A8AB569AF108"/>of Amendment, and will take ſome Steps, and go a conſiderable Way towards a Reformation.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Things Men are apt to depend upon, and to date their Converſion from ſome ſuch Times as theſe; and when they think or are queſtioned about their Converſion, they will look back to ſome ſuch Seaſon of Conviction, and quiet themſelves with it.</p>
            <p>But now this is no certain Sign of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Converſion, and Perſons may go thus far without any thoro' ſaving Change: For tho' there be no Converſion without Conviction, yet there may be Conviction without Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Convictions may be meerly from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Conſcience, from the Fear of Death, from the Apprehenſions of divine Wrath, and the Terrors of Hell, without any real Love to God, or Faith in Chriſt; and they may be only ſudden Pangs, raiſed by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a preſent Danger, that go off with the Fright. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the Judgments of God fell heavy upon him, he had ſome Conviction, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he had ſinned, and intreated <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him; but the particular Judgment was no ſooner removed, but his Heart was hardned again. <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 9.27, 28.</note> So the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were greatly affected at the Terrors and Glories of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when the Law

            <p>As it is not an uncommon Thing for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have no true Grace, to have ſome Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Remorſe for Sin; ſo neither is it for them to have a conſiderable deal of Joy. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may paſs out of deep Sorrow, into high
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005117_0047_1016A8AF725C3258"/>Degrees of Joy; and from being in Deſpair, to a Sort of full Aſſurance. Perſons may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talk of the Love of Chriſt, and of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him; but they may be perſwaded in their own Minds that they are among the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his redeemed choſen Ones, and they may ſometimes be raiſed up even into ſuch a Tranſport of Joy as to overcome their Natures, and yet it may be a falſe Joy, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it may be very defective. For as there may be a Sorrow about Sin that is not a godly Sorrow, ſo there may be a Joy that is not a true ſpiritual Joy. Which may be ſtirred up mechanically, and by ſome Influence upon the animal O Economy, or from Ignorance and Miſtake about themſelves, and Things of a ſpiritual Nature. We read of a <hi>Generation pure in their own Eyes; and yet are not waſhed from their Filthineſs</hi>

            <p n="7">7. <hi>Some have great Dependance upon their Reformation as to ſome particular Vices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A partial Reformation is no uncommon Thing among thoſe who are yet in their State of Unregeneracy. There are ſome Vices that ſome Sinners more eaſily reform and refrain from. Thus thoſe Sins and Follies that youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Age is ſubject to, are frequently reformed, when Perſons come to riper Years. Other Sins there are that Perſons refrain from, meerly for Want of the ſame Opportunities and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they had before; and this they take for real Reformation, whereas their Hearts are much the ſame. Some again refrain from this and the other Vice, from prudent, political, worldly Conſiderations. They find that they impair their Health, bring on Pain and Sickneſs, and hinder them from other worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and tend to ſhorten Life; and from theſe Conſiderations they refrain. Others again abſtain from this and the other Vice, becauſe it waſts their Effects, and their Circumſtances won't allow it. And others becauſe it hurts their Character, and will bring on Diſgrace, or hinder their Promotion. But now you may eaſily ſee how little theſe are to be depended upon. For if Men only reform as to ſome
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:005117_0048_1016A8B2808BE480"/>Sins, and yet live in others; it is a Sign there is no true Grace in the Heart, and that ſuch a Soul has not paſſed thro' a regenerating Change: For where there is true Grace, there will be the breaking with every Sin. The Language of a truly gracious Soul is that of the Pſalmiſt, 119.128. <hi>I eſteem</hi> ALL <hi>thy Precepts concerning</hi> ALL <hi>Things to be right, and I hate</hi> EVERY <hi>falſe Way.</hi> Yea, there muſt be a departing from <hi>our own Iniquity,</hi> if we would give a ſure Sign of <hi>our Uprightneſs before God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 18.23.</note>. We muſt <hi>lay aſide every Weight, and the Sin that moſt eaſily beſets us, if we would run the chriſtian Race</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. 12.1.</note>.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Others again have great Dependance upon their being juſt, and true, and honeſt in their Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as a certain Mark of their being in a State of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many Perſons in the World, whom if you ſhould aſk them, what Reaſon they had to think they were the Children of God, or what they grounded their Hopes of Heaven and Happineſs upon? Would anſwer, That they have never wronged any Man (as they know of) in their Lives, that they have dealt fairly and juſtly with all Men, that they have been careful to pay their Dues both publick and private.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:005117_0048_1016A8B2808BE480"/>
And now this, if it be true, is an excellent Thing, and it is what the Goſpel teaches and requires, and wherever the Spirit of God comes it always works ſuch a juſt and honeſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Soul, which will put the Man that is under the Influence of it, upon dealing juſtly with all Men, and ſpeaking the Truth to his Neighbour; and without this it is in vain for a Man to pretend to be a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But now a Man's being fair and honeſt in his Dealings is of it ſelf, by no Means to be depended upon. For this may be owing, partly to a Sort of native Simplicity that ſome Men have; or it may be partly from the Manner of their Education, where they have never ſeen the Way of the World, and the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Things of Diſhoneſty, that are practiſed in it; or it may be from a political Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, governing themſelves by that common and good Maxim, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy.</hi> Perſons may be very fair and honeſt in their Dealings, merely for the Sake of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Credit and Cuſtom, and ſo of enlarging their Buſineſs and their Income, without any Regard to God, or their Duty therein; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the moſt likely Means of promoting their worldly Intereſt. And ſo it may be ſaid, that ſome People are fair in their Dealings, from the ſame Views that others are unfair and diſhoneſt, meerly to get more of the World, either of the Praiſe or of the Profit of the World. And
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005117_0049_1016A8B57A3B7880"/>here, altho' I do by no Means put the honeſt and the diſhoneſt Man upon a Level; yet it is poſſible they may both be acted from the ſame carnal and worldly Principle; even a Deſire to get the World. One takes this Way, the other takes that Way, to increaſe his worldly Goods; and as for any Regard to God and their Duty, they don't come into Conſideration by either of them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Some have great Dependance upon their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and charitable Practices, as Marks of their being the Children of God; but they are, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, very uncertain ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Men appear to have a great deal of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity in their Tempers; they ſeem to be of a loving friendly Diſpoſition. They will ſay that they owe no Man any ill Will, and it don't appear that they do: We ſhall find them very neighbourly, and ready to any Acts of Kindneſs that any about them ſtand in need of. They appear tender hearted, and compaſſionate to thoſe in Diſtreſs, and will often go a great Way in giving Relief unto them; lending, or giving, aſſiſting, and defending them, as their Caſes call for, and as they have Ability. And we may ſee they do many generous Actions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Acts of Charity, not only by their Words, but by their Example; and will ſhew very much of a publick Spirit, promoting Things that tend to the publick Good, and will ſcorn to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005117_0049_1016A8B57A3B7880"/>do any Thing that appears mean, and little, and ſtingy.</p>
            <p>And now this is a very lovely Temper, and recommends Perſons to the Eſteem and Delight of all that know them. And this is a Temper and Practice which the Goſpel requires, and which Chriſt himſelf recommends by his own Example, whoſe whole Life was a continued Act of Goodneſs and Kindneſs to Man; and ſuch a Temper is always to be ſound where the Spirit of God is at work in good Earneſt; for <hi>the Fruit of the Spirit is in all Goodneſs.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 5.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But yet there may be a great deal of this Temper operating, without any true Grace; and in ſuch as are the Children of the wicked One, rather than the Children of God. For there is ſuch a Thing as Good-nature: That is, ſome Men in their very Make and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, are more inclined to peaceable, loving, kind, and generous Actions, than others. Some Men are more mild and gentle in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and have leſs of Anger and Reſentment than others. And ſome have a more tender and compaſſionate Temper, and are more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affected with the Difficulties and Diſtreſſes of their Friends and Neighbours, than others. And ſome are naturally more open hearted, and more free to give, than others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:005117_0050_1016A8B87A401430"/>
Moreover the Manner of Men's Education may have a great Hand in this; they are bro't up in an open, free, generous Way of living, and under an Apprehenſion of it's being mean and baſe to appear cloſe and covetous: And ſome are bro't up in ſuch a Way, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears more diſgraceful to them, than to be penurious and cloſe; nor is there any Thing they are more afraid of, than not to be tho't generous and open hearted, and many Times will go beyound their Abilities in their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments and Ways of living, for fear they ſhould be tho't Niggards and Miſers. And now this ſprings from Pride rather than any true Generoſity, and from an unreaſonable Fear and Concern about their own Character, rather than from any true Regard to God and his Honour.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is the ſame Phariſaical Spirit in the World that was in our Saviour's Time, when they <hi>did their Alms to be ſeen of Men, and to have Glory of Men</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 6.2.</note>.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is no uncommon Thing for Men to treat each other with great outward Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and Reſpect; yea, and to heap many Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes upon them, when there is Envy and Malice in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>Finally here, the Apoſtle ſuppoſes a Man may go ſo far as to <hi>give all his Goods to feed the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005117_0050_1016A8B87A401430"/>Poor,</hi> and not have the Grace of <hi>Charity,</hi> and conſequently to <hi>be nothing</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.2.</note>.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Some have great Dependance upon the good Opinion that others have of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If their Reputation runs high for ſerious and religious Perſons, and they underſtand that this is their Character among Men; it is very apt to raiſe their Opinion of themſelves, and it is exceeding natural for Perſons to fall in with the good Opinion that others have of them. But now what is more precarious or uncertain than this? How many are there that bear a good Name and Character, that are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, while others that are much more deſerving, are defamed and condemned? But then if any Perſon who is in great Eſteem for his own Experiences, and for his Skill in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and trying Men's ſpiritual State, ſhall pronounce upon ſome ſuch, when they have examined, that they are converted, and ſhall upon it call them the dear Children of God, they are very apt to conclude at once that it is ſo, and to look upon themſelves as God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But now this is a very uncertain and unſafe Way of determining the Matter as to our ſpiritual State. For alas, what is more fallable than the Judgment of Man, eſpecially when he undertakes to judge about the Hearts
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:005117_0051_1016A8E230DBD000"/>of others? It is exceeding difficult for Men to find out their own Hearts ſo as to judge fully upon them, how much more difficult to judge the Hearts of others. If Men are apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, Oh how eaſy is it then to deceive others! Nay, ſome of theſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to judge the State of others, may be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deceived and deluded as to themſelves, and then no wonder if they ſhould be deceived as to others, and be the Means of deceiving them. Moreover, ſome real Chriſtians may have an Exceſs of Charity, that is they may ſometimes judge too favourably of others, and think they are the Children of God when they are not. So that altho' it may be very proper for Perſons to lay their Caſe before experienced Divines, and converſe with experienced Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians about their ſpiritual State? yet there muſt not be too great Streſs laid upon their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but you muſt remember that <hi>Man looks at the outward Appearance,</hi> and <hi>that it is God alone that looks to the Heart,</hi> and that ſees to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it. And you muſt be ſenſible, that many and many a one who has been number'd among the Saints of God on Earth; yea, and had in high Reputation for their Piety and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will be ranked with Sinners in the Day of Judgment. Who were in greater Reputation for Piety and Sanctity than the Phariſees of old? and yet Chriſt pronounces them groſs <hi>Hypocrites,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:005117_0051_1016A8E230DBD000"/>and <hi>ſuch as ſhould receive the greater Damnation</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Matth. 23.14.</note> And <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf was miſtaken with Reſpect to <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, when he baptized him, and received him among the Faithful <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 8.13, 23.</note>. Which ſhews how unſafe it is to depend upon the good Opinion or Judgment of others with Reſpect to the State of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>There is a Sort of Love to God and Chriſt which ſome Perſons have, and depend very much upon it, as a Mark of their being the true Children of God; and yet it is a very uncertain one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true Love of God and Chriſt, is one of the beſt Evidences that we are the Children of God, <hi>for God is Love, and every one that loveth is born of God</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John 4.7, 8.</note>. But yet there is a Sort of Love, and an Appearance of Love, which People are apt to be deceived with, which is no Sign of our being the Children of God.</p>
            <p>Thus there <hi>is a loving in Word and in Tongue,</hi> which ſome at length come to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is a real hearty Love, that is, ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take delight in diſcourſing about Chriſt, and about Matters of Religion, and eſpecially about their own ſuppoſed Experiences, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the goings forth of their Souls as they imagine in Love to God and Chriſt, and they by frequent ſpeaking of theſe Things without a
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:005117_0052_1016675A36AE3AE0"/>careful Examination, they are at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they do truly love him, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there may be no real Love in their Hearts, nor any manifeſt Token of it in their Lives, none of that which Chriſt makes the ſtanding Mark and ſure Sign of true Love to him, <hi>even the keeping his Commandments</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John 14.21.</note>.</p>
            <p>Again, there are ſome that think they love God and Chriſt, and ſo are the Children of God; becauſe they love to attend upon ſome religious Duties, they love to read, they love to hear, they love to meet together for religious Worſhip, and for Converſation about religious Matters, and ſometimes they are in ſuch an earneſt Frame about theſe Things, that they know not how to let ſlip any Opportunity for meeting together that occurs. And now there is a great Shew of Love to God in theſe Things; and it muſt be ſaid, that where there is true Love to God there will be a Love to his Houſe, a Love to his Worſhip, and to his Ordinances. But yet there is a Sort of Love to theſe Things, that is no certain Sign of Love to God, or of our being his Children. A Man may love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Aſſemblies and religious Exerciſes upon ſome Accounts; and yet not truly love God. When there was but very little of the Love of God or of Obedience to him among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they abounded in Sacrifices, ſo
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:005117_0052_1016675A36AE3AE0"/>that <hi>God was full of them and weary of them</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. 1.11, 12.</note>. And ſpeaks of it to the Reproach of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they ſeemed to love and delight in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Services, when they had no real Regard for him. <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my Ways, as a Nation that did Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for ſook not the Ordinances of their God, they aſk of me the Ordinances of Juſtice, they take Delight in approaching to God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. 58.2.</note>. <hi>Herod heard John gladly</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark 6.20.</note>, but was very far from loving him, or Chriſt whoſe Meſſenger he was. <hi>Stony ground Hearers receive the Word with Joy, but are not rooted and grounded in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Some miſtake and think they love Chriſt ſo as is a good Sign of their being the Children of God, becauſe they find themſelves much affected with a lively Deſcription of the Sufferings and Death of Chriſt, when perhaps the ſame Affections might be raiſed by reading or hearing any other affecting Tragedy, at leaſt if they ſaw one acted upon the Stage. Chriſt's Sufferings may be deſcribed in ſuch a lively Manner as to work very powerfully upon the Imagination and Affections, even ſo as to draw forth Tears, yea, to cauſe Schreetches and Screamings out, and yet there may be no true Love to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:005117_0053_1016675C266D91F8"/>
Again, Perſons may miſtake as to their Love to Chriſt, and ſo their being the Children of God, this Way, <hi>viz.</hi> they are filled with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and Terror becauſe of the Wrath of God and the eternal Torments of Hell-Fire they are expoſed unto, and the Apprehenſions that Chriſt will deliver them from Death, and Hell, and eternal Miſery, excite ſome Love and Affections in them to Jeſus Chriſt; but it is perhaps meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this Tho't of his being their Deliverer from Miſery, without any Conſideration of thoſe amiable Excellencies and Perfections in him, which demand their higheſt Eſteem, Love, and Delight. They love him only as a Man would love another that ſhould go into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and pull him out when he was juſt ſinking and drowning, he will in the Time of it have ſome grateful Senſe of his Kindneſs, and will find ſome conſiderable Love going towards him, and yet perhaps may have no inward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for him; may have no Regard for him, but only for this one Act of Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus Perſons may be pleaſed with the Tho't of having Chriſt for their Saviour, to ſave them from Hell and Miſery; and yet have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Eſteem of him for his own real amiable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, ſo as to love him upon the Account of them; they may love him for his Goodneſs and Kindneſs to them, but not for his Wiſdom, his Juſtice, his Truth, and Holineſs: They may love him for a Saviour, but not for a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005117_0053_1016675C266D91F8"/>they may love him for purchaſing a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but not for his Precepts and Rules of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But this is not a true Love. For where there is the true Love of God's Children, there will be a loving Chriſt for his own Sake, and for what he is in himſelf, as well as for what he is to them. They will be pleaſed with him as well for being a Prince, as a Saviour; and will be as much pleaſed with the Thought of being delivered from the Power, as from the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Many have great Dependance upon their acting Conſcienciouſly, and being fearful of doing any Thing that will ſtir up their Conſciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. But now, in ſome Reſpects, this is an uncertain Mark of being the Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many there are, who conclude they are the Children of God, and draw great Comfort to themſelves from this Conſideration, that they make Conſcience of their Ways, and that they don't allow themſelves in offending againſt their Conſciences, or in doing any Thing that their Conſciences would accuſe them of. And beſure this bids fair for a certain Mark of a true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian and Child of God. The Apoſtle's Advice to others was to <hi>have</hi> &amp; keep <hi>a good Conſcience</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3.16.</note>. And they exerciſed themſelves to <hi>have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of Offence towards God, and towards
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005117_0054_101667E9ADF05C58"/>Men</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts 24.16.</note>. And their rejoicing was this, the <hi>Teſtimony of their Conſciences,</hi> that in Simplicity, and godly Sincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, they had their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the World <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 1.12.</note>. And Baptiſm is ſaid to ſave us, not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh, <hi>but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> And yet after all we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh here about Conſcience, or we may be miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Thus we muſt diſtinguiſh,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Between Conſcience in the full Extent and Latitude of its Dictates, and in the reſtrained li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Senſe in which it is frequently taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus conſidering Conſcience in the full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, and it teaches us that we ought to aim at the Glory of God in all we do, and that we ſhould keep his Commandments out of Love to God, and from a Principle of Obedience, and with ſincere Deſires of pleaſing, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him thereby.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Conſcience enlightned by divine Revelation teaches us to do all we do in the Name of Chriſt and in Dependance upon his Grace to help us, truſting to find Acceptance only thro' him. Now taking Conſcience in ſuch a large Senſe and it dictates the whole of
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005117_0054_101667E9ADF05C58"/>Chriſtianity to us, and conſequently to comply with the Dictates thereof, is to come up to the Precepts and Principles of Chriſtianity. And ſuch as go this Length in complying with the Dictates of Conſcience, may upon good Grounds conclude they are the Children of God.</p>
            <p>But taking Conſcience as it is more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and commonly underſtood, and it intends no more than its dictating to us that this and the other is to be done by us, as our Duty; that this and the other is a Sin, and muſt be avoided, without conſidering ſo much how and after what Manner it is to be done either with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God or Chriſt. Conſcience, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common vulgar Underſtanding of it, don't ſo much reſpect the Principle, the Views, and the Aims reſpecting God and Chriſt, as the bare doing or not doing the Thing. And now I ſay taking Conſcience in this reſtrained Senſe, and a Man may be conſciencious, that is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do this and the other Duty, and to avoid this and the other Sin; and yet it may be no certain Sign of his being a Child of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh between our Regards extending ultimately to God, and their terminating in Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho' we are to have a conſtant Regard to Conſcience, and muſt govern our ſelves by the Dictates thereof in all we do: yet our Tho'ts and Views, our Subjection and Obedience
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005117_0055_1016A8BB60804C18"/>muſt not terminate in Conſcience. But we muſt look beyond Conſcience unto God, whoſe Will and Command is our only Rule, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not to be regarded, only upon the Suppoſition of its dictating the Will of God to us. Conſcience is to be conſulted upon all Occaſions; but yet it muſt not be conſidered as our Sovereign and ſupreme Lord, but only as God's Deputy and Vicegerent in the Soul. We muſt obey Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not meerly becauſe it is the Voice of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but becauſe we look upon it as the Voice of God, and as dictating the Mind and Will of God unto us. And ſo our hearkening to the Dictates of Conſcience muſt be in Obedience to God, and becauſe we look upon the Dictates thereof as the Will of God made known unto us. For unleſs we thus carry our Thoughts and Principles of Obedience beyond Conſcience unto God, we ſhall make Conſcience to be our God and Sovereign, to the Neglect of the great God himſelf, who is the Lord of Conſcience. And even an Atheiſt might go ſo far as this, he might hearken to his own Conſcience accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it judged Things to be right or wrong, and God not be in all his Thoughts. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if we may ſuppoſe a Man to govern himſelf by Conſcience, without any ultimate Regard to God, and he would be miſtaken if he ſhould look upon himſelf a Child of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:005117_0055_1016A8BB60804C18"/>
3. <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh between a free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Obedience to Conſcience, and a ſervile ſlaviſh Subjection to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men may follow the Dictates of Conſcience, but not out of any love to, or delight in what they do: They may be even compelled and forced to it, for fear of the Laſhes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience afterwards. And ſo to prevent the Trouble and Diſtreſs of Mind they know they ſhall be in, if they don't hearken to Conſcience; they ſubmit to this and that which Conſcience tells them they muſt do.</p>
            <p>And this is the Caſe with many Perſons, they refrain from many known Sins, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they really hate them, and they comply with many known Duties, not becauſe they love and Delight in them; but merely out of Fear of their Conſciences, leaſt they ſhould riſe up againſt them, ſhould accuſe them, and ſhould give great Trouble and Diſtreſs of Mind to them.</p>
            <p>And now the Vertue and Goodneſs of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining from Sin, and complying with Duty, ſeems to be no more than when a Man refrains from ſuch and ſuch a Sin, merely for fear of ſome bodily Pain and Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>For what is the real Difference in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, when a Man refrains from a ſinful Action for fear of a whipt Back, or ſome bodily Pain that it may naturally cauſe; and when it is merely to eſcape the Pain of the Mind, the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005117_0056_1016A8BE188CAB00"/>Girds and Laſhes of a guilty Conſcience? You muſt remember that I ſay, when it is wholly and merely for ſear of this. For that the Fear of Conſcience, and its ſevere Laſhes, is, and may be, an Argument with us to reſtrain us from Sin is undoubted, and ſo may the Fear of bodily Pain or Puniſhment. But when it is only this Fear of the Laſh of Conſcience that dictates and hinders us, it is a ſervile Fear of Conſcience, rather than a gracious child-like Fear of God; and ſo is by no Means a Proof of our being the Children of God.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee how that Conſciouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in ſome Reſpects is a very different Thing from true Godlineſs: And thus a Man may in ſome Senſe be a conſcientious Man, and yet no true Child of God.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon this Head, and been more particular in making the Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe it is ſhocking at the firſt Tho't to many, to ſay, that making Conſcience of their Ways is not a certain Sign of their being the Children of God; and that Perſons might ſee what I mean by it, and that they might not commit a Miſtake in this Point, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry at laſt: For this is a very dangerous Rock upon which many are loſt, and the peculiar Dangerouſneſs of it lies in this, that it is not ſo eaſily diſcerned as ſome others.</p>
            <p>And thus I have mentioned ſome of the many falſe and uncertain Marks of being the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005117_0056_1016A8BE188CAB00"/>Children of God, by which Multitudes have been, and are deceived. I ſay ſome of the falſe uncertain Marks, for there are a Multitude more from which Perſons take occaſion to flatter themſelves into vain Hopes of their good Eſtate, to their eternal Ruin. But what I have ſaid is abundantly ſufficient to ground this one <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Reflection</hi> upon, with which I ſhall conclude the preſent Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since there are ſo many Things which we are apt to depend upon as Signs of our being the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, that are falſe, and at beſt but uncertain Marks hereof; Oh! with what a godly Jealouſy ſhould we be jealous over ourſelves, and with what holy Fear and Trembling ſhould we be working out our own Salvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee that there are a Multitude of Ways for Men to deceive and delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even in Matters of the higheſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of infinite Concernment to them. Innumerable Ways of raiſing our Hopes and Expectations of Safety and Happineſs in the future eternal World, and all upon a ſandy Foundation that will fail us in the Concluſion. And the Wretchedneſs of it is, that we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceive our ſelves, and ſuffer our ſelves to be deluded. And Oh! what Multitudes have flattered themſelves with falſe Hopes, and for want of due Care, have never found their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, till it was paſt all Remedy! How jealous
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005117_0057_1016A8BFB2598E90"/>then ſhould we be of our ſelves! and how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſt this ſhould be our own dreadful Caſe! When I conſider the many falſe and uncertain Marks there are of our being the Sons of God, and the innumerable Ways that a ſubtle Devil and our own deceitful Hearts have to deceive us, I am ſhocked extremely to hear People talk with ſo much Confidence, as ſome have done, about their good Eſtate. When People will ſay they are as fully aſſured of their future Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being as they are of their preſent Exiſtence, and that they know as certainly that they are born of God, and are converted, as that they are born of their earthly Parents: I ſay when Perſons talk with ſuch Confidence as this, and yet at the ſame Time acknowledge that they are but newly converted, and ſo have had but little Experience; it looks as if they had not thoroughly conſidered of the many Ways in which Perſons are liable to be deceived, and I doubt not but that Length of Time, and a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Experience, will abate their Poſitiveneſs, and lead them into a more modeſt Way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing themſelves about theſe Things. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if Perſons did but duly conſider the Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Men's Hearts, and the Subtilty of Satan, and the innumerable Ways in which Men have been deluded, they would humbly enquire whether a deceived Heart hath not turned them aſide; and inſtead of talking with ſuch an Air of Confidence as ſome have done,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005117_0057_1016A8BFB2598E90"/>they would ſay, <hi>Search me, O God, and know my Heart, try me, and know my Tho'ts; and ſee if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way everlaſting.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 139.23, 24.</note>

            <p>Dearly beloved, let every one of you that pretend to any Hopes of your good Eſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether you have not been feeding upon Aſhes, whether you have not had your Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon ſome of theſe falſe and uncertain Marks? Whether you have any better Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for your Hopes, or ſuppoſed Aſſurances, than ſome of thoſe Marks which Hypocrites may have? Whether your Confidences are not vain, and your Refuge of Lies, that will quickly be ſwept away.</p>
            <p>Oh that you were ſenſible of the vaſt Extent of Chriſtianity, and how difficult it is to be a thoro' Chriſtian, and how exceeding apt Perſons are to <hi>think they are ſomething, when indeed they are nothing, and ſo deceive them ſelves.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent any fatal Miſtakes in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you muſt diligently ſtudy the Nature of true Chriſtianity in the full Extent and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of it, and not take up with only ſome particular Part or Inſtance of it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſureſt and cleareſt Mark of our being the Children of God, is our being</hi> LED <hi>and</hi> GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED <hi>by</hi> HIS SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>Under which I have ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is our higheſt Privilege and Happineſs to be numbred and found among the Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is Matter of unſpeakable Comfort, to have a well grounded Evidence in our ſelves, that we are the Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That there are many Things, which Perſons are apt to take for Marks and Tokens of their being
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005117_0059_1016A8C59AEC8460"/>the Children of God, which are falſe, at leaſt very uncertain, and by no Means to be depended upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the ſureſt and cleareſt Mark of our being the Children of God, is our being</hi> LED <hi>and</hi> GOVERNED <hi>by</hi> HIS SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs you would all be glad to know that you are the Sons of God, and many of you I believe are inquiſitive about it, and looking out for Signs and Marks of your Regeneration, and ſo of your being among his Children; well let me tell you from God himſelf, that this is the moſt ſure, yea the only certain Mark of it; even your being led and governed by his Spirit. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> So many as are led by his Spirit, are his Children, and no more. Let their Profeſſion and their Pretenſions be what they will; if they be not led by his Spirit, and are not under the Government of a gracious Principle, they are not his Children; whereas, every Perſon that is led by this bleſſed Spirit, let them be never ſo much deſpiſed, let them be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hardly cenſured and condemned and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the World, yet God will own and love them, and treat them as his Children.</p>
            <p>But then this Queſtion naturally ariſes, <hi>How ſhall I know whether I am led by the Spirit of God or no?</hi> You will be ready to ſay, I doubt not but that all who are led by the Spirit of God
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005117_0059_1016A8C59AEC8460"/>are his Children; but the great Difficulty is to know whether I am led by his Spirit or no? Many have thought that they have been led by this good Spirit of God, and have been very confident about it, when really they have been govern'd only by their own Spirits, or deluded by the Devil that wicked Spirit; and there are (as has been ſaid) a Multitude of Ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Perſons are deceived about their being led by the Spirit of God; how then ſhall I know whether I am ſo governed by him as to be a ſure and certain Mark of my being a Child of God? Well then, this is what I propoſe by the Help of God to ſhew you at this Time, namely, <hi>When Perſons are ſo led by the Spirit of God, as to be a ſure and clear Mark of their being the Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this, my Hearers, demands your diligent Attention, and careful Obſervation; for you muſt be ſenſible there are ſome Things that look like the Leadings and Workings of God's Spirit, which indeed are but the natural Workings of our own, and it is very difficult to diſtinguiſh ſome of the Workings of refined Nature from true Grace, and Men are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to be miſtaken herein, and have many Times taken this and that to be the Workings of the Spirit of Grace, when really they are one Workings of their own Imaginations or Paſſions.</p>
            <p>What I propoſe therefore is to give you ſome of the cleareſt and beſt Marks I can, of our
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005117_0060_1016A8C9F2D8EC08"/>being led by the Spirit of God, and of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a divine and gracious Influence in what we do; by which, if we do not miſtake in the Application of theſe Marks, we may in ſome good Meaſure judge what Manner of Perſons we are.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall not conſider any of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gifts, or miraculous Operations of the Spirit of God, in which the Holy Ghoſt fell upon the Apoſtles, in the Day of Pentecoſt; for theſe extraordinary and miraculous Gifts, are diſtant from the Graces of the Spirit, and are in their Nature ſeparable from them, and ſo are no certain Signs of our being the Children of God. Men may have thoſe Gifts of the Spirit, and not be the Sons of God; for Gifts and Graces don't always go together, no not thoſe extraordinary Gifts. <hi>Many will ſay in the Day of Judgment, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works, to whom Chriſt will ſay, Depart from me ye that work Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 7.22, 23.</note>. So that even theſe extraordinary Leadings or miraculous Operations of the Spirit, are no infallible Sign of Grace, and ſo not of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, therefore I ſhall ſay nothing of them.</p>
            <p>Neither in the ſecond Place ſhall I take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch Things, as the Workings of God's Spirit may be only the accidental Cauſes of,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005117_0060_1016A8C9F2D8EC08"/>and which Things may be, and oftentimes are, produced by ſome other Cauſes. That is, I ſhall not ſpeak of any extraordinary Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spirit or Body, nor any Out-cries for Sorrow, or Screamings for Joy, or falling down, or Swoonings, and Faintings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, or other religious Exerciſes; for altho' the Spirit of God no doubt may come ſo powerfully in Convictions, and Comforts, and Joys, upon weak Spirits as even to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and ſo be the accidental Cauſe of ſuch Appearances ſometimes; yet as it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and no Ways improbable, but that ſuch uncommon Appearances, may oftentimes ariſe from quite different Cauſes; and the Spirit of God have no Hand in them, but in a providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Way, ſo theſe can be no certain Marks or Tokens of a Man's being under the ſpecial O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Spirit of God; therefore there is no Streſs at all to be laid upon ſuch Things conſidered in themſelves.</p>
            <p>But the Tokens and Marks that I ſhall give you, of your being ſo led by the Spirit of God, as to be a certain Sign of your being the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, ſhall be ſuch as ariſe from the very Nature of the divine Spirit himſelf, as it is revealed, to us in the Names, Titles, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters that are given of him in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and <hi>theſe theſe,</hi> my Brethren, you may depend upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:005117_0061_1016A8CBF52E1320"/>
So then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I ſhall begin with that Character or Title given of this Spirit in our Text, where he is called the</hi> SPIRIT OF GOD.</p>
            <p>So that this Spirit which leads and governs every Child of God is the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> the third Perſon in the adorable Trinity, and ſo is indeed God. And he is frequently ſtiled the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>And now if it be the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> that leads them, we may conclude that he will lead them unto God. For whether ſhould the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> lead us, but unto God himſelf?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> muſt needs lead us to the Belief of his Being and Perfections, and to the Knowledge of him, and Acquaintance with him in ſome Meaſure, and to have a ſpecial Regard to him in all our Actions. If the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> leads us he muſt needs lead us to <hi>believe that God is,</hi> and to ſee and apprehend ſomething of his Glory and Majeſty, and of thoſe glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Perfections that make up the divine Eſſence. Moreover, The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> will lead us to ſee and conſider him in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he ſtands in to us, and to all the World, as our Creator, our Preſerver, and our ſovereign Lord and Ruler; and ſo will lead us to eſteem and admire him, to worſhip and adore him, to love and fear him, to truſt in him, and obey him, to be above all concerned for his Glory, and to place all our Happineſs in him. Now
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:005117_0061_1016A8CBF52E1320"/>I ſay, that that Spirit which is the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> whenever he leads any of us, muſt needs thus lead us to God.</p>
            <p>Well then, if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are thus led to God, or no. Are you led to ſuch Apprehenſions of God, and to ſuch Diſpoſitions and Affections of Soul towards him, as are due to him from us? Have you a firm Belief of his Being, and have you the higheſt Apprehenſions of his infinite Majeſty, and of all his glorious Excellencies and Perfections? Do you ſtand in an holy Awe of him, ſo as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him with Reverence and godly Fear, and are you afraid of ſinning againſt him? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, do you love him with all your Heart and Soul, have you the higheſt Eſteem of him, have you the moſt ardent Deſires after him, and do you take the greateſt Delight in drawing nigh to him, and in having Communion with him? Are you really concerned for his Honour and Glory, and have you a Care, and is it your Deſire and Endeavour to pleaſe, honour and glorify him in all Things? And do you find your ſelves grieved and troubled whenever you ſee God diſhonoured, or diſpleaſed? Does Sin trouble you becauſe it diſhonours God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends him? And can you ſay that you are ſo concerned for the Glory of God, that there is a general and a governing Aim at it in all you do, even in the daily Concerns and common Affairs
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:005117_0062_1016A8CEE219B0C8"/>of Life? Do you in any Meaſure come up to the Apoſtle's Rule, that <hi>whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, you do all to the Glory of God.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> Furthermore, Do you find yourſelves devoted to the Service of God, and are you ſubmiſſive to his Will? Do you find and feel your ſelves under the Influence of his divine Power and Authority, and do you find a ready Subjection to his Preceptive Will, and a quiet Submiſſion to his providential Will? Can you heartily ſay as in the Lord's Prayer, <hi>Thy Will be done?</hi> And do you really deſire to know, obey and ſubmit to his Will in all Things? Again, Do you plainly ſee that he is the only ſatisfying Portion of the Soul? And can you truly ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 119.57. <hi>Thou art my Portion, O Lord?</hi> And do you plainly perceive that all your real Happineſs lies in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God? And do you find the Streams of Goodneſs that flow from him to you, enlarge your Heart towards him, and lead you nearer and nearer to the Fountain of all Good?</p>
            <p>Now if it be thus with you, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that you are led by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and conſequently are the Children of God. For who or what would lead us to God in ſuch a Manner as this, but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> himſelf?</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:005117_0062_1016A8CEE219B0C8"/>
2. <hi>This Spirit is called</hi> the SPIRIT OF CHRIST, conſequently he will lead us to CHRIST, and to GOD thro' CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Thus he is called in the 9th Verſe of the Context, <hi>If any Man have not the</hi> SPIRIT OF CHRIST, <hi>he is none of his.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. he is called the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> And now this divine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit was the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> conſidering Chriſt in his mediatorial Office, for Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>received the Spirit not by Meaſure,</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">John 3.34.</note> and he dwelt in him. And it was <hi>by the holy Ghoſt</hi> that he choſe his Diſciples, and gave Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto them. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts 1.2.</note> Moreover he may be called the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> as he procured of the Father his being ſent to teſtify of him; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow his Apoſtles, thoſe choſen Witneſſes of his, with thoſe extraordinary and miraculous Gifts, which fitted them for preaching Chriſt, and publiſhing the Goſpel to the World: And to work powerfully, graciouſly, and ſavingly upon the Souls of Men. For thus ſays Chriſt, <hi>But when the Comforter, that is the holy Ghoſt is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father; he ſhall teſtify of me.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">John 15.26.</note> And we read of God's ſending forth the <hi>Spirit of his Son</hi> into the Hearts of his Children. <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 4.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And now if it be the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>teſtifieth concerning Chriſt,</hi> that leads
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005117_0063_1016A8D4093C4DB8"/>and governs every Child of God, we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude that <hi>this Spirit</hi> will lead them unto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to the Knowledge, the ſaving Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to a ſincere Belief on <hi>him,</hi> and to a hearty Acceptance of <hi>him</hi> as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and offered in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And this Spirit leads the Soul to Chriſt by <hi>convincing him of Sin,</hi> of the Evil of Sin in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and of his own Sinfulneſs in particular. He opens the Man's Eyes to ſee what a vile Creature he is by reaſon of Sin. He gives him to ſee how that his corrupt Nature, and his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Life has rendred him very odious and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the infinitely holy God, that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to divine Juſtice; and that he deſerves nothing leſs than Death, Hell, and eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. He gives him to ſee that all the Curſes of God's Law are out againſt him, and that he is liable every Day to be ſeized by divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and that it is of the Lord's Mercies that he is not conſumed in the Flames of Hell.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This bleſſed Spirit in leading the Soul to Chriſt, leads him to ſee that he has no Way to help and deliver himſelf out of this wretched State. He gives the Soul to ſee that he has not wherewith to atone for his Sin, or make Satisfaction to divine Juſtice: For the Soul that is thereby convinced of Sin, ſees ſuch an infinite Evil in Sin, and that it reflects ſuch an infinite Diſhonour upon God, that nothing he has to offer to God can be ſufficient to atone
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005117_0063_1016A8D4093C4DB8"/>therefor. He ſees that <hi>Lebanon is not ſufficient to burn, nor the Beaſts thereof ſufficient for a Burnt-offering</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. 40.16.</note>. Nay, he is by the Spirit made to ſee, that if God would accept of his ſincere Repentance for his paſt Sins, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of Life for the future; yet that he has no Heart herefor, but that if he be left to himſelf, he ſhall, inſtead of repenting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, be adding continually to the Score of Guilt, and <hi>treaſuring up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> So that he by the Spirit is led to ſee, that if left to himſelf, he has no Hope no Help; but muſt inevitably periſh.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The Spirit leads him to ſee that there is no Way to Salvation but in and thro' Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that there is no Salvation in any other, nor any other Name given under Heaven among Men, whereby we can be ſaved, but only the Name of Jeſus</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts 5.12.</note> And here the Spirit opens the Eyes of the poor convinced Soul to ſee Jeſus <hi>whom God hath exalted at his own right Hand to be a Prince and Saviour, to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Remiſſion of Sins</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 5.31.</note>. And he ſees him as one able <hi>to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 7.25.</note>. Accordingly this bleſſed Spirit perſuades and enables the Soul to come to Chriſt, and to come to God thro' him, and to commit the whole Affair of his Salvation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005117_0064_1016A8D58F0EE778"/>his Hands, heartily accepting of him in all the Offices that he ſuſtains and executes as our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Now then if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit; you muſt ſee whether he thus leads you unto the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Has this Spirit thoro'ly convinced you of Sin? Have you been led to ſee your ſinful, loſt and periſhing State, and the abſolute Need you ſtand in of a Saviour? And have you ſeen the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all-ſufficiency of Chriſt, and the Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is in him to be a compleat Saviour to you? Have you ever ſeen the amiable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies there are in Chriſt, and his amazing Love to poor periſhing Sinners, in purchaſing and procuring eternal Redemption for them, at the Price of his own moſt precious Blood and Life? Do you alſo ſee how that in this Affair of our Salvation by a Redeemer God has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded towards us <hi>in all Wiſdom and Prudence,</hi> and do you highly approve of this Method of Salvation, which humbles Man, and exalts free Grace; and do you heartily come into it? Do you receive him heartily and unreſervedly as the <hi>Prophet, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of your Salvation? Do you ſubject your ſelf to him, as freely as you rely upon him for Salvation, nay do you ſee that your Salvation does very much conſiſt in a Subjection to him? Do you ſhake off all Dependance upon your ſelves, or upon any Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or Worthineſs of your own, and do
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:005117_0064_1016A8D58F0EE778"/>you look to him both for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Strength?</hi> Do you depend entirely upon the Merits of Chriſt's Obedience and Death, and the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Interceſſion for Pardon and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God? And are you willing, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily willing, to be ſaved in the Way that Chriſt offers to be your Saviour?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Are you ſo led to Chriſt as to be in love with him? Do you ſee a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, a Beauty, and a Glory in him, ſo as to eſteem him the Chief among ten Thouſands, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely? And do you love him above Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother, and Brother, and Siſter, and Wife, and Children, and Houſes, and Lands; yea, and above your very Lives? Thus you muſt love him, or you are not worthy of him <note n="‖" place="bottom">Matth. 10.37, 38.</note>; and thus you will love him, if you are led by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Finally here, are you ſo led to him, as to be in ſome Meaſure conformed to him? Have you ſomething of the ſame Mind in you as was in Chriſt Jeſus? Has this bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt aſſimilated you, and made you like to him in the Temper of your Minds? And does it lead you to tread in his Steps, and walk as he walked in the World? Have you learned of him who was humble, and meek, and lowly in Heart? Are you diligent, and devout, are you patient, and forgiving, are you harmleſs and
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005117_0065_1016A8D84D0F8180"/>heavenly as he was? And have you any Thing of that Submiſſiveneſs to your heavenly Father's Will, and ſuch a Concern for his Glory as there was in Chriſt? And is there any Thing of that Care and diligent Endeavour to finiſh the Work which God has given you to do, as there was in him?</p>
            <p>And now if you can find ſuch a Temper, and ſuch a Behaviour towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, you may conclude that the Spirit of Chriſt has ſo far the Leading of you, as to be a good Evidence that you are the Children of God.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Spirit by which the Children of God are led, is</hi> A SPIRIT OF TRUTH, <hi>by whoſe Inſpiration the holy Scriptures were given: Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuch as are led by</hi> THIS SPIRIT, <hi>will have a high Regard for them, and will make them the Rule of their Faith and Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Scripture was given by Inſpiration of God, that is of the Spirit of God: <hi>For holy Men of God ſpake theſe Things as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1.21.</note>. Thus it was with the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, and it is the ſame with the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, for the Authors thereof had the Spirit of God with them, even the Spirit of Truth to lead them
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:005117_0065_1016A8D84D0F8180"/>into all, that is into all neceſſary Truths <note n="*" place="bottom">John 16.13.</note>. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that they ſpake <hi>not in Words which Men's Wiſdom teacheth, but which the</hi> HOLY GHOST <hi>teacheth</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2.13.</note>. So that the Spirit which leads every Child of God is the ſelf ſame Spirit which inſpired the Prophets and Apoſtles of old, and enabled them to deliver thoſe ſacred Oracles of Truth contained in the Bible.</p>
            <p>And now we may be ſure that all thoſe whom this bleſſed Spirit leads and governs, he will lead them not only into the Belief of the Scriptures which came from himſelf; but into the Love of them, and into a Conformity to them.</p>
            <p>So that if this Spirit has the Leading of any, it may be depended upon that he will lead them to receive the Word with Faith and Love, and to lay it up in their Hearts, and practice it in their Lives.</p>
            <p>Now then if you would know whether you are led by this Spirit, you muſt enquire how you receive and entertain the written Word of God. Do the Scriptures appear to you to be the Oracles of God, and ſo the Oracles of Truth? And do the Truths thereof come with convincing Evidence? Do they come upon you in <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit, and with Power?</hi> Are you brought to yield a full Aſſent to Goſpel Truths? Do you believe the Hiſtory,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005117_0066_1016A8D9E2F35788"/>the Doctrines, the Promiſes, the Threatnings, and the Propheſies of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And do the ſublime myſterious Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, which are plainly revealed in the Goſpel, come with ſuch Demonſtration upon your Souls, as that you yield a full Aſſent to the Truth of them; even tho' they are above your Reaſon to comprehend?</p>
            <p>Moreover, Are your Eyes ſo opened, as <hi>to behold the wondrous Things contained in God's Law</hi> and Goſpel, and do you inwardly and heartily approve of the Goſpel Scheme, and Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? And do you deſire to be ſaved in that Way?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, You muſt enquire how the Precepts and Rules of Living laid down in the Word of God affect you. Do they ſtrike you as the Laws of the King of Heaven, and as the Commandments of God our Saviour? Do you ſee the divine Authority that is inſtamped upon all of them? And have you a Senſe of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation you are under in Point of Duty, as well as Intereſt, to hear and obſerve all that God has commanded, and can you find a Heart as well as a Tongue, to ſay, <hi>All that the Lord our God hath ſaid unto us, that will we do?</hi> And beſides a Senſe of the divine Authority, do you ſee any Excellency in the Precepts themſelves? Do you ſee into the Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of the divine Commandment in his Word? Can you ſay, that you <hi>eſteem all God's Precepts
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005117_0066_1016A8D9E2F35788"/>concerning all Things to be right?</hi> Does the Law appear to be <hi>holy,</hi> and the Commandment <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>good?</hi> And do you adhere cloſely to the Word of God, as the only ſure Rule of your Faith and Practice? And do you reject every Thing in Religion that is not according to this Word? And do you hide this Word in your Heart that you may not ſin againſt God?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Is the Word of God your Delight, as well as your Counſellor? Do you Delight in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law do you meditate Day and Night? Are you able to ſay that the Law of God's Mouth is better to you than Thouſands of Gold and Silver, and are his Statutes your Songs in the Houſe of your Pilgrimage, and is his Word ſweeter to you than Honey, or the Honey Comb?</p>
            <p>But then can you alſo ſay with the Pſalmiſt, 119.140. <hi>Thy Word is</hi> VERY PURE, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Servant loveth it?</hi> Here conſider I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you very particularly, whether it be the <hi>Purity</hi> of God's Word that in an eſpecial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner recommends it to your Choice, your Love, and Delight. Do you love the Word of God becauſe its Doctrines are <hi>pure,</hi> and its Precepts <hi>holy,</hi> and becauſe they tend to inſtruct you in the Nature of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and alſo to make you <hi>holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now if it be thus with you, you may conclude that you are led by this bleſſed Spirit,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005117_0067_1016A8DDDBA2AD30"/>and are the Children of God; for the Spirit of God is uniform in his Operations. And ſince he indited the holy Scriptures, giving us the Doctrines and Precepts thereof; we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch as he takes the Leading of, he will lead them into the Faith, the Love, and Practice of the Things contained therein.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Again the Spirit by which the Children of God are led, is a</hi> SPIRIT OF HOLINESS; <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſuch as are ſo led by the holy Spirit, as to demonſtrate them the Children of God, they will be led to</hi> HOLINESS.</p>
            <p>He is called the <hi>Spirit of Holineſs.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 1.4.</note> And in a Multitude of Places he is called the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> or the HOLY GHOST. And now we may conclude, that all the Operations of this Spirit will be HOLY, and that if ever he leads us, he will lead us from Sin to <hi>Holineſs:</hi> That if ever he gives a Turn to us, and works a Change in us, it muſt needs be from a Life of Sin to a Life of <hi>Holineſs.</hi> And that if ever this Spirit work power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and effectually upon the Soul, it will thoro'ly convince of Sin, and beget a real Grief and Sorrow for Sin, and an Hatred of every Thing that appears ſinful, &amp; a Love to, &amp; a Delight in, &amp; the Practice of every Thing that appears truly <hi>good and holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then if you would know whether you are under the Influence of ſuch an <hi>holy Spirit,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:005117_0067_1016A8DDDBA2AD30"/>you muſt conſider what Operation this Spirit has had upon you with Reſpect to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> You muſt enquire whether this Spirit has ever ſo opened your Eyes as to diſcover to you the Deformity, the Baſeneſs, and the Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, conſidered as it is in itſelf a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the holy and righteous Law of God; and has he at the ſame Time given you to ſee the Nature, Charms, and Beauty of Holineſs? Do you find your Tho'ts and Apprehenſions, your Inclinations and Diſpoſitions as to thoſe Things changed? Do thoſe Things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſinful, appear odious and hateful to you? And can you ſay that thoſe Sins which you have been in Love with, and have hugg'd them in your Boſom, and have roll'd them as a ſweet Morſel under your Tongue, that now you hate and abhor them, and that you loath yourſelves upon the Account of them? And do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and abandon them, ſaying with <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoſea 14.8.</note> And have you been ſo under the Influence of this holy Spirit, as actually to part with your beloved Sins? Are thoſe Sins which have been as dear as a right Eye, plucked out? and thoſe that have been as near as a right Hand, cut off?</p>
            <p>And as you thus hate Sin, ſo on the other Hand, you muſt inquire what Love there is to Holineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="unknown:005117_0068_1016A8E09279EB60"/>
And here, you muſt enquire upon what Account you love Holineſs; and muſt ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you love it upon God's Account, becauſe it is the Nature of God to be holy, and becauſe he wills Holineſs and delights in Holineſs; and ſurely if the Spirit of God leads you to any Love of Holineſs, it will be upon this Account, that God is holy, and requires it of you. But then you muſt further enquire whether you ſee the real Beauty and Excellency of Holineſs, and whether you eſteem and love it alſo for its own ſake. You muſt examine whether Things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amiable and lovely to you according to the Degree of Holineſs that is in them: Do you love God above all, becauſe he is glorious in Holineſs? Do you eſteem him, and love him, and delight in him for his Holineſs, as you do for his Goodneſs? Is Heaven peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, becauſe it is a holy Place, and the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God's Holineſs and Glory? Nay does the Happineſs of Heaven appear to you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in its Holineſs? Furthermore, do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in <hi>holy</hi> Meditations, in <hi>holy</hi> Company, and in <hi>holy</hi> Converſation? Laſtly, Is it the great Deſire of your Soul to be made <hi>holy,</hi> and do you earneſtly endeavour to lead an holy Life, and are you in the Way of Watchfulneſs and Prayer, and in the diligent Uſe of Means, <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your ſelves from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:005117_0068_1016A8E09279EB60"/>
Now unleſs you can, upon a critical and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Examination of your ſelves, find that it is thus with you in ſome good Meaſure, you have no Reaſon to conclude that you are led by ſuch an <hi>holy</hi> Spirit, and have not this Mark of being the Children of God, nor any Ground to hope for the Inheritance of Children whilſt in ſuch a State; for <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 12.14.</note> Whereas, if the holy Spirit has but ſo much the leading and governing of us, as to renew and ſanctify us; and if we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled clearly and certainly to ſee this, we may depend upon it that we are the Children of God, and ſhall partake of the Inheritance of all ſuch. <hi>Ye have your Fruit unto Holineſs, and the End e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 6.22.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This Spirit is a Spirit of</hi> GRACE <hi>and</hi> SUPPLICATION, <hi>conſequently ſuch as are led by this Spirit will be put upon the great Duty of Prayer, and will take Delight in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God promiſed by the Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> 12.10. that he would pour out upon the Houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem, the Spirit of Grace and Supplication.</hi> And now the holy Spirit of God is ſuch a Spirit; for it is worthy our Obſervation, that whenever the holy Ghoſt is called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> as he is in many Places of Scripture, <note n="‡" place="bottom">John 14.16. and 26.16, 17.</note> he may as well
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:005117_0069_1016675716CC6530"/>be called the <hi>Advocate</hi> or <hi>Paraclete,</hi> as the Word is, even one that eſpouſes and undertakes our Cauſe, that pleads with us and for us, and puts us upon pleading for ourſelves.</p>
            <p>As for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is our <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> with the Father; If any Man ſin we have an <hi>Advocate,</hi> or <hi>Paraclete,</hi> with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John 2.1.</note>The ſame Word is uſed as when the holy Ghoſt is called the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
               </note> So that every true Child of God has not only an Advocate in heaven with the Father, but has an Advocate, or Paraclete, with, or within himſelf, even the holy Ghoſt, which God the Father (thro' the Merits and Interceſſion of his Son) has ſent to perform the Office of an Advocate, to plead and ſtrive with us, to ſtir up Convictions in our Souls, of our Sin and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and to perſwade and enable us to an hearty Acceptance of Jeſus Chriſt, and of Salvation by him: And to put us upon deſiring, ſeeking, and praying to God for our ſelves and others, for all needed Mercy and Grace.</p>
            <p>So that one great Office of the holy Ghoſt is, to plead with Men, and to put them upon pleading with God for themſelves and others, and to aſſiſt them in the great Duty of Prayer, ſtirring up ſincere Deſires and devout Affections, and enabling us to pour out our Souls to God in Prayer; and this we are taught in the 26th
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:005117_0069_1016675716CC6530"/>Verſe of the Context, where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities: For we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with Groanings that cannot be uttered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now from hence we may certainly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that whenever a Man is led by the Spirit of God, ſo as to be a Mark that he is a Child of God, he will be put upon the Exerciſe of Prayer, he will ſee the Reaſonableneſs, the Agreeableneſs, the Uſefulneſs, and the Neceſſity of Prayer, and will be led not only into the diligent and conſtant Practice of Prayer, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always with all Prayer and Supplication, and continuing therein; but this Spirit will excite an Earneſtneſs and Fervency of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will cauſe a Pleaſure in drawing near to God in this holy Duty.</p>
            <p>For how can it be ſuppoſed that this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clete,</hi> this <hi>Advocate,</hi> ſhould have the leading and governing of any Perſons without putting them upon being Advocates and Interceſſors with God for themſelves and others?</p>
            <p>Now then, if any of you would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt ſee whether he has led and brought you to your Prayers, to frequent, conſtant, humble, fervent Prayer. Do you ſee your abſolute Dependance upon God for every Thing? Do you ſee the Reaſonableneſs of Prayer? Do you ſee the great Priviledge of Prayer, and the infinite Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:005117_0070_1016A8E5275DE568"/>and Grace of God, that he permits and allows us to draw near to him, and that we may come with Boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, to obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in Time of Need? And do you thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improve this Priviledge, this Liberty of Acceſs, ſo as in every Thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thankſgiving to make known your Requeſts to God?</p>
            <p>And do you come humbly before God, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your Wants, and at the ſame Time ſenſible of your Unworthineſs of the leaſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</p>
            <p>Moreover, If you would judge whether you are led by the Spirit of Prayer, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether you content yourſelves with a dull, lifeleſs Form of Prayer Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or whether there be ſome hearty Deſires, and whether your Soul is poured out in Prayer, which is indeed what God looks upon as Prayer?</p>
            <p>Enquire here further ſtill, and ſee whether you love Prayer, whether you delight in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to God, and take Pleaſure in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Caſes before God, and pleading with him for Mercy and Grace. Are you thankful for this Liberty of Acceſs to God, and do you go to him with your Prayers and your Praiſes as your Delight and Pleaſure, rather than as your Taſk and Burden? And enquire particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly here, whether it is ſufficient for you that you have Leave and Liberty to go to God by
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:005117_0070_1016A8E5275DE568"/>Prayer in your Cloſets and in your Families, without inſiſting upon a direct and poſitive Command for it? For he that has the true Spirit of Prayer wants nothing but Liberty to go to God with all his Wants, and to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſuch as caſt off Fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Prayer before God, or take no Pleaſure in Prayer, and are rather glad of an Excuſe to omit the Duty, rather than of an Opportunity to renew their Addreſſes to God, how dwelleth the Spirit of Prayer in ſuch a Man? After the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was converted it is ſaid, <hi>Behold he prayeth</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 9.11.</note> And therefore ſuch as don't give themſelves unto Prayer, and take no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that Duty; it is a ſad Sign that they are not the Children of God. A prayerleſs Perſon is doubtleſs a graceleſs one.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This Spirit by which the Sons of God are led is</hi> A SPIRIT OF ADOPTION, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently every one that it led by this Spirit, has a child-like Temper and Diſpoſition of Soul towards God wrought in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we read in the Verſe immediately following my Text. But ye have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Spirit of Bondage again to Fear, but the <hi>Spirit of</hi> ADOPTION, whereby we cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:005117_0071_1016A8E7E20F15F0"/>
Now he is called the Spirit of Adoption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he works in us the Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Children towards our heavenly Father; enabling us to call him Father, and putting us upon going to him with the Reverence and Confidence of Children to a Father, able and ready to help us; for ſo ſays the Apoſtle, Gal. 4.6, 7. <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but a Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then if you would know whether you are led by this Spirit, you muſt examine and ſee, whether there be any of this child-like Temper wrought in you. Do you look upon God as your Friend and Father? And can you find any Thing of the Honour, the Fear, the Love, the Reverence for him that is infinitely due to ſuch a Father? Do you go to him with the Freedom, with the Delight, and with the Confidence of Children to a Father? Do you depend upon him for your daily Bread, both for your Souls and Bodies, as Children do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Parents? Are you concerned for the Honour of your heavenly Father, as loving, dutiful Children are for the Honour of their earthly Parents? Does it grieve you to ſee him diſhonoured and offended, and his Name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and blaſphemed; and do you inwardly reſent it, as much as a dutiful Child would when he ſhould hear his Father ſlandered and
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:005117_0071_1016A8E7E20F15F0"/>abuſed? Do you look upon his Intereſt and Honour your own, as a Child does that of his Father?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Do you find any Thing of a dutiful and ſubmiſſive Temper towards your heavenly Father? Can you with Sincerity and from your Heart ſay what our Lord has taught you to pray, <hi>Our Father, thy Will be done on Earth as it is done in Heaven?</hi> Have you ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him as ſtanding in the Relation of a Father, as puts you upon keeping all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and can you ſay that none of his Commands are grievous to you, but that you delight to do his Will? And do you as quietly ſubmit to his wiſe and fatherly Corrections? And can you ſay in any Meaſure with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at the Approach of Trouble and Sorrow, <hi>Father, not as I will; but as thou wilt</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark 14.36.</note>.</p>
            <p>Again, Do you truſt in, and can you ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon your heavenly Father's Wiſdom and Care and covenant Love and Faithfulneſs, as to reſt ſatisfied with all his Diſpenſations, and do you actually find the happy Fruit of all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with you? Do they work for your Good, your ſpiritual Good, as they do to all them that love God?</p>
            <p>Finally, Do you ſee any Likeneſs or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of your heavenly Father in you, as
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005117_0072_1016A8EBD3898E70"/>there is commonly between earthly Parents and their Children? Do you find any Likeneſs to God in the moral Perfections of his Nature? Is the Image of God which was loſt by the Fall of our firſt Parents, in any Meaſure reſtored? Have you learned to be righteous as God is righteous, to be <hi>holy as God is holy,</hi> to be <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful as God is merciful,</hi> and <hi>perfect as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is perfect?</hi> Now if it be thus with you, it will be certain that God has indeed ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The Spirit of God is a powerful and active Spirit, and productive of all good Fruits; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently when any are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> THERE WILL BE THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>But I have no Time to enter upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſideration of theſe, at preſent, but ſhall leave them to be conſidered hereafter, when God ſhall give the Opportunity.</p>
            <p>And all I ſhall add at preſent is my Advice, that when you go home you would examine your ſelves cloſely and critically, by theſe Marks, to ſee whether you have been and are thus led, guided and governed by this bleſſed Spirit. Put the ſeveral Queſtions as you can remember them, cloſe to your own Hearts, and ſee what Anſwer you can make to them. And here you had need to be very careful that you don't give falſe and flattering Anſwers to your ſelves,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005117_0072_1016A8EBD3898E70"/>and ſo deceive your own Souls. By what you have already heard you find, that there is a great deal contained in being led by the Spirit of God; and there is a great deal more to be ſaid yet. It is not ſuch an eaſy Thing to judge whether we are led by the Spirit of God, as ſome think for. Becauſe altho' in ſome Things they may ſeem to be led by the Spirit of God, but in others there are ſad Demonſtrations yet that they are not. Now you muſt by no Means ſit down ſatisfied in ſuch a State as this. You muſt never think you are led truly to God, unleſs you are led to Chriſt, and to God thro' Chriſt; and you muſt never think you are led to Chriſt, unleſs you are led in the Way of Truth as revealed in the Word of God, and unleſs you are led to Holineſs of Heart, and Holineſs of Life, and unleſs you are brought into a truly prayerful and thankful Frame of Soul, and have the true Spirit of Adoption, whereby you can with Faith and Affection call God Father, and go to him as Children to a Father, and beſides all this unleſs there be the Fruits of the Spirit in all ſocial Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues relating to our fellow Creatures, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with ſafety determine that you are the Children of God: And this teaches us not to be haſty and ſudden in drawing up Concluſions in our own Favour. The Leadings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comprehend a great deal in them. And there requires a large and comprehenſive View
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:005117_0073_1016A8EF2A803FC0"/>of our ſelves, to judge rightly of our State. Well then, be much in the Examination and Obſervation of your ſelves, as ever you would find out what Spirit you are of, or what Spirit has the Leading and Government of you. And even in this Examination and Trial of your ſelves, you need this bleſſed Spirit to lead and guide you. And for want of this Spirit of Truth to guide them, many have been ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally deluded that they have thought they have been in an extraordinary Manner led by the Spirit of God, when they have been actually ruled by the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobedience.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Spirit of God is an almighty Spirit, and wherever he comes to Purpoſe, he produces moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and happy Effects. He gives a univerſal Change to Men's Tempers and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and gives them a new Turn of Tho't, of Diſpoſition, and Conduct, both towards GOD, their Neighbour, and themſelves.</p>
            <p>And there will be not only ſome, but all the Fruits of the Spirit bro't forth by them; altho' ſome will be more manifeſt and conſpicuous than others. Now all chriſtian Vertues and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005117_0074_1016A8F26CC0ECA8"/>Graces are truly the Fruits of the Spirit; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they relate to God or Man, becauſe they are all produced by the Agency and Influence of the bleſſed Spirit. Now we read, Eph. 5.9. That the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit is in all Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Truth.</hi> But we have a larger Catalogue of theſe bleſſed Fruits of the Spirit, in Gal. 5.22.23. Where we are told, that the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance.</hi> Now ſome of theſe Fruits of the Spirit here reckon'd up, conſidered in the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt comprehenſive Senſe, will take in many Duties to God, as well as to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And it is moſt certain, that the Spirit of God produces all thoſe gracious Habits in the Soul towards God, as well as thoſe towards one another. And they are as truly and properly the Fruits of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But as thoſe Tokens and Marks of our being led by the Spirit of God, which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former Diſcourſe, had a more immediate Reference to God and Chriſt; ſo I ſhall conſider thoſe Fruits of the Spirit here reckoned up by the Apoſtle, more eſpecially with Reſpect to ourſelves, and one another.</p>
            <p>And theſe Fruits of the Spirit are as certain Tokens of our being led by the Spirit of God as the other, and where theſe ſocial Graces and Vertues are wanting, it is as certain a Sign that we are without the Spirit of God, as when
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:005117_0074_1016A8F26CC0ECA8"/>thoſe Graces are wanting, that do more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately refer to God himſelf. And indeed we may lay this down as a Rule, that if we have not theſe Graces that relate to Men, we may be ſure that we have none of thoſe which relate to God. The firſt and great Commandment is indeed to <hi>love the Lord our God with all our Heart, and with all our Soul,</hi> &amp;c. but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which is like unto it, is to <hi>love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelves; and on theſe two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 22.37,—40.</note> And God has ſo joined theſe two Commandments together, that no Man may put them aſunder. <hi>This is the Commandment we have from him, that he who loveth God, love his Brother alſo.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John 4.21.</note> And therefore ſuch only deceive themſelves, who think they love God, and yet dont love their Brother, and are not ready with their Acts of Love and Kindneſs towards him. <hi>If a Man ſay I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar; for he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here then I will diſtinctly conſider thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fruits of the Spirit, which the Apoſtle reckons up, as Marks and Signs that we muſt find in us, before we may upon good Grounds conclude that we are led by the Spirit of God,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005117_0075_1016A8F661606B18"/>ſo as to demonſtrate that we are the Children of God. And I ſhall take them in Order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Fruit of the Spirit here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is LOVE. So whenever any are led by the Spirit of God, there will be not only a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Love to God; <hi>but a ſincere, undiſſembled, true Love to one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fruit of the Spirit is <hi>Love:</hi> And here I ſhall not ſpeak of the Love of God, and the Love of Chriſt, (which are indeed Fruits of the Spirit) becauſe I have ſpoken to theſe in the foregoing Diſcourſe: But more eſpecially of the Love of our Neighbour. This Spirit of God is a Spirit of Love, as well as of Truth, and he begets Love in every Soul wherever he comes to any ſaving Purpoſe. This Spirit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues, and in a great Meaſure removes that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Hatred, and Malice which is natural to us ſince the Fall, and excites a ſincere and fervent Charity, a free generous Love towards all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, enabling ſuch as are under the gracious powerful Influences hereof, to love their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as themſelves. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of himſelf and others, ſays, That <hi>in Times paſt, they lived in Malice and Envy, were hateful, and hating one another.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Titus 3.3.</note> But now wherever the Spirit of God comes, ſo as to lead and govern the Soul, he ſubdues thoſe wicked and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005117_0075_1016A8F661606B18"/>Luſts: For ſo the Apoſtle goes on, <hi>But</hi> after that the Kindneſs and Love of God our Saviour towards Men appeared, not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Mercy <hi>he ſaved us, by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that whenever Perſons are regenerated, or renewed by the holy Ghoſt, their Malice and Hatred will be ſubdued, and a univerſal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and Good-Will ariſe in their Souls. You may remember I told you in the laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> would certainly lead us <hi>to God,</hi> not only to the Love of him, but a Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, and conſequently muſt needs beget brotherly Love in the Soul. <hi>Beloved, let us love one another, for Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for</hi> GOD IS LOVE. <note n="†" place="bottom">1 John 4.7, 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be <hi>this bleſſed Fruit of the Spirit</hi> in you, even a <hi>true and undiſſembled Love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> Have you ſeen that there is in you natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, Malice and Hatred to your Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? And do you find that it is in any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſubdued and removed? Can you ſay that you heartily wiſh well to the whole humane Race? And do you with Sincerity pray for them, and from your Heart deſire their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:005117_0076_1016A8F7E7D2F628"/>and Happineſs? Or when you pray for them, are you very indifferent about the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and unconcerned how it fares with them? Now this it is to be feared is the Caſe of many, they pray for all Men, but alas, they are only Words of Form, without any real Deſire about the Matter.</p>
            <p>But then as Love to all Mankind is a Fruit of the the Spirit, ſo a ſpecial and peculiar Love to the Children of God, and the Houſhold of Faith, is wro't in the Soul by this Spirit; for the Spirit of God will lead every one that is under his Influence, to love the Children of God in an eſpecial Manner.</p>
            <p>Here then you ſhould examine your ſelves, whether you find a ſpecial and peculiar Love going forth towards all that you apprehend to be the true Children of God: If you have had no Acquaintance with them, and received no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from them, nay if you have never ſeen them; yet does the Repute of their being the Children of God, and Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, draw forth your Heart in Eſteem of them, and Love to them? And can you ſay that you love ſuch better than you do your Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, and ſuch as are very kind and generous to you, whom you have Reaſon to fear are not the Children of God? But here you muſt enquire what you love thoſe for, above others. Can you find that your ſpecial and peculiar Love to them is, becauſe they love God, and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:005117_0076_1016A8F7E7D2F628"/>becauſe they are the Friends of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and becauſe they appear with the Image and Likeneſs of God upon them? Now if theſe Things be the real Incentives of your Love, it is a Sign that you are quickned and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the divine Spirit. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 John 3.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But then again, where this Spirit of Love rules and reigns, he will lead us not only to love the Friends of God, and to love our own Friends and Benefactors; but he will put us alſo upon <hi>loving our very Enemies.</hi> You muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Chriſt who manifeſted infinite Love to your very Enemies. <hi>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">I John 4.10.</note> And <hi>thus God commended his Love towards us, in that while we were yet</hi> SINNERS, <hi>Chriſt died for us</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 5.8.</note>. In this Caſe then, which is indeed a trying Point, let us carefully examine our ſelves. Are you brought to this, to lay aſide all malicious Tho'ts, all revengeful Deſires, towards thoſe that have injured or abuſed you, in your Name, in your Eſtate, or in your Family? And inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are you ready to reward Good for Evil? Can you, and do you, from your Hearts <hi>bleſs
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:005117_0077_1016A8F983F20A50"/>them that curſe you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you?</hi> I aſk you whether you do theſe Things from <hi>your Hearts.</hi> For if ye from <hi>your Hearts</hi> forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgive you <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. 6.14. and Chap. 18. Verſe 35.</note>. It is to be feared that many who ſay they forgive their offending Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet have their Hearts full of Malice and Revenge, and their Mouths full of Curſes and Ill-Wiſhes againſt him, and in ſome ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand Way, doing many a Miſchief to him. But now if we are led by the Spirit of God and Chriſt, and there is the true genuine Fruit of this Spirit, we ſhall from our Hearts forgive them, and from our Hearts pray God to forgive them, and ſhall be ready, as Opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, to do good unto them. And this will be to ſhow our ſelves to be <hi>the Children of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven, who cauſeth his Sun to ſhine on the Evil and on the Good; and ſendeth Rain on the Juſt, and on the Unjuſt</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Matth. 5.45.</note>. And who daily loadeth us with Mercies, even while we are loading him with our Iniquities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Another Fruit of the Spirit here mentioned is</hi> JOY.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="unknown:005117_0077_1016A8F983F20A50"/>
And now, altho' <hi>Joy in the Lord,</hi> is the Fruit of the Spirit, and what we ſhould particularly examine our ſelves about, to ſee whether we do really joy in the Lord, and rejoice greatly in the God of our Salvation, whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in Chriſt Jeſus, and at the Advancement of his Cauſe and Intereſt, and whether the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation upon God, and Chriſt, and ſpiritual Things be ſweet unto us, and whether there be a greater Delight in God's Service, and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Communion with him than in any worldly Service, or carnal Enjoyment whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and whether we find the Joy of the Lord to be our Strength; I ſay, altho' we ſhould examine our ſelves in theſe Things; yet I would conſider this <hi>Joy</hi> with Reſpect <hi>to our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creatures</hi> in a particular Manner, even our rejoicing heartily at the Good and Welfare of others, and our doing with Delight and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure what will promote their Happineſs and Comfort. This <hi>Joy</hi> is a Branch of that grand comprehenſive Command of <hi>loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelves,</hi> and flows from ſuch a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love reigning in the Soul. So that where there is that <hi>Joy</hi> which is the Fruit of the Spirit, there will be not only an external, but an inward hearty Rejoicing at the Good of others, at their ſpiritual Good in an eſpecial Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:005117_0078_1016A8FDE761FC48"/>
This Joy which is the Fruit of the Spirit is the direct Contrary to that Envying and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the Good of our Neighbours, which is ſo natural to us in our corrupt Eſtate. It is that Part of Charity which <hi>rejoiceth not in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but rejoiceth in the Truth.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover this <hi>Joy</hi> intends our doing Acts of Kindneſs with <hi>Joyfulneſs,</hi> that if we give to the Relief of any, we do it chearfully, and not grudgingly or of Neceſſity, remembring that God gives freely, and loves the chearful Giver. It intends that we do ſo truly and heartily love Mankind, that it is a Joy and Pleaſure to us to be doing that which will afford Comfort and Joy to others.</p>
            <p>And now this Joy which is the Fruit of the Spirit, is not confin'd to particular Friends and Neighbours, and dear Relations, but it muſt reach to all that we are concerned with, and that come within the Reach of our Kindneſs; even altho' they have injured and abuſed us.</p>
            <p>So then, would you know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Fruit of the Spirit. Do you find any Thing of an habitual Joy at the Good of others?
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:005117_0078_1016A8FDE761FC48"/>Do you find any Thing of a ſecret but real Pleaſure at the Proſperity of others? Or do you rather find a Spirit which luſteth to Envy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you? Can you rejoice with them that rejoice, even altho' you yourſelves are in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Can you be truly thankful for other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Mercies as well as for your own? And can you be thankful for Mercies which they receive when you are denied thoſe particular Mercies your ſelves? Are you thankful that your Neighbour is in Health, altho' you are in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Are you pleaſed with every Thing good and excellent which you ſee in others? Can you rejoice in the Gifts and Graces of others, even when they excel you, and bear away a great Share of Honour and Eſteem from you? And do you rejoice at the Repentance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Sinner in any Meaſure as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do in Heaven; and when they bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance, and abound in the Fruits of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, is this the Rejoicing of your Heart? And do you delight in doing Good to others, both to their Souls and to their Bodies? When you give, do you give with open Hand and Heart? And when you do Acts of Kindneſs, do you do them not only as a Duty you muſt do, but as a reaſonable and pleaſant Duty, and what you delight to do? This would be the genuine Fruit of the Spirit.</p>

3. <hi>Another Fruit of the Spirit is</hi> PEACE.</p>
            <p>And if we ſhould conſider this, with Reſpect to <hi>Peace</hi> with God thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>Peace</hi> with Conſcience, and undoubtedly it is the Fruit of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But I will conſider it at preſent only as <hi>Peace</hi> among Men. And therefore ſuch as are led by this Spirit, will be led into a peaceable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Behaviour.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God, wherever it leads and governs, will ſuppreſs a contentious and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome Spirit: For it will ſubdue Pride, and <hi>thoſe other</hi> Luſts <hi>from whence come Wars and Fightings,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">James 4.1.</note> and leſſer Contentions. And it puts Men upon <hi>ſtudying the Things that make for Peace;</hi> yea and upon <hi>following Peace with all Men,</hi> as well as <hi>Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. 12.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So then, would you know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt ſee whether there be a peaceable Spirit within you, leading and governing you in all your Concerns one with another. Do you dread Contentions and Diviſions? Do you carefully watch againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing that ſtirs up Strife? Are you careful to avoid thoſe Things that are provoking to others? And are you ready to paſs by Affronts
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:005117_0079_1016A900B8199E38"/>and Provocations which are offered to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rather than proſecute them into a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel? Do you watch and guard againſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Strife, do you as the wiſe Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes unto, <hi>leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. 17.14.</note> And when any unhappy Differences are begun, are you deſirous to put a ſpeedy iſſue to them? Are you ready to accommodate Differences that you have fallen into? And is there a yielding, condeſcending, complying Temper in you, ready to forgive Injuries, and ready to acknowledge your Faults, and aſk For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs wherein you have offended and injured others?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, with Reſpect to others that are in Contention, are you <hi>Peace-Makers</hi> among them, ſuch as our Saviour pronounced <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and whom he ſays <hi>ſhall be called the Children of God?</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. 5.9.</note> Are you <hi>Counſellors of Peace?</hi> And are you careful to do what in you lies to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh every Fire of Contention ſo ſoon as you perceive it begins to burn? And are you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid every Thing that has a Tendency to break the Peace of others, or that will carry on a Contention when begun among them? And here in particular, are you careful to avoid all <hi>Tale-bearing</hi> in ſuch Caſes, remembring what the wiſe Man ſays, <hi>Where no Wood is the
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:005117_0080_1016A903E010F430"/>Fire goeth out; ſo where there is no</hi> TALE-BEARER <hi>the Strife ceaſeth. The Words of a</hi> TALE-BEARER <hi>are as Wounds, and they go down into the innermoſt Parts of the Belly</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 26.20, 22.</note>. Now this is a good Rule among others to judge whether we have the Spirit of God to lead and govern us, for God is a God of Love and Peace: And Chriſt is the Prince of Peace, and came on purpoſe to make Peace thro' the Blood of his Croſs: And therefore when Men are liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious &amp; quarrelſome, &amp; live in Contentions, they may juſtly fear whether they are led by the Spirit of God. And would to God that Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Neighbours who live at Variance, and in Contention and Strife all their Days, would ſeriouſly conſider of this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Another Fruit of the Spirit is</hi> LONG-SUFFERING.</p>
            <p>By which we may underſtand a reſtraining our Anger under Provocations; our bearing patiently any Injuries and Affronts that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto us, inſtead of haſtily proceeding to reſent or revenge them. Now Patience, or Long-ſuffering, is a Perfection of God, for ſo his Name is proclaimed, <hi>The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious,</hi> LONG-SUFFER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING <note n="‡" place="bottom">Exodus 34.6.</note>. And ſo it muſt needs be a Perfection
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:005117_0080_1016A903E010F430"/>in the Spirit of God, what belongs to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which he will work in every one that is brought under his divine Guidance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. He will ſo work upon, and in, all whom he leads that they ſhall be <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>patient in Spirit:</hi> They ſhall bear Injuries and Affronts, ſo as to <hi>defer their Anger,</hi> and not break out into raſh Wiſhes or revengeful Actions.</p>
            <p>Indeed it muſt be allowed that there is a great Difference in Men's natural Tempers, even among thoſe that we look upon to be the Children of God: Some Men are naturally much more haſty in Spirit than others, and it is with much more Difficulty that they reſtrain their Anger, than ſome others. Their Spirits are naturally ſo volatile, and ſo eaſily put into Agitation, that they break forth oftentimes into angry Actions or Expreſſions, even before the Man has Time to think of it, ſo as to reſtrain his Paſſion: But yet if Men ſubject to ſuch ſudden and violent Paſſions are under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and reſtraining Influences of the divine Spirit, they will have their Paſſions under better Command, ſo as to keep in from ſuch ſudden, violent Out-breakings of raſh Anger, which others that are under no Reſtraint do fall into. Whenever the holy Spirit comes to purpoſe he ſanctifies Men's particular Tempers, and even their angry Paſſions, making uſe of them to
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005117_0081_1016A906B8C0B3A8"/>very good Purpoſes, turning them into a flaming Zeal for the Cauſe of God, and the Intereſt of Religion, as he did the warm Temper of <hi>Elijah.</hi> So he cauſes the haſty Spirit and angry Paſſions of Men to praiſe him, and the Remainder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he will reſtrain.</p>
            <p>So then if you would judge whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt ſee what Government you have of your ſelves, and of your Spirits. If you would know whether the Spirit of God rules in your Hearts, you muſt know whether he has given you the Rule of your own Spirit, which is a glorious Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>he that ruleth his own Spirit is greater than he that taketh a City</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 16.32.</note>. Here then let me aſk you, Are you enabled in any Meaſure to keep under your Paſſions? Do you avoid raſh Anger, and the being angry without a Cauſe? Have you learned to bear Provocations patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo as not to have your Spirits ruffled, nor your Paſſions breaking out in an indecent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Manner? Have you learnt of your bleſſed Lord to endure the Contradiction of Sinners? Can you bear their Reproaches and their Inſults, and do you imitate that perfect Pattern, who <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2.23.</note>? And can you ſay with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:005117_0081_1016A906B8C0B3A8"/>being reviled, we bleſs: Being perſecuted, we ſuffer it: Being defamed, we entreat <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 4.12, 13.</note>?</hi> Can it be ſaid of you, that you are ſlow to Wrath, and that inſtead of repelling Anger with Anger, you endeavour <hi>with ſoft Anſwers to turn away Wrath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word here, Are you jealous over your Spirits, and watchful over them, and whenever you find your Paſſions to riſe, do you with all your Might endeavour to ſuppreſs them? Do you at ſuch a Time keep your Tongue as with a Bridle, that you might not offend therewith?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Do you find that you gain upon your Paſſions, and that you get more and more the Maſtery of them? Are they leſs tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, and not ſo unruly as they have been? For wherever the Spirit of God comes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, the Soul is reſtored, the uſurping Paſſions are turned off the Throne, and Reaſon and Conſcience reſtored to their Dominion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And therefore ſuch Men as give Way to an angry Spirit, and ſuffer themſelves to be carried away with their Paſſions, and are continually in a Ruffle of Mind, venting their Wrath upon one and another, whether they have any juſt Provocation or no; <hi>how dwelleth the Love of God, and the Spirit of God in ſuch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:005117_0082_1016A90AD299A090"/>
5. <hi>Another Fruit of the Spirit here mentioned by the Apoſtle, is</hi> GENTLENESS.</p>
            <p>Now by <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> we may underſtand that Sweetneſs and Kindneſs of Temper, by which we are diſpoſed to deal gently and kindly with all that we have any Concern with, and a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to accommodate our ſelves to each other (ſo far as we may) and to make Things eaſy and comfortable for others, as well as to be eaſy and quiet our ſelves.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> may be conſidered as oppoſite to every Thing that is rigorous and ſevere, unmerciful or cruel; yea, and oppoſite to a ſtiff, perverſe, and obſtinate Temper.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> which is the Fruit of the Spirit, is a ſweet, ſoft, pleaſant, obliging Temper, ſanctified by the Spirit, whereby the Man has an inward Inclination, and a gracious Propenſion to treat every Man in a gentle, kind, and tender Manner.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> contains in it a Diſpoſition to think favourably of others, and to put as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and as charitable Conſtructions upon their Sayings &amp; Doings as they will poſſibly bear; and alſo a Diſpoſition to ſpeak to and of Perſons in a kind and gentle Manner, avoiding every Thing in Converſation that is harſh, that is rude, that is moroſe or uncivil.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> don't conſiſt in ſoothing and flattering Perſons, commending them beyond
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:005117_0082_1016A90AD299A090"/>their Deſerts; nor does it hinder from admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring faithful and ſharp Reproofs where they are needed. But yet the Gentle-Man will treat every Man with due Reſpect, and will be ſo friendly, ſo yielding, and condeſcending, ſo obliging, and ready to do a Kindneſs, as ſoftens and wins the Hearts of others.</p>
            <p>And now this <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> the Fruit of the Spirit, flows from a holy Generoſity of Soul, full of Love, and Good-Will to Men, and full of Gratitude to God.</p>
            <p>Now then if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt inquire whether you have ſuch a kind, gentle and good Spirit within you. Do you lay aſide or check every Thing that is moroſe, churliſh, croſs and fretful in your Tempers? Do you endeavour to make your ſelves eaſy and comfortable to all that you are concerned with, whether in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or publick Stations, whether at Home or Abroad? Are you as becometh the Servants of the Lord, <hi>gentle</hi> in your Carriage towards all, inſtead of ſtriving with any? Have you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any of that Wiſdom from above, that is <hi>pure, peaceable,</hi> GENTLE, <hi>and eaſy to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and full of Mercy <note n="*" place="bottom">James 3.17.</note>?</hi> Do you find your ſelves <hi>kindly affectionate one to another in
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005117_0083_1016A90C580C9DC0"/>brotherly Love?</hi> Do you delight in pleaſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rather than to be thwarting and vexing them, and do you endeavour to pleaſe them in all Things for their Good? And are you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conſider the various Tempers of Men, and are you ready to yield and condeſcend to them, and comply with them, ſo far as may be done with a good Conſcience, and conſiſtent with their real Good? Now if there be ſuch a Sweetneſs, Gentleneſs, and Agreeableneſs of Temper, excited by the Spirit of God, it will not only render you the Delight of humane Kind, but give you a good Token that God delights in you as his Children.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Another Fruit of the Spirit, is</hi> GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS.</p>
            <p>And now if we underſtand this, as diſtinct from the foregoing Fruit of the Spirit, I would conſider it as intending not only the Principle of Love, Kindneſs, and Good-Will to Men, but the <hi>Practice</hi> of it. By this Goodneſs I would underſtand not only our being good, but our <hi>doing good.</hi> It intends not only a Diſpoſition and Deſire, but our actual Care and Endeavour to be as uſeful and as ſerviceable in the World as we can; and to have our Time, our Strength, our Powers, and Faculties, our Eſtate, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and our Influence, all employed after
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:005117_0083_1016A90C580C9DC0"/>ſuch a Manner as may be not only for our own Good, but for the Good and Benefit of others. Where the Spirit of God works this Goodneſs, the Man will deſire and endeavour to do all the Good he can, according to the Capacity that God has given him, and the Station that God has placed him in. I ſay according to his Capacity and Station, becauſe he will be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that if he attempts above his Capacity, and out of his Rank and Station, he will be in Danger of doing more Hurt than <hi>Good.</hi> I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that within his own Sphere he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do all the Good he can. Accordingly ſuch a Man as is endowed with this Spirit of true Goodneſs, will conſider what Abilities God has given him, and will take Heed that he don't boaſt of any falſe Gift, or imagine himſelf fit for what he is not; nor on the other Hand, will he deny any of God's Gifts, or excuſe himſelf from any Service that would be for the Good of others, from a falſe Pretence that he has not Ability for it. But he will think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly of his Abilities and Capacities of doing Good, and will conſider the Station that God in his Providence has placed him in; and ſo what Opportunities he has in his Hand for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and doing Good, and will readily and chearfully embrace the ſame. Is he a civil Ruler, and in any Place of Power and Truſt, if he has this Spirit of Goodneſs, he will rule in the Fear of God, and endeavour according
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:005117_0084_1016A90F3A16F8C0"/>to the Deſign of his Office, to <hi>be the Miniſter of God for Good</hi> to the People. Is he a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel; he will endeavour to do all the Good he can in this Station, and that he may do this Good eſpecially, which is the greateſt of all, even to convert Sinners from the Error of their Ways, and ſave their Souls from Death: Or if he be only in private Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will be content with that, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to do all the Good he can therein, by his Eſtate, by his Counſels, by his Example, and by his Prayers.</p>
            <p>And now if you would know whether you are led by this Spirit of Goodneſs, you muſt enquire whether you are thus inclined to all Acts of Goodneſs, and whether you live in the daily Practice of it, in Conformity to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is not only Good, but does Good. Do you look upon your ſelves as made to do all the Good you can, and that all which you have and are, is given and continued to you to do Good withal? And are you pleaſed with the Thoughts of having ſuch and ſuch Abilities and Opportunities for doing Good? Here let me aſk you, whether your being in any ſuperiour publick Station pleaſes you, <hi>chiefly</hi> upon this Account, namely, that it gives you an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of being more extenſively good to others; or is the Honour of it, and the Opportunity of ſerving your ſelves, that which moſt ſecretly affects you? So again, if God gives Wealth,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:005117_0084_1016A90F3A16F8C0"/>and Plenty of this World's Goods to you, what Thought is it pleaſes you moſt? Is it that now you ſhall have the Name of a rich Man, and that now you have wherewith to gratify your Coveteouſneſs, and inordinate Love of the World, and that you have Plenty wherewith to gratify your Pride, your Luxury, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Or does this pleaſe you moſt, to think that now you are enabled to do Good to others, that now you have wherewith to relieve ſuch as are in Straits, to ſupply the Wants of the Needy, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Goſpel at home, &amp; to ſpread it abroad? This I know is oftentimes the Language of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before they arrive to any plentiful Eſtate. And Oh what fine generous Projections are made by Perſons provided they had but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in their Hands! Now therefore if Perſons would know whether they are ſincere in this, they muſt enquire whether they are now actually doing Good according to their preſent Ability: Do you now actually lay by, as God proſpers you, for pious and charitable Uſes? And are you doing Good according to your Ability as you go along? You that are rich, are you rich in good Works? And are the reſt of you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Ability, ready to diſtribute, and willing to communicate for the publick Good? Let me aſk you, whether you chooſe rather to give to others that are in Wants, than to lay up for a Hoard, or lay out for Superfluities for your ſelves? And are you concerned to deny
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:005117_0085_1016A910E871F930"/>your ſelves ſome Conveniencies, that you might relieve others, under their Neceſſities? And is it more Pleaſure to you to do that whereby others might have neceſſary Food, than to fare ſumptuouſly your ſelves? And had you rather cloath the Naked, than dreſs fine your ſelves?</p>
            <p>Moreover, you would do well to enquire, whether you are careful in your private Stations and Relations to be as good, and to do all the Good you can. If you are Huſbands, or Wives, do you endeavour to be as good as you can in that Relation, whereby you may be meet Helps, mutual Comforts and Bleſſings? If you are Parents, do you endeavour to do all the Good you can to your Children, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for them, by inſtructing them, and bringing them up in the Fear of God, and in the Ways of Religion, whereby they may be capable of doing Good, and of being Bleſſings in their Day? And if you are Maſters or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, do you give unto your Servants that which is juſt and equal, and are you careful to teach and inſtruct them, and to be of all the Benefit to them, both to their Souls and to their Bodies, that is juſtly expected from you? In a Word, are you concerned to be as uſeful and beneficial to others as you can, and that every one might be the better by you, that has any Concern with you? Have you an Eye not meerly at your own Intereſt, but at the Good of others? And is there a publick generous
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:005117_0085_1016A910E871F930"/>Principle that runs thro' all your Actions, and that influences you in them? Theſe, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, would be happy Tokens that you are led by the Spirit of God, who is Goodneſs itſelf, and is good to all, and by the Spirit of Chriſt, who was ſo good as to leave Heaven it ſelf to come upon this Earth, to redeem and ſave ſuch ſinful Worms as we are. <hi>For ye know the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for your Sakes he became poor, that ye through his Poverty might be rich.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 8.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Another Fruit of the Spirit is</hi> FAITH.</p>
            <p>By which is generally underſtood in this Place <hi>Truth, Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity towards Men.</hi> It is our being true and ſincere in our Words and Promiſes, and faithful in every Buſineſs we undertake, and in every Station and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, and to every Truſt repoſed in us. By <hi>Faith</hi> here we muſt underſtand a Perſon's being ſo true to his Word, ſo faithful, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in all his Concerns, as to gain Faith and Credit among others, ſo as to be himſelf belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, truſted to, and depended upon.</p>
            <p>So that wherever this Spirit of God, this Spirit of Truth, works powerfully and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, it will produce this deſireable but rare Fruit among Men. He will make Men true to their Words, ſincere in their Profeſſions,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:005117_0086_1016A9156C31C820"/>and punctual to their Promiſes, honeſt in all their Dealings, and faithful in all their Truſts, diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Duty, and performing every Buſineſs, faithfully, honeſtly, and according to Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Agreement.</p>
            <p>Now then, if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt enquire for this Fruit of the Spirit, this Faith, this Truth, this Honeſty, Uprightneſs and Fidelity.</p>
            <p>Here then let me enquire of you, whether you hate the Way of Lying, and the Way of deceiving others by your Words? Are you careful to ſpeak the Truth one to another, or have you a Tongue that frameth Deceit? Are you careful in relating of Facts, not to exceed the Truth? Do you endeavour to make juſt and true Repreſentations of Things, ſo as to lead Perſons into a juſt and right Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them? Are you more concerned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Stories as you receive them, than to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh them with Additions of your own? Are you more concerned to relate Matters of Fact as they really and truly are, than to ſet them off with ſome aggravating Circumſtances beyond the Truth?</p>
            <p>Again, Are you careful to avoid all Flattery, which is but Deceit and Falſhood, and do you endeavour to deal plainly, faithfully, and truly one with another? And on the other Hand, Are you careful not to defame, not to raiſe nor ſpread falſe Reports againſt any, by which you
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:005117_0086_1016A9156C31C820"/>would not only wrong the Truth, but greatly injure your Neighbour's Credit and Character?</p>
            <p>Again, Are you ſincere in your Profeſſions of Love and Friendſhip, or is your Love more in Word and in Tongue, than in Deed and in Truth?</p>
            <p>But then again, you would do well to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how it is with Reſpect to Promiſes. Are you cautious in making Promiſes; but when you have given your Word and Promiſe are you careful to fulfil it? Do you make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of being as good as your Word, and do you endeavour that your Word may be as good as your Bond?</p>
            <p>Again, let me enquire, whether you are true, faithful and honeſt in your Work as well as in your Words? Whatever Work you undertake, do you endeavour to do it faithfully according to your Skill and Power, ſo that there ſhall be no Deceit in the Work; do you in your ſeveral Occupations ſee to it that every Piece of Workmanſhip that goes out of your Hands be done as it ought to be, that it is not ſlighted over, nor its Defects covered, whereby others are deceived and impoſed upon?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Do you endeavour to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every Relation? Are you according to your Marriage-Covenant, loving and faithful Huſbands, loving, faithful and obedient Wives? Are you faithful Parents, and do you, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Covenant-Promiſes and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:005117_0087_1016A9195DFBA8C0"/>bring up your Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord? And are you faithful Children, paying that Honour, that Love, that Obedience and Subjection to your Parents that is due to them from you? Are you faithful Maſters to your bought or hired Servants, and to your Apprentices, giving them that Inſtruction and Knowledge in Religion, and in the particular Arts or Trades they come to be inſtructed in? And you that are Servants are you faithful to your Maſters, ſerving them not with Eye-Service, as Men-pleaſers, but in Singleneſs of Heart, fearing God? Are you careful not to <hi>purloin,</hi> or wrong your Maſters in any Thing, but by Diligence and Care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Intereſt ſhew all good Fidelity?</p>
            <p>But to go on, if any of you are advanced to Places of Power and Truſt, either in the State or in the Church, are you concerned to be faithful herein? Are you faithful to your King and Country, faithful to the Church &amp; Town, are you faithful to the College, and to every Society you are concerned with and for?</p>
            <p>In a Word, Can you upon a thoro' and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reflection upon your own Conduct in your Places, find your <hi>Conſciences teſtifying for you, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God you have had your Converſation in the World?</hi>

            <p n="8">8. <hi>Another Fruit of the Spirit, is</hi> MEEK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS.</p>
            <p>Now by <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> we may underſtand an humble quiet Spirit, the <hi>meek</hi> Man is he who is in a great Meaſure delivered from the Power of Pride and Paſſion. He is the very Reverſe of the <hi>proud and haughty Scorner,</hi> and of him <hi>who deals in proud Wrath,</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.24. The <hi>meek</hi> Man is he that has a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Senſe of himſelf, of his Sins, of his Infirmities, and Imperfections, and of his conſtant Liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to err, and fall as others do: And he is diſpoſed to think and ſpeak of others, and to behave towards others, with that Humility and Condeſcention, with that Candour and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as becomes him under ſuch a Senſe of himſelf. The <hi>meek</hi> ſpirited Man, is not a Man of a mean little Spirit; tho' he be poor in Spirit, yet he is not poor ſpirited. The <hi>meek</hi> Man is not of a cowardly daſtardly Spirit. But that Meekneſs which is the Fruit of the Spirit, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes an enlarged, a generous, and a truly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Soul. A Soul raiſed up above the little Things which diſturb the Pride and Paſſions of others. The <hi>meek</hi> Man is not blind ſo as not to ſee Faults, nor is he ſtupid ſo as not to be
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:005117_0088_1016A91AE29E7128"/>affacted with them; nor is he ſo weak ſpirited as to be afraid to reſent or reprove a Fault. No, if the meek Man ſees his Brother offend, he will be ready to tell him of his Fault, and be as faithful in adminiſtring a Reproof as any; but then he wont do it in a haughty and imperious Manner, but with a Spirit of Meekneſs, Love, and Tenderneſs: Not in a Way that tends to irritate but to convince his offending Brother, not to upbraid and reproach him for his Falls, and to vent his Pride and Paſſion, as is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Caſe, but in a friendly and yet faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Manner, ſo as to melt and humble, and bring to Repentance, and thereby gain his Brother.</p>
            <p>For this Meekneſs which is ſo great an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtian, don't ſuppoſe that we are without Paſſions, but the right Government of them by Reaſon and Religion, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain all that is proud and haughty, all that is raſh and haſty, either in Heart, Speech or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. And an excellent Spirit this is. This was the diſtinguiſhing Character of the Man <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was MEEK <hi>above all the Men upon the Face of the Earth.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. 12.3.</note> And we are told that <hi>an Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit is in the Sight of God of great Price.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3.4.</note> And many Things are ſpoken in Favour of the <hi>Meek. Bleſſed are the Meek, for they ſhall inherit the

            </p>
            <p>Now then, if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have this bleſſed Fruit of the Spirit. Are you ſo led by the Spirit of Chriſt as that you have <hi>learned of him who was meek and lowly in Heart?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 11.29.</note> Have you ſomething of that Meekneſs and Gentleneſs that was in him? Have you a juſt, that is a mean Opinion of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Do you ſee that you are ignorant and weak, that you are corrupt and wicked, and that you have given great Provocation to God, and that you deſerve the heavieſt Judgments at his Hands; and when his Hand is heavy upon you, are you humble, ſilent, and ſubmiſſive, acknowledging that God puniſhes you far leſs than your Iniquities deſerve? And ſo are you patient in Spirit, rather than proud and fretful in Spirit, under the afflictive Diſpenſations of divine Providence? Moreover, do you ſee ſo much of your own Sinfulneſs and Weakneſs, as to eſteem others better than your ſelves? And are you kindly affectioned one to another, in Honour preferring one another, inſtead of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be preferred above others? And inſtead of haughty Airs, and an imperious Carriage,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:005117_0089_1016A91DCCE27640"/>do you behave with Meekneſs, and Kindneſs, and Condeſcention to your Inferiours and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, as well as with Reſpect and Honour to your Superiours? If you are ever engaged in Controverſies, do you manage with <hi>Meekneſs of Wiſdom,</hi> ſo as to ſhew not only that your own Spirit is calm, but ſo as ſhall alſo tend to ſoften, and calm, and quiet the Spirits of others? And if you receive Injuries, and meet with great Provocations, do you in Patience poſſeſs your Souls, looking upon all you meet with to be no more, nor ſo much as you deſerve? And altho' it ſhould be very unjuſt from Men, can you bear it patiently, conſidering how very juſt it is from God? In a Word, are you meek and lowly in Heart, and are you ſo cloathed with Humility, as that it appears upon all Occaſions, even in Days of Temptation, in Days of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation? And if Pride and Paſſion do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times break out, inſtead of juſtifying yourſelves, and ſaying you <hi>do well to be angry,</hi> and that it is but a juſt Reſentment, are you humble for it, and do you watch and pray againſt it? And are you upon the gaining Hand in this Reſpect? If it be thus with you, it is a good Evidence for you. But here I would ſay, to prevent your being deceived, that they are not the moſt meek and humble Chriſtians that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, or that talk a great deal of their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; nay the humble Soul is oftentimes the leaſt ſenſible of it, and ſees and complains moſt
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:005117_0089_1016A91DCCE27640"/>of his Pride and Paſſion, not but that even here alſo there may be a Deluſion, for Perſons may take a Pride in ſpeaking of their Pride, and in repreſenting themſelves to be exceeding proud and wicked.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>The laſt Fruit of the Spirit here mentioned, is</hi> TEMPERANCE.</p>
            <p>Now by <hi>Temperance</hi> we are to underſtand, the due Regulations and Reſtraints of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſative Appetites and Deſires of any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative Enjoyment whatſoever. The foregoing Fruits of the Spirit, referred more eſpecially to the Government of our Paſſions or Affections; this concerns the Government of our Appetites or ſenſative Deſires more eſpecially, and ſuch as are led by the Spirit of God, the whole Man, the Appetites, as well as the Paſſions, will be governed by him; for when he comes to any Purpoſe, he ſanctifies thro'out, in Spirit, Soul, and Body.</p>
            <p>This Temperance intends the being ſober in the Uſe of any of the good Things that God has given us to enjoy; and that we do not indulge our ſenſative Deſires any farther than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Rules of Sobriety and Chaſtity, as they are laid down for us in the Word of God. It intends, that we conſider the wiſe Deſigns of God in giving thoſe ſenſative Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Deſires to us. The one for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating our Kind, and for preſerving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:005117_0090_1016A920C63E82C0"/>that intimate Love and Union between Huſband and Wife, which is ſo neceſſary for the Comfort and Happineſs of the connubial State. The other Appetites for the Support, Comfort, and Refreſhment of our Natures. But as theſe Appetites ſince the Fall are all of them grown inordinate, and exceeding apt to carry us beyond due Bounds; ſo it is neceſſary for us to have them under ſuch Reſtraints as to anſwer the good Ends propoſed by them. And the keeping our Appetites within theſe Bounds, is what is called <hi>Temperance.</hi> It is a preſerving a Chaſtity in Heart, Speech, and Behaviour: It is a refraining from all Gluttony in Eating, and from all Drinking wherein is Exceſs. And ſuch Regulations and Reſtraints, when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from true chriſtian Principles, are by the Influence of the divine Spirit. And although ſome may be regular on theſe Accounts that have not the Spirit of God; yet there are none that are under the leading governing Influence of the Spirit, but what will be under theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations.</p>
            <p>So then, would you know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you muſt enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Temperance,</hi> which is the Fruit of the Spirit. Are you, as the Word of God requires you to be, ſober, and chaſte, and temperate in all Things? Do you flee Fornication and all Uncleanneſs, and inſtead of having Fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, do you
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:005117_0090_1016A920C63E82C0"/>rather reprove them? Do you carefully avoid all laſcivious and wanton Carriage, and do you lay aſide all Filthineſs and fooliſh Talking and Jeſting, which is not convenient, and do you endeavour to baniſh all carnal Imaginations, and not ſuffer impure Tho'ts to lodge within you? And inſtead of theſe Things, do you exhibit to the World a chaſte Converſation coupled with Fear, both in the married and unmarried State?</p>
            <p>But then again, how do you regulate your other Appetites? Are you watchful againſt all Exceſs in Meat and Drink? If you find a ſtrong Appetite inclining you to eat more than is for your Health, do you watch and guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Exceſs herein, when you are at Feaſts where there is Plenty, Variety, and Dainties, do you conſider diligently what is before you, <hi>and put a Knife to your Throat?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 23.1, 2, 3.</note> And how is it with you as to your drinking ſtrong Drink? Do you reſtrain and govern your Appetites in this Reſpect, ſo as not to be intoxicated with it, and ſo as not to raiſe your Spirits and your Paſſions beyond due Bounds? You muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the Preacher ſays, that <hi>Wine is a Mocker, and ſtrong Drink is raging, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is deceived thereby is not wiſe.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 20.1.</note> But Oh how many are deceived hereby! Not only thoſe that are groſs Drunkards; but many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who altho' they don't drink themſelves
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:005117_0091_1016A9238339E1C8"/>drunk, yet drink to ſuch Exceſs as to hurt their Health, to break their Conſtitution, to weaken their Judgment, to raiſe their Paſſions, to make them contentious and quarrelſome at Home and Abroad: And by tarrying long at their Cups, waſte their Time, ſpend their Money, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh their Families. And now in theſe Ways Men are as truly guilty of a ſinful Exceſs as when they are actually intoxicated with Drink; and whatever ſome ſuch Perſons may think of themſelves, it is a ſad Sign that they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the governing Influences of the bleſſed Spirit. Perſons therefore ſhould carefully examine themſelves in this Matter, and remember that all Eating and Drinking, beyond what is for Nouriſhment and Refreſhment, and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſes the Mind, or indiſpoſes the Body, and unfits for the Service that God calls unto, and that evidently tends to hurt our Healths, is Exceſs. Moreover, there is a high luxurious Way of living, in which Perſons ſinfully gratify their Ambition as well as their Apetites. For altho' ſuch as have a Plenty of this World's Goods may lawfully live in a more ſumptuous Manner than others; yet for Perſons of plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Incomes to live ſo up to the Extent of their Means, as to diſable themſelves from thoſe Acts of Piety and Charity, which are juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from their Incomes, and eſpecially when any live ſo beyond their Means, as to ſpend upon the Eſtates of others, and diſable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:005117_0091_1016A9238339E1C8"/>from paying their juſt Dues, it is a ſinful Exceſs. In this therefore People would do well to examine themſelves; for I apprehend that Perſons living above their Circumſtances is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and contrary to what the Word and Spirit of God teaches, which is to <hi>be content with ſuch Things as we have.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 13.5.</note> Furthermore, you muſt examine whether you keep in due Bounds as to your Diverſions and Recreations, ſo as to ſpend no more of your precious Time in Pleaſure than may ſerve to unbend your Spirits, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your Health, and enable you the more chearfully to go on in your Buſineſs, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Love of Eaſe and Pleaſure ſo grows upon you, as that you fall into an idle, ſlothful, careleſs Way of living, to the Neglect of God, and of yourſelves and Families?</p>
            <p>Now we muſt examine ourſelves in theſe Matters, and know what Government we have over our Appetites: For unleſs theſe be under due Regulations and Reſtraints, we have no Reaſon to think we are led by the Spirit of God. The Fornicator, the Adulterer, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate, and the Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, the Glutton, the Drunkard, the Idle, the Voluptuous, and the Extravagant, can't be tho't to be led by the Spirit of God, and ſo have not this Mark of their being the Children of God. For altho' every ſober, temperate, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:005117_0092_1016A927DA245648"/>diligent Man may not be led by the Spirit of God, but may be induced to ſuch a Carriage from other Motives than thoſe of the Goſpel; yet this we may lay down as a Rule, that no Man is led by the Spirit of God, but what is ſober, and chaſte, and temperate. And conſequently altho' every ſober Man may not conclude himſelf a Child of God; yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who allows himſelf in Luxury and ſinful Exceſſes, may conclude that he is not a Child of God. <hi>Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Drunkards, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6.9, 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have gone thro' the ſeveral Signs and Tokens which I propoſed to give you, of Perſons being ſo led by the Spirit of God, as to demonſtrate that they are the Children of God. And here I have put a great many cloſe Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you, and it will take you ſome Time to anſwer them. And they are not ſo eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered as ſome may imagine; and a raſh ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den anſwering them will be very dangerous and hurtful to you. Put theſe Queſtions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, and cloſely, and impartially to your own Souls, and ſeek for ſuch an Anſwer as is really and truly the Caſe: And don't go to flatter and deceive your ſelves with falſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. I don't doubt but that ſome of you will
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:005117_0092_1016A927DA245648"/>find it difficult to anſwer in ſome Points, and eſpecially as to the <hi>Principle,</hi> the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of your Actions. You had need therefore deal much with your own Hearts, and obſerve them and the Workings of them upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. And Oh that this <hi>divine eternal Spirit</hi> would ſo lead you as to aſſiſt you in the Trial of your ſelves! and that ſuch as are not led and governed by him, that he would convince them of it, give you to ſee the carnal wretched State you are in, and come ſo powerfully upon you as to convert and ſave you. And that ſuch as are truly led by him, that he would ſo ſhine upon his own Work in your Souls as to give you to ſee it, and to reap the Comfort of it; having the bleſſed Spirit witneſſing in that Way with your Spirits that ye are the Children of God.</p>
            <p>All that remains further for the finiſhing the Subject is, ſome Application and Improvement, for altho' moſt that has been ſaid is practical; yet there are ſome uſeful Inferences, and ſome practical Remarks, Counſels, and Exhortations, that may not be unſeaſonable; but I muſt leave them 'till God gives another Opportunity.</p>

            <p>Prop. II. <hi>The ſureſt and the beſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our being the Children of</hi> GOD, <hi>is our being led by the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>For the Illuſtration of which I have ſaid:</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſureſt and cleareſt Mark, and which we may depend upon, is our being led by the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>And as the two laſt Diſcourſes have been taken up in ſhewing when Perſons may be ſaid to be ſo led by the Spirit of God, as to be a ſure and clear Mark of their being the Children of God; I ſhall now proceed to make ſome <hi>practical Remarks</hi> upon what has been ſaid on this Point, by Way of</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>Inf. 1. <hi>What we have heard about being led by the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> GOD, <hi>teaches us, that the Leading of this</hi> SPIRIT <hi>contains more in it than moſt People imagine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men are exceeding apt to have but a partial, and ſo imperfect Notion of the Leadings of the divine Spirit, and of that gracious Principle, which influences and governs every good Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Men don't conſider what a univerſal Principle this is; nor what a univerſal Change it works in Men's Hearts; nor what a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Influence it has upon Men's Lives. If Men were duly ſenſible of this, they would not be ſo
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:005117_0094_1016A92D441A0C80"/>quick in judging themſelves to be the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Children of God, as now they are.</p>
               <p>By what you have heard, you may preſently underſtand, that wherever the Spirit of God comes powerfully and effectually, he ſanctifies thro' out in <hi>Spirit,</hi> in <hi>Soul,</hi> and in <hi>Body.</hi> He inlightens the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> he renews the <hi>Will,</hi> he regulates the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> he corrects the <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,</hi> and the particular <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> is ſanctified: So that the Man is <hi>made a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, old Things are paſſed away, behold all Things are become new.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.17.</note> This bleſſed Spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he leads, he leads the Soul to God, and to Chriſt, and to Holineſs; he leads to the Belief of the holy Scriptures as the only ſure Rule of Faith and Manners, leads to a devout, prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and tho'tful Frame of Soul, and into a child-like Temper and Diſpoſition. Moreover he leads the Soul to bring forth all thoſe ſocial Graces that are the Fruit of the Spirit, ſuch as Love to our Neighbour, Joy in his Proſperity, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, and Temperance. And in ſhort, every Grace and Vertue that relates ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God, our Neighbour, or our ſelves, are wrought in the Soul by the bleſſed Spirit, where he leads and governs. Altho' all thoſe Graces may not be ſo conſpicuous in ſome; yet it muſt be ſaid that there is the Principle, the Root and
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:005117_0094_1016A92D441A0C80"/>Foundation of every Grace laid in every Soul where the Spirit of God comes with Power.</p>
               <p>But now this is not what People are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aware of, they will indeed ſay that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be ſo; but then don't conſider how exceeding broad the divine Commandment is, nor how extenſive that Principle muſt be, that will cauſe them to have Reſpect to all God's Commandments. Perſons ſometimes find themſelves altered as to ſome particular Points, and they are ready to conclude that there is a thoro' and ſaving Converſion to God, when there is really no ſuch Thing. Some Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Terrors, and then ſome ſudden Flaſhes of Joy, and ſome Reſtraints or Refrainings from ſome particular Sins, and the running into the Practice of ſome particular Duties, have been too often miſtaken for the whole of Converſion and Regeneration. And they miſtake becauſe they don't know any better; they have never experienced a thoro' and ſaving Change, and ſo don't know by Experience what it is, nor how extenſive it is; and no Wonder if they miſtake and frame very contracted Notions of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Inf. 2. <hi>Are only ſuch the Children of</hi> GOD <hi>who are led by his</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, hence we may fear that the Number of ſuch are comparatively ſmall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:005117_0095_1016A932922D7910"/>
When we conſider what it is to be led by the Spirit of God, and what a mighty Change is wrought thereby in Men's Hearts, and what a Turn is given to Men's Temper and Behaviour, and when we conſider all the Fruits and Effects of the Bleſſed Spirit, wherever he works power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and effectually, and alas where do we find ſuch Men! Indeed we are not to expect to find any who have attained to ſuch a Degree, as to <hi>be already perfect,</hi> and that have entirely gotten from under the Power of their Luſts, ſo as to have no Out-breakings of Corruption! I ſay we are not to expect to find ſuch: For the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had not, nor had any of the Reſt of the Apoſtles, attained to a ſinleſs Perfection. And therefore if we ſhould look for abſolutely perfect Men, we ſhould find none, <hi>for there is not a juſt Man upon Earth, that doth Good, and ſinneth not.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccl. 7.20.</note> But even as to ſuch as are ſo under the gracious Influence of the bleſſed Spirit as that the Principle of Grace prevails above their Luſts, and Corruptions, which is the Caſe of every true Chriſtian; I ſay, the Number of theſe is but ſmall, compared with thoſe who are under the Power of their Luſts, and ſo in their carnal unregenerate State. For let us but obſerve the general Temper which Men diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and let us obſerve the general Courſe of Men's Lives, and we ſhall have abundant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:005117_0095_1016A932922D7910"/>to fear that the greater Part are led away of their own Luſts, rather than by the Spirit of God. How many are carried away with Pride, how many with Covetouſneſs, or an inordinate Love of the preſent World? And how many with Malice and Hatred, Diſcontent and Envy? Others we ſhall ſee to be Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of God, given up to Rioting and Drunkenneſs, Chambering and Wantonneſs, to Luxury, Idleneſs, and Sloth. And if we take away all ſuch as are apparently &amp; evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the prevailing Power of ſome Luſt or other, and add to them a great, tho' uncertain Number of cloſe Hypocrites, who make a good Appearance, but are really under the Power of their Luſts; and there will be found but a ſmall Number of thoſe that are really and truly under the governing Influence of a divine and gracious Principle. There are great Numbers that are apparently and evidently in their Sins; and many more, who if they have a good Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; yet are rotten at the Heart. And now when all the openly Wicked, and all the refin'd Hypocrites are taken out, we ſhall find but a ſmall Number comparatively left: Oh how few, that love God with all their Heart and with all their Soul. How few that love their Neighbour as themſelves! What little Faith would Chriſt find upon the Earth, if he ſhould now come? And how rare are the true Fruits of the Spirit, even among profeſſing Chriſtians,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:005117_0096_1016A9341A5466F8"/>who pretend to be, and many of them think they are governed by his Spirit! Alas, Do not their Corruptions break out much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than their Graces; nay don't their Corruptions break forth ſo frequently and ſo groſly, as to give Reaſon to fear that there is no true Grace in them? If we judge Men by their Fruits, (and if we judge them at all it muſt be by their Fruits) we ſhall have a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly View of Mankind, and ſhall ſee the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Part of Mankind under the Dominion of their Luſts, and but few comparatively under the gracious Influence of the Spirit. Chriſt called his Flock, <hi>a little Flock.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. 12.32.</note> And we are told that <hi>many are called,</hi> that is with the external Call of the Goſpel, <hi>but few are choſen.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 20.16.</note> Wide is the Gate and broad is the Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat; becauſe ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Inf. 3. <hi>Are the Children of God ſo led by his Spirit, and governed by this gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as has been deſcribed? Hence then, how amiable and truly excellent are the Children of God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:005117_0096_1016A9341A5466F8"/>
For wherever the Spirit of God takes Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, he begets the moſt amiable and excellent Qualities pleaſing to God, lovely in the Eyes of Angels, and of all the Saints, and which indeed beget the Veneration and Eſteem of all; Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which render them happy to themſelves, and comfortable to all that they have any Concern withal.</p>
               <p>When we conſider the Temper that is wro't by the Spirit of God in all his Children, and their Carriage and Behaviour conſequent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, both towards God and towards Man, we may ſay with the Preacher, that the <hi>Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> * Yea that the <hi>Saints</hi> are the <hi>only excellent ones in all the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we behold the Children of Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ruins of the Fall, they appear vile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Creatures indeed, more vile than the Beaſts that periſh: And we can hardly conceive how beautiful and excellent a Creature he was, when he firſt came out of his Creator's Hands, with the Image of God bright upon him.</p>
               <p>But now when the Spirit of God reſtores the divine Image or gracious Principle to the Soul in any Meaſure; then the Beauty and Glory of Man begins again to appear. And Oh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Difference between the Sinner and the Saint!<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 12.26.</note> One that is evidently under the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:005117_0097_1016A93704690740"/>Power of his Luſts, his fleſhly Luſts that make him a Brute, and more vile than the Beaſts; and his ſpiritual Luſts that make him like the Devil himſelf: I ſay the Difference between ſuch a Man, and a Man renewed and ſanctified with the Spirit of God, and under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Influence of a divine and gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple!</p>
               <p>Indeed this Difference at preſent is not ſo conſpicuous as is to be deſired, becauſe of the Sin and Corruption that ſtill remain in God's Children, and too too often break forth in the very beſt of them.</p>
               <p>But now let us conſider the diſtinguiſhing Marks of God's Children, and draw the Picture of a Saint, with only theſe general Characters that I have given as Signs of our being led by the Spirit of God, and are the very Lines which the divine Spirit draws upon every true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and he will appear in a moſt beautiful and amiable Light, he will appear glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
               <p>Thus let us behold the Chriſtian convinced of Sin by the Spirit of God, truly humble and ſorry for all his paſt Sins, and hating every evil and falſe Way, and reforming thoſe Things that are amiſs, and departing even from his own Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Let us view him alſo in his hearty Return to God, from whom he has revolted, and in his cloſe Attachment to him, loving him with all
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:005117_0097_1016A93704690740"/>his Heart and Soul, careful above every Thing to pleaſe him, and fearful of offending him, aiming at his Honour and Glory in all he does, and placing all his Happineſs in the Enjoyment of him; going to him as his Father, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him in all his Ways, ſeeking to him, and truſting in him for all he wants, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Praiſe of all that he receives.</p>
               <p>Again, Let us view him in his Union to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, believing in him with all his Heart, as his only and all-ſufficient Saviour, renouncing all Confidence in himſelf, and in any Righteouſneſs of his own, depending upon being pardoned, aſſiſted, and accepted, only in and thro' this dearly beloved Son of God: And at the ſame Time his Heart ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the higheſt Love to the Lord Jeſus, loving him above Father, and Mother, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Houſes, and Lands; yea and above his very Life, for the infinite Love he has ſhewn to him.</p>
               <p>Let us alſo view the Chriſtian in his earneſt Deſires and Endeavours to be as like to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as poſſible; ſtriving after the ſame Mind, and Spirit, and endeavouring to tread in the ſame Steps.</p>
               <p>Let us view him in his conſtant and devout Attendance upon Chriſt in all his Inſtitutions, ſtrictly obſerving his Directions, and walking in all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Commandments of the Lord blameleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:005117_0098_1016A93905BD44D0"/>
Let us view him acquieſcing in all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of divine Providence, receiving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thankfully, bearing Afflictions patiently, and whatever State and Condition he is in, therewith content.</p>
               <p>Again, Let us view him in his ſincere and undiſſembled Love to Mankind, loving his Neighbour as himſelf, dealing juſtly with all Men, ſpeaking the Truth to his Neighbour, and doing ſuch Acts of Piety and Kindneſs as he has Ability and Opportunity for. Let us view him feeding the Hungry, cloathing the Naked, relieving the Diſtreſſed, inſtructing the Ignorant, ſetting them to rights that are out of the Way, ſympathizing with all according to their Circumſtances, weeping with them that weep, and rejoicing with them that rejoice, and ſtudying the Things that make for Peace, patiently bearing any Injuries and Abuſes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than revenge them, and laying aſide all Malice, and Guile, and Hypocriſies, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings, and Evil-ſpeakings; being reviled he bleſſes, being perſecuted he ſuffers it, being defamed he intreats, and is gentle, and good, and kind, and faithful, and honeſt, and all cloathed and adorned with Meekneſs, Modeſty and Humility.</p>
               <p>But then finally, let us view the Chriſtian or Child of God in his Conduct and Management towards himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:005117_0098_1016A93905BD44D0"/>
Let us view him in the Rule of his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in preſerving the juſt Government of his Paſſions, keeping them within due Bounds and under the Regulation of Reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Let us view him in his juſt Contempt of the World, and of all Things in it; and yet managing all his worldly Affairs with Diligence, with Care, and with Diſcretion. Let us view him in his moderate Uſe of all Things which God has given; in his being ſober, chaſte, and temperate in all Things.</p>
               <p>And now I have recollected a few Hints from the foregoing Diſcourſes, which may go for a rough Draught of a Child of God, and are ſome of the general Lines which are drawn by the Spirit of God, upon the Soul and upon the Life of every gracious Saint.</p>
               <p>And now, my beloved Brethren, what a Beauty, what a Brightneſs is there in every one of theſe Lines? And how amiable, lovely, and beautiful, muſt the Man be that has theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters bright upon him? — Indeed the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs is, that we hardly ever did ſee ſuch an one, where all theſe Lines were ſtrong and clear; for the Caſe with the beſt of Chriſtians among us is this, that altho' ſome of theſe Lines or Characters may be very conſpicuous, yet others are weak and much obſcured. The Sins and Corruptions that ſtill remain do ſo blot and blur and ſtain them, that ſome of them in ſome Chriſtians can hardly be perceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:005117_0099_1016A93D103FE980"/>
But now let us by what we have ſeen in ſome Chriſtians that have been eminent for ſome Graces, imagine a Saint with ALL theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters clear and ſtrong upon him; that is, let us imagine a Man as not only having all theſe Virtues and Graces of the Spirit, but as having them in a ſtrong, lively, and vigorious Exerciſe, and oh how glorious would he appear! Surely he would attract the Love, Delight and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence of God himſelf; for he cannot but delight in theſe moral Virtues and Graces wherever he beholds them. And every Angel in Heaven, as well as every Saint on Earth, muſt needs be in Love with ſuch an one; nay, the very Devils, and wicked Men, would be forced to acknowledge him to be truly excellent and glorious.</p>
               <p>Well then, altho' we may not expect to ſee ſuch a perfect Man in Chriſt Jeſus, as this, nor to attain to it our ſelves, in the preſent State of Imperfection; yet let us aſpire after it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endeavour to come as near to it as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. O let us ſtrive after thoſe divine Vertues, thoſe heavenly Graces which will render us ſo like to God, and ſo lovely in his Eyes, and in the Eyes of Angels and Saints, and which will be ſuch an everlaſting Spring of Peace, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Joy to ourſelves.</p>
               <p>Now therefore ſuffer the Word of EXHOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATION. And the <hi>Exhortation</hi> which ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:005117_0099_1016A93D103FE980"/>to you at this Time is, That you would earneſtly ſeek and ſtrive to obtain <hi>this bleſſed Spirit of God, to lead, and guide you,</hi> to <hi>beget thoſe divine Vertues and Graces in your Souls,</hi> and <hi>draw them forth in a vigorous Exerciſe in your Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſcarce think there is one of you all, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, but that you would be glad to be numbred among the Children of God, and to be ſecured of all the glorious Privileges of ſuch: But then in order to this, you muſt be under the leading governing Influence of the Spirit of God, you muſt have him working powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually upon your Souls, producing this gracious Change, and impreſſing ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Principles, and drawing forth every Grace into Exerciſe. And therefore this is the firſt and the grand Thing to be deſired and ſought after by us; namely to be led by the bleſſed Spirit of God, to be impreſſed with this divine and heavenly Principle. The great Thing we need, and which we ſhould be moſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of is, that the Spirit of God might <hi>move</hi> upon <hi>our Hearts,</hi> with his almighty Energy, as he did upon <hi>the Face of the Waters</hi> at firſt; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that Corruption and Confuſion that is upon them, rectifying the Diſorders that are within, and <hi>reſtoring our Souls;</hi> that is, reſtoring the divine Image, and all thoſe gracious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Habits which were loſt by Sin: Which is the only ſure and certain Sign of our being the Children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:005117_0100_1016A93FD17014B0"/>
And now that you may be quickned care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſeek and ſtrive for this bleſſed Spirit, and for thoſe bleſſed and gracious Influences thereof; I will offer a few Things to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which if they be accompanied with the bleſſed Spirit into your Hearts, will excite Deſires and ſtir up Endeavours, in the Way of the Goſpel, for the obtaining the ſame to purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do but conſider, it is the BLESSED SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT OF GOD, <hi>that you are adviſed and exhorted to ſeek after, and to whoſe guiding and governing Influences you are recommended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no leſs than the <hi>divine eternal Spirit,</hi> and no leſs than God himſelf, that you are adviſed to put your ſelf under. And therefore you may be ſure that there can be no Danger in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led by this Spirit. It is impoſſible for this <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> who is a Spirit of <hi>Grace,</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> to lead us to any Thing but what is true, and good, and holy. This Spirit can lead us to nothing, but what will tend to make us good and happy. So that you may be ſure it is a Privilege to be led by this Spirit; that he leads in none but ſafe and right Paths; that he leads in the Truth, and teaches; that he leads in the Paths of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for his Name's Sake. So that if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be led in the right Way, in the Way of Holineſs, and in the Way of Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:005117_0100_1016A93FD17014B0"/>forever; you muſt deſire to be led by this Spirit, and put your ſelves under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Influences thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider, none but this Spirit can or will lead you in the right and ſafe Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many falſe and lying Spirits gone forth into the World. The Devil, and all his accurſed Legions, are lying Spirits, and they lie in wait to deceive. And the good Angels, altho' they are for nothing but the Truth; yet they, altho' they excell in Strength, yet are not able of themſelves to work ſavingly and effectually upon Men's Souls; tho' they have a good Will to it; yet they have no Power to reſtore our Souls, and create us anew in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>They are miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter unto them who ſhall be Heirs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> * But they cannot work ſaving Grace in the Soul. This muſt be done, whenever it is done, by the Spirit of God. And unleſs we are brought under the powerful gracious Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit, we ſhall abide in our carnal natural State. So that if ever you would be delivered from the dreadful Ruins of the Fall, if ever you would be delivered from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Slavery you are in to your Luſts and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and brought into the glorious Liberties of the Sons of God; you muſt ſeek and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be led by this bleſſed Spirit; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, all Means that can be uſed will prove ineffectual.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:005117_0101_1016A958B6EFF700"/>
3. Conſider, none are <hi>the true Children of God,</hi> but ſuch as are born of this Spirit.</p>
               <p>Such as are born of this Spirit are born of God, and ſo are the Children of God; but as for ſuch as have not had this regenerating and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, let them call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Children of God, and let others think them ſo; yet God will never own them for his, nor treat them as his Children. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ever you deſire the glorious Privileges of the Sons of God, as ever you would be able with Confidence to call him Father, and would have the Liberty to go to him as Children to a Father, as ever you would have him pity you, and love you, as a Father doth a Child, and as ever you would be intitled to the Inheritance of God's Children; you muſt come under the regenerating and ſanctifying Operations of this bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider, that the gracious Operation of God's Spirit upon the Soul, is the Seal of the living God, and is alſo the Earneſt of our Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read ſeveral Times, of being ſealed with the Spirit; and of God's ſealing with his Spirit, 2 Cor. 1.22. <hi>Who hath alſo</hi> SEALED <hi>us, and given the</hi> EARNEST <hi>of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> And we are warned <hi>againſt grieving the holy Spirit by which we are</hi> SEALED <hi>unto the Day of Redemption,</hi> Eph. 4.30. So that it is the holy Spirit that ſeals Men, and ſeals them unto the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:005117_0101_1016A958B6EFF700"/>Day of Redemption, and this bleſſed Spirit that ſeals them, does it by making gracious Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon them, by inſtamping the divine Image upon their Souls, which is God's Seal, his Mark by which he knows all his Children. And wherever this Seal is, there is the Pledge or <hi>Earneſt</hi> of the future Inheritance: There is Part given in Token of what is to come; for the gracious Impreſſions made upon the Soul by the bleſſed Spirit are the Beginnings of Heaven. That new Life which is breathed into the Soul by the Spirit of God, it is the Beginning of eternal Life. Now then if you would be ſealed with God's Seal; if you would be found at laſt <hi>with the Mark of the living God upon you,</hi> ſo as to be owned and received among his Children; and if you would have the Pledge and Earneſt of eternal Glory within you; yea if you would have the Beginnings of eternal Life in your Souls; you muſt ſeek 'till you obtain this bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Conſider, it is only by being under the bleſſed Influences of this Spirit, that we can have the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, the Light of his Countenance, and any true Peace and Comfort in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God can take no Delight in any, but ſuch as have his Spirit. It is the Comelineſs which God himſelf puts upon us by his Spirit, that renders us the Objects of divine Delight &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence. And none but ſuch as have this Spirit
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:005117_0102_1016A9416EB0A300"/>can expect to enjoy God, or any Communion with him, or any Token of his Favour, nor indeed any true Peace and Comfort in the World. This <hi>Sanctifier</hi> is alſo the <hi>Comforter.</hi> And we muſt have him as a <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> or we ſhall never have him as a <hi>Comforter.</hi> Indeed ſome may be filled with carnal Mirth, and ſpend many Days in Pleaſure, but what Kind of Mirth is it? Why <hi>even in Laughter the Heart is ſorrowful,</hi> having a miſgiving, accuſing Conſcience within, <hi>and the End of that Mirth is Heavineſs.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 14.13.</note> Others alſo without the Spirit, may pretend to much ſpiritual Comfort; but alas! it is only <hi>the Light of their own Fire, and Sparks of their own kindling.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. 50.11.</note> But now where the Spirit of God comes and begets Comfort in the Soul, it is a true and ſolid Comfort, it is a Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a good Foundation, that will bear to be examined and tried, and the End of it will be Joy.</p>
               <p>Well then, would you enjoy God's <hi>Favour which is Life,</hi> and <hi>his Loving-Kindneſs which is better than Life?</hi> Would you have <hi>the Peace of God that paſſes all Underſtanding to keep your Heart and Mind thro' Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which may ſupport you under all the Troubles of Life, and may diſpel all the Terrors of Death? Why then you muſt ſeek to obtain this bleſſed Spirit in the renewing and ſanctifying Influences
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:005117_0102_1016A9416EB0A300"/>thereof. You muſt ſeek to obtain the Graces, before you can have the Comforts and Joys of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Conſider, that it is by this bleſſed Spirit alone that we can be fitted for Heaven, and for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Inheritance which God has there laid up for his Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no getting to Heaven; nor would it ſignify any Thing to get thither, unleſs we are in ſome Meaſure fitted for that bleſſed Place; and all whom God ever receives to Heaven, he fits them for it. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Mortality being ſwallowed up in Life, that is in eternal Life and Happineſs, ſays, that <hi>he who had wrought them for the ſelf-ſame Thing is God, who had given unto them the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Spirit.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.5.</note> He who hath <hi>wrought</hi> us for the ſelf-ſame Thing, or <hi>prepared,</hi> or <hi>fitted,</hi> for that bleſſed Immortality, as it might as well be rendred. So that God prepares and fits every one for Heaven that he receives to it. <hi>Giving Thanks to the Father, who hath made us meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Col. 1.12.</note> And now the Father does this by his Holy Spirit, in ſanctifying, purging and cleanſing from thoſe Things that would render us unfit for ſuch a holy Place, and that would hinder us from the Enjoyment of it. In our
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:005117_0103_1016A94622394E88"/>natural State we are utterly unfit for Heaven. O! ye carnal, corrupt, impure Souls, what would you do in Heaven if you could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thither, which is indeed impoſſible! For nothing entreth there that defileth. But if you could get thither, what would you do there? You could neither bear a Part in the Exerciſes, nor could you taſte the Delights and Pleaſures of that glorious Place.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as ever you would have an Entrance miniſtred to you into the everlaſting Kingdom, and as ever you would be fit for the Preſence of the holy God, as ever you would be fit for the Society of Angels, and of the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and as ever you would be fit for the Exerciſes, and capable of reliſhing the Delights and Joys of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly World; you muſt ſeek to obtain this bleſſed Spirit to ſanctify and cleanſe you: For as to every one that ſhall be ſaved, it may be ſaid, that they are choſen unto Salvation <hi>thro' Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> and Belief of the Truth.
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you ſee ſomething of the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Neceſſity of our being under the leading governing Influences of this bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Of as much Importance as it is for us to be delivered from being the Children of Wrath, and Heirs of Hell, and to be the Children of
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:005117_0103_1016A94622394E88"/>God, Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chriſt, to the heavenly and eternal Inheritance, and to be made meet for it; of ſo much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance is it for us to have this divine and bleſſed Spirit to lead and guide us, and to work all divine Vertues and Graces in our Souls.</p>
               <p>And now perhaps ſome of you are ready to put this Queſtion to me, <hi>viz.</hi> How ſhall we obtain theſe bleſſed Influences of this divine Spirit? What Courſe muſt we take that we may be led by the Spirit of God, and have thoſe divine Vertues and Graces wrought in our Souls?</p>
               <p>And now to this important Queſtion, I will anſwer in a few Particulars, by Way of Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>DIRECTION 1. <hi>You muſt believe and be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Need you ſtand in of this bleſſed Spirit, to lead and govern you, and to work every Grace in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Men have been ſo ignorant of their own Weakneſs and Corruption, as to imagine that with the common Helps afforded them in the outward Means of Grace; they had Power enough of heir own to effect a gracious Change: That they could in the Uſe of theſe Means convert and change themſelves, and put
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:005117_0104_1016A94A0B916D00"/>every Grace into Exerciſe as there ſhould be Occaſion.</p>
               <p>But now as ſuch are groſly miſtaken, ſo God oftentimes leaves ſuch ſelf-ſufficient, ſuch ſelf-confident Perſons to themſelves, whereby they may be effectually convinced at length, (and oftentimes when it is too late) that they had not Power of their own to ſtand; much leſs to do this and other Duties. And therefore ſuch as are ſo confident in their own Strength, are not likely to ſeek for Help as they ſhould, and ſo not in a likely Way to have the Help of the Spirit afforded unto them.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour told his Diſciples <hi>that without him they could do nothing.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John 15.5.</note> We muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that without the Help of his Spirit we can do nothing effectually in the Affair of our Souls. And the more ſenſible you are of your Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, your Corruption, and Wickedneſs, and the abſolute Need you ſtand in of the ſpecial Help of the divine Spirit; the nearer you are to have the Help of this bleſſed Spirit afforded unto you. Let Perſons be but ſenſible that in their natural State they are weak and impotent, <hi>wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked;</hi> and then they are more ready to look to God for Help, more ready to receive it, and God more ready to beſtow it. <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick; I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi>

DIREC. II. <hi>On the other Hand, you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of looking upon your Impotency in ſuch a View, and preſuming ſo much upon the Help of the Spirit; as to ſit down in Sloth and Negligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſome Men are vain in their Imaginations with Reſpect to the natural Powers of Men, and can't bear to think they are ſo debaſed and debilitated by the Fall, as really they are; but think they can do this, and the other by their own Power, without any ſpecial Help of the Spirit; ſo others are apt to run into the other Extreme, and from the Repreſentation that is made in Scripture of humane Weakneſs and Corruption ſince the Fall; but more eſpecially from ſome falſe Gloſſes that ſome have put upon certain metaphorical Expreſſions in Scripture; and from the ſtrong, indiſcreet, and indiſtinct Expreſſions of ſome Teachers, concerning the Impotency of Men; I ſay, that from theſe Things, ſome have been ready to think that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all can be done by them, nor ſo much as to be attempted by them; but will ſit ſtill, waiting till the Spirit of God moves them; pleading that it is in vain to attempt to do any Thing before the Spirit helps them; yea, and that it would be a ſinful preſuming in their own Strength, to attempt any Thing before they find the Spirit helping them. And how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a Plea is this with ſome Perſons, when they are called upon to this and the other Duty,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:005117_0105_1016A94B93D24B88"/>to ſay, I can do nothing of my ſelf, I have no Power of my own, I am not ſufficient as of my ſelf for a good Tho't; and how quietly and contentedly will ſome ſuch Perſons ſit down in Sloth, and in the Neglect of Duty, with ſuch a Plea as this, from Year to Year, pretending that they wait only for the Spirit of God to help them: When in Fact the Spirit of God has all the While been ready to help them, if they would but improve the Help that he ſtood ready to afford them. And however ſome People may quiet themſelves in their Sloth and Negligence, from a Pretence of their Impotency, and how much ſoever they may flatter themſelves that they give Glory to God, by pleading ſuch a Weakneſs and Inſufficiency in themſelves; yet it will be very offenſive to God, and a Means of provoking him to withold his Spirit from them, when they make uſe of this as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to encourage themſelves in Sloth and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
               <p>For altho' I am fully perſwaded that there is a moral Impotency in Men to that which is ſpiritually good, and that we indeed are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of ourſelves for a good Tho't; yet there is a natural Power ſtill left in Man to do many Things that are materially and externally good; ſuch as to read, to hear, to attend the Worſhip of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore for any to neglect theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Duties, under a Pretence that they can
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:005117_0105_1016A94B93D24B88"/>do nothing of themſelves, would be as much an Abuſe of the Doctrine of humane Impotency, as it would be for a Man, becauſe we are taught that <hi>in God we live, and move, and have our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 17.28.</note> to ly a Bed, and not ſtir Hand or Foot, pleading that he moves in God, and that he can't move without him.</p>
               <p>So that every one who makes uſe of Man's Impotency as a Plea for Idleneſs, Sloth and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, it is moſt certainly an Abuſe of the Doctrine: But it rather affords an Argument for ſtriving. I don't mean in our own Strength, but in the Strength of the Lord; and we muſt try and ſee whether God don't afford Help and Strength to us. For God is oftentimes ſtriving with Sinners under the Goſpel by his Spirit: And who can ſay, if they ſhould attempt in any Duty, but that God will ſet in with his holy Spirit and help them? What one Soul can ſay but that the Spirit of God ſtands ready to help him, if he will but engage in any Duty. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men muſt ſee what they can do, and go ſo far as they find they have any Power, inſtead of ſitting down in Sloth and Lazineſs. The Man with the withered Hand, when Chriſt bid him <hi>ſtretch it forth,</hi> did not pretend to plead that he had not Power to ſtretch it out, but believing that he who bid him ſtretch it out; was able to ſtrengthen him to it, he attempted to ſtretch it
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:005117_0106_1016A94E8EED0798"/>out, and found Power at the very Time to do it.

We muſt conſider the Gift of the holy Ghoſt to be as free a Gift as that of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We are not to look upon God as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Obligations to give his Spirit to us, but that it is according to his meer good Pleaſure: For <hi>he will have Mercy on whom he will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and will have Compaſſion on whom he will have Compaſſion.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 9.15.</note> Altho' in the Counſels of God in the Covenant of Redemption, we may ſuppoſe that it was agreed upon that the eternal Spirit ſhould apply the Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt; yet this Spirit is given to apply this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, by working Faith in the Soul, and uniting it to Chriſt in effectual Calling, according to the ſovereign Pleaſure of God. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling; not according to our Works; but according to his</hi> OWN PURPOSE AND GRACE.
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> So that you muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to claim the Holy Spirit; you muſt not think that by any Thing you can do, you can challenge the holy Spirit as what you have a Right unto; the divine eternal Spirit is perfectly free in his Operations, as free as the Wind: <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">John 3.8.</note> So whenever any of you receive the gracious Influences of this Spirit, you muſt acknowledge it as a free Gift, and according to the ſovereign Pleaſure of

And in this Way God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for his Spirit.

                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. 2.8.</note> He is in a likely Way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Grace, yea it is a Sign that the Spirit of Grace has begun to work upon that Soul.</p>
               <p>DIREC. IV. <hi>You muſt be much in Prayer to God, for his bleſſed Spirit to lead and govern you.</hi>

               <p>Altho' the Spirit of God in the gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences thereof be the free Gift of God, and he gives it according to his own ſovereign Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; yet he allows and encourages us to aſk it of him. And altho' we cannot challenge or demand the holy Spirit, becauſe we have aſked it of God; yet we have great Encouragement
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:005117_0107_1016A9516CF191C8"/>to pray, and to hope for obtaining upon our Prayers, provided we have ſincere Deſires in our Prayers. Indeed if we have any ſincere Deſires they are ſtirred up by this very Spirit. Accordingly ſo far as you are enabled you muſt deſire this bleſſed Spirit to be your Guide, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, and Comforter, and muſt manifeſt thoſe Deſires in Prayer to God: And if you dont deſire ſo much as you ought, you muſt pray that you may deſire it more. Prayer is a Duty that we can perform in ſome Sort; and if we can't of ourſelves pray ſo well as we ſhould; let us pray as well as we can, and pray that God would enable us to pray better, and that is the likelieſt Way for us to pray better, and one of the beſt Methods we can take to obtain the holy Spirit in his gracious Influences. For as our bleſſed Saviour repreſents the Matter unto us, we may as certainly, yea much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly depend upon our heavenly Father to give the holy Spirit to them that aſk, than upon our obtaining of our earthly Parents, any good Thing that we aſk of them. <hi>If ye being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children; how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that aſk him.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 11.13.</note> So then we muſt aſk this Spirit of God, and we can't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this Gift without aſking.</p>

Indeed ſome have ſuggeſted, as if it was a dangerous Thing to ſet unconverted People, to praying for the holy Spirit: And others have ſpoken of it as a Matter of great Doubt with them, whether unconverted Perſons ought to pray; by Reaſon of which ſome weak Minds that have been under Doubts as to their Regeneration, have been under Diſcouragements as to the great Duty of Prayer. But he that obſerves the Current of Scripture, will find that every Man is obliged to pray, and eſpecially to aſk for the holy Spirit, and for renewing Grace. As it is God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to give a new Heart, and a new Spirit, and as he has promiſed to give it unto his People, ſo he expects that we ſhould aſk it of him. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, — and I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them.</hi>

And this plainly ſuppoſes, that Perſons muſt pray, muſt ſeek to God in order to obtain this great Bleſſing of the Spirit. Moreover, if we may pray that <hi>God would create a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within us;</hi> we may pray before there is ſuch a clean Heart and right Spirit created or renewed within us.</p>

But then if we pray for the Spirit of God, we muſt labour to be earneſt and importunate in our Prayers. If we find ourſelves cold, dull and lifeleſs in praying for the Spirit of Grace; we muſt pray that God would make us more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in our Prayers. We muſt alſo ſet our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to conſider the infinite Importance, and the abſolute Neceſſity of our obtaining the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, and ſo muſt pray that whatever God denies us, he would not deny us his holy Spirit. You ſhould endeavour that the Language of your Souls might be to this Purpoſe, <hi>Lord, as to outward and temporal Bleſſings, I aſk them with Submiſſion to thy wiſe and holy Will, whether to grant or to deny: But as to thy holy Spirit, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee by no Means to deny it unto me, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Spirit I ſhall remain in a carnal corrupt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and can never ſee thy Face, nor enjoy thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but I muſt be excluded thy Preſence for ever.</hi> And ſo far as there is any Earneſtneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in your Prayers, ſo far it is a Token for Good. For when God is about to give his holy Spirit in the gracious Influences thereof; he will ſtir up ſome Earneſtneſs of Deſire, and will quicken us to call upon his Name.</p>
               <p>DIREC. V. <hi>You muſt readily acknowledge the Help and Influence of the Spirit, which you receive your ſelves, and perceive in others; and give</hi> GOD <hi>the Glory of it.</hi>

As we are to aſk for the Spirit, ſo he is to be acknowledged in all his gracious Influences and Operations upon Men's Hearts, and if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience any Thing hereof in our ſelves, in any lively Actings of Faith, and Love, or other Graces, or in any gracious Reſtraints from Sin, or Aſſiſtances to Duty, or in any true ſpiritual Joy: We muſt not aſcribe thoſe Things to our ſelves, but acknowledge them all to the Glory of God. We muſt acknowledge with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and ſay, <hi>By the Grace of God, I am what I am. —Not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15.12.</note> He which hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame Thing, is God, who hath alſo given unto us the Earneſt of the Spirit.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.5.</note> I live; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs not I; but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>

               <p>But here we muſt beware of Errors on the right Hand and on the left. As we muſt be careful to give God the Glory of all his Grace, and muſt take heed that we don't aſcribe any Thing to our ſelves which is really the Work of the divine Spirit; ſo we muſt avoid the other Extreme, which is the aſcribing this and that to the divine Impulſe, and the gracious Influences of God's Spirit, which are really the Effect only of an enlivened Fancy, and warm Imagination; for this in the Concluſion may be as dangerous and fatal as the other. But Wiſdom is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is neceſſary to direct us in thoſe Things, and the holy Scriptures muſt be our Guide.</p>
               <p>And by this Rule we muſt judge the Spirits, as well as our ſelves; and judge of them by their Fruits, for by their Fruits it is that we can know and judge of them.</p>
               <p>And here we may, from the Nature of the divine Spirit, as revealed in his Word, lay down this general Rule in the Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe Things are to be attributed to the Spirit of God,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:005117_0110_10166758A3801AB0"/>that plainly, clearly, and fully lead us to God, and Chriſt, and Holineſs, to Juſtice, Truth, and Charity, to Sobriety, Chaſtity, and Humility. And that whatever Influence there is upon us, that don't plainly and fully lead us to theſe Things, whatever ſpecious Appearance it may make at preſent, it is from ſome other Spirit than the Spirit of God, and may not be aſcribed to him.</p>
               <p>DIREC. VI. <hi>You muſt diligently attend upon all the inſtituted Means of Grace, wherein you may hope to meet with the Spirit of God in the gracious Influences thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is in Concurrence with ſome outward Means of Grace that God for the moſt Part works upon the Souls of Men, and makes uſe of them as the Inſtruments of our ſaving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to him. Thus the Word of God is very much made uſe of in the Hand of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the convincing and converting Sinners. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 19.7.</note> That is, inſtrumentally by the Hand of the Spirit. For it is with the Word that he converts and regenerates the Soul. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us, with the Word of Truth.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">James 1.18.</note> Surely then we ought to converſe very much with the Word of God. We ſhould read it, and hear it, with diligent Attention and cloſe

And we muſt be ſteady and conſtant in attending upon religious Duties and Ordinances, and muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to be eaſily diverted from them.

He has been ſo provoked hereat, as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and has ceaſed to ſtrive with them any more. And if God in righteous Judgment ſometimes deals thus with thoſe that quench the Spirit, that don't carefully obſerve the Dictates thereof, nor comply with its bleſſed Motions; how much more will he be provoked to leave
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:005117_0111_1016A95BC6234DE8"/>ſuch as do even <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, and do deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> Oh then as ever you would obtain the bleſſed Spirit, you muſt take Heed of grieving or provoking him, by reſiſting him, or refuſing to comply with him. You don't know what Hazzard you run every Time you quench or reſiſt the Spirit of God. And let me tell you, that if any of you finally miſs of the Spirit of God, and die in your Sins, God will know it, and charge upon every one of you that you quenched his Spirit, that you grieved his Spirit, that you reſiſted his Spirit, which will ſtop every Mouth, ſo that you won't have a Word to ſay for your ſelves in the Day of Judgment; but will condemn your ſelves for refuſing and reſiſting the Spirit of God when he was offered to you. Well then as ever you would obtain the Spirit of God, ſo as to be a ſure Token of your being the Children of God, you muſt not reſiſt, but readily yield to the Strivings of the Spirit. You muſt hearken to his Suggeſtions, and fall in with his bleſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whatever the Spirit of God ſuggeſts from the Word of God, as your Duty, and is prompting you unto, you muſt comply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, without conferring with Fleſh and Blood, without conſulting your carnal Eaſe or worldly Intereſt in the Matter. And by thus heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the bleſſed Spirit, and complying with the Motions thereof, you will have the Spirit come more and more powerfully upon your
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:005117_0112_1016A95FB22D1BA8"/>Souls, that at length you will be ſo led and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by this Spirit of God, as will be an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that you are the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now to conclude the whole Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us all admire and adore the Riches of divine Grace, that God is pleaſed to take any of the rebellious Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> and admit them to all the glorious Privileges of his Children; that he has been pleaſed to ſend his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and dearly beloved Son to purchaſe ſuch infinite Benefits for us; and that he has been pleaſed alſo to ſend his holy Spirit, to make us the fit Objects of divine Love and Complacency, and to make us the fit Subjects of ſublime Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and of immortal Happineſs. And now ſince this infinitely bleſſed Spirit, in all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, convincing, renewing, ſanctifying, ſaving and comforting Influences is revealed and offered in the Goſpel, and ſince the outward Means of Grace are ſo freely enjoy'd, and the common Strivings of this Spirit, ſo frequently experienced by us; Oh! let us take Care that we may not be of that unhappy Number <hi>who receive this Grace of God in vain. Look, look diligently, leaſt any of you ſhould</hi> finally <hi>fail of the Grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here you may receive this as a Truth, and rely upon it, that altho' God be the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Diſpenſer of his Grace; yet that if you
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:005117_0112_1016A95FB22D1BA8"/>fail of the Grace of God, fail of obtaining his Spirit to lead and guide you, as he does the Children of God, it will be your own Fault; and becauſe you have not done what you might have done, and ought to have done, for the obtaining this bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>For if you are found without the Spirit of God and deſtitute of ſaving Grace at laſt, it will be becauſe of your Pride and Self-Conceit, that you preſumed in your own Strength, and did not ſuitably acknowledge the Need you ſtood in of the Help of the Spirit, or you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſo much upon the Help of the Spirit, as to lay aſide all Endeavours of your own, or you have been ſo careleſs about the Matter, as to reſtrain Prayer before God, and did not ſeek to him for his Spirit, as you might have done. Or you have denied to the Spirit the Glory of his divine and gracious Influences, attributing thoſe Things which have really been wrought by the Spirit, to ſome other Cauſes. Or you have aſcribed that to the holy Spirit, which would have been derogatory to his Glory, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for his Honour. Or you have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome of the Ordinances and Means of Grace which Chriſt has appointed. Or you have quenched the Spirit, and grieved him, and provoked his Departure. And now if theſe, and ſuch like, be the real Reaſons why any of you go without the Spirit of God, ſurely you will have a Conſciouſneſs of your own Guilt,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:005117_0113_1016A9626FB4DC30"/>and will judge and condemn your ſelves, and be obliged to acknowledge the Juſtice of God in condemning you: And all the World will acknowledge the Juſtice of the divine Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and ſay, as in Rev. 16.5. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, becauſe thou haſt judged thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, you muſt alter your Tho'ts, and alter your Courſe as to thoſe Things, as ever you would have this Spirit of God to guide and govern you, and even in this you need the Help of the Spirit. Oh! then let us be ſenſible that we need the Spirit of God in every Thing, and that without him we can do nothing. Let us cry to God for his Spirit, and that whatever he denies, he would not deny us his Spirit, and that whatever he takes from us, he would not take away his holy Spirit from us. Plead with God as the Pſalmiſt did, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy Preſence, take not thy Spirit from me.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 51.11.</note> Oh let us beware of reſiſting, grieving, or quenching this bleſſed Spirit; for we don't know how ſoon he may be provoked to depart: And wo unto us, if he depart from us. Let us then be thankful for every Striving of the Spirit, let us cheriſh every Motion, and comply with every Thing that this divine Spirit prompts us unto; endeavouring always to diſtinguiſh between the Spirit of God and our own Spirits, between the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error. Let us
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:005117_0113_1016A9626FB4DC30"/>wait upon God in all the Ways we have Ground to hope that we ſhall meet with his Spirit and Grace. And don't let us neglect one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance wherein God is ever wont to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Grace. Let us never flatter our ſelves that we have the Spirit of God dwelling in us, when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> nor let us vainly imagine we have more of the Spirit than we have. But whatever we do really find of the Spirit of God in us, let us acknowledge it as the Fruit of free Mercy, and ſovereign Grace in God, and give him the Glory of it. In theſe Ways we may hope to have the Spirit of God come into us, and to carry on his Grace in our Souls, from one Degree thereof unto another, until all the Vertues and Graces of the Spirit, ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in us, and we appear in all the Beauty and Glory, and partake of all the Happineſs and Joy of perfect Men in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
