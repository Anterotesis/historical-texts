            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN I firſt undertook this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I had no further intention than to give information upon a moſt important ſubject, for a few leading men in the great Council of the Nation; whoſe great influence, if well directed, might give eaſe, felicity, and content, to the whole empire: But when I came to reflect upon the difficulty, which the greateſt and beſt of men meet with, to ſtem the torrent of prejudice and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the enemies of England have, with infinite art and induſtry, ſpread through the land, I ſaw it neceſſary to be more particular in reciting facts, in order to rectify many paſt errors; and ſhall therefore now explain every alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, for the benefit of any man who can read, or claim the leaſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I blame no Miniſter, or Stateſman, farther than in proportion as he may

have promoted the deſigns and intereſts of our natural enemies, either by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or deſign. I wiſh only to enable every ſincere lover of his country to diſtinguiſh, with certainty, our friends from our enemies; and no longer ſuffer themſelves to be led by the cunning and fatal deſigns of thoſe, who have thus brought us to the brink of ruin.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GIVE me leave to addreſs myſelf to you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly. I am perſuaded of your love of juſtice and equity; and it is happy you live in a country bleſt with liberty; admitting every one to publiſh his ſentiments, to give information, and even advice to the greateſt men, without the leaſt impeachment of their honour or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>This little piece may be ſingular; as it looks back to the fundamental principles of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the very firſt dawnings of Engliſh free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it is meant to ſupport the almoſt obliterated idea of Engliſh dignity, which has been long ſince dropt, or ſhamefully abuſed, by many political writers, and is almoſt buried in the rubbiſh of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. But as the vigour of our conſtitution, and the very exiſtence of the empire depends upon its revival, by meaſures reſulting from this noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; I, in the name of every well-wiſher to this country beſeech you, particularly, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power, to preſerve or deſtroy the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011065_0006_0F854C81FB9094B8"/>
happineſs of millions, to weigh well the important point, at this very important moment, and ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize yourſelf, by uncommon efforts, to ſave this great and mighty nation, from falling a ſacrifice to a ſet of men, whoſe deſigns are, firſt to diſtract us with fatal diviſions among ourſelves, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign us over to our enemies, who have long ſince paid down the price.</p>
            <p>'Tis neceſſary firſt to inform you, that, whatever I aſſert I can prove; my intelligence comes from the very fountain: I have the ſanction of men who ſtand foremoſt in reputation, wealth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; my facts are ſuch as the predeſtinarian muſt allow to have been from decrees eternal, nor can time immemorial change them into deluſion. But ſuffer me to ſuſpend the explanation of my plan, and keep back for a moment the conviction I intend to fix upon you, that it may finally ſtrike with fuller evidence, and leave the ſtronger im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. And firſt let me aſk this ſingle queſtion —Is there any method by which the enemies of Great-Britain can reaſonably hope to conquer, or deſtroy us, but by forming diſſentions, ſtirring up prejudices, diſaffection, diſagreement, and diviſions; which may eventually bring us to a fatal civil war, or render us unable to unite with ſpirit, vigour, and ſucceſs in our own defence? This is their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate intereſt; this is their beſt policy; this is the point they ſhould keep in view, and what they are reſolved to effect.— Every good ſubject of theſe kingdoms, will reply, Moſt undoubtedly, moſt evidently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:011065_0007_0F854C82C0B3EE80"/>It is known to all men, well acquainted with the world, and motives of their conduct, that invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enemies may, from ſecret and ambitious deſigns, under the cover of ſolemn treaties, or high enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums of eſteem, be apparently our friends. The Spainards formerly, and the French of late, have attempted univerſal monarchy by arms. The Spainards were beat out of that humour in 1588, by the loſs of the general Armada: the French, by the battles of Hockſtade and Ramillies; but they then thought proper to eke out the lyon's ſkin with the fox's tail; and, at Utrecht, they had the addreſs to unravel the victories of the war. The little remains of the ſame ſpirit, then left, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to avail themſelves of the death of Charles the ſixth; they over-run Germany by the diviſion of the princes, even to Bohemia; but were again forced to their arts, by way of treaty. They have ſince attempted to over-run Germany by ſurpriſe, and were preparing to do the ſame in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; but being beaten out of both, they once more had recourſe to treaties, and formed the late peace; by what means, and how obtained, I will not ſay; but thus, you ſee, the enemies of Great-Britain have played a game, ever by b*****y, ſucceſsful, and often exceeding their warmeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. 'Tis therefore contrary to common ſenſe, to ſuppoſe they will quit the cards, while they have every thing to expect.—No; experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells us, they have ſteadily purſued their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ever ſince the peace.—We know (but we dare not yet impeach)— has for ſeveral years ſince the peace, actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011065_0008_0F854C837A142DE8"/>
from the court of France, £**** a year, for ſervice undertaken, and promiſed to be executed, for them. But this is is no ſtrange thing; for there was an Engliſh miniſter, formerly, who ſtood a penſioner to that court.<note n="*" place="bottom">At the death of the Abbe De Boys, it was found that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a penſion from England; and among the papers of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who died about the time when the parliamentary proſecutions begun, upon the famous South-Sea year, 1720. it appeared that one of them had received £ 16,000 a year penſion from France.—Nor is this a new thing; Philip De Comenes proves, that all the great men of England, and even the King himſelf, took penſions from Lewis XI.</note> And though we muſt not ſuppoſe there has been an inſtance lately, yet there can be no impropriety in looking back at the meaſures purſued; ſince our artful enemies, before and ſince the late peace, have been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into our kingdom, and have ardently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain admittance into our councils alſo. I hope they have been diſappointed; for 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to every man of common ſenſe, that their deſigns are to divide us, by raiſing falſe ſuſpicions, prejudices, and jealouſies againſt each other; and ſo diſtract us, by inteſtine quarrels, as to weaken our ſtrength, which, when united, is, by their dear experience, found irreſiſtable.<note n="†" place="bottom">By letters from many Engliſh gentlemen in France, ſince the peace, we have been informed, that theſe were their conſtant medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and when they ſaw an approaching rupture with our ſubjects in America, even the common people exhibited the livelieſt ſymptoms of joy at the news; and the hopes of all were once more revived, that England would ſtill in ſome future day, be conquerable.— And, by letters from our friends in America, we are with the higheſt confidence aſſured, that there came a French agent over to New-York, from the court of France, who, to prevent ſuſpicion, came by way of Hiſpaniola; and, while the uneaſineſs laſted, gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant intelligence of matters to his employers; and, no doubt had they got intelligence, that our ſubjects in America were once fairly divided and unhinged from the mother-country, they would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately have excited the whole body of Canadians to take up arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our colonies, while they attacked us in ſome other ſenſible part, either here, or in our colonies, and ſo ſecured to themſelves u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal empire; for, whatever ſtate holds the provinces of North-America, may hold the full balance of power to the world, and give it laws.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011065_0009_0F854C842866A2D8"/>I am ſorry that I am furniſhed with ſuch facts; but ſo it happen'd, that ſoon after the late peace took place, ſeveral perſons of known integrity and tried abilities, grew every day more and more out of faſhion. The famous Financier then took the lead; and inſtead of an eligible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional method of reducing our debts and taxes, he immediately proceeded in a ſucceſſion of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which all tended to divide and diſtract us. He began with extending the exciſe laws over the makers of cyder; which ſome ſuppoſe (for ſome men will believe there was a French influence prevailing ſome where, and cannot forget a former miniſter's taking a penſion from that court) was but a leading meaſure towards bringing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of ſmall-beer, (in their own houſes) under the ſame odious laws; which muſt have been attended with murmurs, and dangerous diviſions; and thereby directly have anſwered the deſigns of our enemies.</p>
            <p>General warrants came next; which, by their miſchievous, dangerous nature, and fatal tendency, and the efforts made to eſtabliſh them as legal (which in their conſequences muſt ſo certainly have utterly demoliſhed every future claim to Liberty in this kingdom) leaves us no poſſible doubt, whether our Gentle Shepherd had, or had not, adopted French politics; becauſe the Grand Monarch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011065_0010_0F854C84E4EB04F0"/>
could never have deviſed a better engine of ſlavery.—But I muſt lead you on, if not already convicted, to other meaſures, which were equally deſtructive, and, if continued, muſt have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſame unhappy and dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.—Reſtrictions on our trade.—He had the influence to fit out a number of our men of war; which, from the expence, parade, and mighty bluſtering in giving proper inſtructions, one might have imagined, had been deſigned for ſome grand and capital expedition; and though it did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh all Europe, as ſome preparations of this kind have done, yet it aſtoniſhed all men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, who ever reflected on the conſequence, except thoſe few who knew the cauſe. This Grand Armada, for ſo I chooſe to call it, as it reſembles the Invincible Armada, both in the motives of its outſet, and fate they met with; one was attended with the loſs of the Spaniſh power, the other with the loſs of the Engliſh trade. One was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to enſlave mankind; the other, if there was any deſign at all, to impoveriſh, and hereafter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the Engliſh empire. The brave officers of this ſquadron, were now made (under oath) real cuſtom-houſe officers; not for England but for Spain and France; for, by this means, the French have poſſeſſed themſelves of a great ſhare of this moſt advantageous trade.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The nature of this trade with the Spainasds is this—The Spaniards who live in Mexico, where they work their ſilver mines, find it doubly their intereſt to purchaſe Britiſh manufactures from the Engliſh merchant, in our Weſt-India iſlands, or in any of our ports in North-America; becauſe they can buy ſuch goods as they want cheaper of our merchants than of their own; beſide ſaving the indulto or duty, and many other charges upon their money, which it is ſubjected to, if ſent to Old Spain.—They therefore take every opportunity poſſible to purchaſe of us; and can any Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be ſo mad as to ſtop a trade, in which we receive in return, for every thing that we make in England, hard ſilver?—All the nations in Europe, who make manufactures, are exerting their utmoſt ſkill, and go every length to ſecure to themſelves this lucrative trade.— None ever had it, in proportion to us, till —, at a vaſt expence to the government, put a ſtop thereto, by obliging the Spaniard to purchaſe of the French and Dutch! The merchants here, who ſend goods to America, are in a ſtate, little ſhort of bankruptcy; for our merchants in America, uſed to make moſt of their payments in this ſilver, collected from the Spaniard. If this imperious, head-ſtrong, obſtinate financier, had meant to do his own country any ſervice, he ſhould have taken juſt the contrary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. The men of war, which, if there had been occaſion of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out, ſhould have been ready to protect us in this trade; the officers ſhould have had ſecret verbal inſtructions, or hints to explain matters in this light to the ſeveral governors through America; that their utmoſt endeavours were expected to ſecure the trade from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſometimes happens for want of their authority. Thus every merchant and manufacturer in England, would have had punctual and immediate payment for his goods, and full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for double the hands he now employs; and many have been in ſplendid, eaſy circumſtances, who are now, by reaſon of this fatal ſtroke, ſtarving. Not a farmer, not a ſoldier, not a ſailor, not a man of whatever rank in England, but now feels the difference. The rich, would have had more wealth, the poor hungry wretch would have had bread, and the man now ſhivering for want of clothes, would have been ſheltered in ſoft wool from the chilling winds. Upon the moſt moderate calculation, 'tis believed we have loſt the ſum of fifteen or twenty millions of dollars by this fatal meaſure, which would otherways have come into this kingdom. A gentleman lately arrived from the Weſt-Indies, declares upon his honour, that he ſaw in one day ſeven Spaniſh ſloops come into St. Euſtatia bay, (a Dutch port) with dollars to purchaſe European manufactures. He endeavoured to perſuade ſome of them to go to the Engliſh iſlands, but was anſwered, the Engliſh did not know their own minds, nor could they yet put any confidence in them.</p>

               </note> Can any man imagine the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011065_0011_0F854C859F733178"/>
then miniſter ſo totally loſt to common ſenſe, and ſo totally blind to the nation's intereſt, as to have done this under proper motives and influence? the the leaſt that can be ſaid, or the beſt apology that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011065_0012_0F854C86DBFEF630"/>
can poſſibly be made for him, is, that he wanted capacity and diſcernment. But it makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the nation, whether our ruin comes by blunders, or by iniquity; the miniſter who brings ſuch calamities upon us, from either, ought to be reſponſible.</p>
            <p>Our manufacturers, or Spittal-field weavers, in the mean time, complained that the French eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our prohibitory laws againſt their ſilks, by firſt ſending them to the ports from whence our laws admit ſilks, paying a certain duty, &amp;c. and prayed for redreſs.—Had they ſtrictly obſerved this miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's conduct, they would never have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble to attend him in the manner they did; for they muſt have concluded, he was too well bred, and too buſy in puſhing other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to give them the relief they wanted; for they wanted a national preference, and laws to ſecure Engliſh manufactories, and Engliſh intereſt; and as they were ignorant of his deſigns, their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations muſt be acknowledged natural. But the manner in which he found means to diſappoint them is well known.—Our merchants applied for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Canada Bills, as agreed upon by the definitive treaty; but were put off, with empty promiſes, and the common-place profeſſions of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in office; the only thing they could ever obtain, and the only thing in his department of buſineſs, that he can, with any juſtice, be ſaid to be maſter of. At laſt, thoſe bills ſunk ſo low as 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> and were looked upon as loſt; which were, in a few months after, by the honeſt nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the men who ſucceeded this miniſter,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011065_0013_0F854C8722E3AFB8"/>
fixed and actually paid, at near 40 <hi>per cent.</hi> and gives a moſt ſtriking proof of his inability, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs to take any lead in matters of ſtate.</p>
            <p>But, to proceed, freſh blunders were now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating (I mean in the Gentle Shepherd's admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; for he father's ſo many, that his idea will ever ſtand connected with blunders of ſtate) he turned his wiſdom towards reſtraining the trade of, and taxing our Britiſh colonies; which indeed ſtood in need of ſome attention, but of a contrary nature; for they had been at their full ſhare of expence with Great-Britain, and Ireland, in proſecuting the war.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The line of colonies had in actual ſervice through the general courſe of the late war above 20,000 men, which they paid and cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves. The difficulty of raiſing them, where the price of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is ſo extremely high, was very great, and moſt of the colonies found it neceſſary to give for encouragement every year from 5l, to 15l. ſterling per man, to inliſt for the yearly campaign, for labour was once as high as 4s. 6d. per day. The debts which the provinces had to pay their own governments, juſt as we do in England, made taxation on land much higher than it is here, and in ſome colonies equal in almoſt every thing elſe. There never was therefore a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger abſurdity than pretending that theſe provinces ſhould pay us for defending them, and till the late war they have ever defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Vaſt numbers of their beſt ſailors were likewiſe conſtantly in our men of war, which obliged them to give 20 guineas per man fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to come only to England —</p>
                  <p>When Admiral Saunders was about to proceed for Quebec in the year 1759. he acquainted the people of Boſton, that he wanted a number of good ſeamen, upon which, they immediately ſent him a great number of their beſt ſailors, who almoſt all continued in the Fleet till the peace took place.</p>
               </note> The late peace had taken moſt of the articles of remittance out of their reach, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the ſugar iſlands and Weſt India trade to the French; vaſtly in debt to England for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, in debt to themſelves for the large ſums iſſued for the ſupport of their troops; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011065_0014_0F854C87E65118E8"/>
by the cuſtom-houſe officers of our men of war from their natural trade with Spaniſh Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:—but, inſtead of giving any relief to thoſe poor makers of brick (which might have been done by extending their trade to foreign markets) he immediately took away the little ſtraw they had left; he took away all their paper currency;<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The ſudden reduction of this paper money was a dreadful cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the provinces, for they had always remitted all their ſpecie, of gold and ſilver to England for goods. This paper ſerved them for common circulation, and anſwered juſt as well as ſo much gold, where they took care to keep the ſum within bounds. And if it ever fell in value, ſterling debts to the northward of Virginia, were always paid in ſterling, therefore the Engliſh merchant could not ſuffer by it; they gave the very beſt ſecurity for redeeming it, which were lands, of the whole province, and it was to them juſt as bank notes or navy bills are to us. Whatever therefore may be ſaid in favour of a ſolid medium, nothing can exceed the ill-judged time and moment of an attempt to take it away; for the merchants who owed money to G. B. had none left to pay, or any poſſible method of getting it, in any ſeaſonable time, but from among the Spaniards. This door was ſhut up to them, as well as to us, by our wiſe miniſter's officers of floating Spaniſh cuſtom-houſes. This has left our merchants in England, who traded to America, in a ſtate little ſhort of bankruptcy, and the merchants in America in a ſtill worſe condition. Lands in America muſt be ſold to pay debts, juſt as chattels are in England; and there was an inſtance in the province of New-Jerſey, of one merchant ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeventy ſhop-keepers for debt; the ſeventy had lands, and their lands were ſold at public auction for no more than the ſum owing, by which means ſeventy families were deprived of their ſubſtance for want of this paper currency. In the province of Connecticut, their provincial or governmental taxes and arrearages, were a year or two ſince £80,000 to be diſcharged within the year, and though the officers of government filled the jails with people, till they would contain no more, and deſtrained upon every man's property, lands, houſes, and chattels, they could collect no more of the tax than £7000, or thereabouts. A true ſtate of the whole may at any time be ſeen in the hands of their agent, Mr. Johnſon, now here.</p>
                  <p>The taxes were ſo high upon the town of Boſton, that every man who appeared in a good way of buſineſs, or lived in a decent houſe, was taxed from 10<hi>l.</hi> to 20<hi>l.</hi> per. annum. A captain of a ſhip, who conſtantly went to ſea, has been taxed 12<hi>l.</hi> per annum.</p>
               </note> and though there may be good arguments in favour of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011065_0015_0F854C88B109AE30"/>
a ſolid medium of commerce, yet there can be no arguments in favour of taking away an artificial medium, without ſupplying its place with a better than that which is taken away; and the ſum thus taken away muſt be replaced, before the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in America can pay the merchants and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers in England; and this is the reaſon that ſo many thouſands of our poor are now out of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and in a ſtarving condition.<note n="*" place="bottom">If I miſtake not, the colonies owed to G. B. in the year 1766, five millions; had proper meaſures been purſued, one fourth might long ſince have been paid off, which if now in England, would make a ſtrange though agreeable difference with our merchants, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers and landholders; whereas now, they can neither get goods from England, or pay for them.</note> Surely, nothing could keep people from demanding ſudden revenge upon the authors of ſo much miſchief, but the love of liberty, order, Engliſh dignity, and an Engliſh King.</p>
            <p>Engliſhmen, and their deſcendants, wherever they go, and wherever they plant themſelves, are Engliſhmen, with all their rights, priviledges, and freedom.—They are ſubjects; for they have their king, and his protection, in every corner of the earth; nor is he leſs an Engliſhman who lives in India, Africa, or America, than he who daily baſks in the immediate ſunſhine of royal preſence.</p>
            <p>Thus the Romans were Romans; and wherever they went they carried their city.—We were Engliſhmen in Saxony: the Scotch are Engliſhmen by alliance, and intimate union; the Iriſh are Engliſhmen by adopting our laws; and the ſacred rights of Engliſh freedom go through the world with them. Theſe firſt principles of our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011065_0016_0F854C898690D110"/>
are our birthright, and juſt inheritance; and ſhall any power on earth dare to injure or violate them? Yet this obſtinate blunderer, in defiance of equity, honour, policy freedom, perſuaſion, or humanity, ventured to ſet the example, and tried the dreadful experiment, which no miniſter ever attempted before; and at a ſingle ſtroke enſlaved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Engliſhman in America. They had been, long before, repreſented to him reduced to a ſtate of bankruptcy; their trade loſt, by reſtrictions and inſupportable taxes; their money all taken from them, with no poſſible method of replacing it: in debt to England; burdened with immenſe internal taxations to diſcharge their provincial debts, contracted by the expence they were put to in the late war, in conjunction with England;<note n="*" place="bottom">Every one who knows the ſtate of the colonies, knows that they are greatly confined for want of a market to take off their produce; ſuch as all ſorts of timber, flour, proviſions of all ſorts, &amp;c. and ſince the provinces of Canada. Newfoundland, and the Floridas, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the other provinces, all their produce goes to the ſame markets, which makes the ſupply greater and of courſe the price leſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lands of the old ſettled colonies are leſs valuable in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may at this time be purchaſed near fifty per cent. cheaper than in the moſt dangerous moments through the late war. Colonel Bird's eſtate in Virginia, which is now valued and to be diſpoſed of by lottery at £40,000, would have ſold in 1760, for £70,000. A gentleman in New-Jerſey, has been impriſoned many months for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout £2000, whoſe eſtate would have ſold in 1760, for £5000.</note>
though the benefits of conqueſt could be immediately advantageous to England only; greatly behind hand in their agriculture, by ſending their labouring men into the field of battle.—In ſhort, they had little elſe left but life and freedom. But this —, againſt all their humble intreaties, or ſpirited aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, of being Engliſhmen (whoſe property is

We know, from our own hiſtory, that Kings have made large ſtrides to be abſolute; but no miniſter, even Woolſey himſelf, ever ventured ſo far. This Act <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 304—"And be it further enacted, by the authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid that the High Treaſurer of Great-Britain or the Commiſſioners of his Majeſty's Treaſury or any three, or more of ſuch commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the time being, ſhall once in every year, at leaſt ſet the prices at which all ſorts of ſtamped vellum, parchment, and paper ſhall be ſold by the ſaid commiſſioners, for managing the ſtamp duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their officers, and that the ſaid commiſſioners, for the ſaid duties, ſhall cauſe ſuch prices to be marked upon every ſuch ſkin and piece of vellum, and parchment, and ſheet, and piece of paper, &amp;c. &amp;c."</note> inveſts an abſolute power in the four Lords of the Treaſury (which is much the ſame as giving it to the firſt Lord) to raiſe the price upon the ſtamp'd paper, to any ſum they might think proper. This paper, by the letter and ſpirit of the law, was abſolutely neceſſary, in the execution of any buſineſs where property was concerned, to make the ſame valid in law; hence it is evident, from the ſtamps being kept in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the ſole power of ſending over the paper, or preventing its going at proper times, and in ſufficient quantities, the power of the ſtamp-maſter, appointed for the diſtribution of paper, to harraſs and plague the people, by monopoly, or local de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which would raiſe the price of the paper itſelf, by the difficulty of obtaining it; or oblige

the diſtant farmer to travel, hundreds of miles, to ſecure a ſingle ſheet; which is contrary to the laws of vicinage, the abſolute impoſſibility of paying money for the paper; ſubjecting the poor huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to bring his corn or cattle to the ſtamp-maſter for payment;<note n="*" place="bottom">Money was ſo ſcarce in the provinces, that the ſtamp-maſter in Maryland, told his friends he ſhould in ſo many months, be maſter of all the caſh circulating in the province; then he would take their corn, commence merchant, govern the market, turn the corn into a commanding medium, and purchaſe their lands at his own price: this he might eaſily have done, and, had not that law been repealed, a few years would have given them poſſeſſion of near half the lands in America, and tyrannic power over all the reſt of his Majeſty's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there; for the Lords of the Treaſury could at will have raiſed a ſheet of paper from ſixpence, to a hundred pounds, therefore had full command of all the wealth that America could acquire and their whole property, of which they had, at immenſe expence of blood, treaſure, labour, watchfulneſs and care, poſſeſſed themſelves</note> the power of juries taken away, and all deciſions committed to judges, who hold their commiſſions at pleaſure; and, in fine, the power of governing all his Majeſty's ſubjects in America by having the full command of their wealth; ſo that the King himſelf had no other than the name of dominion over them. I ſay, when all thoſe circumſtances come to be conſidered, and their tendency diſcovered, the meaneſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt diſcern the moſt infamous and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable deſigns, through the whole, that our inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate enemies themſelves could poſſibly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended.—I ſay, our enemies; for the famous Financier had not capacity or genius enough for ſuch a deep and wiſe-invented plan of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I have recited but one clauſe of this Act, tho' all tends to the ſame end, and breaths the ſame ſpirit.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Franklin, a gentleman of great abilities, and commands a great ſhare of inoffenſive wit, and true humour, was deſired by a particular perſon to point out the particularly grievous parts, and clauſes in this act; and after reading the ſame over very carefully, he returned it to his lordſhip, with the alteration of only one word, as the only alteration which could poſſible be admitted, or to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be adviſed; and this was, that inſtead of one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-five, it ſhould take place in two thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-five.</note>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011065_0019_0F854C8BA9EB9528"/>Thus, this miniſter was upon the very point of gaining ſuch an undue influence, in this nation, as never was before known. How ſoon would he have had ſuch a number of venal followers, who, for their ſhare of American property, might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly obey his dictates, or rather the dictates of our enemies, till they had plunged this great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire into utter ruin, and abject ſlavery; or at leaſt created ſuch diſturbances as the enemy would have taken advantage of. It would have given great alarm to us all, had the power of the ſtamps, here in England, been thus delegated to the miniſter; but thoſe who look any diſtance, ſee equal danger attending thoſe in America. Indeed, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, there was more danger in the latter; for the diſtance muſt leſſen the grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and gives the miniſter an opportunity of gathering wealth, and creating power, unſeen, though not unfelt; yet many would not have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcerned the cauſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">All the wealth, property, and future proſpects of acquiring any in America, would have been entirely at the controul of the miniſter, and muſt have been eaten up by his creatures, inſtead of coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England in payment for our manufactures, which would enrich us juſt in proportion, as the people there increaſed in numbers, and wealth; we ſhould therefore have been ſtarving for want of that trade, which is our only ſecure trade left to this nation.</note> Beſide how cruelly oppreſſive and unjuſt!

Shall the Engliſhman, in India, or America, for they are there, ſtill Engliſhmen, be denied the uſe and enjoyment of their little pocket expences, while their wealth muſt center here in England? Shall their fidelity be called in queſtion, if, after a trial of 150 years they never did refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the laws of their country, while they breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Engliſh ſpirit? Have our provinces ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to contribute their full ſhare of ſupport in the common cauſe, when they had the honour of doing it, with their own conſent?</p>
            <p>The Parliament certainly have, and ought to preſerve, a legiſlative power over the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But, I hope, taxation is looked upon as a different thing from legiſlation, and always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to actual repreſentation, If his Majeſty has not power enough, in any one of the colonies, to raiſe proportionably neceſſary ſupplies, for the ſupport of the ſtate in general; or if his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative power is not ſufficient to regulate and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all matters of government, neceſſary for their peace and ſafety, let it be immediately increaſed and ſtrengthened;<note n="*" place="bottom">The form of government in moſt of the provinces, is a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the Britiſh parliament, (if we may compare little things to great.) The people chooſe once in ſeven years a certain number to repreſent the reſpective counties, who raiſe ſupplies, as the Commons do here. The Governor repreſents his Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can nominate, and with his Majeſty's approbation, appoint a certain number of his friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are called his Council who, like the Lords, complete the legiſlative body. All heir laws muſt have the concurrence of this whole legiſlature, and after that his Majeſty's own approbation to make them valid; for his diſapprobation of courſe repeals them: hence his Majeſty has the ſame means of raiſing ſupplies in the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as in England or Ireland. The Governor for the time being, is likewiſe High Chancellor of the province. Thus it is evident the people have no other power, than that of giving their own money, and have the ſame inducements to do this according to their abilities, as we have in Britain, nor have they ever once refuſed contributing moſt amply, and often have done it much beyond their abilities. The provinces of Rhode Iſland and Connecticut are by charter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much upon the republican principles, and the dignity of government falls far ſhort of what might be really advantageous towards its perfection, vigour and ſupport; eſpecially the former, but theſe provinces have often given the moſt ſerious proofs of their good diſpoſition, to ſhare equally in all the burdens which have ever attended the ſtate; and ſhould they, by a contrary conduct, ever forfeit their privileges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is then time enough to introduce any new regulations. I candidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the government of Rhode Iſland, even now ſtands in need of ſome alterations; and the leading people of the province, have long deſired it; but muſt the whole empire be thrown into convulſions, becauſe one little province wants regulating? or ſhall all our ſubjects in America be made ſlaves, becauſe ſome few ſmugglers in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince can be licentious.</note> why need the worſt method

Would any man, in his ſenſes, if his hand or foot were inflamed, firſt attempt a cure by violent and untried remedies, which might very probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the limb, perhaps the whole body; would he not firſt try lenitives; or, if local applications prove not effectual, would he not alter his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, correct the juices, and ſubmit to purify the whole body, rather than loſe ſo valuable a part?</p>
            <p>But the intention of this letter is not to contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Right of Parliament; it is to trace the deſigns, and actual influence, which our enemies gain over us, by working upon our paſſions and prejudices; ſowing the ſeeds, and carefully culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the poiſonous weeds of jealouſy and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, in every heart, capable of nouriſhing the

The government now pays a bounty of three ſhillings per pound on wrought ſilks, ſent to the very ſame place, is not this giving money to the rich and extravagant, who wear ſilks, and can well, or ought to be well able to pay ſomething to the ſupport of government; and at the ſame time pinching the poor neceſſitous cottager, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him light, while he may have ſhelter from the peircing cold?

neceſſity of our manufactures; whereas, their confinement muſt drive them to the reſource of manufacturing; the eternal conſequences of want of land. Some may imagine, perhaps, for ſome men have very fruitful, though very ſhallow ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, that we muſt oblige them to conſume our manufactures; but thoſe who know any thing of the matter, will tell you, it is extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to oblige any people, againſt their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wear ſuperfine cloth, drink beer, eat cheeſe, lay out every ſhilling in their poſſeſſion for jewels, ribbons, and the innumerable faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable trinkets we ſend to them. <note n="*" place="bottom">Manufactures are built upon poverty and want of land; our only method is therefore to encourage the extenſion, and ſpreading of our ſubjects as much as poſſible, and encourage ſuch raw mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials as we want for our manufactures; and in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they have increaſed in their importations of our goods (which is beyond all belief to ſtrangers,) ſo they will continue to do, till their demands are more than all our exports, if oppreſſion does not prevent them. The article of pot-aſh ſhews how much benefit we may expect from America; for when they firſt began to make it there, the price was 65l. per ton, which was paid by England to foreigners, chiefly in caſh; and now we have it, equally good, from America, at 30l per ton, all paid for in our manufactures. Juſt ſo we might ſoon have the command of hemp, iron, or any important material wanted for our manufactures.</note> Is it neceſſary to enquire, whether the noiſe and diſpute about the right of taxing America, and the efforts to do it, is not a diſpute between the power of adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, who want to feed their dependants on the riches of America; and the future increaſe and flouriſhing of our manufactures, on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends our commerce, grandeur, and freedom?

ſhare our burdens: or whether a few men in power ſhall command their wealth and our own (it is inſeparable) by laying freſh taxes upon, and creating new offices among them? For I muſt beg leave to obſerve, that this late act, diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſome of our moſt important manufactures, and which ſo juſtly alarms our fellow-ſubjects in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, was formed by, and aroſe entirely from, the leaven of that power, which before brought us to ſuch unhappy circumſtances. <note n="*" place="bottom">The late Chancellor of the Exchequer, confeſſed to ſome of his friends, that he had promiſed the Gentle Shepherd, before he was Chancellor, that he would endeavour to lay an act upon America, which would ſo far reſemble the Stamp-act, as to anſwer the ſame purpoſes.

He was the father of the ſecond child, who though born with ſmoother features, and weaker limbs, yet may in time become as juſtly formidable, and contaminate the whole nation.

                  </opener>
                  <p>THERE are three things, in which I would be more particular than I could be in the ſhort hints I ſent your Lordſhip, and without an intention to reflect on any one miniſter, as I am ignorant who were the authors of the late meaſures, juſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011065_0029_0F854C932B8D6DE8"/>
delineate them, as they lie in my own mind, for your lordſhips conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The popular cry was, That as we had been at a great expence to drive away the French, and ſave the Americans, it was but reaſonable they ſhould refund part of that expence.</p>
                  <p>This pretence took with many unthinking people, who did not conſider, that wherever the enemy made their ſtrongeſt efforts, there the grand expence would ariſe.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe this effort had been made in any other part of the Britiſh dominions; for inſtance, had they landed in Scotland, and made a rapid progreſs, as they did in the late rebellion; would you, after the war was over, have taxed all the counties from which they were driven, with a new tax, to refund that particular expence, on thoſe who, during the courſe of the war, furniſhed a reaſonable quota both of men and money, exerted themſelves to the utmoſt, and our whole expence centered again in England; as all the money ſpent on our fleet, and in our colonies, certainly did: Doth not ſuch a demand appear very abſurd? Was not this expence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to preſerve his Majeſty's dominions, and preſerve our trade, as well as ſecure American property, and hereby ſecure our own, ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with them?</p>
                  <p>What ſums have in the laſt war, been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to preſerve Hanover? (which never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Great Britain more); do you, now the war is over, make a demand on them, or any of the German Princes, for ſaving them from the ravage of the French?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:011065_0030_0F854C93E41751A0"/>Why then ſhould our infant colonies, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under their ſeveral provincial debts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for the common cauſe, and who furniſhed men for every expedition, be ſingled out, and loaded with ſuch a burthen? a burthen far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to their ability! a burthen which will eventually terminate on England; which every merchant connected with America, and the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of manufacturers employed by thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, muſt alſo feel; under which they will groan, and by which they will be ruined.</p>
                  <p>Another thing is, ſending troops to defend America; which, indeed, has a great appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of care over them, but really is as abſurd as it is needleſs. To ſend regular troops to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in a former war not only defended themſelves, but fitted out an expedition, which ſucceeded in taking the French capital fortreſs of Louisbourgh, and thereby furniſhed their mother-country with a premium to purchaſe peace.</p>
                  <p>A people who, in the laſt war, without any regular troops to aſſiſt them, defeated the French regulars under Deſkow; and, had they been timely ſupported, would have drove the French out of Canada, without that heavy expence which is now complained of, and America, called on to refund; an expence which was chiefly occaſioned by the ſupine neglect and timid efforts of the miniſtry of her mother-country, which gave the French time to pour in troops on the continent of America.</p>
                  <p>Can this people, with nothing but Indians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011065_0031_0F854C94A64608E0"/>
them, from whom they have defended themſelves an hundred years, when French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars are entirely removed from the continent, have any occaſion for regular troops to defend them? If they are not neceſſary, it is creating a large expence, to carry and ſupport an uſeleſs, nay, I am ſorry to ſay, a diſſolute ſet of men, to live in idleneſs among them, and deprave the manners of the people, which is of no ſmall importance in infant colonies, where the utmoſt induſtry is neceſſary to their own well-being, and their utility to their mother-country.</p>
                  <p>If the calling on the Americans to refund ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences neglect and timidity occaſioned, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences which aroſe for the defence of his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's dominions, and the ſecurity of <hi>our commerce</hi>; and if regular troops are not naceſſary for the defence of that people, the whole ſyſtem of levying taxes falls to the ground, and there is no pretence for doing of it, in the violation of their charters; charters that will ever be held ſacred by all true Engliſhmen, eſpecially by thoſe whoſe forefathers fled into the wilderneſs, to avoid the intolerable oppreſſion, and arbitrary power of the <hi>faithleſs</hi> Stuarts, who looked upon the people's charters as waſte-paper.</p>
                  <p>It appears, the late miniſtry were determined to load America with taxes, without any regard to their charters; this, they muſt needs think, would ſit hard on a free and brave people whoſe liberties, inviolably maintained, would always occaſion an acceſſion of people to cultivate our extenſive acquiſitions, as well as conciliate the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011065_0032_0F854C96A9E98DA0"/>
minds of the Canadians to an Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Taxes would, I ſay, ſit hard on them, eſpecially ſuch as would impoveriſh the whole country, occaſion great diſcontent and animoſity; therefore, to ſtifle the popular odium, and the ferment of above <hi>a million</hi> of an oppreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not for their defence, land forces were neceſſary to be quartered among them, and crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers on their coaſt, to prevent illicit trade; but, in reality, to keep the colonies in awe, and carry into execution the oppreſſive meaſures, which ſome people have ſpoke out; <hi>The Colonies are growing rich and powerful, and muſt be kept under</hi>; which, I believe, your Lordſhip has heard.</p>
                  <p>How abſurd is this! Doth not, and will not, all the riches and power of the colonies centre in England, and make us rich and powerful? has it not really done ſo already? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if you ſtunt the growth of the colonies, don't you hurt yourſelves? Is giving the dead palſey to the limbs, the way to promote the health of the body?</p>
                  <p>Whatever falacious reaſoning may be urged, there is a mutual intereſt between Great Britain and her colonies, which will ever unite them; while ſentiments of liberty prevail, and are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and the monſter Oppreſſion, baniſhed from the heart and head of an Engliſh miniſtry, and they act in character as Engliſhmen.</p>
                  <p>Here is a continental connection, worth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and cultivating; which, if duly improved, will furniſh us with the treaſures of the South, and the neceſſaries of the North; that riches
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011065_0033_0F854C97018F3B20"/>
and power, which alone can ſecure us, by a <hi>Family Compact of our own,</hi> which will bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Compact of Popiſh Powers.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing I ſhall trouble your Lordſhip with, at preſent, is the equity of <hi>our</hi> taxing America; which I will fairly ſtate as it lies in my mind.</p>
                  <p>All the colonies but Georgia, and Nova Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, were originally ſettled by perſons drove from their native country, in thoſe reigns which, by oppreſſion, ſtained the glory of Britain; though, by the like oppreſſive meaſures, ſhe was ſupplied with manufacturers from the neighbouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, to our unſpeakable advantage.</p>
                  <p>Yet, oppreſſion was ſo much the taſte of thoſe times, that it drove out a number of the King's ſubjects, who took ſhelter in a deſart, that they might enjoy their civil and religious liberties, uncontrouled and unmoleſted. They were then in a ſtate of nature, under no civil government but what they formed themſelves, when they had eſtabliſhed their ſeveral ſettlements, out of regard to their mother-country, they ſent home their ſeveral agents, to tender their new acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to their mother-country, on certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions then agreed on by the ſeveral parties, and ratified by their reſpective charters, which they looked on as ſacred, and make their boaſt of, like our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of England.</p>
                  <p>If you conſider the thouſands that have been expended in ſettling Georgia, and Nova Scotia, you will better judge of the merit of the other colonies, which ſettled themſelves, without any
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011065_0034_0F854C97BA6A7F90"/>
expence to their mother-country. Without ſuch a ſurrender, therefore, Great Britain could have no pretence to any authority over them; for the right was founded in compact; and the ſame compact that gives Great Britain any rightful authority over them, ſecures the privileges ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated in that compact; which is, the <hi>ſole right of taxing themſelves,</hi> by their own repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; in which all the charters agree, however in other circumſtances they may differ; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, any attempt to break in upon their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, muſt meet with the ſame reception from them, as an Engliſh miniſtry would find from the violation of our <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; can you wonder then at any thing that has happened in Virginia, or any of the other provinces, by invectives againſt a miniſtry that violates their <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and deprives them of the privileges of Engliſhmen? an army, therefore, is neceſſary to carry ſuch meaſures into execution, though not neceſſary for the peoples defence.</p>
                  <p>It was always the ambition and glory of the Houſe of Hanover to maintain the privileges of Engliſhmen inviolable; and it will be a ſtanding mark of infamy on any miniſter who ſtains that glory, by the leaſt violation of them in America.</p>
                  <p>I ſubmit to your Lordſhip's determination, which is his Majeſty's intereſt; to rule in the hearts of a free people in America, as well as in England; or, by deſtroying their medium of commerce, which they have found uſeful for above an hundred years, and by laying burthens upon them, which they cannot but look upon as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011065_0035_0F854C985FB6D9C8"/>
acts of arbitrary power; which makes them ſlaves, inſtead of Engliſhmen?</p>
                  <p>If at any time there is a neceſſity of raiſing money from the colonies, let it be intimated by the ſeveral Governors to their reſpective Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; as was annually the caſe during the war; it will be cheerfully done; and preſerve that natural deep veneration and love which they bear their King and mother-country.</p>
                  <p>If the facts repreſented to your Lordſhip ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evident, and the reaſoning juſt, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance will apologize for this great freedom taken with your Lordſhip, in opening the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſentiments of,</p>

                  <p>It is now received, as an undoubted propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſtrength, riches, and influence of Great Britain, depend upon commerce: whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore diminiſhes our commerce, muſt impoveriſh and weaken our national influence.</p>
                  <p>Our commerce has been greatly curtailed in moſt parts of Europe; and we have therefore only our connection with America to truſt to, as the ſource of our ſtrength, riches, and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

Every thing, therefore, that interrupts and weakens the mutual confidence which has been remarkable for a hundred years paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great Britain and her colonies, muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble the ſtrength, and diminiſh the riches of this country.</p>
                  <p>The advantages to be drawn from our Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can colonies, muſt ariſe, not from taxes of any kind, but from extending our trade.

                  <p>So deep a ſcar was made with the late Stamp Act, as is not yet entirely healed. Making any freſh wounds in our commerce, if perſiſted in, muſt unavoidably occaſion painful ſenſations, not only in America but in Great Britain; and be felt not merely by the merchants, but by every manufacturer with whom they are connected; and no one corner of the kingdom will eſcape the baneful influence. To put any difficulties on our American trade, will inevitably diminiſh our exports to that country, from their inability to pay the merchants for the manufactures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by them; which inability will be the ſame, whether the people in America reſolve to take goods, or not. The Governors and Judges being independent on the people, which muſt render the courſe of juſtice precarious, will be a further diſcouragement to trade, and will raiſe

freſh, in the minds of the Americans, the evils that attended ſuch a meaſure, when their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers left this their native country.</p>
                  <p>When the merchants dare no longer venture their ſubſtance on ſuch uncertainties, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans will be under the neceſſity of uſing their own manufactures, though contrary to their preſent taſte and inclination. To prevent them purſuing this only reſource and remedy, muſt be the moſt manifeſt injuſtice, and as abſurd as to make a law obliging them to go naked.</p>
                  <p>The only method to ſecure our mutual inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and effectually prevent the Americans thinking ſeriouſly of manufactures, muſt be to encourage cultivating their lands, and extending their commerce, and thereby enabling them to pay for the various merchandizes of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which at preſent lie on hand for want of a market, and will leave thouſands of our poor unemployed, ripe for tumults and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>I ſubmit to your Lordſhip's ſuperior judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if any ſum of money, raiſed by taxes, can compenſate the evils which muſt inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low diſcouraging a trade, to the amount of two millions a year, which employs a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hands, who are already in the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, through the dearneſs of proviſions; and whoſe diſtreſſes, before the winter is out, may make them deſperate, as well as loſing the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and eſteem of two millions of the moſt loyal ſubjects in his Majeſty's dominions, whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for their mother-country is ſtrong and natural.</p>

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:011065_0038_0F854C9B65436DC0"/>I know, every candid independant man, who reads, is fully convinced of the goodneſs of the meaſures here pointed out: we are now all of opinion; for our intereſts, and path of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are as plain and clear as ſubſtances and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows by ſunſhine. Our difficulty remains, to fix upon the proper perſons who have honeſty and firmneſs enough to lead; for there are ſo many little ſons of Cerberus, who muſt have a ſop, or will otherways bark up our fears, jealouſies, phantoms, and apparitions; that our greateſt men are either afraid of, or in doubt, whether there is a poſſibility of oppoſing them with ſucceſs, though ſupported with immediate intereſt of the wide extended empire. All I will venture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, is to hold the man who has thus blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or wilfully plunged us into ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, in the higheſt contempt; and let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe who are in power, point out their fitneſs for office, by conſulting the intereſt of the kingdom, united.—<hi>Difficulties!</hi> did I ſay; I fear a few months more will enable me to ſay, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction!</hi> Be not deceived: there are falſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, deluſions, and hereſies in politics, as well as in religion. He who tells you, the conſtitution goes on with vigour, lies; the extremities are now periſhing; muſt not the plan ſoon reach the heart? can the hand or foot be mortified, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger to the whole body? ſhould not the blood, which nouriſhes the vital part, run pure to the diſtant limbs, and receive no contamination by the way? the phyſician who thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, is a mad-man or a quack. The ſtateſman,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011065_0039_0F854C9C23644998"/>
who ſuffers ſlavery and oppreſſion to reſt on any corner of the kingdom, is to be diſplaced, as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unworthy the important truſt, either for want of ſenſe or honeſty. But, from the fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of our enemies, or former Prime State Blunderer, this is our dreadful and unhappy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Our colonies are under moſt ſevere reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and depreſſions; their lands are daily ſelling, to diſcharge their debts to England; their own internal provincial debts inſupportable; their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit loſt; their agriculture declining, for want of markets,<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis our buſineſs to ſupply, if poſſible, all the foreign iſlands in the Weſt-Indies, from America, with fiſh, lumber, flour, live ſtock, proviſions of all kinds; and at the ſame time puſh off among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as many Britiſh manufactures as poſſible: This they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent; becauſe in proportion to our ſhare, the ſupplies they would otherways have from their mother ſtate, to whom the iſlands belong, muſt be diminiſhed; likewiſe every handful of their produce, which we get in return, leſſens foreign navigation; but there is an eaſy method to elude all their vigilance, which is to make free-ports, entirely free, as St. Euſtatia is to the Dutch, without a cuſtom-houſe-officer's ever having power to meddle with the planter, who comes to barter his produce: theſe ports ſhould be as near as poſſible to the iſlands, with whom we want to trade, and vaſt care ſhould be taken to encourage the planter to come to them; for when our ſhips attempt to load at thoſe foreign iſlands, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately liable to total confiſcation, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the men to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. A late adminiſtration, did wiſely to open Dominica and Jamaica<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I imagine they could not make the former free enough for want of proper ſupport in adopting the meaſure. Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacola ſhould have been opened to receive the trade of Cuba, and Spaniſh Mexico, and Turks iſlands for Hiſpaniola; and every ſhip employed in this trade would be an additional ſtrength to the Engliſh navigation built upon the decline of foreigners, who muſt loſe the advantages of navagation with the produce: but what can we expect of this nature, ſince our lords of trade write diſſertations againſt trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (miſtaking the thing itſelf for its had management) and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove it is our ruin.</note> which the laws of England forbid; their principal inhabitants removing from a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, idle town, or ſea-port, retiring into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,

theſe unhappy and deſperate circumſtances, ſome may, perhaps, expect they will be forced to open violence. No doubt, our enemies, the French, long to ſee them drove to that dreadful extremity, and our ſwords drawn againſt ourſelves; and this would have been the caſe, two years ago, had we followed the iniquitous advice of Mr. —; but the coloniſts have no thoughts of ſuch a meaſure. They know their whole property depends upon the Engliſh laws; that the moment they become unhinged from Great Britain, they bid farewell to property; and they tremble at the thought of ſeparation.<note n="*" place="bottom">What madneſs thoſe are guilty of who recommend governing our colonies by military power! was this once to be adopted, what have we not to fear! a prime Miniſter might at any time ſell our whole line of colonies to France, and give them up with no other trouble than that of ſending over a proper commander, who agrees to obey his orders!

But I muſt cloſe the dreadful ſcene.—You, Sir, whoſe important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to watch over the rights and liberties of this great nation, may, we hope, by your abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diligence and care, help to ſave us from the calamities we ſo juſtly fear muſt otherways ſoon overtake us. And though affairs appear dark and threatening; though our enemies without are ambitious, powerful, and cunning; though they have warm advocates, and faithful ſervants, in our very boſom; ſome, from unknown charms, ſome from falſe reaſoning, and ſome from pride, and love of power, chooſing rather to ſee the empire loſt, than the infallibility of a part queſtioned in the leaſt point; and though a revengeful diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſervant has found means to continue miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and uneaſineſs, by ſpreading lies and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices through the land; yet there are many things to encourage and animate you in a ſteady and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited oppoſition to his meaſures. You have a King, whoſe glory is the liberty of his ſubjects; who loves peace, harmony, and concord, and wiſhes to expand the beams of ſolid happineſs to the moſt diſtant corner of the realm: All the real friends of freedom are, or will in a ſhort time, be on your ſide; the intereſt of the merchant firſt, then the manufacturer, and finally the landholder,

The people will, in general, begin to feel their dependence on each other; as that neceſſity appears, they will look to the proper objects for its ſupport; and thoſe men who ſtand forth to ſave them, muſt become popular and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; while they, who were the cauſe of their calamities, the diſturbers of their peace, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their riches and ſtrength, and promoters of diviſions, muſt become odious and contemptible; for the moment they are convinced, that even any of their fellow ſubjects are injured, and unjuſtly treated, their generous hearts feel all the paſſions of tenderneſs, humanity, contempt, hatred, and revenge.</p>
            <p>May bad policy work out its own ruin, bad men finally be detected, miſtaken men convinced, and prejudices rectified by reaſon and the force of truth; and thus our union cemented, our enemies diſappointed in their attempts to divide us; and the glory of the whole empire ſhine with greater luſtre than ever, under the ſmiles and benign influence of the beſt of Kings.</p>
