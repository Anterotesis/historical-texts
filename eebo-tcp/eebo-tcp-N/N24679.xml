            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> following intereſting work was originally read before the Royal Society of Agriculture at <hi>Lyons,</hi> of which the author was then Preſident; and ſoon after that before the Royal Society of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>—It was ſo well received by thoſe learned bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, that it ſoon found its way to the preſs, and has ſince been tranſlated and re-printed in <hi>London. M. LE POIVRE</hi>'s manner is eaſy and elegant—his obſervations ſtriking and judicious—his ſentiments philanthropic and benevolent.—His principal aim appears to be to prove that the genuine happineſs of every nation depends upon the improvements of <hi>Agriculture;</hi> and that for this end the property of the induſtrious ought to be permanently ſecured by laws and modes of government that ſhould be ſubject to no violation.</p>
            <p>For the benefit of the <hi>American</hi> Farmers and Legiſlators it is now re-printed, in hopes that it may be an incitement to a proper mode of thinking on the ſubject of Agriculture, as well as to greater exertions and induſtry among the different ranks of people amongſt us.</p>

               <p>EVERY people, however barbarous, have arts peculiar to themſelves. The diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of climates, whilſt it varies the wants of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, offers to their induſtry different produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on which to exerciſe it. Every country, at a certain degree of diſtance, has fabrics ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly peculiar to itſelf, that they could not have been the fabrics of other regions: but agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in every climate, is the univerſal art of mankind: from one extreme of the globe to the other, nations ſtill barbarous, as well as thoſe whoſe ideas are civilized, procure to themſelves, at leaſt, a part of their ſubſiſtence by the culture of their fields; yet this art, however univerſal, is not every where equally flouriſhing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:032696_0004_0FF429CC3647D020"/>It never fails to proſper among wiſe nations, who know how to honor and encourage it;—it ſupports itſelf but feebly amongſt a people half poliſhed, who either prefer to it frivolous arts, or who, being ſufficiently enlightened perhaps to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its utility, are ſtill too much ſlaves to the prejudices of their ancient barbarity, to affran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize and confer honors on thoſe who exerciſe it;—it languiſhes, and its influence is ſcarcely to be obſerved amongſt barbarians, who deſpiſe it. The ſtate of agriculture has ever been the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object of my reſearches among the various people I have ſeen in the courſe of my voyages. It is almoſt impoſſible for a traveller, who perhaps only paſſes through a country, to make ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks as are neceſſary to convey a juſt idea of the government, police, and manners of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. In ſuch a caſe, the criterion which beſt mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s the internal ſtate of a nation, is to obſerve the public markets, and the face of the country. If the markets abound in proviſions, if the fields are well cultivated, and covered with rich crops, then in general you may conclude that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is well peopled, that the inhabitants are civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized and happy, that their manners are poliſhed, and their government agreeable to the principles of reaſon.—You may then ſay to yourſelf, I am amongſt <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When, on the contrary, I have arrived amongſt a people, whom it was neceſſary to ſearch for amidſt foreſts, whoſe neglected lands were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with brambles; when I have traverſed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032696_0004_0FF429CC3647D020"/>
large tracts of uncultivated deſarts, and then at laſt ſtumbled on a grubb'd-up wretchedly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated field; when arrived at length at ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, I have obſerved nothing in the public mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket but a few ſorry roots, I no longer heſitated to determine the inhabitants to be wretched ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or groaning under the moſt oppreſſive ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>I never remember a ſingle inſtance of being obliged to retract this firſt idea, conceived ſimply by inſpecting the ſtate of agriculture amongſt the various nations I have ſeen: the knowledge of various particulars, which a long reſidence amongſt many of them has enabled me to acquire, has ever confirmed me in opinion, that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or oppreſſed, and that population there can never be conſiderable.</p>
               <p>You will obſerve by the detail I now offer you of my enquiries, that in every country agriculture depends abſolutely on the laws, the manners, and even on the eſtabliſhed prejudices of the reſpective inhabitants. I ſhall begin with obſervations on ſome parts of Africa.</p>

                  <head>The Weſtern Coaſts of Africa.</head>
                  <p>The iſlands and weſtern diſtricts of this part of the world which I have ſeen, are for the greater part uncultivated lands, inhabited by unhappy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes. Theſe wretched men, who have ſo poor
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032696_0005_0FF4310BE4FD1DC0"/>
an eſtimation of themſelves as to ſell one anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, never employ a thought on the cultivation of their lands. Satisfied to exiſt from day to day, under a climate where their wants are few, they cultivate juſt as much as prevents their dying of hunger; they careleſsly ſow every year ſome maize, a very little rice, and plant, in ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, different kinds of potatoes, not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ours, though the culture is much the ſame; we know them by the name of <hi>yams.</hi> In gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al their harveſts are ſo poor, that the Europeans, who reſort to them for the purchaſe of ſlaves, are obliged to bring from Europe or America the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions neceſſary for the maintenance of thoſe unfortunate creatures doomed to compoſe their cargoes.</p>
                  <p>The negroes, who inhabit the environs of the European colonies, give ſomewhat more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to agriculture than the others;—they rear ſlocks; they cultivate rice in greater quantities; and in their gardens are found pulſe, of which the ſeed has been brought from Europe; yet all they know of agriculture, they have learnt from the Europeans ſettled amongſt them; their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is extremely bounded; and I have nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er been able to diſcover in their induſtry any proceſs which could in the leaſt improve our own.</p>
                  <p>From the river of Angola to Cape Negroe, and from thence till you approach the Cape of Good Hope, nothing is to be ſeen but ſterile uncultivated
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032696_0005_0FF4310BE4FD1DC0"/>
lands; the coaſts are naked, and covered with barren ſands; and you are under the neceſſity of travelling many leagues before yon can diſcover a palm-tree, or the ſlighteſt verdure. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and its few inhabitants ſeem to be ſtruck with one common curſe. From the informations I have received touching theſe countries from the Italian miſſionaries, who, with an admirable zeal, have penetrated into the heart of theſe accurſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, I learn likewiſe that agriculture is juſt as languid in the interior parts as upon the coaſts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, in many places, the ſoil appeared much more fruitful from its natural productions.</p>

                  <p>The countries around the Cape were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſame ſterility before the Dutch took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them; but ſince their eſtabliſhment on this point of Africa, the lands produce in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance wheat and grain of every kind, wines of different qualities, and a conſiderable quantity of exellent fruits, collected from every quarter of the world: There you ſee extenſive paſtures covered with horſes, black cattle, and ſheep— theſe herds and flocks thrive exceedingly well. The abundance which this colony enjoys, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the barrenneſs of the ſurrounding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, evidently demonſtrates that the earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies her favors only to the tyrant and the ſlave; but becomes prodigal of her treaſures, beyond the moſt ſanguine hope, ſo ſoon as ſhe is free, and cultivated by men of diſcernment, whom wiſe and invariable laws protect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:032696_0006_0FF4310D69A28DD8"/>A number of Frenchmen, forced from their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have on this coaſt found a new eſtabliſhment, and with it, ſecurity, property, and liberty, the only true encouragers of agriculture, the only principles of abundance. They have enriched this adopted mother by their induſtry; they have there founded conſiderable colonies, ſome of which bear the name of that unhappy country which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them the uſe of water and of fire, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of which however they ſtill fondly cheriſh.</p>
                  <p>The colony of Little Rochelle ſurpaſſes all the reſt, by the induſtry of the coloniſts, and the fertil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the lands which belong to it. The paſtures are there compoſed of a variety of graſſes, natives of the country, together with ſeveral different ſpecies of herbage, which compoſe our artificial meadows in Europe, ſuch as trefoil, lucern, and faintfoin. The exotic plants, the ſeeds of which have been imported by the Dutch, flouriſh there as the natural productions of the country. Thoſe ſeeds are ſown by an operation of the plough; they cut the graſs only the firſt year; the ſecond they open the meadows to cattle, which live there at diſcretion, without any other attention than that of collecting them together every evening into a park encloſed with ſtrong and high palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades, to ſecure them againſt the lions and tigers, with which this country abounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:032696_0006_0FF4310D69A28DD8"/>Some of theſe encloſures are watered only by the rains, although they generally endeavor to chuſe them in the neighborhood of ſome brook, where they dig commodious watering places. In all theſe paſturages, they have an eye to groves of trees, where the herds and flocks may find ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt the intenſe heat of the ſun; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in January, February and March, which in this part of the world are the moſt ſultry months in the year.</p>
                  <p>The arable land is here labored as in Europe, ſometimes by horſes, but oftener by oxen: the Dutch of this colony have by their induſtry cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the natural ſluggiſhneſs of theſe latter ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, by exerciſing them while young in a briſk pace; in conſequence of which I have ſeen, at the Cape, carriages, drawn by teams of ten or a dozen yoke of oxen, go as expeditiouſly as if drawn by horſes.</p>
                  <p>The grains commonly ſown at the Cape, are wheat, turkey corn, and rice; theſe generally produce an increaſe of fifty-fold. They culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a variety off different kinds of pulſe, ſuch as peaſe, common beans, and French beans. This pulſe makes a refreſhing proviſion to the ſhips touching at the Cape going or returning to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</p>
                  <p>A particular ſpecies of this pulſe is much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in India, to which they export a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity; it is there known by the name of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032696_0007_0FF4310EF2237AD0"/>
                     <hi>Cape-Peaſe:</hi> it is a kind of French bean which requires no prop; its grain is of the form of that bean, but larger and flatter; it taſtes like our green peas, and preſerves its freſhneſs for a long time. I have this year attempted the culture of this plant, which promiſes ſucceſs. The climate at the Cape ſeems to demand from the cultivator an attention which appears not ſo neceſſary in this country, and which would even perhaps be prejudicial to the productions of our lands.</p>
                  <p>The Cape however is expoſed the greateſt part of the year to violent hurricanes, which blow generally from the north-eaſt. Theſe winds are ſo impetuous that they would beat down the fruits from the trees, and ſweep to deſtruction the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of the farmer, had they not provided a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier for the ſecurity of the harveſt. The Dutch coloniſts have divided their lands into ſmall fields, which they have ſurrounded with high palliſades of oaks and other trees, planted very cloſe to one another, ſome what reſembling a charmille, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ornament of a garden. Theſe pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſades they cut every year, as they grow; their height being commonly from twenty-five to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feet; every ſeparate field, in conſequence, is encloſed like a chamber.</p>
                  <p>It is by this induſtry alone that the Dutch have rendered this colony not only the granary of all their ſettlements in the Eaſt-Indies, but the moſt commodious place for veſſels to touch at for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments and proviſions of all kinds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:032696_0007_0FF4310EF2237AD0"/>When the Dutch began to form their vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, they endeavored to procure plants from thoſe cantons which enjoyed the greateſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for their wines; but after many fruitleſs attempts to produce, at the extremity of Africa, the vines of Burgundy and Champagne, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to rearing the plants tranſported from Spain, the Canaries, and the Levant, where the climate is more analagous to the Cape. At preſent the plants which are cultivated moſt ſucceſsfully, are thoſe of the Muſcadel kind: the red Muſcadel particularly, which they rear in a ſmall diſtrict called Conſtance, produces moſt delicious wine; the Dutch Eaſt-India Company always ſecure this vintage, which they ſend in preſents to the ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigns of Europe.</p>
                  <p>The vines at the Cape are cultivated without vine-props; the method of labour is much the ſame with that in France. The vineyards are ſurrounded by a number of trees, upon which they entwine the ſlips of the great Spaniſh Muſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, in form of eſpaliers, very high, by which the vines are ſheltered from the violence of the winds.</p>
                  <p>The ſame attention, at the Cape, is paid to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening, as to the other branches of agriculture. You there find all the variety of European pulſe, greens, herbs, and roots, with the beſt of thoſe peculiar to other parts of the world.

Company have cauſed to lay out two or three gardens, extenſive and magnificent, which they ſupport with an expenſe worthy of a ſovereign company.</p>
                  <p>Fifteen or twenty European gardeners, whoſe abilities are approved before they are embarked, are employed in the cultivation of each of thoſe vaſt gardens, under the direction of a principal gardener, whoſe place is lucrative and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is in thoſe gardens, at the expenſe of the company, that all the experiments are made in every new ſpecies of culture; and it is there that every private individual is provided gratis, with ſuch plants and ſeeds as he may have occaſion for, together with the neceſſary inſtructions for their cultivation. Theſe gardens furniſh, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abundance, herbage and fruits of various kinds to the company's ſhips.</p>
                  <p>Travellers cannot but with pleaſure and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration obſerve large encloſures conſecrated to the ſtudy and improvement of Botany, in which the moſt rare and uſeful plants, from every quarter of the world, are arranged in the moſt excellent order: the curious have the additional ſatisfaction alſo of finding ſkilful gardeners, who take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in deſcribing and pointing out their virtues.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe beautiful gardens are terminated by large orchards, where are to be found all the fruits of Europe, together with ſeveral natives of Africa and Aſia. Nothing is more agreeable

                  <p>After doubling the Cape of Good Hope, you enter the Indian ſea, where you find the great Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and to Madagaſcar: we are ſtill unacquainted with many places of this iſland, though the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, Dutch, French, and other Europeans have had ſettlements, and frequented it, above two centuries. Thoſe parts which we know, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fertile, and the inhabitants would in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, cultivate them extremely well, were there a vent for their productions. They rear numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous herds of cattle and ſheep; their paſturages, ſuch as nature has formed them, are rich: in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cantons are large tracts of tilled ground, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with graſs of an extraordinary ſize, which grows to the height of five or ſix feet; the natives call it <hi>Fatak;</hi> it is excellent for nouriſhing and fattening their horned cattle, which are of the largeſt ſpecies, and differ in ſhape from ours, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by a large fleſhy protuberance on their neck.—Another graſs, of a finer blade, ſhoots ſpontaneouſly through the ſands on the ſea coaſt, which furniſhes food for the ſheep: theſe are of the ſame ſpecies with thoſe of Barbary, and differ from ours moſt remarkably, by the monſtrous ſize
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032696_0009_0FF4292DF5BC4190"/>
of their tails, which weigh in general from ſix to eight pounds.</p>
                  <p>The Madecaſſes or Malegaches (which is the name of the inhabitants of this iſland) cultivate ſcarce any other grain but rice: they ſow at the commencement of the rainy ſeaſon; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which they are not under the neceſſity of watering their fields. In laboring their ground, they uſe no other inſtrument but the pickaxe; they begin by grubbing up all the weeds; then five or ſix men, ranging themſelves in a line on the field, dig little holes as they paſs along, into which the women or children, who follow, throw the grains of the rice, and then with their feet cover them with earth: a field ſown in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner produces an increaſe of above eighty or a hundred fold, which proves rather the extreme fertility of the ſoil, than the goodneſs of the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation: badly underſtood as it may be, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the inhabitants of Madagaſcar live in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. In no country in the world, that I have ſeen, are rice and other eſſential proviſions cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in this iſland. For a remnant of coarſe blue cloth, which may be worth perhaps twenty pence, the Madecaſſe gives two or three meaſures of rice. Theſe meaſures are furniſhed by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, who never fail to enlarge them every year; yet the iſlanders do not complain. The meaſure is firſt of all heaped; the buyer then, in virtue of an eſtabliſhed right for ſecuring good meaſure, thruſts his arm to the elbow in the rice, and with one ſweep empties it almoſt entirely,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032696_0009_0FF4292DF5BC4190"/>
which the Madecaſſe has the patience a ſecond time to repleniſh, without a murmur. This mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is called a <hi>Gamelle,</hi> which, thus filled, will hold about 160 pounds of pure rice.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a doubt, but if our [the French] India Company, who alone are in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the trade with the natives of this iſland, would give proper encouragement to agriculture, it would in a ſhort time make a rapid progreſs.— Our iſlands of Bourbon and France would here always find a certain reſource againſt thoſe dearths which too frequently diſtreſs the latter of theſe iſlands. Our ſquadrons bound for India, who put into the Iſle of France for refreſhments, would there always find abundance of proviſions brought from Madagaſcar, and of conſequence would not be ſubjected to the neceſſity of loſing their time at the Cape, or at Batavia, begging refreſhments from the Dutch, whilſt the enemies of France, as happened in the late war, are conquering their ſettlements, and deſtroying their trade.</p>
                  <p>Wheat would grow in Madagaſcar in the ſame abundance as rice: it was formerly cultivated ſucceſsfully in the ſettlement which we then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed at the ſouthern point of the iſland, called Fort Dauphin. Even at this day fine ſtalks of wheat are ſtill to be found there, produced from the ſcattering grains of the ancient crops, which being blown about by the winds have annually, ſince our being drove from that ſettlement, ſown of themſelves, and ſprung up at random, amongſt

the native herbs of the country. The lands there are of inconceiveable fertility; the iſlanders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and ingenious. In thoſe diſtricts where the Arabs have not penetrated, the ſimple laws of nature are their guides; their manners the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the primitive ages. Theſe laws, and theſe manners, are more favorable for agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than all our ſublime ſpeculations, than all our moſt applauded theories on the moſt approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practice; than all thoſe ineffectual means now employed to re-animate an art, which our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners teach us to regard with contempt, or treat with levity; and which is perpetually harraſſed, perpetually oppreſſed by innumerable abuſes, which derive their ſource from the very laws themſelves.</p>

                  <p>Almoſt 200 leagues eaſt of Madagaſcar lie the two iſlands of Bourbon and France; the ſoil of which is naturally as fertile as that of Madagaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, whilſt they enjoy a happier climate. Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon has no port; it is of conſequence little fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by the ſhipping. The inhabitants have preſerved their ſimplicity of manners, and aggri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture is there in a flouriſhing ſtate. The iſland produces wheat, rice, and maize, not only for its own conſumption, but even furniſhes a ſmall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Iſle of France: the culture there is the ſame as at Madagaſcar. The horned cattle and ſheep, which they have imported from that iſland, thrive here extremely well, eſpecially as they have
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032696_0010_0FF431139E6A58B0"/>
alſo introduced the graſs called <hi>Fatak,</hi> which, as I have before obſerved, makes excellent paſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p>The lands of this iſland are principally employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the culture of the coffee-tree. The firſt plants of this ſhrubby tree were brought from Mocha. It multiplies by its grains ſowing ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly; little attention is required; nothing more is neceſſary than to grub up, three or four times during the firſt year, the neighboring weeds, which would otherwiſe rob it of its proper nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: the ſecond year it grows without care; its branches, which extend horizontally along the ſurface of the ground, by their ſhade ſtifle the growth of all ſuch weeds, as might ſhoot up within their circumference: at the end of eighteen months the coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, and in three years yields a plentiful crop. They plant theſe trees chequer-wiſe, at about the diſtance of ſeven feet from one another, and when they grow too tall, prune them to the height of perhaps two feet from the ground.</p>
                  <p>The coffee-tree demands a light ſoil: it thrives better in ſand almoſt pure, than in rich ground: they obſerve in the iſle of Bourbon, that theſe trees yield annually, one with another, about a pound of coffee: this fruit comes to perfection, and is gathered in during dry weather, which gives it a great advantage over the Weſt-india coffee, which never ripens nor is got-in but in the rainy ſeaſons. The coffee, after it is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <head>The Iſle of France.</head>
                  <p>This iſland poſſeſſes two excellent harbors, where all the ſhipping of the French Company, employed in the commerce of China and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, touch for refreſhments; here alſo rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous their armaments in times of war: this iſland is, of conſequence, not ſo ſolitary as Bourbon. The politics and manners of Europe have here more influence. The lands are as fertile as thoſe of Bourbon; rivulets, which are never dry, water it like a garden: notwithſtanding which, the harveſts often fail, and ſcarcity is here almoſt perpetually felt.</p>
                  <p>Since the days of the celebrated M. de la Bourdonnois (who governed this iſland for ten or twelve years, and ought to be regarded, as the founder of the colony, for his introduction and patronage of agriculture) they have wandered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly from project to project, attempting the culture of almoſt every ſpecies of plants, without properly proſecuting any one of them. The cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, the cotton, the indigo, the ſugar-cane, the pear, the cinnamon, the mulberry, the tea, and the cocoa trees, have all been cultivated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, but in ſuch a ſuperficial manner as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032696_0011_0FF4311524959DA8"/>
could never ſecure ſucceſs. Had they followed the ſimple plan of the founder, which was to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure bread, the iſland would at this day have been flouriſhing; abundance would then have reigned amongſt the coloniſts, and the ſhipping never been diſappointed of the neceſſary refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proviſions.</p>
                  <p>The cultivation of grain, nevertheleſs, though neglected and badly underſtood, is that which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the beſt. Thoſe lands, which are ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, yield annually a crop of wheat, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of rice or Turkey-corn, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of one fallow year, and without the leaſt improvement, or any other mode of labor, than that which is practiſed at Madagaſcar.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Maniac</hi> was firſt introduced into this iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and by M. de la Bourdonnois: the culture of this plant was at firſt attended with very great difficulty, but is now the principal reſource of the coloniſts for the nouriſhment of their ſlaves. As the culture of this root is here the ſame as in America, I ſhall not repeat what has been relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a number of travellers.</p>
                  <p>They formerly brought from Madagaſcar black cattle and ſheep; but ſince they have diſcovered that more advantage attends the tranſportation of ſlaves they have neglected the increaſe of their cattle, which the continual demands of the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and the wants of the inhabitants at the ſame time daily diminiſh: Beſides, they have never
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032696_0012_0FF431182B746B90"/>
hitherto formed any paſtures; ſuch as they have attempted having been laid out with ſo little ſkill, that they have not ſucceeded. The iſland produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces naturally, in different cantons, an excellent kind of graſs, which grows to the height of five or ſix feet. This graſs begins to appear above ground about the beginning of the rainy ſeaſon; it performs all its vegetation during the three months, which this ſeaſon laſts: the inhabitants take advantage of this to paſture their herds, who fatien upon it amazingly; but the vegetation over, there remains nothing on the ground but a ſtraw too hard to afford nouriſhment to the cattle; and ſoon after the fire, which is kindled here by a thouſand accidents, conſumes this ſtraw, and with it frequently part of the neighboring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts. During the remainder of the year, the herds wander about and languiſh amongſt the woods.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt fault which has been committed in this iſland, and which has proved moſt prejudicial to cultivation, is the method of clearing the woods from off the grounds by fire, without leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groves and thickets at proper diſtances. The rains, in this iſland, conduce moſt to the ameliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grounds; but the clouds being ſtopt by the foreſts, there the rains fall; whilſt the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lands are ſcarce watered by a ſingle drop: the fields, at the ſame time, being thus deprived of defence, are expoſed to the violence of the winds, which often entirely deſtroy the harveſts. The Dutch, as we have before obſerved, found no
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032696_0012_0FF431182B746B90"/>
trees at the Cape; but they have planted them there, as ſhelter for their habitations. The Iſle of France, on the contrary, was covered with woods, and the coloniſts have entirely deſtroyed them.</p>

                  <p>Agriculture has ever flouriſhed in the Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; it has, however, degenerated ſince the conqueſt of this country by the Moguls; who, like all barbarous nations, have deſpiſed that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry which nouriſhes mankind, to attach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that deſtructive art which deſolates the earth.</p>
                  <p>The conquerors, when they took poſſeſſion of the country, appropriated to themſelves at the ſame time all the lands. The Mogul emperors divided them into great moveable fiefs, which they diſtributed amongſt their grandees; theſe farmed them out to their vaſſals; and thoſe again to others; ſo that the lands are now no longer cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated but by the ſervants and day-labourers of the ſub-farmers.</p>
                  <p>As no country in the world is more expoſed to revolution than the Indies, ſubjected to maſters whoſe government is an abſolute anarchy, the poſſeſſor of the fief, as well as the farmer, for ever uncertain of their fate, endeavor to make the moſt of the lands and their cultivators, without ever beſtowing a thought on improvement. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032696_0013_0FF43119B74EA930"/>
for theſe barbarian conquerors, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered natives, inviolably attached to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manners, apply themſelves inceſſantly to agriculture, from inclination, and from religion. Notwithſtanding the frantic deſpotiſm of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul government, the Malabar,<note n="*" place="bottom">The French give the name of Malabar not only to the ancient inhabitants of the Malabar coaſt, but in general to the Aborigines of the great peninſula of Indoſtan.</note> deſpiſing and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the maſter whom he obeys, cultivates, with the ſame ardor as if he was proprietor, the fields of his anceſtors, the care of which is confided to him by the uſurper.</p>
                  <p>The laborers are a tribe much honored among the Indians. Religion has conſecrated agriculture, even to the animals deſtined for the labor of the ground. As the Indians in general are deficient in paſtures, as horſes are ſcarce, as buffaloes and other cattle for the draught multiply but ſlowly, the ancient Indian policy made it a crime againſt their religion to kill theſe uſeful animals. The Malabars make them more ſerviceable than any other people: they employed them, as we do, in laboring the ground; as alſo in drawing their carriages, and in carrying every kind of load: there are no other beaſts of burden in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of Pondicherry. I am convinced that in every country they might be rendered equally uſeful.</p>
                  <p>The ſoil on the Coromandel coaſt is light, dry, and ſandy; the induſtry and labor, however, of

the natives make it produce two crops every year, without the neceſſity of one fallow ſeaſon. After the rice harveſt is over, there is always a crop of ſome ſmaller grains, ſuch as millet and a ſpecies of French beans, of which India produces a variety of different kinds.</p>
                  <p>The moſt remarkable proceſs of Indian huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, is the watering their grounds for the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of rice.</p>

                     <p>If the grounds they propoſe watering, have neither rivulet nor fountain ſufficiently abundant, they dig a pit-well, on the brink of which they raiſe a pillar of near the ſame height as the depth of the well. At the ſummit of this pillar, which is forked, is an iron bar, which croſſing both divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions horizontally, ſupports a kind of ſee-ſaw, to one end of which a ladder is ſuſpended; the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end of this ſee-ſaw, projects from the top of the pillar about three feet, having a long pole faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to it in a poſition parallel with the pillar, at which hangs a large bucket of wood or copper: by the ſide of this machine is a large reſervoir, built with bricks and cloſely cemented, elevated above the level of the grounds they propoſe to water; the opening whence the waters are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged being on that ſide which fronts the field.

As ſoon as the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir is full, they open a kind of ſluice; the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation begins, and is kept conſtantly flowing by the operations of theſe two men, who ſometimes are thus employed whole days, the one aſcending and deſcending, the other throwing the bucket in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the well, and emptying it when full.</p>

                     <p>Gardening is but little known on the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel coaſt. The orchards are better ſupplied than the gardens; yet they have no fruits that can be compared to thoſe of Europe. They do not underſtand the art of engrafting. Their moſt common fruits are the pine-apple, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the bonana, and the gouyave. The two firſt of theſe fruits are but indifferent on the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel coaſt, though excellent on the Malabar coaſt, and ſeveral other parts of India.</p>

                     <p>The moſt uſeful of all the trees in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards is undoubtedly the cocoa-tree. This tree bears cluſters of nuts of an immenſe ſize. When theſe nuts are ripe, they yield a ſpecies of oil in great abundance, which the Indians uſe for vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes, particularly in ſeaſoning their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtuff: the taſte of this oil, however, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſagreeable to thoſe who are not accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to eat it. But the method of rendering the culture of this tree moſt advantageous, is the extracting wine from its fruit. The Indian watches the time when the nuts of the cocoa-tree have attained to the ſize of our ordinary nuts which happens ſoon after the fall of the flower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he then makes an inciſion in the ſtalk of the cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about ſeven or eight inches from the trunk o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel fills in twenty-four hours: the Indian takes care to change it every day. This natural wine, which is called <hi>Soury,</hi> is ſold and drunk in this ſtate.

                     <p>A cocoa-tree, thus managed, is worth a pagoda (about eight ſhillings) per annum.

                  <head>The Kingdom of Siam.</head>
                  <p>The kingdom of Siam, ſituate on the peninſula of the Indies beyond the Ganges, is in general extremely fertile. Divided, like Indoſtan, by a chain of mountains from north to ſouth, it enjoys all the year round, and at the ſame time, two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oppoſite ſeaſons. The weſtern diviſion, all along the bay of Bengal, is deluged by continual rains, during the ſix months that the monſoons continue to blow from the weſt. This ſeaſon is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032696_0016_0FF4312349BEA4E8"/>
conſidered as their winter on this coaſt; whilſt in the other diviſion of the kingdom, towards the eaſt, they enjoy the fineſt climate, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that difference of ſeaſon, which reigns on the weſtern ſide, except by the overflowing of the Menam. This noble river runs along a great way among mountains, where the rains concenter: it waſhes the walls of the capital, and annually overflows, without the leaſt ravage, a delightful country, covered all over with rice plantations. The ſlime, which the Menam leaves behind, enriches the ſoil prodigiouſly; the rice ſeems to grow up in proportion as the inundation riſes, and the river at length gently retires by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into its bed, as the rice approaches to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and has no further occaſion for its waters. How bountiful has nature been to thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit this charming country!—ſhe has, however, done more: the fields produce, in profuſion, an infinite variety of moſt delicate fruits, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire almoſt no cultivation; ſuch as the pine-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the mangouſtas (the moſt delicate fruit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the world) mangoes of different kinds, and all excellent, ſeveral ſpecies of oranges, the banana, the ducion, the gacca, with other fruits of an inferior quality. Nature, ſtill more bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, has alſo ſcattered over this country, almoſt on the ſurface of the ground, mines of gold, cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and a ſpecies of fine tin, which there, as in other parts of India, they name <hi>Calin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this terreſtial paradiſe, ſurrounded with ſo much riches, who would imagine that the Siam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032696_0017_0FF43126987E8200"/>
are, perhaps, the moſt wretched people in the world?</p>
                  <p>The government of Siam is deſpotic: the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign alone enjoys that liberty which is natural to all mankind: his ſubjects are all his ſlaves; every one of them is annually taxed at ſix months perſonal ſervice without wages, and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out food: he allows them the other ſix months to procure themſelves wherewithal to exiſt the year. Under ſuch a government, there is no law that can afford protection to individuals againſt violence, or in the ſmalleſt degree ſecure them in their property. Every thing is ſubjected to the caprice of a prince, rendered brutal by every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of exceſs, particularly that of power; who paſſes his days locked up in his ſeraglio, without an idea of any thing beyond the walls of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; and particularly ignorant of the wretched condition of his ſubjects. Theſe are expoſed to the avarice of the grandees, who themſelves are only the chief ſlaves, and tremblingly approach, on appointed days, the preſence of their tyrant, whom they adore like a divinity, though ſubject to the moſt dangerous caprices.</p>
                  <p>Religion alone has preſerved the power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting againſt tyranny thoſe who, ranging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under its ſtandard, are admitted into the order of the prieſts of <hi>Somonacondom,</hi> the deity of the Siameſe. Thoſe who embrace this order, and their number is conſiderable, are by law obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve the ſtricteſt celibacy, which in a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032696_0017_0FF43126987E8200"/>
warm climate, ſuch as that of Siam, whilſt it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions great diſorders, almoſt depopulates the country.</p>
                  <p>It may eaſily be conceived, that under ſuch a government agriculture cannot flouriſh; it may be ſaid, even, that no regard is paid to it at all, when the ſmall portion of ground which is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored, is compared to the immenſe extent of lands which are totally neglected.</p>
                  <p>With regard even to thoſe grounds which they have laid out, nature may be ſaid to do every thing. Men oppreſſed, debaſed, without ſpirit, nay, in a manner without hands, give themſelves ſcarce any other trouble than juſt to reap what the earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces; and, as the country is extenſive, and thinly peopled, they enjoy abundance of neceſſaries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without labor.</p>
                  <p>From the port of Mergin, ſituated on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern coaſt of this kingdom, to the capital, during a journey of ten or twelve days, you croſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe plains, charmingly watered, and the ſoil excellent; ſome of which appear to have been formerly tilled, but now lie quite uncultivated. This journey travellers are under the neceſſity of making in caravans, in order to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the tygers and the elephants, to which this fine country is in a manner entirely abandoned, during a journey of eight days there ſcarce being the veſtige of a habitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:032696_0018_0FF4312823403B20"/>The environs of the capital are cultivated; the lands belonging to the king, thoſe of the princeſs, the miniſters, and principal officers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the amazing fertility of the country, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I have been aſſured, an increaſe of two hundred fold.</p>
                  <p>The Siameſe method of cultivating their rice, is firſt to ſow it very thick in a ſmall ſquare plot of ground, well watered, a little below the ſurface of the earth. As ſoon as the plants have grown about five or ſix inches high, they pull them up by the roots, and tranſplant them, in ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of three or four ſtalks, diſtant from each other about four inches every way. Theſe plants are placed deep in a clay ſoil, which has been previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly well labored with a plough, drawn by two buffaloes. The rice tranſplanted in this manner, has beyond compariſon a much greater increaſe, than if allowed to grow up in the ſame ground where it was originally planted.</p>
                  <p>It is the Chineſe, and the Cochin-chineſe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the capital and its neighborhood, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute moſt to the improvement of the grounds. Theſe ſtrangers are uſeful to the ſovereign, by the commerce they carry on with him, and it is the intereſt of the government to protect them from oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the neighborhood of the uncultivated lands I have mentioned, you find others, belonging to different individuals, who, diſcouraged by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032696_0018_0FF4312823403B20"/>
oppreſſions, have quite abandoned them. It is aſtoniſhing, however, to obſerve theſe lands, frequently neither labored nor ſown for years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, produce extraordinary crops of rice. The grain, reaped negligently, ſows of itſelf, and re-produces annually another harveſt, by the help of the inundations of the river Menam; which proves, at the ſame time, the extreme fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the ground, and the extreme miſery of the inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>The orchards of the prince, and the great Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apoins <note n="*" place="bottom">A religious order.</note> are admirable for the variety of their fruits, all of the moſt exquiſite kind; but theſe delicacies no private individual is allowed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. When a man is ſo unhappy as to have in his grounds a tree of excellent fruit, ſuch as the mangouſtas, a party of ſoldiers never fail to come every year, to ſecure, for the king, or ſome great miniſter, the produce of this tree. They take an account of every mangouſta, good or bad, making the proprietor guardian and ſecurity for the whole; and when the fruits ripen, ſhould there happen the ſmalleſt deficiency the poor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor is ſubjected to all the inſolence of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained power; it becomes of conſequence, a real misfortune for a private man to be poſſeſſed of ſuch a tree.</p>
                  <p>The Siameſe rear herds of buffaloes, and horned cattle; but all the care they take of them, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

them in the day time, to the fallow grounds, which abound in paſtures, and re-conduct them, in the evening, to the encloſures, in order to ſecure them from the tygers, of which there are great numbers in this country. The milk, and a very little labor, is all the advantage they draw from them. Their religion, which is the ſame that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in Indoſtan, and which the Talap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They elude, however, this law, by ſelling them to the Mahometans, ſettled among them, who kill them, and ſell their fleſh private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They have alſo great numbers of poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, particularly ducks of the beſt kinds in the Indies.</p>
                  <p>The king maintains a number of tame ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. Each of theſe monſtrous animals has twelve or fifteen men daily employed in cutting herbs, bananiers (a kind of large roſe) and ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes. They are after all of no real uſe; they ſerve only for ſhew. They diſplay, ſay the Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe, the grandeur of their prince; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an idea of his greatneſs, more from the number of his elephants, than from the number of his ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Theſe animals, wherever they come, make moſt deſtructive havock; of this their keepers take advantage, making every individual, who is poſſeſſed of cultivated lands, or gardens, pay an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually a certain tribute: ſhould they refuſe, the elephants would immediately be let looſe, and

                  <p>Beyond the kingdom of Siam is the peninſula of Malacca; a country formerly well peopled, and, conſequently, well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greateſt powers, and made a very conſiderable figure on the theatre of Aſia. The ſea was covered with their ſhips, and they carried on a moſt extenſive commerce. Their laws, however, were apparently very different from thoſe which ſubſiſt among them at preſent. From time to time they ſent out numbers of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which, one after another, peopled the iſlands of Sumatra, Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The inhabitants of all theſe iſlands, thoſe at leaſt upon the coaſts, are the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they ſpeak almoſt the ſame language, have the ſame laws, the ſame manners.—Is it not ſomewhat ſingular, that this nation, whoſe poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſo extenſive, ſhould ſcarce be known in Europe?—I ſhall endeavor to give you an idea of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032696_0020_0FF4312CED4B65E0"/>
thoſe laws, and thoſe manners; you will, from thence, eaſily judge of their agriculture.</p>
                  <p>Travellers, who make obſervations on the Malais, are aſtoniſhed to find, in the centre of Aſia, under the ſcorching climate of the line, the laws, the manners, the cuſtoms, and the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ancient inhabitants of the north of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The Malais are governed by feudal laws, that capricious ſyſtem, conceived for the defence of the liberty of a few againſt the tyranny of one, whilſt the multitude is ſubjected to ſlavery and oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>A chief who has the title of king, or ſultan, iſſues his commands to his great vaſſals, who obey when they think proper. Theſe have inferior vaſſals, who often act in the ſame manner with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them. A ſmall part of the nation live independent, under the title of <hi>Oramoai,</hi> or <hi>noble,</hi> and ſell their ſervices to thoſe who pay them beſt; whilſt the body of the nation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſlaves, and live in perpetual ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>With theſe laws the Malais are reſtleſs, fond of navigation, war, plunder, emigrations, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, deſperate enterpriſes, adventures, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry. They talk inceſſantly of their honor, and their bravery, whilſt they are univerſally conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, by thoſe with whom they have intercourſe, as the moſt treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe; and yet, which appeared to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032696_0020_0FF4312CED4B65E0"/>
me extremely ſingular, they ſpeak the ſofteſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Aſia. That which the Count de Forbin has ſaid, in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the Macaſſars, is exactly true, and is the reigning characteriſtic of the whole Malay nations. More attached to the abſurd laws of their pretended honor, than to thoſe of juſtice or humanity, you always obſerve, that amongſt them, the ſtrong oppreſs and deſtroy the weak: their treaties of peace and friendſhip never ſubſiſting beyond that ſelf-intereſt which induced them to make them, they are almoſt always armed, and either at war amongſt themſelves, or employed in pillaging their neighbors.</p>
                  <p>This ferocity, which the Malais qualify under the name of courage, is ſo well known to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean companies, who have ſettlements in the Indies, that they have univerſally agreed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the captains of their ſhips, who may put into the Maley Iſlands, from taking on board any ſeamen, of that nation, except in the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and then, on no account, to exceed two or three.</p>
                  <p>It is nothing uncommon for a handful of theſe horrid ſavages ſuddenly to embark, attack a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel by ſurpriſe, poignard, in hand, maſſacre the people, and make themſelves maſters of her. Malay batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty men, have been known to board European ſhips of thirty or forty guns, in order to take poſſeſſion of them, and murder with their poignards great
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032696_0021_0FF429350BAF0EF0"/>
part of the crew. The Malay hiſtory is full of ſuch enterpriſes, which mark the deſperate fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of theſe barbarians.</p>
                  <p>The Malais, who are not ſlaves, go always armed: they would think themſelves diſgraced, if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <hi>Crit.</hi> The induſtry of this nation even ſurpaſſes itſelf, in the fabric of this deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive weapon.</p>
                  <p>As their lives are a perpetual round of agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tumult, they could never endure the long flowing habits, which prevail amongſt the other Aſiatics. The habits of the Malais are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly adapted to their ſhapes, and loaded with a multitude of buttons, which faſten them cloſe to their bodies in every part.—I relate theſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly trifling obſervations, in order to prove, that, in climates the moſt oppoſite, the ſame laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſimilar manners, cuſtoms, and prejudices. Their effect is the ſame too with reſpect to agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture.</p>
                  <p>The lands poſſeſſed by the Malais are, in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, of a ſuperior quality. Nature ſeems to have taken pleaſure in there aſſembling her moſt favorite productions. They have not only thoſe to be found in the territories of Siam, but a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of others peculiar to theſe iſlands. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is covered with odoriferous woods, ſuch as the eagle or aloes wood, the ſandal, and the caſſia odorata, a ſpecies of cinnamon. You there breathe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032696_0021_0FF429350BAF0EF0"/>
an air impregnated with the odours of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flowers of the greateſt fragrance, of which there is a perpetual ſucceſſion the year round, the ſweet flavour of which captivates the ſoul, and inſpires the moſt voluptuous ſenſations. No traveller, wandering over the plains of Malacca, but feels himſelf ſtrongly impelled to wiſh his reſidence fixed in a place ſo luxuriant in allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where nature triumphs without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of art.</p>
                  <p>The Malay iſlands produce various kinds of dying woods, particularly the <hi>Sapan,</hi> which is the ſame with the Braſil wood. There are alſo a number of gold mines, which the inhabitants of Sumatra and Mallaca call <hi>Ophirs:</hi> ſome of which, thoſe eſpecially on the eaſtern coaſt, are richer than thoſe of Braſil or Peru. There are likewiſe mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the inhabitants name <hi>Tombage.</hi> In the iſlands of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra and Banea are mines of calin, or fine tin; and at Succadana, in the iſland of Borneo, is a mine of diamonds. Thoſe iſlands enjoy alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, the rotin, the ſagou, (or bread-palm-tree) the camphre, and other precious aromatics, which we know under the names of various ſpice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>The ſea too teems with abundance of excellent fiſh, together with ambergris, pearls, and thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate birds neſts (ſo much in requeſt in China) formed in the rocks with the ſpawn of fiſhes, and the foam of the ſea, by a ſpecies of ſmall ſized

                  <p>In the midſt of all this luxuriance of nature, the Malay is miſerable. The culture of the lands, abandoned to ſlaves, is fallen into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.

                     <p>The ſagou-tree, in part, ſupplies the defect of grain. This admirable tree is a preſent which bountiful nature has made to men incapable of labor. It requires no culture; it is a ſpecies of the palm-tree, which grows naturally, in the woods, to the height of about twenty or thirty feet; its circumference being ſometimes from five to ſix. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickneſs, and covers a multitude of long fibres, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interwoven one with another, envelope a maſs of gummy kind of meal. As ſoon as this tree is ripe, a whitiſh duſt, which tranſpires thro' the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their extremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032696_0022_0FF4312E71CB9AB8"/>
down near the root, divide them into ſeveral ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they ſplit into quarters: they then ſcoop out the maſs of mealy ſubſtance, which is enveloped by and adheres to the fibres; they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute it in pure water, and then paſs it through a ſtraining bag of fine cloth, in order to ſeparate it from the fibres. When this paſte has loſt part of its moiſture by evaporation, the Malais throw it into a kind of earthen veſſels, of different ſhapes, where they allow it to dry and harden. This paſte is wholeſome, nouriſhing food, and preſerves for many years.</p>
                     <p>The Indians, in general, when they eat the ſagou, uſe no other preparation than diluting it in water; but ſometimes they dreſs it after differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manners: they have the art of ſeparating the fineſt of the flour, and reducing it to little grains, ſomewhat reſembling grains of rice. The ſagou, thus prepared, is preferred to the other, for the aged and infirm; and is an excellent remedy for many complaints in the ſtomach. When diluted either in cold or boiling water it forms a whitiſh jelly, very agreeable to the taſte.</p>
                     <p>Though this ſagou-bearing-palm grows natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the foreſts, the Malay chiefs have formed conſiderable plantations of it, which conſtitute one of their principal reſources for ſubſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>They might have the fineſt orchards in the world, would they give themſelves the trouble to collect the various plants of thoſe excellent fruits
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032696_0023_0FF429378AB58BF0"/>
which nature has ſo liberally beſtowed upon them: we find, however, none but a few ſtraggling trees planted at random around their houſes, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over their lands without ſymmetry or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the great iſland of Java have ſomewhat better ideas of agriculture, than the other Malais, ſince their ſubjection to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dutch. Theſe ſovereign merchants have taken advantage of the feudal ſyſtem of the Malais, to reduce them under their yoke; art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully weakening the regal power, by fomenting, at times, the rebellions of the great vaſſals; and humbling the vaſſals, in their turn, by ſuccoring their princes, when drove to the brink of ruin.</p>
                     <p>The Javaneſe begin to recover from that ſtate of anarchy, the conſequence of their ancient laws now almoſt no longer remembered. They cultivate with ſucceſs, rice, coffee, indigo, and ſugar-cane. They rear, on the eaſtern coaſt of the iſland, and in the diſtricts of Madur and Solor, in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, numerous herds of buffaloes, of a monſtrous ſize: their fleſh is excellent, and they are of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite uſe in laboring the ground. They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe numbers of horned cattle, the largeſt and fineſt, perhaps, in the world. The common paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turage in this, and the reſt of the Malay iſlands, is the ſame graſs I have mentioned under the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Iſle of France, which the coloniſts there almoſt entirely neglect.</p>

                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:032696_0023_0FF429378AB58BF0"/>Here it would be proper to deſcribe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cultivating the ſpiceries, the indigo, the ſugar-cane and the camphre; but theſe muſt be the ſubject of another diſcourſe.

               <head>PART SECOND.</head>
               <p>I LAST year began to give you a ſketch of my inquiries into the ſtate of agriculture among different nations of Africa and Aſia. I obſerved that ſcarce a veſtige of it could be traced amongſt the ſtupid, the indolent negroes, who inhabit the weſtern coaſts of Africa; whilſt it flouriſhed, under the ſhade of liberty, amongſt the Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the Cape of Good-Hope. I pointed out the happy abundance which reigned in the fertile iſland of Madagaſcar, inhabited by a people gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by the greateſt ſimplicity of manners, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with other laws than thoſe of nature. Whilſt I did juſtice alſo to the ſyſtem of cultivation that prevailed at the Iſle of Bourbon, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, and of conſequence little or no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Europe, the coloniſts have preſerved an uncorrupted ſyſtem of manners, ever favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for agriculture, I was, at the ſame time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of acknowledging, that this art which requires perſeverance and ſimplicity, was greatly neglected at the Iſle of France, which, having two excellent ports, and being much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by European ſhips, was more influenced by the inconſtant and volatile manners of our quarter of the world; and that, in conſequence, though the ſoil, in point of fertility, was equal to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032696_0024_0FF4312FF6E256B8"/>
Madagaſcar and Bourbon, their harveſts general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly failed, and an almoſt perpetual ſcarcity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over the iſland.—I paſſed from thence to the great peninſula of the Indies, where agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, however oppreſſed by the barbarous laws of the Mogul conquerors, is ſtill honored and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the religion, the manners, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of the conquered Malabars.—At Siam, under the happieſt climate, and bleſſed with a ſoil inferior in fertility to no country in the world, agriculture we have obſerved debaſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities of tyranny, and abandoned by a race of ſlaves, whom nothing can intereſt, after the loſs of liberty.—I have repreſented it almoſt in the ſame condition amongſt the Malais, who inhabit immenſe dominions, and innumerable iſlands, where nature has diſtributed her choiceſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and laviſhed her bounties with a profuſion unknown to other regions. The deſtructive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the feudal laws, which keep this people in a perpetual ferment, permits not their application to the culture of the fineſt ſoil in the world. Nature alone does all. I am convinced that if the other nations of the earth, who have the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be governed by the feudal ſyſtem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited a climate equally happy, and lands equally fertile with thoſe of the Malais, their agriculture would be equally neglected: neceſſity alone could force the plough into their hands.</p>
               <p>In my laſt diſcourſe I endeavored to give you an idea of the moſt intereſting modes of local agriculture which came under my obſervation:
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032696_0025_0FF4313573914B40"/>
my principal object, however, was to enable you to remark that in every country, in every quarter of the world, the ſtate of agriculture depends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the eſtabliſhed laws, and, conſequently, on the manners, cuſtoms, and prejudices from which theſe laws derived their origin. I now proceed.</p>
               <div type="place">
                  <head>THE POWER OF AGRICULTURE.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Origin of the Kingdom of Ponthiamas.</head>
                  <p>Departing from the peninſula of Malacca, and the iſlands of the Malais, towards the north, I fell in with a ſmall territory called <hi>Cancar,</hi> but known on the marine charts, under the name of <hi>Ponthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amas.</hi> Surrounded by the kingdom of Siam, where deſpotiſm and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of Camboya, where no idea of eſtabliſhed government ſubſiſts; and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the Malais, whoſe genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad: this charming coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated, and almoſt deſtitute of inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>A Chineſe merchant, commander of a veſſel which he employed in commerce, frequented theſe coaſts. Being a man of that intelligent reflective genius, which ſo characteriſtically marks his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he could not, without pain, behold immenſe tracts of ground condemned to ſterility, though naturally more fertile than thoſe which formed the riches of his own country; he formed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032696_0025_0FF4313573914B40"/>
a plan for their improvement. With this view, having firſt of all hired a number of labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſome Chineſe, others from the neighboring nations, he, with great addreſs, inſinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the favor of the moſt powerful princes, who, for a certain ſubſidy, aſſigned him a guard for his protection.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of his voyage to Batavia, and the Phillippine Iſlands, he borrowed from the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans their moſt uſeful diſcoveries and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, particularly the art of fortification and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: with regard to internal police, he gave the preference to the Chineſe. The profits of his commerce ſoon enabled him to raiſe ramparts, ſink ditches, and provide artillery. Theſe preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary precautions ſecured him from a coup de main, and protected him from the enterpriſes of the ſurrounding nations of barbarians.</p>
                  <p>He diſtributed the lands to his laborers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt reſervation of any of thoſe duties or taxes known by the names of ſervice or fines of alienation; duties which, by allowing no real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, become the moſt fatal ſcourge to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is an idea which revolts againſt the common ſenſe of every wiſe nation. He provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his coloniſts, at the ſame time, with all ſorts of inſtruments proper for the labor and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their grounds.</p>
                  <p>In forming a laboring and commercial people, he thought, that no laws ought to be framed, but
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032696_0026_0FF43136F88E93A0"/>
thoſe which nature has eſtabliſhed for the human race in every climate: he made theſe laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by obeying them firſt himſelf, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting an example of ſimplicity, induſtry, frugal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, humanity, and good faith:—he formed, then, no ſyſtem of laws—he did more—he eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed morals.</p>
                  <p>His territories ſoon became the country of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry induſtrious man, who wiſhed to ſettle there. His port was open to all nations. The woods were cleared; the grounds judiciouſly labored, and ſown with rice; canals, cut from the rivers, watered their fields; and plentiful harveſts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupplying them with ſubſiſtence, furniſhed an object of extenſive commerce.</p>
                  <p>The barbarians of the neighborhood, amazed to ſee abundance ſo ſuddenly ſucceed to ſterility, flocked for ſubſiſtence to the magazines of Ponthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amas; whoſe dominions, at this day, are conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as the moſt plentiful granary of that eaſtern part of Aſia; the Malais, the Cochin-chineſe, the Siameſe, whoſe countries are naturally ſo fertile, conſidering this little territory as the moſt certain reſource againſt famine.</p>
                  <p>Had the Chineſe founder of this colony of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile laborers, in imitation of the ſovereigns of Aſia, eſtabliſhed arbitrary impoſts; if by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of a feudal ſyſtem, of which he had examples amongſt the neighboring nations, he had veſted in himſelf the ſole property of the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032696_0026_0FF43136F88E93A0"/>
lands, under the ſpecious pretence of giving them away to his coloniſts; if he had made luxury reign in his palace, in place of that ſimplicity which diſtinguiſhed his humble dwelling; had he placed his ambition in a brilliant court, and crowds of fawning ſlaves; had he preferred the agreeable to the uſeful arts, deſpiſing the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious who labor the ground with the ſweat of their brow, and provide ſuſtenance for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their fellow creatures; had he treated his aſſociates as ſlaves; had he received into his port ſtrangers in any other ſhape than as friends; his fields had ſtill been barren, his dominions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled; and the wretched inhabitants muſt have died of hunger, notwithſtanding all their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of agriculture, and all the aſſiſtance they could derive from the moſt uſeful inſtruments either for tilling or ſowing their grounds. But the ſage Kiang-tſe, (the name of this judicious Chineſe) perſuaded that he ſhould always be rich, if his laborers were ſo, eſtabliſhed only a very moderate duty on all the merchandiſe entered at his port; the produce of his lands appearing to him ſufficient to render him powerful and great. His integrity, his moderation, and his humanity, made him reſpected. He never wiſhed to reign; but only to eſtabliſh the empire of reaſon. His ſon, who now fills his place, inherits his virtues as well as his poſſeſſions: by agriculture, and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands, he has become ſo powerful, that the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians his neighbors, ſtile him king, a title which he deſpiſes. He pretends to no right of ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032696_0027_0FF4293A52F4B8E0"/>
but the nobleſt of all, that of doing good; happy in being the firſt laborer, and the firſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of his country, he merits, as well as his father, a title more glorious than that of king— <hi>the friend of mankind.</hi>

                  <p>To the northward of Ponthiamas we find the countries of Camboya and Tſiampa. They are naturally fertile, (Camboya in particular) and appear in former times, to have been well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; but the government of theſe two little ſtates, having no ſettled form, the inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perpetually employed in deſtroying tyrants, only to receive others in their place, have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the culture of their grounds. Their fields, which might be covered with rice, with herds, and with flocks, are deſerts; and the natives are reduced to feed on a few wretched roots, which they gather from amidſt the brambles, which overſpread their lands.</p>
                  <p>Travellers are ſurpriſed to find, at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the wretched canton of Camboya, the ruins of an old city, built with ſtone, the architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                  <p>The Cochin-chineſe, who border on Camboya to the north, obſerving the lands of this kingdom deſolate and abandoned, ſome years ago took poſſeſſion of ſuch tracks as were moſt conveneient, and have there introduced an excellent culture.

They then applied themſelves entirely to the cultivation of rice, which, being the ordinary food of the inhabitants of Aſia, is to them an object of the greateſt importance.

                  <p>The fertility of the ſoil, which had lain long uncultivated, ſoon recompenſed their labors by abundance; population increaſed in proportion to the culture; and their cantons extended in ſuch a manner, that all the plains of this vaſt country being put into a ſtate of improvement, they were tempted to make encroachments on thoſe of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boya, which were in a manner totally abandoned.

                     <head>Culture of different Kinds of Rice in Cochin-China.</head>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineſe cultivate ſix different kinds of rice: the <hi>Little Rice,</hi> the grain of which is ſmall, oblong and tranſparent; this is by far the moſt delicate; it is generally adminiſtered to the ſick: the <hi>Great Long Rice</hi> is that whoſe form is round: the <hi>Red Rice,</hi> ſo called becauſe the grain is enveloped in a huſk of a reddiſh color, which adheres ſo cloſely, that it requires a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon operation to ſeparate it. Theſe three kinds are produced in the greateſt abundance, and form the principal ſubſiſtence of the natives. They require water, it being neceſſary to overflow the grounds where they are cultivated.</p>
                     <p>They raiſe alſo two other ſorts of dry rice, which grow in dry ſoils, and like our wheat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no other watering but what they receive from the clouds. One of theſe ſpecies of rice has a grain as white as ſnow; when dreſſed it is of a ſlimy viſcous ſubſtance; they make of it different kinds of paſte, ſuch as vermicelli. Both theſe kinds form a conſiderable article in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to China. They cultivate them only on the mountains and riſing grounds, which they labor with the ſpade. They ſow theſe grains as we do wheat, about the end of December or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of January, when the rainy ſeaſon ends: they are not above three months in the ground and yield a plentiful crop.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:032696_0029_0FF4313D09D2A218"/>I am induced to believe, that the culture of this valuable grain would ſucceed extremely well in France. In the years 1749 and 1750, I often travelled over the mountains of Cochin-china, where this rice is cultivated; they are very high and the temperature of the air cold; in the month of January, 1750, I obſerved that the rice was very green, and above three inches high, altho' the liquor in Reaumur's thermometer was only about four degrees above the freezing point.</p>
                     <p>I carried ſome quintals of this grain to the Iſle of France, where it was ſown with ſucceſs, and produced a greater crop than any other ſpecies. The coloniſts received my preſent with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eagerneſs, as, excluſive of its ſuperior increaſe, it has a finer taſte, is attended with leſs trouble, there being no neceſſity for overflowing the fields; and, as it ripens fifteen or twenty days ſooner than the other kinds, it can be reaped and ſecured before the hurricane ſeaſon, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes dreadful havock with their latter harveſts. The other kinds of rice, being of a ſlower growth, require their grounds to be laid under water, after the manner of the natives of the Coromandel coaſt; but our coloniſts pay ſo little attention to agriculture, that they have never hitherto introduced it.</p>
                     <p>One might have imagined, that the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges flowing from the cultivation of dry rice, would have engaged the coloniſts to attend to it with the greateſt care; and that, from the Iſle of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032696_0029_0FF4313D09D2A218"/>
France, it might have been with eaſe introduced into Europe: but I have in vain endeavored to procure it from this iſland; thoſe to whom I have applied, have ſent me only common rice, which demands water and warmth. The culture of dry rice has, like every other ſpecies of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, been abandoned to the unexperienced igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſlaves, who have mixed all the different kinds together, in ſuch a manner, that the rice of Cochin-china being ripe long before the others, the grains have dropt from the ears before they were reaped, and the ſpecies, in this manner, has been by degrees, entirely loſt in that iſland. Would any traveller, whom buſineſs or curioſity might lead to Cochin-china, ſend over but a few pounds of this excellent grain, he would deſerve our warmeſt acknowledgments.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineſe cultivate the common rice nearly in the ſame manner with the Malabars on the Coromandel coaſt.—After having twice ploughed their ground, they ſow the rice in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle field which has been well labored with the ſpade; the ſurface of this little field they juſt cover with water, to the height only of a few lines; and as ſoon as the rice is about five or ſix inches high, they harrow over their large fields, and overflow them with water; then pulling up the rice-plants in the ſeed-plots, tranſplant them into theſe grounds, thus prepared, in ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of four or five ſtalks, about the diſtance of ſix inches the one from the other. Women and children are generally employed in this work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:032696_0030_0FF4293E08626C60"/>The Cochin-chineſe have no machine for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing their grounds, nor have they any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: their plains, from one end of the kingdom to the other, are commanded by a chain of high mountains, plentifully ſupplied with ſprings and rivulets, which naturally overflow the grounds, according as their courſe is directed.</p>
                     <p>They cultivate likewiſe different kinds of grain, ſuch as the mahis millets of different ſorts, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpecies of the French bean, potatoes, yams, and a variety of roots proper for the ſubſiſtence of men and animals. But the culture of moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant advantage to them, next to the rice, is the ſugar-cane; and no country in Aſia produces it in greater abundance than Cochin-china.</p>

                     <head>Sugar-Canes.</head>
                     <p>The ſugar-canes of this country are of two kinds; the firſt grows thick and tall, the joints at a conſiderable diſtance from one another, the color always green, the juice abundant, with very little of the ſalt in it. This ſpecies of cane is in general uſe for feeding and fattening of cattle; and experience teaches them, that no kind of food fattens ſooner or better the human ſpecies, as well as animals, than this ſugar-cane, eat while green, and the ſugar which is extracted from it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſpecies is ſmaller in every reſpect, with its joints approaching nearer together: when ripe it aſſumes a yellow color; and contains leſs water and more ſalt than the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:032696_0030_0FF4293E08626C60"/>The Cochin-chineſe, when preparing the ground for the ſugar-cane, turn it up to the depth of two feet; this operation is performed with a plank. They then plant joints or eyes of the cane, three and three together, in a horizontal poſition, in the ſame manner almoſt as they plant vines in ſeveral provinces of France. Theſe ſlips are planted chequer-wiſe about eighteen inches deep in the ground, diſtant ſix feet from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this operation they perform near the end of the rainy ſeaſon, in order that the ſlips may be ſufficiently watered, till ſuch time as they have taken root. During the firſt ſix months, they give them two dreſſings with a kind of pick-axe, in order to deſtroy the weeds, and preſerve a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture about the roots of the canes, by heaping the earth around them.</p>
                     <p>Twelve, and ſometimes fourteen, months after the plantation, they gather the firſt crop. By this time the canes, though planted at the diſtance of ſix feet, become ſo buſhy that it is impoſſible to enter the field, without the aſſiſtance of a hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to clear your way.</p>
                     <p>The canes being cut, and tied up into bundles, are carried to the mills, in order to extract their juice. I ſhall not here deſcribe the form of theſe machines, which reſemble in a great meaſure thoſe of the Weſt-Indies; inſtead of water, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy horned cattle or mules to ſet in motion the two cylinders, between which the ſugar-canes are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032696_0031_0FF4313F6F28F7B0"/>
Theſe engines have been deſcribed by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of travellers.</p>
                     <p>The juice being extracted, they boil it ſome hours in large kettles, in order to evaporate part of its water: it is then tranſported to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring market, and ſold in that condition. Here ends the induſtry and the profits of the Cochin-chineſe planter. The merchants purchaſe the juice, which reſembles pure water; they boil it again, throwing into the kettles ſome alkaline ſubſtance, ſuch as the aſhes of the leaves of the muſia or bananier, and ſhell-lime; they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with no other; theſe ingredients throw up a thick ſcum, which the refiner carefully ſkims off, the action of the alkali haſtens the ſeparation of the ſalt from the water, and by the force of ebullition, reduces the juice of the cane to the conſiſtence of ſyrup. As ſoon as this ſyrup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to granulate, they decant it into a great earthen veſſel, where they cool it about an hour; when a kind of cruſt, ſtill ſoft, and of a yellowiſh color, appears on the ſurface of the ſyrup; they loſe not a moment then to empty it into a veſſel of a conic ſhape, which they call a <hi>form.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this intermediate operation of cooling the ſyrup, it would harden into a maſs, and not being granulated, would conſequently want one eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial quality of ſugar.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſugar-cones, or forms, in Cochin-china, are, like thoſe of our Weſt-India colonies, of bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed earth, about three feet high, pierced at their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032696_0031_0FF4313F6F28F7B0"/>
narrow extremities, and contain in general about forty or fifty pounds of ſugar. Theſe <hi>forms,</hi> when full, are placed on another earthen veſſel, the mouth of which is proportioned to receive the narrow end of the cone, and muſt be large enough to contain the coarſe ſyrup, which diſtils from the ſugar, through ſome ſtraw which imperfectly ſtops up the little opening in the bottom of the <hi>form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they ſuppoſe the ſyrup has acquired the conſiſtence of ſalt in every part of the cone, they then proceed to whiten and purify it. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in a trough a fine ſort of whitiſh clay, with ſuch a quantity of water as, when thus prepared, prevents it from having too much conſiſtence; with a trowel they then lay it upon the ſurface of the ſugar to the thickneſs of about two inches in the void ſpace left at the top of the form by the condenſing of the ſugar, after purging itſelf of the coarſer ſyrup or molaſſes. The water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the clay penetrating by degrees into the maſs, waſhes it, and carries off inſenſibly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſyrup, and every foreign particle that adheres moſt cloſely to the ſugar. When the clay hardens, they replace it with a freſh quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, diluted as the firſt: this operation, which laſts about twelve or fifteen days, is the ſame here as in our Weſt-India colonies. Some refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Cochin-china, however, have another method. In place of clay, tempered thus with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they cut into ſmall pieces the trunk of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa or bananier, which they place upon the ſugar:
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032696_0032_0FF431425DA6DDB8"/>
the trunk of this tree is very watery; the water of a detergent quality; and diſtils from the fibres which envelope it, in very ſmall drops. Thoſe who follow this method pretend, that the oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is thereby rendered leſs tedious, and that the ſugar acquires a finer color.</p>
                     <p>The proceſs of the Cochin-chineſe, in refining their ſugar, goes no further: they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtoves in uſe in the Weſt-Ind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies. After having clayed their ſugars ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſell them in the public markets, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Chineſe, and other ſtrangers, who are invited to their ports by the moderate price of this commodity, which is cheaper at Cochin-china than any where in India.</p>
                     <p>The white ſugar of the beſt quality is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſold at the port of Faiſo, in exchange for oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er merchandiſe, at the rate of three piaſters (about fourteen ſhillings) the Cochin-china quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which weighs from one hundred and fifty, to two hundred pounds French<note n="*" place="bottom">Ninety-one pounds eight ounces French, make one hundred pounds Engliſh.</note>. The trade in this commodity is immenſe. The Chineſe alone, whoſe lands do not produce enough for their own conſumpt, purchaſe annually from Cochin-china above forty thouſand barrels, weighing about two thouſand pounds per barrel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:032696_0032_0FF431425DA6DDB8"/>This country, it ſhould be obſerved, which produces this commodity in ſuch abundance, and at ſo low a price, being a new kingdom, ought to be conſidered, in ſome meaſure, as a colony: it is worthy obſervation too, that the ſugar-cane is there cultivated by free men, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of preparation and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-chineſe production with the ſame commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlaves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure ſugar from our colonies, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to authoriſe by law the ſlavery of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Africans tranſported to America. From what I have obſerved at Cochin-china, I cannot enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a doubt, but that our Weſt-India colonies, had they been diſtributed without reſervation amongſt a free people, would have produced dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the quantity that is now procured from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of the unfortunate negroes.</p>
                     <p>What advantage then has accrued to Europe, civilized as it is, and thoroughly verſed in the laws of nature, and the rights of mankind, by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally authoriſing in our colonies the daily out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages againſt human nature, permitting them to debaſe man almoſt below the level of the beaſts of the field? Theſe ſlaviſh laws have proved as oppoſite to its intereſt as they are to its honor, and to the laws of humanity. This remark I have often made. Liberty and property form the baſis of abundance, and good agriculture: I never obſerved it to flouriſh where thoſe rights of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032696_0033_0FF4314564DB0F00"/>
mankind were not firmly eſtabliſhed. The earth, which multiplies her productions with a kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, under the hands of the free-born laborer, ſeems to ſhrink into barrenneſs under the ſweat of the ſlave. Such is the will of the great Author of our nature, who has created man free, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him the earth, that he might cultivate his poſſeſſion with the ſweat of his brow; but ſtill ſhould enjoy his liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineſe, excluſive of the ſugar-cane, employ themſelves in the culture of a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of other productions, of great importance both to their interior fabrics, and external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercce.</p>
                     <p>They cultivate the cotton-tree, the mulberry, the pepper, the varniſh-tree, the date, the tea, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, and the ſaffron, together with a plant pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the country, called <hi>Tſai,</hi> which being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented like indigo, furniſhes in great plenty a flower of a green color, which, in dying, gives a durable tincture of a fine emerald color. This plant would undoubtedly be a moſt valuable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our Weſt-India colonies.</p>
                     <p>I muſt at preſent decline entering into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the various proceſſes attending theſe different cultures. They will afford ſubject for ſome future memoirs.</p>
                     <p>The ſoil, in general, of Cochin-china, is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and they cultivate it well. Their mountains
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032696_0033_0FF4314564DB0F00"/>
in general are fallow, as population is not even ſufficiently conſiderable for the cultivation of all the plain grounds they have taken poſſeſſion of in Camboya: theſe mountains produce, however, the eagle or aloes-wood, which is the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perfume in the world; the ſapan-wood, the ſame with that of Braſil; and the cinnamon, in ſmall quantities indeed, but much ſuperior in quality to that of Ceylon. The Chineſe pay three or four times more for it than for that which the Dutch import from that iſland. They have ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſorts likewiſe of admirable wood for joiner and cabinet-work, particularly the roſe-wood; the tea-wood is excellent for building, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to all others in the conſtruction of the royal galleys, having every property that can be wiſhed for, either for beauty or ſolidity. From their mountains alſo, and from the foreſts with which they are covered, they procure ivory, muſk, wax, iron and gold in great abundance. Theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains too are full of game, ſuch as deer, antelopes, wild goats, peacocks; pheaſants, &amp;c. The chace is free to all, but dangerous from the number of tygers, elephants, rhinoceros, and other carnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deſtructive animals, with which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts abound.</p>
                     <p>The ſea, which waſhes their coaſts, as well as the rivers, are well ſupplied with excellent fiſh. Every one has the liberty of fiſhing; and in this the Cochin-chineſe take great delight. I have already obſerved, that they live chiefly on fiſh and rice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:032696_0034_0FF42943D34E2B50"/>Their domeſtic animals are, the horſe for the road, the buffalo for labor, and the cow, the hog, the goat, the gooſe, the duck, and hens of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds, for the table. Theſe animals thrive extremely well, and are in great abundance. The king alone reſerves to himſelf the excluſive right of breeding elephants for the war; and this is a reſervation which no man envies him. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains generally four hundred of them; he could maintain four thouſand men at a much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. The Cochin-chineſe have few good fruits; the pine-apple, and oranges of different kinds, are the beſt their country produces. They do not cultivate the vine, though it is one of the native productions of their lands. They are but indifferently provided with pulſe. In a word, their orchards and their gardens are very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. They attach themſelves to the more eſſential branches of agriculture.</p>
                     <p>Although this art is not yet arrived at that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection in Cochin-china, to which it might be carried, with the advantage of ſuch an excellent ſoil, yet the manners of the people being very favorable, it flouriſhes greatly.</p>
                     <p>The Cochin-chineſe are gentle, hoſpital, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and induſtrious. There is not a beggar in the country; and robbery and murder abſolutely unknown. A ſtranger may wander over the kingdom, from one end to another (the capital ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) without meeting the ſlighteſt inſult: he will be every where received with a moſt eager
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032696_0034_0FF42943D34E2B50"/>
curioſity, but, at the ſame time, with great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. I have here remarked a cuſtom ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar indeed, but expreſſive of their goodneſs of heart. A Cochin-chineſe traveller, who has not money ſufficient to defray his expenſes at an inn, enters the firſt houſe of the town or village he arrives at: no body inquires his buſineſs; he ſpeaks to none, but waits in ſilence the hour of dinner; ſo ſoon as the rice is ſerved up, he mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly approaches, places himſelf at table along with the family, eats, drinks, and departs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pronouncing a ſingle word, or any perſon's putting to him a ſingle queſtion: it was enough they ſaw he was a man, a brother in diſtreſs; they aſked no further information.</p>
                     <p>The ſix firſt kings, founders of this monarchy, governed the nation as a father governs his family; they eſtabliſhed the laws of nature alone; they themſelves paid the firſt obedience to them. Chiefs of an immenſe family of laborers, they gave the firſt example of labor; they honored and encouraged agriculture, as the moſt uſeful and honorable employment of mankind. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from their ſubjects only a ſmall annual free-gift, to defray the expenſe of their defenſive war againſt their Tonquineſe enemies.</p>
                     <p>This impoſition was regulated, by way of poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax, with the greateſt equity. Every man, able to labor the ground, paid into the magiſtrate, on account of the prince, a ſmall ſum proportioned to the ſtrength of his conſtitution, and the vigor of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032696_0035_0FF43146E8EF9188"/>
his arm; and nothing more. It was under their reign, that this nation multiplied ſo ſurpriſingly, in conſequence of the plenty furniſhed by the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their fields. Whilſt they reigned, the treaties entered into on the banks of the river, which ſeparates Tonquin from Cochin-china, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the chiefs of their family and thoſe who followed them in their retreat, were moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved. It is to this reciprocal fidelity that Cochin-china owes its preſent flouriſhing ſtate with regard to power, population and agriculture. Their ſucceſſor, who now reigns, inherits their goodneſs of heart, but has the weakneſs to ſuffer himſelf to be governed by his ſlaves. Theſe have acquired the art of ſeparating the intereſt of the prince from that of his people. They have inſpired him with the thirſt after perſonal riches. The vaſt quantity of gold which they have dug from the mines, during this reign, has already proved detrimental to induſtry and agriculture. In the palace it has been productive of luxury and corruption, its never-failing attendants.</p>
                     <p>This prince has been inſenſibly led to deſpiſe the ſimple habitations of his anceſtors. He has built a ſuperb palace, a league in circumference, ſurrounded by a wall of brick, on the model of that of Pekin. Sixteen hundred pieces of cannon, mounted around the palace, announce to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the approaching loſs of their liberties and rights.</p>
                     <p>He found a neceſſity too for a winter palace,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032696_0035_0FF43146E8EF9188"/>
a ſummer palace, and an autumn palace. The old taxes were by no means ſufficient to defray theſe expenſes; they were augmented; and new impoſitions deviſed, which, being no longer vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary contributions, could not be levied but by force, and tyrannical oppreſſion. His courtiers, who found their intereſt in the corruption of their prince, have given him the title of <hi>King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Vous Tſoi,</hi> hearing himſelf often ſo ſtiled, at length thought he might aſſume it—"Why," addreſſing himſelf one day to me, "don't you come oftener to pay your court to the <hi>King of Heaven?</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Theſe deſigning ſycophants, who guard every avenue to the royal ear, have had the addreſs to over-awe the ordinary adminiſtration of juſtice; and, taking advantage of exemption from pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, have pillaged the laborers, and filled the provinces with oppreſſion and diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>All along the high roads I have ſeen whole vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages newly abandoned by their inhabitants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>In the midſt of all this growing diſorder, the prince, whole mind has been ſurpriſed by fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flatterers, and who alone is ignorant of the villany of thoſe around him, ſtill preſerves a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for the manners of his anceſtors; he does not indeed, like his forefathers, give an example
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032696_0036_0FF4314BA745AA48"/>
of perſonal labor, but ſtill his deſire is to protect agriculture.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen him, at the commencement of the new year, preſide, with all the ſimplicity of his predeceſſors, at the general aſſembly of the nation, which is annually held on that day, in the open field, in order to renew the reciprocal oath for obſervation of the primordial contract, which eſtabliſhed him father of his people, at the ſame time that they inveſted him alone with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the nobleſt indeed of all, of making his people happy.</p>
                     <p>When he ſpeaks of his ſubjects, he calls them ſtill by no other name than that of his children. I have ſeen him too aſſiſt, like a ſimple individual, in the annual aſſembly of his family, according to the ancient uſage of the nation; an aſſembly where the moſt aged always preſide, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the dignities of thoſe of younger years. This, however, ſeemed to me only a formality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Corruption, it is true, has not yet infected the general body of the people; they ſtill preſerve their primitive manners: it is hitherto confined to the palace, and the capital: its ſource, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is too elevated to prevent its poiſoned ſtreams from flowing to the plains. It is from the great that the corruption of a people ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its origin.</p>

                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:032696_0036_0FF4314BA745AA48"/>When it ſhall have infected every rank; when the foundations of agriculture, liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, already attacked by the great, ſhall be overthrown; when the profeſſion of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhall become the moſt contemptible, and the leaſt lucrative, what muſt be the fate of agriculture? without a flouriſhing agriculture what muſt be the fate of thoſe multitudes, foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under its wing?—what muſt be the fate of prince and people?—it will reſemble that of the nation who poſſeſſed the country before them; perhaps that of the ſavages, who yielded it to that nation: of them there are no remains, but the ruins of an immenſe wall, near the capital, which appears to have been part of a great city: it is of brick, and of a form very different from what is to be ſeen in the other countries of Aſia: no hiſtory, however, no tradition has preſerved the memory of the builders.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole I conclude, from the general corruption which threatens the manners of the Cochin-chineſe, that agriculture is on the decline, and that whatever efforts they may make to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, it has now paſſed its meridian, and muſt infallibly degenerate.</p>

I entered the river of Canton; it is peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled like the land; its banks lined with ſhips at anchor; a prodigious number of ſmall craft are continually gliding along in every direction, ſome with ſails, others with oars, vaniſhing often ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from the ſight, as they enter the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs canals dug with amazing labor, acroſs exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive plains, which they water and fertilize. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe fields, covered with all the glory of the harveſt, with ſtately villages riſing to the eye on every ſide, adorn the remoter view, whilſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, covered with verdure, cut into terraſſes, and ſhaped into amphitheatres, form the back ground of this noble landſcape.</p>
                  <p>I arrive at Canton, where new ſubjects for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration ariſe; the noiſe, the motion, the croud augments; the water, as well as land, being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where covered with multitudes. Aſtoniſhed at the amazing appearance, I inquire into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of inhabitants of this city, and ſuburbs; and after comparing different accounts, find that they
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032696_0037_0FF4314E1AAD6438"/>
muſt amount at leaſt to eight hundred thouſand ſouls. My ſurpriſe, however, is greatly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when I learn, that to the northward of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, about five leagues up the river, is a village named <hi>Fachan,</hi> which contains a million of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and that every part of this great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, extending about ſix hundred leagues from north to ſouth, and as much from eaſt to weſt, was peopled in the ſame proportion.</p>
                  <p>By what art can the earth produce ſubſiſtence for ſuch numbers? do the Chineſe poſſeſs any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret art of multiplying the grain and proviſions neceſſary for the nouriſhment of mankind? To ſolve my doubts I traverſed the fields, I introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced myſelf among the laborers, who are in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, eaſy, polite and affable, with ſome ſhare of learning, and knowledge of the world. I exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and purſue them through all their operations, and obſerve that their ſecret conſiſts ſimply in manuring their fields judiciouſly, ploughing them to a conſiderable depth, ſowing them in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſon, turning to advantage every inch of ground which can produce the moſt inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crop, and preferring to every other ſpecies of culture that of grain, as by far the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
                  <p>This ſyſtem of culture, the laſt article except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appears to be the ſame that is recommended in all our beſt authors, ancient and modern, who have wrote on this ſubject; our common labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are acquainted with it; but how much muſt
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032696_0038_0FF4314F9E3D8FD8"/>
our European farmers be ſurpriſed, when they are informed, that the Chineſe have no meadows, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural nor artificial, and have not the leaſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fallowing, never allowing their lands the ſlighteſt repoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Chineſe laborer would conſider meadows, of every denomination, as lands in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they ſow their lands all with grain, and give the preference to ſuch grounds as we gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally lay out in meadows, which, lying low, and being properly ſituated with reſpect to water, are conſequently by far the moſt fertile. They affirm, that a field ſown with grain, will yield as much ſtraw for the nouriſhment of cattle, as it would have produced of hay, beſides the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional advantage of the grain for the ſuſtenance of man, of which they can ſpare too, in plentiful ſeaſons, a ſmall portion for the animal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Such is the ſyſtem adhered to from one extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of their empire to the other, and confirmed by the experience of four thouſand years, amongſt a people, of all the nations in the world, the moſt attentive to their intereſt.</p>
                  <p>That which muſt render this plan of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the more inconceivable to Europeans, is the idea of their never allowing their lands to lie one ſeaſon unlabored. Thoſe who for ſome years have endeavored, with ſuch public-ſpirited zeal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate amongſt us this neglected art, have conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032696_0038_0FF4314F9E3D8FD8"/>

                  <p>This ſyſtem, which appears the moſt plauſible of any they have projected, and is received with the greateſt partiality by our farmers, is, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, contradicted by the conſtant experience of the greateſt and the moſt ancient land laboring nation in the world, who regard the practice of meadows, and fallowing grounds, as an abuſe, deſtructive of plenty and population, which are the only important objects of agriculture.</p>
                  <p>A Chineſe laborer could not but ſmile, if you informed him, that the earth has occaſion for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at a certain fixed period of time: he certainly would ſay, that we deviated greatly from the point in view, could he read our treatiſes ancient and modern, our marvellous ſpeculations on agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture: what would he ſay, if he ſaw our lands, part of them fallow, part of them employod in uſeleſs cultures, and the remainder wretchedly labored?

                  <p>The Chineſe uſe the ſame manures as we do, in order to reſtore to their grounds thoſe ſalts and juices, which an unintermitting production is perpetually conſuming. They are acquainted with marl; they employ alſo common ſalt, lime, aſhes, and all ſorts of animal dung, but above all that which we throw into our rivers: they make great uſe of urine, which is carefully preſerved in every houſe, and ſold to advantage: in a word, every thing produced by the earth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveyed to it with the greateſt care, into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhape the operations of nature or art may have transformed it.</p>
                  <p>When their manures are at any time ſcarce, they ſupply the deficiency, by turning up the ground, with the ſpade, to a great depth, which brings up to the ſurface of the field a new ſoil, enriched with the juices of that which deſcends in its room.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:032696_0039_0FF431538AAC2998"/>Without meadows the Chineſe maintain a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of horſes, buffaloes, and other animals of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpecies neceſſary for labor, for ſuſtenance, and for manure. Theſe animals are fed, ſome with ſtraw, others with roots, beans, and grain of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery kind. It is true, they have fewer horſes, and horned cattle, in proportion, than we have, yet it is not neceſſary they ſhould have more.</p>
                  <p>The whole country is cut into canals, dug by the induſtry of the inhabitants, extending from river to river, which divide and water this vaſt empire, like a garden. Travelling, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of goods, almoſt every ſpecies of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is performed on theſe canals, with great eaſe, and ſmall expenſe: they don't even uſe horſes to drag their boats; every thing is done by the ſail or the oar, which they manage with ſingular dexterity, even in going up the rivers. Where any kind of labor can be performed, at a moderate price by men, it is a maxim with them never to employ animals. In conſequence of this, the banks of their canals, are cultivated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the water's edge; they loſe not an inch of ground: their public roads reſemble our foot paths; their canals, however, are infinitely more uſeful than high ways: they convey fertility ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery where, and furniſh the people great part of their ſubſiſtence in fiſh.—There is no compariſon between the weight which can be tranſported in a boat, and that which can be conveyed by any kind of land-carriage; no proportion between the expenſe.</p>

                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:032696_0040_0FF429455CAE8780"/>The Chineſe are ſtill leſs acquainted with the uſe, or rather the luxury of chariots, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages of every kind, which crowd the principal ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Europe. The horſes neceſſary for theſe, aſſembled in thouſands in our capitals, conſume the produce of numberleſs acres of our beſt grounds, which, if cultivated with grain, would afford ſubſiſtence for multitudes, who are dying of hunger. The Chineſe wiſh rather to maintain men than horſes.</p>
                  <p>The emperor and chief magiſtrates are carried through the cities by men, with ſafety, and with dignity; their march is ſedate and majeſtic, it threatens not with danger thoſe who walk on foot: they travel in a kind of galleys, ſafer, more commodious, equally magnificient, and leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive than our land equipages.</p>
                  <p>I have before obſerved, that the Chineſe loſe not an inch of ground. They are very far, therefore, from alloting immenſe parks, of the fineſt ground, for the maintenance alone of deer, in contempt of the human race. The emperors, even thoſe of the Tartar line, have never hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dreamed of forming theſe parks; ſtill leſs the grandees, that is, the magiſtrates and the learned: ſuch an idea could never find place in the mind of a Chineſe. Even their country houſes, and boxes of pleaſure, preſent nothing to the eye all around, but uſeful cultures, agreeably diverſified. That which conſtitutes their principal beauty, is their delightful ſituation, judiciouſly improved,

where, in the diſpoſition of the various parts which form the whole, there every where reigns a happy imitation of that beautiful order of nature, from whence art has borrowed all her charms.</p>
                  <p>The moſt rocky hills, which, in France, and other places of Europe, they turn into vineyards, or totally neglect, are there compelled, by dint of induſtry, to produce grain. The Chineſe are acquainted, indeed, with the vine, which here and there they plant in arbors; but they conſider it as a luxury, and the wine it produces as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ſuperfluity: they would imagine it a ſin againſt humanity, to endeavor to procure, by cultivation, an agreeable liquor, whilſt, from the want of that grain which this vineyard might have produced, ſome individual perhaps might be in danger of periſhing of hunger.</p>
                  <p>The ſteepeſt mountains, even, are rendered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible: at Canton, and from one extremity of the empire to another, you obſerve mountains cut into terraſſes, repreſenting, at a diſtance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe pyramids divided into different ſtages, which ſeem to rear their heads to heaven. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe terraſſes yields annually a crop of ſome kind of grain, even of rice; and you cannot with-hold your admiration, when you behold the water of the river, the canal, or the fountain, which glides by the foot of the mountain, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from terraſs to terraſs, even to the ſummit, by means of a ſimple portable machine, which two men with eaſe tranſport and put in motion.</p>

                  <p>The two fineſt provinces of the empire, Nan-king and Tche-kiang, formerly covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have been united to the continent ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years ago, with an art infinitely ſuperior to that which is ſo much admired in the modern works of Holland.</p>
                  <p>The Chineſe had to ſtruggle with a ſea, whoſe natural flux from eaſt to weſt urges it continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the coaſts of theſe two provinces; whilſt the Dutch have had nothing to oppoſe but a ſea, which by the ſame natural motion, always avoids their weſtern ſhores.</p>
                  <p>The Chineſe nation is capable of the moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous works; in point of labor I never obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their equals in the world.

of eſtimation, but thoſe who, from their ſituation in life, have nothing to do!— An ancient empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of China, in a public inſtruction, exhorting the people to labor, obſerved, that if in one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the empire there was one man who did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there muſt, in ſome other quarter, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other who ſuffers on that account, deprived of the neceſſaries of life. This wiſe maxim is fixed in the breaſt of every Chineſe; and, with this people ſo open to reaſon, he who pronounces a wiſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im pronounces a law.</p>
                  <p>Behold, gentlemen, a ſlight ſketch of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral picture of Chineſe agriculture, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar genius of that people for this art. The limits of my diſcourſe will not permit me at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to enter into a detail of the different cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I have ſeen in this country: I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that they are ſuch as abundantly ſupply all the wants, and conveniences of the moſt populous nation in the world, and furniſh, with their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity, an important article for foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
                  <p>From theſe obſervations it is obvious, that agriculture flouriſhes in China more than in any other country in the world: yet it is not to any proceſs peculiar to their labor, it is not to the form of their plough, or their method of ſowing, that this happy ſtate, and the plenty conſequent on it, is to be attributed; it muſt chiefly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from their mode of government, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable foundations of which have been laid
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032696_0042_0FF431572F475CF0"/>
deep, by the hand of reaſon alone, coeval almoſt with the beginning of time; and from their laws, dictated by nature to the firſt of the human race, and ſacredly preſerved from generation to gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, engraved in the united hearts of a great people, not in obſcure codes, deviſed by chicane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deceit.—In a word, China owes the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of her agriculture to the ſimplicity of her manners, and to her laws, which are the laws of nature and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>This empire was founded by laborers, in thoſe happy times when the laws of the great Creator were ſtill held in remembrance, and the culture of the earth conſidered as the nobleſt of all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the moſt worthy of mankind, and the general occupation of all. From <hi>Fou-hi</hi> (who was the firſt chief of this nation, ſome hundreds of years after the deluge, if we follow the verſion of the Septuagint, and in this quality preſided over agriculture) all the emperors, without exception, even to this day, glory in being the firſt laborers of their empire.</p>
                  <p>The Chineſe hiſtory has carefully preſerved an anecdote of generoſity in two of the ancient emperors, who, not perceiving among their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren any one worthy to mount a throne, which virtue alone ought to inherit, named, as their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, two ſimple laborers. Theſe laborers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Chineſe annals, advanced the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of mankind, during very long reigns; their memory is ſtill held in the higheſt veneration.
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032696_0042_0FF431572F475CF0"/>
It is unneceſſary to obſerve how much examples, ſuch as theſe, honor and animate agriculture.</p>
                  <p>The Chineſe nation has ever been governed like a family, of which the emperor is father: his ſubjects are his children, without any other inequality but that which eſtabliſhed by talents, and by merit. Thoſe puerile diſtinctions of <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe,</hi> and <hi>plebeians, men of family,</hi> and <hi>men of mean birth,</hi> are no where to be found but in the jargon of new people, ſtill barbarous, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forgot the common origin of all men, inſult without reflection, and debaſe the whole human race; whilſt that nation whoſe government is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, dating its commencement with the firſt ages of the world, are ſenſible that all men are born equal, all brothers, all noble. Their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage has not even hitherto invented a term for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing this pretended diſtinction of birth. The Chineſe, who have preſerved their annals from the remoteſt times, and who are all equally the children of the emperor, have never ſo much as ſuſpected an inequality of origin amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>From this principle, that the emperor is father, and the people his children, ſpring all the duties of ſociety, all the duties of morality, every virtue of humanity, the union of every wiſh for the common good of the family, conſequently an attachment to labor, and above all to agriculture.</p>

                     <pb n="84" facs="unknown:032696_0043_0FF4315A20D939B8"/>This art is honored, protected, and practiſed by the emperor, and the great magiſtrates, who generally are the ſons of plain laboring men, whom merit has raiſed to the firſt dignities of the empire; and, in a word, by the whole nation, who have the good ſenſe to honor an art the moſt uſeful to mankind, in preference to others more frivolous, and leſs important.</p>

                     <head>Ceremony of opening the Grounds.</head>
                     <p>On the fifteenth day of the firſt moon, in every year, which generally correſponds to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March, the emperor in perſon performs the ceremony of opening the grounds. This prince, in great pomp, proceeds to the field ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ceremony: the princes of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial family, the preſidents of the five great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, and an infinite number of madarius accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him. Two ſides of the field are occupied by the emperor's officers, and guards; the third is allotted for all the laborers of the province, who repair thither to behold their art honored and practiſed by the head of their empire, the fourth is reſerved for the mandarins.</p>
                     <p>The emperor enters the field alone, proſtrates himſelf, and nine times ſtrikes his head againſt the ground, in adoration of <hi>Tien,</hi> the GOD of heaven; he pronounces, with a loud voice, a prayer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the tribunal of rites, invoking the bleſſing of the Almighty Sovereign on his labor and on the labor of his people, who form his fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily;
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032696_0043_0FF4315A20D939B8"/>
he then, in quality of ſovereign pontiff of the empire, ſacrifices a bullock, which he offers up to heaven, as the ſource of every bleſſing: whilſt they cut the victim in pieces, and place them on the altar, they bring to the emperor a plough, in which are yoked a pair of bullocks, magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorned. The emperor then, laying aſide his royal robes, takes hold of the handle of the plough, and turns up ſeveral furrows the whole length of the field; then, with a complaiſant air, having delivered the plough to the mandarins, they ſucceſſively follow his example, emulating one another in performing this honorable labor with the greateſt dexterity. The ceremony concludes with the diſtribution of money, and pieces of ſtuff, among the laborers there preſent; the moſt active of whom finiſh the remaining labor, in preſence of the emperor, with great agility and addreſs.</p>
                     <p>Some time after, when they have ſufficiently labored and manured their grounds, the emperor repairs again, in proceſſion, and begins the ſowing of the fields; always accompanied with ceremony, and attended by the laborers of the province.</p>
                     <p>The ſame ceremonies are performed, on the ſame days, in all the provinces of the empire, by the viceroys, aſſiſted by all the magiſtrates of their departments, in preſence of a great number of the laborers of their reſpective provinces.

Every year the viceroys of the provinces ſend to court the names of ſuch laborers as have chiefly diſtinguiſhed themſelves in their employments, either by cultivating grounds till then conſidered as barren, or, by a ſuperior culture, improving the production of ſuch lands as formerly had bore grain.

                     <p>The whole attention, in general, of the Chineſe government, is directed towards agriculture. The principal object of the father of a family, ought to be the ſubſiſtence of his children. The ſtate of the fields, in conſequence, forms the great object of the toils, the cares and the ſolicitudes of the magiſtrates. It may eaſily be conceived, that with ſuch diſpoſitions, the government has not neglected to ſecure to the laborers that liberty, property, and indulgence which are the great ſprings for the improvement of agriculture.</p>
                     <p>The Chineſe enjoy, undiſturbed, their private poſſeſſions, as well as thoſe which, being by their nature indiviſible, belong to all, ſuch as the ſea, the rivers, the canals, the fiſh which they contain, and the beaſts of the foreſt: navigation, fiſhing, and the chace are free to every one; and he who buys a field, or receives it by inheritance from his anceſtors, is of courſe the ſole lord and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>The lands are free as the people; no feudal ſervices, and no fines of alienation; none of thoſe men intereſted in the misfortunes of the public; none of thoſe farmers who never amaſs more exhorbitant fortunes, that when an unfavorable ſeaſon has ruined the country, and reduced the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy

laborer to periſh for want, after having toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the year round for the ſuſtenance of his fellow ſubjects; none of that deſtructive profeſſion, hatched in the delirium of the feudal ſyſtem, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whole auſpices ariſe millions of proceſſes, which drag the laborer from his plough into the obſcure and dangerous mazes of chicane, and thereby rob him, while defending his rights, of that time which would have been importantly employed in the general ſervice of mankind.</p>

                     <p>In China there is no other lord, no other ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, who has power to levy taxes, but the common father of the family, the emperor. The bonzes [prieſts of the ſect of Fo-hi] accuſtomed to receive alms from a charitable people, would be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently received, ſhould they pretend that this alms is a right which heaven has beſtowed upon them.</p>

                     <p>This impoſt, which is not exactly the tenth part of the produce, is regulated according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the grounds: in bad ſoils it is perhaps on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thirtieth part, and ſo in proportion. This impoſt, however, of the tenth part of the produce of the earth, which belongs to the emperor, is the only tax on the lands, the only tribute known in China ſince the origin of the monarchy: and ſuch is the happy reſpect which the Chineſe have
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032696_0045_0FF4315D2A6AD360"/>
for their ancient cuſtoms, that an emperor of China would never entertain the moſt diſtant thought of augmenting it, nor his ſubjects the leaſt apprehenſion of ſuch augmentation. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pay it, in kind, not to avaricious farmers-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals, but to upright magiſtrates, their proper and natural governors. The amount of this tribute, though apparently trifling, muſt be immenſe, when we conſider that it is levied on every foot of ground of the moſt extenſive and beſt cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed empire in the world. This tax is paid with the greateſt fidelity, as they know the purpoſes to which it is applied. They know, that part of it is laid up in immenſe magazines, diſtributed ov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er every province of the empire, and allotted for the maintenance of the magiſtrates and ſoldiery: they know, that, in the event of ſcarcity, theſe magazines are open to all, and the wants of the people ſupplied with part of that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them in times of abundance: they know too, that the remainder of this impoſt is ſold in the public markets, and the produce of it faithfully carried to the treaſury of the empire, the cuſtody of which is entruſted to the reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tribunal of <hi>Ho-pou,</hi> from whence it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I have examined: compare nation with nation, and then judge, if the unfortunate Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, without property, ſubjected to the tyrannical government of the Moguls; judge if a race of ſlaves, under the iron ſceptre of the deſpot of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am; judge if the Malais, ever turbulent, and fettered by their feudal laws; judge, I ſay, if theſe nations, though poſſeſſing the fineſt grounds in the world, can poſſibly ever make agriculture to flouriſh like the Chineſe, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned as a family, and ſubjected to the laws of reaſon alone.—I ſhall again repeat, therefore, with confidence, that, in every country in the world, the fate of agriculture depends ſolely on the laws there eſtabliſhed, on the manners of the people, and even on the prejudices which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their origin from thoſe laws.</p>
