            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>BUT the matter muſt be further look'd into.</p>
            <p>MY Text is found in a Book Entituled, <hi>The Preacher.</hi> It ſeems, the Things which are in this Book inſiſted on, are ſuch as it well becomes a <hi>Preacher</hi> to inſiſt upon. We have here the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations</hi> of a <hi>Solomon,</hi> writing a Treatiſe upon, <hi>The Chief End of Man;</hi> An Aged <hi>Solomon,</hi> after much Experience, confeſſing his own Errors, and correcting of ours, upon that Important Subject. The Word which we render, <hi>The Preacher,</hi> carries in it ſome Intimations of, <hi>A Soul upon Recollection.</hi> We have here that Enquiry managed, <hi>What is
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002913_0005_0FE694E08B3A67A8"/>true Happineſs?</hi> And, <hi>How,</hi> or <hi>Where,</hi> is <hi>true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> is to be met withal! Upon a Serious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection,</hi> it is here pronounced, That our <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Happineſs</hi> is to <hi>Enjoy Chearfully</hi> what we <hi>Poſſeſs Honeſtly.</hi> But, Wo to that Man, who Stops here; who is put off ſo; who knows none but a <hi>Temporal Happineſs.</hi> There is an <hi>Eternal Happineſs,</hi> which a Man ought always and chiefly to be concern'd about : An <hi>Happineſs</hi> to be found in the Day when <hi>G O D ſhall bring every work into Judgment.</hi> And the way to obtain this <hi>Happineſs</hi> is for a Man to <hi>Fear G O D and keep His Commandments.</hi> In the proſecution of theſe things, very pertinent are the Remarks made in this Book, upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <hi>Vanities,</hi> whereof Men do in this Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the grievous <hi>Vexations.</hi> One of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <hi>Vanities,</hi> is Remark'd in the Text before us; <hi>Man knoweth not his Time.</hi> It refers to ſuch occurrences, as the preceeding Verſe takes notice of. <hi>Time</hi> intends the <hi>Changes</hi> which befalls us in <hi>Time;</hi> The <hi>Changes</hi> which are alſo called <hi>Chances,</hi> becauſe we ſee not the Cauſes of them. The <hi>Reaſons</hi> as well as the <hi>Seaſons</hi> are ſecret unto us. But above all, <hi>Time</hi> intends the end of our <hi>Time.</hi> It is our <hi>Death</hi> which is our <hi>Time :</hi> The <hi>Time</hi> wherein we are to <hi>Dy,</hi> and we are to have no more <hi>Time</hi> allow'd unto us. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of this <hi>Time,</hi> wherein it pleaſes the Holy <hi>Lord of Time,</hi> who <hi>Inhabits Eternity</hi> to keep us, has here ſome elegant Illuſtrations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances. The <hi>Fiſh</hi> Knows not the <hi>Time</hi> of its being taken in the <hi>Nett.</hi> The <hi>Bird</hi> knows not
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002913_0006_0FE694ADECB7C8D0"/>the <hi>Time</hi> of its being taken in the <hi>Snare;</hi> So are Men <hi>Suddenly</hi> taken by the <hi>Evil-Time</hi> of a <hi>Dying Hour.</hi> The <hi>Netts</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> are ſpread for us. The <hi>Snares</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> are laid for us. <hi>Man knows not the Time</hi> of his being taken in them.</p>
            <p>ATTEND unto a DOCTRINE of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as Uſeful as Awful, to be at <hi>all Times</hi> thought upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LITTLE do People know the Times that are hereafter to paſs over them : Little do we know what Changes are to come, and when they are to come upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>CONTINGENCIES</hi> are Things which we cannot have a <hi>certain knowledge</hi> of. Tis at beſt, but an <hi>Opinion,</hi> tis at beſt but a <hi>Conjecture,</hi> that we can have of them. Now, with reſpect unto <hi>us,</hi> what are all <hi>Futurities,</hi> but <hi>Contingencies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY DOCTRINE is a String which the Quill of <hi>Solomon</hi> did very much harp upon. And moſt certainly the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of a <hi>Solomon</hi> could not be expreſs'd without Strong Impreſſions from ſuch a Meditation. Tis bewailed by <hi>Solomon</hi> as the <hi>Miſery of Man,</hi> Eccl. VIII. 7. <hi>He knoweth not that which ſhall be; For who can tell him when it ſhall be!</hi> Oh! may we have the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to make our <hi>Advantage</hi> of this <hi>Miſery;</hi> ſince we do know what we have to do, that we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for <hi>that which ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, This is the Tendency of the Meditation upon which we are now proceeding.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002913_0007_0FE694E68926F8C8"/>
            <p>WE will Inquire, Firſt, <hi>What is there in the Times paſſing over us, which we muſt not have the Fore-knowledge of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TWO words will fully eno' expreſs the matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt LITTLE do we <hi>Fore-know</hi> the <hi>Quantity</hi> of our <hi>Time;</hi> or what will be the <hi>Duration</hi> of it. <hi>Man knoweth not his Time;</hi> in that he <hi>knows not,</hi> whether it will be a <hi>Longer Time,</hi> or a <hi>Shorter Time.</hi> As it has been ſaid, <hi>What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee Death?</hi> So it may be ſaid, <hi>What man alive is there, who knows when he ſhall ſee Death?</hi> We are told, <hi>The living know that they ſhall Dy.</hi> But which of the <hi>Living</hi> are they who <hi>know when they are to Dye?</hi> The <hi>Preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> that ſome few have had of their <hi>Time,</hi> are extraordinary! One ſaid, Gen XXVII. 2. <hi>I am old, I know not the Day of my Death.</hi> And the <hi>Young</hi> does as little <hi>know the Day of his Death.</hi> It is an ancient ſaying, <hi>If an old Man has Death ſtanding before his Face, a young Man has Death ſtanding behind his Back.</hi> The <hi>Time</hi> of its giving the <hi>Fatal ſtroke,</hi> is as little known to the one, as to the other. <hi>One that is in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet, and having his Bones moiſtned with morrow;</hi> Even ſuch an one does <hi>not know his Time;</hi> for even ſuch an one may <hi>Dy</hi> at <hi>this</hi> very <hi>Time. One that is in Bitterneſs of Soul, and never Eats with pleaſure,</hi> becauſe of the Infirmities under what he languiſhes; even ſuch an one alſo does <hi>not know his Time.</hi> For even ſuch an one may be Repriev'd from <hi>Death</hi> beyond expectation; and ſee many <hi>Stronger</hi> ones <hi>ly down in the Duſt</hi> before him. We do all know, That <hi>it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002913_0008_0FE694AE521958B8"/>is appointed unto man once to dy.</hi> But which of us does <hi>know his appointed Time</hi> for it; or when he is to <hi>Dy?</hi> Ordinarily, <hi>of that Day &amp; Hour knoweth no Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, LITTLE do we <hi>Foreknow</hi> the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of our <hi>Time;</hi> or what we are to <hi>Encounter</hi> in it. Shall we have a <hi>Good Time,</hi> or a <hi>Bad Time</hi> of it? <hi>Man knoweth not!</hi> In our <hi>Time</hi> ſhall we ſee Days of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> or Days of <hi>Sorrow? Man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not!</hi> Shall we have our <hi>Time</hi> ſweetned with much <hi>Proſperity,</hi> or embittered with much <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity? Man knoweth not!</hi> The World may not prove either ſo <hi>Good</hi> as we <hi>hope,</hi> or ſo <hi>Bad</hi> as we <hi>fear?</hi> 'Tis moſt commonly ſo. Some look for a <hi>ſadder Time</hi> than ever does arrive unto them. So did the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Hero, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul.</hi> But much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do Men look for a <hi>better Time,</hi> than what anon comes unto them. They ſay, <hi>I ſhall never be moved;</hi> But, GOD <hi>hides His Face, and they are Troubled.</hi> When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a Priſoner and his <hi>Foot they did humble with the affliction of a chain; The Iron, that did penetrate into his very Soul:</hi> Did he <hi>know</hi> what was to be done for him, when the King <hi>constituted him to be the Ruler of his Houſe; yea, and the Governour of all that was poſſeſs'd by him.</hi> When <hi>Haman</hi> was in all the Grandeur of the <hi>Perſion</hi> Court, and the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State there; Did he <hi>know</hi> how near he and his Family were, to a matchleſs confuſion? What <hi>Accidents</hi> we are to meet withal, whether <hi>Joyful</hi> Accidents, or <hi>Woful</hi> Accidents, we muſt not <hi>know,</hi> indeed ſo much as one day before hand.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002913_0009_0FE694E6A31A2908"/>So we are admoniſhed; Prov. XXVII. 1. <hi>Thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> O Man, Thou <hi>knoweſt not,</hi> what may <hi>This Day</hi> befall thee in thy Perſon, in thy Family, in thy Intereſt. Thou <hi>knowest not</hi> what may be the <hi>Tidings</hi> that will <hi>This Day</hi> be brought unto thee. Thou <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not</hi> in the <hi>Evening</hi> what may befall thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Morning,</hi> or in the <hi>Morning</hi> what ſhall befall thee before the <hi>Evening;</hi> Any more than the Men upon whom the <hi>Tower of Siloam fell,</hi> that the <hi>Tower</hi> was to fall, while they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
            <p>THE Articles wherein you have had ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, the <hi>Future Events</hi> of our <hi>Times,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our GOD will keep us in the greateſt <hi>Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,</hi> are then theſe Two; Firſt, That which is the greateſt of all our <hi>Changes;</hi> And, then, all the <hi>Changes</hi> which may before That come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Our Meditation muſt not eaſily, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſmiſs theſe Articles of our <hi>Times</hi> which are <hi>unknown</hi> unto us. But before we paſs any further, Let an earneſt EXHORTATION pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us, To <hi>Entertain this Meditation, and he duely affected with it.</hi> Oh! may this Thought be often rolling in our Minds; <hi>I know not my Time, nor do I know any thing that is to befal me in my Time!</hi> And may our Minds feel the power of it; bring our Lives under the power of it! The very <hi>Pagans</hi> would ſometimes give an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto this Meditation; and ſay, <hi>Neſcis quid ſerus Veſper vebat;</hi> O Man, Thou knoweſt not what may before Night be to come upon thee. Certainly, It becomes <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to give a more
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002913_0010_0FE694B7265998B0"/>affecting entertainment unto ſuch a Meditation.</p>
            <p>Firſt; THE caſe of <hi>Mortality</hi> is above all to be thus conſidered; That <hi>Man knows not his Time,</hi> when his <hi>Mortality</hi> muſt have the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it finiſhed. Man lies under a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Death;</hi> and the <hi>Time</hi> for <hi>Execution</hi> is <hi>determined</hi> with GOD; <hi>Lord, The number of our Months is with thee; Thou haſt appointed our Bounds, that we cannot paſs.</hi> But Man muſt not <hi>know the Time,</hi> until the Executioner come and bring the Bow-ſtring. There is no <hi>Day</hi> that breaks upon any Man, but for ought he <hi>knows, His Time is come, and the Day of his Death. Sudden Deaths</hi> are ſome of thoſe Things, whereto all Men living are expoſed. We find it ſuppoſed, Numb VI. 9. <hi>A man may die very ſuddenly.</hi> 'Tis what we ſee fulfill'd on great <hi>Numbers;</hi> We need not for the proof of it quote the Book of <hi>Numbers.</hi> The commiſſions which our glotious GOD gives to the <hi>Angel of Death</hi> are often kept ſecret until the very Day, that he comes and ſwears unto them, <hi>No more Time</hi> ſhall be given them. It may be the Portion of <hi>Wicked Men</hi> to <hi>Dy ſuddenly.</hi> The profane Men, who can ſay of the Thing they never once thought upon, <hi>They thought no more of it than of their Dying Day;</hi> find it according to their word; Their <hi>Dying Day</hi> comes at a <hi>Time</hi> which they <hi>thought not</hi> of. The Men of <hi>Sodom;</hi> Did they <hi>know their Time?</hi> A bright fair, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiny Morning, found them wallowing in all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities; Before Night the <hi>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</hi> came down upon them. The <hi>Egyptians;</hi> Did they <hi>know their Time?</hi> In the Morning
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002913_0011_0FE694E8F06FA880"/>they were full of brave Expectations to divide <hi>Spoils</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi> among them, and to do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Exploits. That Night they were Drown'd, and Damn'd; the <hi>Sea covered them.</hi> The <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines;</hi> Did they <hi>know their Time?</hi> In the Morning they had nothing in their Eye, but the <hi>Sports</hi> of an Holiday. E're the Night came, they were cruſh'd all to pieces. <hi>Ananias &amp; Sapphira;</hi> Did they <hi>know their Time.</hi> They came out well to the Meeting, and they are carried home Dead! It may be the Portion of <hi>Godly Men</hi> alſo to <hi>Dy ſuddenly.</hi> It may be a Privilege granted by GOD unto ſome of His moſt Favoured ones, to <hi>Dy</hi> ſuch a <hi>Death. Uzzah,</hi> Did he <hi>know his Time;</hi> In the Morning of the Day, when the <hi>Ark</hi> was to be carried into the City of <hi>David?</hi> or, The Prophet ſent unto <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> Did he <hi>know his Time,</hi> in the Morning of the Day when the <hi>Lion</hi> fell upon him? Others leſs obnoxious find it ſo.</p>
            <p>Yea, Secondly; THE Caſe of every <hi>Calamity</hi> is thus to be conſidered. <hi>Man knows not his Time,</hi> when that <hi>Calamity</hi> will befal him, wherein GOD will <hi>perform the Thing that is appointed for him.</hi> One that has an <hi>Husband,</hi> or a <hi>Father,</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, does not <hi>know,</hi> but before Night, the ſtate of a <hi>Widow,</hi> or an <hi>Orphan</hi> may be Theirs: The <hi>Sun</hi> may <hi>ſet at Noon</hi> with us, and leave us in a <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Darkneſs.</hi> A <hi>Job</hi> has his <hi>Houſe</hi> full of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> in the Morning; but he does not know that before Night, he ſhall have neither <hi>Houſe</hi> nor <hi>Children</hi> left unto him. In this evil World, every Man knows, that his Dependence may be like that of the Apoſtles, <hi>Afflictions wait for me:</hi> But
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002913_0012_0FE694B7460100A8"/>then he muſt add like the Apoſtle. Act. XX. 22. <hi>Not knowing the Things that ſhall befal me.</hi> And much more, <hi>Not knowing the Time when they ſhall befal me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was counted a Flight of Wiſdom; <hi>All that I know, is that I know nothing!</hi> It will be wiſely done of us to make the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in this point, as efficacious as may be upon us; <hi>This I know, that man knoweth not his Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE will enquire, Secondly; <hi>Whence is it, that we muſt not have the Fore-knowledge of the Times that are to paſs over us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Firſt; THERE is for it, the <hi>Firſt Reaſon</hi> of all things; the grand <hi>Reaſon of all Reaſons.</hi> The <hi>Sovereign will</hi> of GOD; That is <hi>Reaſon</hi> enough. The <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of the Great GOD will be maintained in it. It was a juſt Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; Pſal. XXXI. 15. <hi>O Lord, my Times are in thy Hand.</hi> It was a juſt Admonition; Act. I. 7. <hi>It is not for you to know the Times, which the Father has put in His own power.</hi> All that ſhall befall us in our <hi>Times,</hi> is Decreed by the GOD that made us. Now, the <hi>Decree</hi> is by our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign kept a <hi>Secret:</hi> For <hi>ſuch is His will and pleaſure,</hi> that it ſhould be ſo. There is a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous One, who is in our Tranſlation of the Bible, called, <hi>The Ancient of Days.</hi> The Original is, <hi>The Appointer of Times.</hi> 'Tis fit, that our <hi>Times</hi> remain <hi>unknown</hi> to any but Him that has the <hi>Appointing</hi> of the <hi>Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, there is more than this to be ſaid of the matter.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002913_0013_0FE694E9114DDAF8"/>
            <p>Firſt, IT is from the <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of our Gracious GOD unto the poor Children of Men, that they muſt not <hi>know their Time,</hi> nor what is to befall them in their <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may well be aſcribed unto the <hi>Pitty</hi> of our GOD, That we do <hi>not know our Time;</hi> For ſuch <hi>a knowledge</hi> would very much deſtroy the <hi>comfort</hi> of our <hi>Time;</hi> very much make for us a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable <hi>Time,</hi> Here, Here, moſt emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; <hi>He that increaſeth Knowledge increaſeth Sorrow.</hi> It would mightily take away the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> which we take in any thing under the Sun, if we knew aforehand, <hi>When</hi> and <hi>How</hi> we are to take our leave of that <hi>comfort.</hi> It is reported concerning <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 King. VIII. 11, 12. <hi>The man of God wept; And Hazael ſaid, Why weepeth my Lord? And he anſwered, Becauſe I know the evil, that thou wilt do.</hi> Thus, If a Man <hi>know the evil Time</hi> that is to befall himſelf, or his Houſe, and the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Evil,</hi> he would fall a <hi>weeping</hi> at it; into ſuch a <hi>weeping,</hi> that he would be able to find little Reliſh in the gifts of GOD unto him. The <hi>Anticipations</hi> of <hi>Trouble</hi> would break the Hearts of Men, if they knew before hand all the <hi>Trouble</hi> that is to come upon them, and the <hi>Time</hi> when it will come. Our Lord has told us; Math. VI. 34. <hi>Sufficient unto the Day is the evil thereof.</hi> It will be ſoon enough to <hi>know the evil,</hi> when the <hi>Day</hi> comes. If we ſhould <hi>know the evil</hi> before the <hi>Day,</hi> it would multiply exceedingly, &amp; keep growing &amp; growing, and ſcalding upon us; we ſhould be more ſcalded before it falls, than we ſhould be in the Actual Falling of it. It is a moſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002913_0014_0FE694B864725280"/>conſpicuous Difference between a <hi>Man,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Bruit.</hi> And I look upon it, as no deſpicable Argument, that <hi>Man</hi> is made for a World that is <hi>to come.</hi> A <hi>Man</hi> has a ſtrong Apprehenſion of what is <hi>to come :</hi> And what he <hi>knows</hi> is <hi>to come,</hi> he feels it Exquiſitely, he feels it Wonderfully. Oh! Should many a Man <hi>know, At ſuch a Time, ſhall my Houſe be laid in Aſhes;</hi> Or, <hi>At ſuch a Time, a Relative that is the Deſire of my Eyes will be taken from me:</hi> Or, <hi>at ſuch a Time I ſhall my ſelf be carried unto my long Home, and the Mourners for me ſhall walk about the Streets;</hi> Verily, this <hi>knowledge</hi> would cauſe an unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anguiſh in him. Such a <hi>knowledge</hi> of our <hi>Time,</hi> would cauſe a cry to be heard among us, like that which was once heard in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> A cry whereof they kept an Anniverſary comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration among them, for many Ages.</p>
            <p>Again; IT may be aſcribed unto the <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD, that we do <hi>not know our Time.</hi> For, hereby we come the better to <hi>Know</hi> and to <hi>Do,</hi> the <hi>Duty</hi> of our <hi>Time.</hi> Here is indeed an <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> that is very truly, and very juſtly, the <hi>Mother of Devotion.</hi> Our <hi>not knowing our Time,</hi> and the Things to come, does train us up, to a <hi>Filial Faith</hi> in the <hi>Fatherly Care,</hi> of the Lord, who only has all thoſe Things in His own Hands. We read; Jam. IV. 14, 15. <hi>Ye know not what ſhall be on the Morrow;—Ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this or that.</hi> We Refer our ſelves to the <hi>Will of GOD,</hi> with the more of <hi>Reſignation;</hi> a moſt humble and lovely <hi>Reſignation;</hi> becauſe we <hi>know not what ſhall be on
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002913_0015_0FE694F3F14C3188"/>the Morrow.</hi> And our <hi>Preparation,</hi> a Watchful and Prayerful <hi>Preparation</hi> for the worſt that may happen to us; This is promoted by our <hi>not knowing our Time,</hi> and what ſhall happen to us. It is preſſed upon us; Mar. XIII. 33. <hi>Take heed, watch, and pray; for ye know not when the Time is.</hi> Becauſe we <hi>know not the Time,</hi> when we or ours are to Dy, or what is to befall us; If this won't put us upon <hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi> and keep us in a way of Holy walking, I don't know what will! <hi>I know not my Time, nor what I am to ſee in a very Little Time.</hi> A Man of any ſenſe will think ſo. But Methinks, One that has the leaſt grain of ſenſe, muſt go on to think; <hi>I deſire now to keep alive the conſtant Fear of GOD, all the Time that He ſhall allow me; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be armed with Patience and Submiſſion, for all the uneaſy Things which in my Remaining Time I may find reſerved for me.</hi> Sirs, we muſt yield a <hi>Blindfold Obedience</hi> unto GOD; This <hi>Blindfold Obedience</hi> is a <hi>Well aim'd Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. THERE is a Dreadful <hi>Judgment</hi> of GOD, upon <hi>Wicked Men</hi> in it, that they muſt not <hi>know their Time.</hi> The wrath of GOD upon <hi>Wicked Men</hi> muſt overtake them. After what manner muſt it overtake them? We read; Pſal. XI. 6. <hi>Upon the wicked He ſhall rain ſnares— and an horrible tempeſt,</hi> We read; Pſal. LXXIII. 18, 19. <hi>Surely, Thou haſt ſet them in ſlippery places; — How are they brought into Deſolation, as in a Moment?</hi> Of the Wicked Man, we are told; Pſal. XXXVII. 13. <hi>The Lord ſhall laugh at him, for He ſees that his Day is coming.</hi> Why;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002913_0016_0FE694B8847C21E0"/>The Man does <hi>not ſee</hi> it himſelf! This gives a greater Triumph to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD, in the <hi>Day</hi> that comes upon him. The Vengeance of GOD upon a wicked Man, muſt come <hi>Irreſiſtibly.</hi> It comes <hi>at once,</hi> and that makes it the more <hi>Irreſiſtible.</hi> A <hi>Whirlwind</hi> of <hi>Wrath</hi> muſt come upon a wicked Man. A <hi>Whirlwind,</hi> that muſt riſe <hi>at once.</hi> It muſt gather <hi>Suddenly,</hi> It muſt be big with terrible <hi>Thunder.</hi> It muſt break him to pieces, before he has any <hi>Time</hi> to look about him. He muſt <hi>not know his Time.</hi> No; He muſt be <hi>Surprized</hi> by the Vengeance of GOD.</p>
            <p>BUT now, Let us make our more particular Improvement of theſe Faithful ſayings.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> SINCE our GOD will not let us <hi>know our Time,</hi> we muſt beware of <hi>curious Inquiries</hi> after the Future Events of our <hi>Time.</hi> There is a certain Prerogative, of which <hi>Vain Man that would be wiſe,</hi> is very ambitious; That is, that <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>Divination:</hi> Men would fain <hi>know their Time,</hi> and what is to come hereafter. And, how many curſed Arts of <hi>Divination</hi> have been invented for the gratification of this <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity!</hi> But, O vain Man, Thou lifteſt up thy hand unto a Forbidden <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> when thou art Inquiſitive about Futurities. Take the Rebuke of GOD; Deut. XXIX. 29. <hi>Secret Things belong unto the Lord our GOD.</hi> Indeed there are ſome <hi>Things to come,</hi> whereof we may commendably &amp; profitably be Inquiſitive; But they are ſuch Things as our GOD has <hi>Reveled</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002913_0017_0FE694F410055D38"/>unto us, in the Prophecies of our Bible. Theſe are Things, which <hi>Piety</hi> would make us <hi>Deſire to look into.</hi> The Tribe which has <hi>Underſtanding in the Times,</hi> is to be applauded for it. They who <hi>Deſcern not the Signs of the Times,</hi> to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided for it. But what is this, to the Impious and Criminal <hi>Curioſity</hi> of them, who will needs be prying into Faturities, which GOD will have to be concealed from us? I tell you, The <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemites</hi> might as well pry into the Ark of GOD. For Men to graſp after ſuch a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of their <hi>Time,</hi> as may indiſpoſe them for a modeſt wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Providence of GOD; Verily, 'Tis a great Iniquity. Hence, to conſult <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> and <hi>Fortune-tellers,</hi> about our <hi>Time,</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents thereof; 'Tis a Crime; As to <hi>Believe</hi> them, 'tis a Weakneſs, 'tis a Madneſs. Thoſe <hi>Prophetaſters;</hi> Pittiful <hi>Jugglers</hi> Mankind ſtrangely degrade and diſgrace themſelves, by ſuffering thoſe <hi>Jugglers</hi> to impoſe upon them. Indeed, they have no <hi>Rules</hi> worth a ſtraw to go by. If they do any thing to purpoſe, 'tis by a <hi>Satanical Impulſe.</hi> Their pretended <hi>Rules of Art</hi> are meer cheats. And the wretches themſelves uſually have ſuch <hi>Tragical,</hi> but <hi>Unforeſeen</hi> Things befalling of them, 'tis marvellous that the credit of the <hi>whole Sect</hi> is not for ever Extinguiſhed. Indeed, one can't but wonder, as the Roman Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor long ago did about their <hi>Augurs,</hi> how the wretches can look one another in the Face, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſcornful ſneer at the cheats which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to put upon the <hi>Vast Herd</hi> that pay Regard unto them. <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Indulge not the Vice of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002913_0018_0FE75E04B9A5EF40"/>a Mind Curious to <hi>know your Time.</hi> 'Tis a crime, that will ripen People for the puniſhments which uſe to come upon Sinners, when they have quite <hi>fill'd up the meaſure of their Iniquity.</hi> We have ſeen fearful Examples of Perſons, that have gone to <hi>Forbidden-ways</hi> of coming at the <hi>knowledge of their Time,</hi> and they have never ſeen one Good Day after it. When <hi>Soul</hi> was gone ſo far, as to conſult a <hi>Witch,</hi> Then the wrath of GOD would bear no longer with him!</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II</hi> WE muſt not <hi>know our Time;</hi> Then 'tis a Folly for us, to <hi>preſume</hi> upon a <hi>Time,</hi> which our GOD has given us no Aſſurance of. Such is the Folly of them, who preſume upon an <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Time,</hi> while they make it a <hi>Time</hi> of Impiety, a <hi>Time</hi> of Impenitence, a <hi>Day of Provocation.</hi> O preſumpteous ones, In all the word of GOD, where have you a promiſe of an <hi>Happy Time,</hi> for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly People, <hi>going on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes?</hi> Yea, ſuch is the Folly of all, who preſume that their <hi>Time</hi> will always be <hi>juſt what it is.</hi> For Men to Dream that all things will continue <hi>Long unaltered</hi> from what they are at this <hi>Time:</hi> Let me tell you, This. <hi>Dream</hi> is uſually a very dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Symptom. When Men are moſt <hi>Secure,</hi> and are Fearleſs of any <hi>Alteration</hi> upon their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; Then 'tis, that the Deadlieſt <hi>Alterations</hi> are moſt near unto them. An Old Man brags, he is as <hi>Well</hi> and <hi>Strong</hi> as he has been theſe <hi>Many Years;</hi> he hopes he ſhall yet ſee <hi>Many Years.</hi> He Dies <hi>this Year!</hi> Oh!

V. 3. <hi>When they ſay, peace and ſafety, then ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh.</hi> When and How is a <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> taken off?

Say with an eaſy Mind; <hi>I know not my Time; and I am content that I do not know it. But, O my God, I know in my Time nothing will befall me, but what thou ordereſt, and I chearfully refer all to thy ordering!</hi> But I will go on, and charge this Folly upon all that preſume on the <hi>Time to come.</hi> While <hi>Man knoweth not his Time,</hi> thou mayſt O Man <hi>know</hi> ſo much of thy <hi>Time,</hi> That the <hi>Preſent Time</hi> is thy <hi>only Time.</hi> All <hi>Thy Time,</hi> is <hi>This Time.</hi> Do not Rely upon a <hi>To-Morrow,</hi> or upon, <hi>A more convenient Seaſon,</hi> for any thing that thou art now to do for the Good of Thy ſelf or Others O <hi>Do with thy might, what thy Hand find to do.</hi> For <hi>know</hi> this; Thou <hi>knoweſt</hi> of no other <hi>Time</hi> for the doing of it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> WHAT now remains, but this Word of Command, <hi>Make all Ready!</hi> Oh! Let us <hi>make Ready</hi> for whatever <hi>Times</hi> are to paſs over us.</p>

            <p>BUT, my Friends, If your <hi>Time,</hi> when it comes find you unprepared, and <hi>alienated from the Life of GOD,</hi> what a Lamentable Condition do you fall into! what amazing Lamentations are you thrown into! The doleful Cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, Open to us!</hi> what will it avail. Twill be <hi>All too Late!

            <p>YEA, Conſider me as now coming to you with a <hi>Meſſage from the Dead,</hi> and a <hi>Meſſage</hi> directed more peculiarly and pathetically to the YOUNG PEOPLE among us; and a <hi>Meſſage</hi> which brings with it a Demand of EARLY PIETY, and their Immediate Converſion to GOD, and Eſpouſal to their SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>AN <hi>Early Death,</hi> and a very <hi>Sudden</hi> One too, ſhould never occur, without our Apprehending a <hi>Voice</hi> of the Glorious GOD unto the Survivers in it. Yea, <hi>The Voice of the Lord Cries to the City,</hi> and very particularly to the YOUNG PEOPLE of the City; The Children of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> will hearken unto it, and with awakened Souls Lift up their Cries to Heaven upon it; <hi>Oh! That before I am cut down, I may bring forth ſome Fruit unto GOD!</hi>

            <p>THE famous <hi>Waldo,</hi> whoſe Name has been ſo conſiderable among the <hi>Waldenſian Witneſſes</hi> of our Lord, was brought home to GOD, and made a Prayerful, Watchful, Fruitful Walker with GOD all the reſt of his Days, upon his beholding a Young Friend of his fall down <hi>Suddenly Dead</hi> before him. And what? Shall never any more, come to <hi>Think on</hi> their <hi>Ways,</hi> and <hi>make haſte</hi> into a <hi>Walk with GOD,</hi> upon ſuch an awakening Spectacle!</p>
            <p>THO' the <hi>Child Samuel,</hi> were a very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Child, and a bright Exemple of EARLY PIETY, we find, that no leſs than Three times over, the moſt Holy GOD, from the <hi>Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> call'd unto him, and he was not aware whoſe <hi>Voice</hi> it was; he was not ſenſible that there was the <hi>Voice</hi> of GOD in the call. Alas, 'Tis an Error whereto we are all too often liable; and the leſs of EARLY PIETY there is in <hi>Young People,</hi> the more liable they are unto it. <hi>Children,</hi> There is a <hi>Voice</hi> to you, in what you have ſeen; and a <hi>Voice</hi> as much directed unto you, as if you were like <hi>Samuel,</hi> by Name called upon: and it is a <hi>Voice</hi> wherein your EARLY PIETY is very audibly &amp; awfully called for. But are you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, whoſe <hi>Voice</hi> it is? 'Tis the <hi>Voice</hi> of the moſt Glorious GOD, and of a SAVIOUR <hi>wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that He may be Gracious</hi> to you. Oh! Liſten to the <hi>Voice,</hi> Anſwer to the <hi>Voice;</hi> and ſay, <hi>Lord, Speak, for thy Servant hears; and I will be thy Servant: I am Ready to comply with thy whole will in all hearty Obedience!</hi> But what, Oh! what is the <hi>Voice,</hi> to be thus hearkened to! The <hi>Voice</hi> is, <q>Oh! <hi>Immediately</hi> go thro' the <hi>Proceſs
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002913_0024_0FE694C2CBD59A20"/>of Repentance,</hi> which the <hi>Life of thy Soul</hi> depends upon! The <hi>Voice</hi> is; Oh! <hi>Immediately</hi> by coming into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD get thy <hi>Soul bound up in the Bundle of Life!</hi> The <hi>Voice</hi> is, 'Oh! <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Deny all Ungodlineſs &amp; Worldly Luſts,</hi> and come into the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of a <hi>Godly</hi> and a <hi>Sober</hi> and a <hi>Righteous Life!</hi> Thou <hi>knowest not</hi> how ſoon thy <hi>Time</hi> to do theſe <hi>Neceſſary Things</hi> may be over with thee.</q>

            <p>NO doubt, There are many <hi>Young People</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, who have ſome <hi>Convictions</hi> on their Minds, That things are not with them, as they <hi>ſhould be;</hi> and they muſt no longer continue as they are : Nor are they without ſome feeble <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, I will not offend any more. Children,</hi> Beware leſt you Sin away theſe <hi>Convictions,</hi> and a Penal <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Hardneſs</hi> be what you ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be for ever left unto. We read concerning <hi>Sampſon,</hi> That while he was yet in his <hi>Youth,</hi> perhaps a very <hi>Young</hi> Lad; Judg. XIII. 25. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times.</hi> Thus, there are many <hi>Young People,</hi> who feel the <hi>Spirit of the Lord beginning to move them at times;</hi> and they feel Pious <hi>Motions</hi> in their Hearts; They think, They will ſhake off their <hi>Vain Company;</hi> They will take up the <hi>Religion of the Cloſet;</hi> They will prepare for, and approach to, the <hi>Holy Table.</hi> But, Oh! Don't loſe theſe <hi>Motions;</hi> and let not the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> be provoked by your contempt of His <hi>Motions</hi> to <hi>Depart</hi> from you. <hi>Wo to them, when I depart from them, ſaith the Lord!</hi> It was among the Dying words, which the late Eminent Profeſſor of Theology in the Univerſity of St.

            <p>IN the <hi>Firmament</hi> of the Sacred Scriptures, what a Terrible Thunderclap is That! Prov I. 28. <hi>They ſhall ſeek me Early, and they ſhall not find me!</hi> Our Bleſſed REDEEMER, who is <hi>the Wiſdom of GOD,</hi> ſays, <hi>They that ſeek me Early ſhall find me.</hi> How and why is it then ſaid, <hi>They ſhall ſeek me Early, and they ſhall not find me!</hi> There is a ſad Solution of it. There is the SAVIOUS <hi>Early;</hi> and there is, the SINNERS <hi>Early.</hi> The propoſal of the SAVIOUR is, <hi>To Day if thou wilt hear my Voice. Yea, Aſſoon as thou dost hear of me, obey me, and ſubmit unto me. Betimes, Quickly, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, without any Delay, make a ſurrender of thy ſelf and thy All unto me.</hi> But now, the SINNER puts off his cares to <hi>get into the Righteouſneſs</hi> of GOD, until all his <hi>Youth</hi> have been ſpent in the <hi>way of his own heart,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> his had his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and he begins to feel <hi>Deſtruction coming as a Whirlwind</hi> upon him. <hi>Then</hi> he thinks 'tis <hi>Early</hi> enough to become a <hi>Seeker</hi> of GOD. This, This is the EARLY, which <hi>Mercy</hi> is denied unto. This the <hi>Early,</hi> which the Abuſed <hi>Patience</hi> of GOD will not permit the <hi>Sinner</hi> to find <hi>Mercy</hi> in!
