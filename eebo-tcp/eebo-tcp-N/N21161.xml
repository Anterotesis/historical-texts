            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>AMONG the obligations resulting to individuals from a state of civil society, we may estimate those duties which are assigned to us, upon particular occasions, by the spontaneous voice of our fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
            <p>OF this class, is the summons which I have received to appear before this enlightened and patriotic assembly!</p>
            <p>AN institution, which has for its object the commemoration of the feelings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which led to the declaration of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Independence, cannot but reflect the highest honour on those who have stepped forward to promote it. And your patriotism, my friends, could not have been more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently displayed, than by the resolution which you have passed, in your corporate capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for dedicating this day to so noble a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:027804_0004_0FD625A7173EB2E8"/>ANOTHER year hath now elapsed, since the return of this anniversary was first publicly celebrated within these walls. And when it is recollected that the reverend Gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. HITCHCOCK.</note> who then addressed you was so happily qualified to embellish the subject, and was himself a partaker in the scenes which he delineated, I cannot but experience an additional motive for intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exercise of your candid interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in favour of his successor.</p>
            <p>TO mark with precision the complicated events which paved the way to the American revolution, would exceed the limits of our duty, and is a task which falls with more propriety to the province of the historian. His business it is to unfold the first dawnings of freedom, to trace her in her feeble cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruscations, and to follow her progressive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to that ever memorable period when she burst forth into a blaze of irresistible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgence! When we penetrate into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of antiquity, when we review the causes which exiled our pious ancestors from their native shores, we cannot but discern the wisdom of that divine oeconomy which has ordained, that the wrongs of the oppressor shall recoil, in the event, to that corrupted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027804_0005_0FD625A83100B168"/>
source from whence they have derived their origin. Such a natural abhorrence has the mind to a state of servitude and subjection, that no attempts are esteemed too hazardous to escape from their galling fetters! An ocean tempestuous and untried, a wilderness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable and unexplored, an enemy savage and relentless, furnished no obstacles sufficient to damp the ardour of men, who were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to flee from the iron rod of religious oppression. The same undaunted spirit which actuated those heroic adventurers against the efforts of ecclesiastical tyranny, was manifested a century afterwards, by their descendants, against the evils of political usurpation:
"For from the first establishment of the English colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they had received impressions favourable to democratic forms of government; their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent situation forbade any inordinate am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition among their native sons, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of their society, abstracted as they were from the splendour and amusements of the old world, held forth but few allurements to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the residence of such from the mother country as aspired to hereditary honours."
Happily for the peace of mankind, such is the established order of things, that pride
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027804_0006_0FD625A99FC56858"/>
and ambition are commonly destined to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract their own purposes.—Great-Britain at the peace of seventeen hundred and sixty-three had arisen to the pinnacle of national glory! Her armies were considered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, and her fleets rode triumphantly and without a rival upon the ocean. Her terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial acquisitions were immense! and had she possessed the wisdom to have availed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of such splendid advantages, she might have been spared from the humiliation of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to a dismemberment, which now ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles at her heart, and which her pride will never suffer her to forget! But envious of the increasing greatness of her colonies, she readily seized on the most trifling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for subjecting them to her improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent exactions. Forgetful of Magna Charta, her own boasted palladium, she hesitated not to violate its elementary principles, in support of her unrighteous demands; and in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxysm of her folly she attempted an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment in the science of legislation, which was to monopolize all the benefits to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the colonies, without extending towards them those parental offices which were due as an equivalent. This wretched expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027804_0007_0FD625AE221A02D0"/>
prevailed for a time, and during its continuance the colonial trade was enjoyed exclusively by Great-Britain; and so immense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did this intercourse contribute to her wealth and aggrandisement, that in the year seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred and seventy-four, her export trade to the colonies alone amounted to six millions sterling, and upwards <note n="*" place="bottom">Parliamentary debates.</note>; a sum near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equal to that branch of her trade with the whole world beside! But the nation which is infatuated with her successes, knows no bounds to her ambitious desires! It was not sufficient for that unnatural parent to prey upon the vitals of the colonists (whom she had insidiously denominated her children) by draining from them their internal resources, without attempting at the same time to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a supreme controul over their persons.</p>
            <p>THE British parliament accordingly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
"that they had, and of right ought to have, power to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever."
Stamp acts, and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory acts, followed each other in swift suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and all dictated upon the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of systematic oppression. It is presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be unnecessary, at this time, to recite
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027804_0008_0FD625AFB9A6F110"/>
the multifarious and ridiculous catalogue of acts which received the sanction of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish parliament, for the subjugation of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>TO this refined audience it may be deemed sufficient to remark, that they are all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recorded, and will be faithfully trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to remote posterity, as monuments of indelible infamy to the British nation.</p>
            <p>TO men who had acquired just ideas of personal liberty, and the rights of property, the omnipotence of parliament had no ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. A resistance which had commenced in principle, was not to be suppressed by any means short of rational conviction. And in despair of accomplishing that, Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had recourse to those disgraceful aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries, which have ever been employed by despotic powers in the support of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary measures.</p>
            <p>FOREIGN mercenaries were transported across the Atlantic, for the diabolical purpose of embruing their hands in the best blood of American citizens. From the manner of that hostile procedure was deduced the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous policy, which was intended to be observed towards the American colonies. It was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027804_0009_0FD625B1CBA114D0"/>
to a corrupt and vindictive adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, that native Englishmen, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vile methods which had been used to alienate their affections, still retained a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal sentiment for their transatlantic bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; a sentiment which could not fail to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the unfit instruments of ministerial barbarity. At the arrival of those despicable hirelings upon the American shores, fresh causes of irritation ensued; and the crisis was at hand when the political contest was to be decided by an appeal to arms! The morning of the nineteenth of April, seventeen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and seventy-five, was destined to be the period of the actual commencement of hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and the Commons of Lexington were consecrated to immortality, by receiving the first effusions of American blood!</p>
            <p>WELL might one of the <note n="*" place="bottom">His Excellency SAMUEL ADAMS, <abbr>Esq</abbr> governor of Massachussetts. See Gordon's history of the American war.</note> patriots of that day exclaim, that such a glorious morning had never before beamed upon his view!</p>
            <p>HIS prophetic eye, glancing with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of lightning, penetrated into the great events which were to succeed; his anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were happily fulfilled, and as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027804_0010_0FD625B2BA9F0CB0"/>
for his eminent services, he now enjoys the most honourable of all testimonials, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and confidence of a free people!</p>
            <p>THE sanguinary system which had thus commenced on the part of Great-Britain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the just indignation of every American who coveted the salvation of his country; an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm, powerful as the electrical spark, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused itself from breast to breast, and the most vigorous preparations were made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the formidable approaches of tyranny, or to perish in the attempt!</p>
            <p>AS a preliminary step, it was deemed an object of the first importance with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, to dissolve in a formal manner the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of their political connexion with the kingdom of Great-Britain; to disclaim every idea of dependence upon any foreign power, and to assert their right to an equality among the nations of the earth!</p>
            <p>THE solemnity of this procedure was dictated by the
"respect which was due to the opinions of mankind,"
and carried with it an impression of the sacred principles upon which it was founded.—Such, my respected audience, was the declaration of American Independence! —an event which constitutes an important
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027804_0011_0FD625B642361DC8"/>
aera in the annals of mankind. And whether we view it as a measure distinguished for boldness of conception, the energy of its execution, or the magnanimity which it reflected upon those illustrious characters who ushered it into exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is equally entitled to our profoundest veneration! To behold a revolution in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment accomplished in so short a space of time, and without its usual concomitants of murder and devastation, is a phaenomenon which was reserved for the United States of America! But to preserve this new state of things;—to maintain the noble structure which had thus been reared by the hands of the people, against a host of external enemies, it was necessary to embark in a defensive system of warfare.</p>
            <p>THE glorious issue is known to us all—and my fellow-citizens will spare me from the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of those calamitous scenes, the recollection of which will serve but to awaken fresh pangs in the soul!</p>
            <p>BUT no motives can dissuade us from testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our respect for those immortal heroes who have fallen in the defence of the dearest rights of men!—Eager to be enrolled as the martyrs of American freedom, they have anticipated the inestimable blessing; and to the wisdom and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027804_0012_0FD625BA30911330"/>
firmness of their applauding countrymen, have they consigned the task of guaranteeing the enjoyment of that celestial boon.</p>
            <l>"How sleep the brave, who sink to rest</l>
            <l>"By all their country's wishes blest!</l>
            <l>"When spring, with dewy fingers cold,</l>
            <l>"Returns to deck their hallow'd mould,</l>
            <l>"She there shall dress a sweeter sod,</l>
            <l>"Than fancy's feet have ever trod."</l>
            <p>IN turning our attention to the man, who was designated from Heaven to conduct the armies of the United States through a long and perilous conflict, and who now presides at the head of their government with a sublimity of character unexampled in all former ages— what a crowd of reflections rush upon the mind! Absorbed with the mingled emotions of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and astonishment, we cannot render him the just tribute of our affections, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximating his exalted qualifications to the divine nature; nor without speeding a fervent ejaculation to the Throne of Grace, that he may long—very long, be spared by an indulgent providence, as a humiliation to the pride of kings, and as a preeminent example to this lower world, of the dignity to which human nature is capable of attaining!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:027804_0013_0FD6254023A75990"/>THE war, which had terminated so honourably for the United States, did not leave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an accumulation of those distresses, which are inseparable from contending nations. The public mind was too much engrossed by the magnitude of the prize which had been gained, to apply an effectual remedy to the evil, until it had arisen to an alarming height. But when the necessity became more obvious, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing pressure of emergencies, and disunion was about to erect her standard among the States, the republican virtues were again called into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The world was once more to be astonished by a new display of the American character! and the fact will scarcely be accredited by posterity, that thirteen discordant States, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in habits, and apparently divided by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, should mutally agree to sacrifice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private consideration, for the attainment of the general good.
"It was obviously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable in the federal government of these States, to secure all rights of independent so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individuals enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into society, must give up a share of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027804_0014_0FD625C146A7ACA0"/>
and circumstance, as on the object to be obtained."
In short, a form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was adopted which has rendered the United States happy at home, and respectable abroad. Under its auspicious administration, we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held an accession of glory which has excited the envy and admiration of the world. It is not our business to lavish encomiums up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flattering complexion of public affairs. An appeal to the existing state of the Union, will furnish the most conclusive evidence of the truth of facts.</p>
            <p>BUT imperfection is the lot of humanity, and national as well as individual blessings are not imparted without a tincture of alloy. In the career of our prosperity, we have not enjoyed an exemption from the intrigues of foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In the exercise of that implacable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment which has ever actuated the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of an insidious foe, the United States have been assailed by injuries in every shape; and to involve them in the unfathomable vortex of European corruption, no artifice has been left unemployed. Our commerce has been shamefully spoliated,—our territories are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, and in the insolence of her aggres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that haughty nation has even presumed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027804_0015_0FD625C270BFCC20"/>
to menace our Atlantic frontier with a naval armament!</p>
            <p>BUT in taking a survey of this patriotic assembly, our apprehensions are in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure removed by the confidence which their spirited appearance inspires. Among those who are ever ready to maintain the post of honour, we behold the disciples of Cincinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, a band of patriots, whose services have justly endeared them to their country.</p>
            <l>"Yes! social friends! undoubted is your claim,</l>
            <l>For patriot deeds deserve a patriot's name."</l>
            <p>WE also recognize those citizen soldiers, who, in assuming the badges of that estimable character, have pledged themselves to oppose a shield of valour against every hostile attempt upon the rights of man. And under the aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious guidance of that spirit of decision which marks the Executive of our own State, what flattering expectations may not be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this military assemblage, should the deprecated period arrive, when the clouds which obscure our political horizon shall be condensed to a storm!—As a subject which is infinitely dear to ourselves, we cannot forbear at this time from offering our warmest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027804_0016_0FD625C3E664EB20"/>
for the successful struggles of our magnanimous allies in the cause of freedom! Let us cherish a belief, that the stupendous revolution which they have so nobly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, has derived its origin from the immutable laws of nature. And if in emerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the abyss of barbarism, to which they have paid their homage for so many centuries, the finer traits of humanity should on some occasions appear to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, let us unite with sincerity in bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the event; but let us be equally sincere in ascribing the calamity to its proper source. Animated by the example of the new world, may our sister republic enjoy the same hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the result, which has awaited our own. In confident expectation that such will be the issue, and that the day is fast approaching, when the oppressed of all the earth shall rend their chains asunder,</p>
            <l>"Do thou, great LIBERTY, inspire our souls!</l>
            <l>"And make our lives in thy possession happy,</l>
            <l>"Or our deaths glorious in thy just defence!"</l>
