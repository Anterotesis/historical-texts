            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>He had, however, ſo ſtrong a deſire to be uſeful to Mr. Bragwell, that he at length determined to break through his practice and paſs the Sunday at his houſe. Mr. Worthy was ſurpriſed to find that though the Church bell was going, the breakfaſt was not ready, and expreſſed his wonder how this ſhould be the caſe in ſo induſtrious a family. Bragwell made ſome aukward excuſes. He ſaid his wife worked her ſervants ſo hard all the week, that even ſhe, as notable as ſhe was, a little relaxed from the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her demands on Sunday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and he owned that in a general way, no one was up early enough for church. He confeſſed that his wife commonly ſpent the morning in making puddings, pies, and cakes, to laſt through the week, as Sunday was the only leiſure time ſhe and her maids had. Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſoon ſaw an uncommon buſtle in the houſe. All hands were buſy. I was nothing but baking, and boiling
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037134_0003_100C9266B0025FF0"/>
and frying, and roaſting, and running, and ſcolding, and eating. The boy was kept from Church to clean the plate, the man to gather the fruit, the miſtreſs to make the cheeſe-cakes, the maids to dreſs the dinner, and the young ladies to dreſs themſelves.</p>
            <p>The truth was, Mrs. Bragwell, who had heard much of the order and good management of Mr. Worthy's family, but who looked down with diſdain upon them as far leſs rich than herſelf, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to indulge her vanity on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion. She was determined to be even with Mrs. Worthy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whoſe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Bragwell had been ſo loud, and felt no ſmall pleaſure in the hope of making her gueſt uneaſy, when he ſhould be ſtruck with the diſplay both of her ſkill and her wealth. Mr. Worthy was indeed ſtruck to behold as large a dinner as he had been uſed to ſee at a Juſtice's meeting. He, whoſe frugal and pious wife had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed him only to ſuch a ſunday's dinner as could be dreſſed without keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one from church, when he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the loaded table of his friend, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of feeling that envy which theſe
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037134_0004_100C92683A4BB4C0"/>
grand preparations were meant to raiſe, felt nothing but diſguſt at the vanity of his friend's wife, mixed with much thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for the piety of his own.</p>
            <p>After having made the dinner wait a long time, the Miſs Bragwells marched in, dreſſed as if they were going to the Aſſize Ball; they looked very ſcornful at having been ſo hurried; though they had been dreſſing ever ſince they got up, and their fond father, when he ſaw them ſo fine, forgave all their impertinence, and caſt an eye of triumph on Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who felt he had never loved his own humble daughters ſo well as at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the whole party went to church. To do them juſtice, it was indeed their common practice once a day, when the weather was good, and the road neither duſty nor dirty, when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter did not begin too early, when the young Ladies had not been diſappointed of their new bonnets on the Saturday night, and when they had no ſmart com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the houſe who rather wiſhed to ſtay at home. When this laſt was the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037134_0005_100C9269CB28AC98"/>
caſe, which, to ſay the truth, happened pretty often, it was thought a piece of good manners to conform to the humour of the gueſts. Mr. Bragwell had this day forborne to aſk any of his uſual company, well knowing that their vain and worldly converſation would only ſerve to draw on him ſome new reprimand from his gueſt.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bragwell and her daughters pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up as uſual a good deal of acquaintance at church. Many compliments paſſed, and much of the news of the week was retailed before the ſervice began. They waited with impatience for the leſſons as a licenſed ſeaſon for whiſpering, and the ſubject begun during the leſſons was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while they were ſinging. The young Ladies made an appointment for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon with a friend in the next pew, while their Mamma took the opportunity of enquiring the character of a Dairy Maid, which ſhe obſerved with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to her own good management, would ſave time on a week day.</p>
            <p>Mr. Worthy, who found himſelf quite in a new world, returned home with his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037134_0006_100C926C6571A1E0"/>
friend alone. In the evening he ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aſk Bragwell, if he did not, on a Sunday night at leaſt, make it a cuſtom to read and pray with his family. Bragwell told him he was ſorry to ſay he had no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at home, elſe he ſhould like to do it for the ſake of example. But as his ſervants worked hard all the week, his wife was of opinion that they ſhould then have a little holiday. Mr. Worthy preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it home upon him, if the utter neglect of his ſervant's principles was not likely to make a heavy article in his final ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: and aſked him if he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the too general liberty of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, jaunting and diverting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on Sunday evenings, was not often found to produce the worſt effects on the morals of ſervants and the good order of families? "I put it to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience," ſaid he, "Mr. Bragwell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sunday, which was meant as a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and a benefit, is not, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly kept, turned into the moſt miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous part of the week, by the ſelfiſh kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of maſters, who, not daring to ſet their ſervants about any public work, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot them that day to follow their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that they themſelves may with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037134_0007_100C926E53557E50"/>
more rigour refuſe them a little indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and a reaſonable holiday in the working part of the week, which a good ſervant has now and then a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect." Thoſe maſters who will give them half or all of the Lord's day, will not ſpare them a ſingle hour of a working day. <hi>Their work must</hi> be done; GOD's work may be let alone."</p>
            <p>Mr. Bragwell owned that Sunday had produced many miſchiefs in his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. That the young men and maids, having no eye upon them, frequently went to improper places with other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants turned adrift like themſelves. That in theſe parties the poor girls were too frequently led aſtray, and the men got to public houſes and fives-playing. But it was none of his buſineſs to watch them. His family only did as others do; indeed it was his wife's concern; and as ſhe was ſo good a manager on other days, that ſhe would not ſpare them an hour even to viſit a ſick father or mother, it would be hard ſhe ſaid, if they might not have Sunday afternoon to themſelves, and ſhe could not blame them for making the moſt of it. Indeed ſhe was ſo indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037134_0008_100C926FDEADCE38"/>
in this particular, that ſhe often excuſed the men from going to church that they might ſerve the beaſts, and the maids that they might get the milking done before the holiday part of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me on. She would not indeed hear of any competition between doing <hi>her</hi> work and taking their pleaſure; but when the difference lay between their going to church and taking their pleaſure, he muſt ſay that for his wife, ſhe was always inclined to the good-natured ſide of the queſtion. She is ſtrict enough in keeping them ſober, becauſe drunkenneſs is a coſtly ſin, and to do her juſtice, ſhe does not care how little they ſin at her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>"Well," ſaid Mr. Worthy, "I always like to examine both ſides fairly, and to ſee the different effects of oppoſite practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; now, which plan produces the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhare of comfort to the maſter and of profit to the ſervants in the long run? Your ſervants, 'tis likely, are very much attached to you; and very fond of living where they get their own way in ſo great a point."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037134_0009_100C9271CA630EC0"/>"O, as to that," replied Bragwell, "you are quite out. My houſe is a ſcene of diſcord, mutiny and diſcontent. And though there is not a better manager in England than my wife, yet ſhe is always changing her ſervants, ſo that every Quarter-day is a ſort of Gaol Delivery at my houſe; and when they go off, as they often do, at a moment's warning, to own the truth, I often give them money pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, that they may not carry my wife before the Juſtice to get their wages.</p>
            <p>"I ſee," ſaid Mr. Worthy, "that all your worldly compliances do not procure you even worldly happineſs. As to my own family, I take care to let them ſee that their pleaſure is bound up with their duty, and that what they may call my ſtrictneſs, has nothing in view but their ſafety and happineſs. By this means I commonly gain their love as well as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their obedience. I know that with all my care I am liable to be diſappointed, from the corruption that is in the world through ſin. But whenever this happens, ſo far from encouraging me in remiſſneſs, it only ſerves to quicken my zeal. If by God's bleſſing, my ſervant turns out a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037134_0010_100C9274385B1BD8"/>
good Chriſtian, I have been an humble inſtrument in his hand of ſaving a ſoul committed to my charge."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bragwell came home, but brought only one of her daughters with her, the other, ſhe ſaid, had given them the ſlip, and was gone with a young friend, and would not return for a day or two. Mr. Bragwell was greatly diſpleaſed, as he knew that young friend had but a ſlight character, and kept bad acquaintances. Mrs. Bragwell came in all hurry and buſtle, ſaying, if her family did not "go to-bed with the Lamb" on Sundays, when they had nothing to do, how could they "riſe with the Lark" on Mondays, when ſo much was to be done.</p>
            <p>Mr. Worthy had this night much matter for reflection. "We need not." ſaid he, "go into the great world to look for diſſipation and vanity. We can find both in a farm-houſe. As for me and my houſe," continued he, "we will ſerve the Lord every day, but eſpecially on Sundays. It is the day which the Lord hath made: hath made for himſelf; we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in it, and conſider the religious uſe of it not only as a duty but as a privilege."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037134_0011_100C92762082E040"/>Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy ſet out early on the next morning on their way to the Golden Lion, a ſmall Inn in a neighbouring market town. As they had time before them, they had agreed to ride ſlowly, that they might converſe on ſome uſeful ſubject; but here, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, they had two opinions about the ſame thing. Mr. Bragwell's notion of an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubject was, ſomething by which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was to be got, and a good bargain ſtruck. Mr. Worthy was no leſs a man of buſineſs than his friend. His ſchemes were wiſe and his calculations juſt; his reputation for integrity and good ſenſe made him the common judge and umpire in his neighbours affairs, while no one paid a more exact attention to every tranſaction of his own. But the buſineſs of getting money was not with him the firſt, much leſs was it the whole concern of the day. Every morning when he roſe, he remembered that he had a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to worſhip as well as a family to maintain. Religion however, never made him neglect buſineſs, though it ſometimes led him to poſtpone it. He uſed to ſay, no man had any reaſon to expect God's bleſſing through the day who did not aſk
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037134_0012_100C9277ABCF1A68"/>
it in the morning. But he had not the leſs ſenſe, ſpirit, and activity when he was among men abroad, becauſe he had firſt ſerved God at home.</p>
            <p>As theſe two Farmers rode along, Mr. Worthy took occaſion from the fineneſs of the day, and the beauty of the country through which they paſſed to turn the diſcourſe to the goodneſs of God and our infinite obligations to him. He knew that the tranſition from thankſgiving to prayer would be natural and eaſy, and he therefore ſlid, by degrees, into that important ſubject; and he obſerved that ſecret prayer was a duty of univerſal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, which every man had it in his power to fulfil, and which he ſeriouſly believed was the ground work of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious practice, and of all devout affections.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bragwell felt conſcious that he was very negligent and irregular in the performance of this duty, he conſidered it as a mere ceremony, or at leaſt as a duty which might give way to the ſlighteſt temptation of drowſineſs at night, or of buſineſs in the morning. As he knew he did not live in the conſcientious perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this practice, he tried to ward
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037134_0013_100C927999939B80"/>
off the ſubject, knowing what a home way his friend had of putting things. At laſt he ſaid, he certainly thought private prayer a good cuſtom, eſpecially for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have time, and that thoſe who were ſick, or old, or out of buſineſs, could not do better, but that, for his part, he believed much of theſe ſort of things was not expected from men in active life.</p>

               <p>I ſhould think Mr. Bragwell, that thoſe who are moſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to temptation ſtand moſt in need of prayer; now there are few methinks who are more expoſed to temptation than men in buſineſs, for thoſe muſt be in moſt danger, at leaſt from the world, who have moſt to do with it. And if this be true, ought we not to prepare ourſelves in the cloſet for the trials of the market, the field, and the ſhop?</p>

               <p>For my part, I think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is the whole of Religion, and if the maſter of a family is orderly, and regular, and goes to church, he does every thing which can be required of him, and no one has a right to call him to account for any thing more.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, truly I do. But I don't believe it <hi>merely</hi> becauſe I read it in Geneſis. I know, indeed, that I am bound to believe every of the word of God. But I have ſtill an additional rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for believing in the fall of the firſt man.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Have you indeed? Now, I can't gueſs what that can be.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Why my own obſervation of what is in myſelf teaches me to believe it. It is not only the third chapter of Geneſis which convinces me of the truth of the fall, but alſo the ſinful inclinations which I find in my own heart. This is one of thoſe leading truth's of Chriſtianity of which I can never doubt a moment, firſt, becauſe it is abundantly expreſſed or implied in Scripture; and next, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conſciouſneſs of the evil nature I carry about with me confirms the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine beyond all doubt. Beſides, is it not ſaid in Scripture that by one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

into the world, and that "all we, like ſheep, have gone aſtray; that by one man's diſobedience many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners," and ſo again in twenty more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that I could tell you of.</p>

               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I never thought of this. But is not this a very melancholy ſort of doctrine, Mr. Worthy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>It is melancholy, indeed, if we ſtop here. But while we are deploring this ſad truth, let us take comfort from another, that "As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive."</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I remember I thought thoſe very fine words, when I heard them ſaid over my poor father's grave. But as it was in the Burial of the dead, I did not think of taking it to myſelf, for I was then young and hearty, and in little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of dying, and I have been ſo buſy ever ſince, that I have hardly had time to think of it.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>And yet the ſervice pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the burial of all who die, is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn admonition to all who live. It is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037134_0021_100C9289759C1348"/>
there ſaid, as indeed the Scripture ſays alſo, "I am the reſurrection and the life, whoſoever <hi>believeth in me</hi> ſhall never die, but I will raiſe him up at the laſt day." Now do you think you <hi>believe in Christ,</hi> Mr. Bragwell?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Why, all this leads me back to the ground from which we ſet out. I mean the duty of prayer; for if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we have an evil nature within us, and that we ſtand in need of God's grace to help us, and a Saviour to redeem us, we ſhall be led of courſe to pray for what we ſo much need.</p>

               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but don't you think, Mr. Worthy, that you good folks who make ſo much of prayer, have lower no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than we of the wiſdom of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? you think he wants to be informed of the things you tell him; whereas, I take for granted that he knows them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that, being ſo good as he is, he will give me every thing he ſees fit to give me without my aſking it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>God, indeed, who knows all things, knows what we want before we aſk him, but ſtill has he not ſaid, that with prayer and ſupplication we muſt make known our requeſts unto him." Prayer is the way in which God hath ſaid that his favour muſt be ſought. It is the channel through which he hath declared it is his ſovereign will and pleaſure that his bleſſings ſhould be conveyed to us. What aſcends up in prayer deſcends again to us in bleſſings. It is like the rain which juſt now fell, and which had been drawn up from the ground in vapours to the clouds before it deſcended from them to the earth in that refreſhing ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Beſides prayer has a good effect on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> minds: it tends to excite a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037134_0023_100C928DA8706EA8"/>
right diſpoſition towards God in us. But above all, it is the way to get the good things we want. "Aſk," ſays the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "and ye ſhall receive."</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bragwell.</speaker>
               <p>Now that is the very thing which I was going to deny. For the truth is, men don't always get what they aſk; I believe if I could get a good crop for aſking it I ſhould pray oftener than I do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Sometimes Mr. Bragwell, men "aſk and receive not, becauſe they aſk amiſs." They aſk worldly bleſſings perhaps when they ſhould aſk ſpiritual ones. Now the latter, which are the good things I ſpoke of, are always granted to thoſe who pray to God for them, though the former are not. I have obſerved in the caſe of ſome worldly things I have ſought for, that the grant of my prayer would have cauſed the miſery of my life.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Worthy.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly; but then I try to mend as to the object of my prayers.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037134_0024_100C928F33EDFDB8"/>
pray for God's bleſſing and favor, which is better than riches.</p>

               <p>To cut the matter ſhort, I aſk then whether prayer is not poſitively commanded in the Goſpel. When this is the caſe, we can never diſpute about the neceſſity or the duty of a thing, as we may when there is no ſuch command. Here however let me juſt add alſo, that a man's prayers may be turned to no ſmall uſe in the way of diſcovering to him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is amiſs in his life.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037134_0026_100C9293076DA068"/>
muſt that be, no act of which you dare beg God to proſper and bleſs. If once you can bring yourſelf to believe that it is your bounden duty to pray-for God's bleſſing on your day's work, you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly grow careful about paſſing ſuch a day as you may ſafely aſk his bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The remark may be carried to ſports, diverſions, company. A man who once takes up the ſerious uſe of prayer, will ſoon find himſelf obliged to abſtain from ſuch diverſions, occupations and ſocieties, as he cannot reaſonably deſire that God will bleſs to him; and thus he will ſee himſelf compelled to leave off either the practice or the prayer. Now, Mr. Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, I need not aſk you which of the two he that is a real Chriſtian will give up.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Mr. Bragwell began to feel that he had not the beſt of the argument, and was afraid he was making no great figure in the eyes of his friend. Luckily however, he was relieved from the difficulty into which the neceſſity of making ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer muſt have brought him, by finding they were come to the end of their little journey; and he never he held the Bunch of Grapes, which decorated the Sign of the Golden Lion, with more real ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:037134_0027_100C92954F6BB160"/>Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Golden Lion. It was market day: the inn, the yard, the town was all alive. Mr. Bragwell was quite in his element. He felt himſelf the principal man in the company. He had three great objects in view, the ſale of his land, the letting Mr. Worthy ſee how much he was looked up to by ſo many ſubtſantial people, and the ſhewing theſe people what a wiſe man his moſt intimate friend Mr. Worthy was. It was his way to try to borrow a little credit from every perſon and every thing he was connected with, and by that credit to advance his intereſt and increaſe his wealth.</p>
            <p>The Farmers met in a large room, and while they were tranſacting their various concerns, thoſe whoſe purſuits were the ſame naturally herded together. The Tanners were drawn to one corner, by the common intereſt which they took in bark, and hides. A uſeful debate was carrying on at another little table, whether the practice of <hi>sowing</hi> wheat or of <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it were moſt profitable. Another ſet were diſputing whether horſes or oxen were beſt for plows. Thoſe who were
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037134_0028_100C9296DC437940"/>
concerned in Canals, ſought the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of other Canallers; while ſome who were intereſted in the new bill for Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, wiſely looked out for ſuch as knew moſt about waſte lands.</p>
            <p>Mr. Worthy was pleaſed with all theſe ſubjects, and picked up ſomething uſeful on each. It was a ſaying of his, that moſt men underſtood ſome one thing, and that he who was wiſe would try to learn from every man ſomething on the ſubject he beſt knew; but Mr. Worthy made a further uſe of the whole. "What a pity it is," ſaid he, "that Chriſtians are not as deſirous to turn their time to as good account as men of buſineſs are! When ſhall we ſee religious perſons as anxious to derive profit from the experience of others as theſe Farmers? When ſhall we ſee them as eager to turn their time to good account? While I approve theſe men for not being <hi>slothful in business,</hi> let me improve the hint by being alſo <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in spirit.</hi>"</p>
            <p>When the hurry was a little over, Mr. Bragwell took a turn on the Bowling-green. Mr. Worthy followed him, to aſk
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037134_0029_100C9298F0D5F7E8"/>
why the ſale of the eſtate was not brought forward. "Let the Auctioneer proceed to buſineſs," ſaid he; "the company will be glad to get home by day light. I ſpeak moſtly with a view to others for you, I do not think of being a purchaſer myſelf." —"I know it," ſaid Bragwell, "or I would not be ſuch a fool as to let the cat out of the bag. But is it poſſible (proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he with a ſmile of contempt) that you ſhould think I will ſell my eſtate before dinner? Mr. Worthy, you are a clever man at books and ſuch things; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps can make out an account on paper in a handſomer manner than I can. But I never found much to be got by fine writing. As to figures, I can carry enough of them in my head to add, divide, and multiply more money than your learning will ever give you the fingering of. You may beat me at a book, but you are a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry child at a bargain. Sell my land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner, indeed!"</p>
            <p>Mr. Worthy was puzzled to gueſs how a man was to ſhew more wiſdom by ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a piece of ground at one hour than another, and deſired an explanation. Bragwell felt rather more contempt for
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037134_0030_100C929B75C80930"/>
his underſtanding than he had ever done before. "Look'ee, Mr. Worthy," ſaid he, "I do not know that knowledge is of any uſe to a man unleſs he has ſenſe enough to turn it to good account. Men are my books, Mr. Worthy, and it is by reading, ſpelling, and putting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to good purpoſe, that I have got up in the world. I ſhall give you a proof of this to-day. Theſe Farmers are moſt of them come to the Lion with a view of purchaſing this bit of land of mine, if they ſhould like the bargain. Now, as you know a thing can't be any great bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the buyer and the ſeller too, to them and to me, it becomes me, as a man of ſenſe, who has the good of his family at heart to ſecure the bargain to myſelf. I would not cheat any man, Sir, but I think it fair enough to turn his weakneſs to my own advantage; there is no law againſt that you know; and this is the uſe of one man's having more ſenſe than another. So, whenever I have a bit of land to ſell, I always give a handſome dinner, with plenty of punch and ſtrong beer. We fill up the morning with other buſineſs, and I carefully keep back any talk about the purchaſe till we have dined.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037134_0031_100C929D63BAA6F8"/>
At dinner we have of courſe a bit of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics. This puts moſt of us into a paſſion, and you know anger is thirſty. Beſides, Church and King naturally bring on a good many other toaſts. Now, as I am Maſter of the feaſt, you know it would be ſhabby in me to ſave my liquor, ſo I puſh about the glaſs one way and the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard the other, till all my company are as merry as kings. Every man is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee what a fine hearty fellow he has to deal with, and Mr. Bragwell receives a thouſand compliments. By this time they have gained as much in good humour as they have loſt in ſober judgment, and this is the proper moment for ſetting the Auctioneer to work, and this I commonly do to ſuch good purpoſe, that I go home with my purſe a ſcore or two of pounds heavier than if they had not been warmed by their dinner. In the morning men are cool and ſuſpicious, and have all their wits about them; but a cheerful glaſs cures all diſtruſt. And, what is lucky, I add to my credit as well as my pocket, and get more praiſe for my dinner than blame for my bargain."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:037134_0032_100C929EF04FC088"/>Mr. Worthy was ſtruck with the abſurd vanity which could tempt a man to own himſelf guilty of an unfair action for the ſake of ſhewing his wiſdom. He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to expreſs his diſapprobation, when they were told dinner was on table. They went in and were ſoon ſeated. All was mirth and good cheer. Every body agreed that no one gave ſuch hearty din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as Mr. Bragwell. Nothing was pitiful where he was maſter of the Feaſt. Bragwell who looked with pleaſure on the excellent dinner before him, and enjoyed the good account to which he ſhould turn it, heard their praiſes with delight, and caſt an eye on Worthy, as much as to ſay, "Who is the wiſe man now?" Having a mind to make his friend talk, he turned to him, ſaying, "Mr. Worthy, I believe no people enjoy life more than men of our claſs. We have money and power, we live on the fat of the land, and have as good a right to gentility as the beſt."</p>
            <p>"As to gentility, Mr. Bragwell," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Worthy, "I am not ſure that this is among the wiſeſt of our pretenſions. But I will ſay that ours is a creditable and reſpectable buſineſs. In ancient times,

Farming was the employment of Princes and Patriarchs; and, now-a-days, an honeſt, humane, ſenſible, Engliſh yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I will be bold to ſay, is not only a very uſeful but an honourable character. But then he muſt not merely think of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying life,</hi> as you call it, but he muſt think of living up to the great ends for which he was ſent into the world. A Wealthy Farmer not only has it in his power to live well, but to do much good. He is not only the father of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but of his workmen, his dependents, and the poor at large, eſpecially in theſe hard times. He has it in his power to raiſe into credit all the pariſh offices which have fallen into diſrepute by getting in to bad hands; and he can convert, what have been falſely thought mean offices into very important ones, by his juſt and Chriſtian like manner of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ing them. An upright Juryman, a conſcientious Conſtable, a humane Overſeer, an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Elector, an active Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of a Work-houſe, a juſt Arbritrator in public diſputes, a kind Counſellor in private troubles, ſuch a one, I ſay, fills up a ſtation in ſociety no leſs neceſſary, and, as far as it reaches, ſcarcely leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant

than that of a Magiſtrate, a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of a County, or even a Member of Parliament. That can never be a ſlight or a degrading office, on which the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a whole pariſh may depend."</p>
            <p>Bragwell, who thought the good ſenſe of his friend reflected credit on himſelf, encouraged Worthy to go on, but he did it in his own vain way. "Aye, very true, Mr. Worthy," ſaid he; "You are right; a leading man in our claſs ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"True, replied Mr. Worthy, "he ſhould be an example of ſimplicity, ſobriety and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of manners. But he will do well, added he, not to affect a frothy gentility, which will fit but clumſily upon him. If he has money let him ſpend prudently, lay up moderately for his children, and give liberally to the poor. But let him rather ſeek to dignify his own ſtation by his virtues than to get above it by his v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Young Wilſon, the worthy grazier, whom Miſs Bragwell had turned off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not underſtand French dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thanked Mr. Worthy for what he had ſaid, and hoped he ſhould be the better for it as long as he lived, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his leave to be better acquainted.

This was one of Mr. Bragwell's nice calculations, and this was the ſort of ſkill on which he ſo much valued himſelf.</p>
