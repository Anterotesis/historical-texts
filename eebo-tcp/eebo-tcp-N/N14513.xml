            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE following pages contain some facts, thrown together by a few gentlemen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in St. Augustine, and was originally intended for a news-paper. It however being afterwards suggested, that by adding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, addresses, and other authentick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, herewith printed, by way of appendix, it might serve to inform our fellow subjects in Great-Britain more fully, with the conduct of the inhabitants of East-Florida during the war. It makes its appearance as a pamphlet, flating their case, and assigning some reasons, founded, it is humbly conceived, on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the constitution and natural justice, why they should be compensated by the nation, for the losses they must sustain, by the cession of the province to the crown of Spain. Should it answer no other purpose, it will at least serve to shew, that the inhabitants of East-Florida continued unmoved in their fidelity and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their parent country, at a time of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral revolt; that the strongest cement of civil society, that of their allegiance to their natural prince, was at no period or moment lost sight of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:018392_0003_0FA708F35D67A620"/>
or disregarded by them; and that the same senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and principles influenced their conduct, throughout all the vicissitudes of the war. It may also tend to awaken in some part of the nation, the emotions of sympathy and regard for men, whose loyalty could not be shaken in the day of trial; and who must now apply to the justice of the nation, to receive compensation for the property they are obliged to forego by the peace.</p>
            <p>Although they are sensible, their remarks are none of them new; yet if they have been so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to arrange with precision, such arguments and doctrines as are furnished by our constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and should this little piece any wise tend to elucidate or place in a clear point of view, the claims of the inhabitants to compensation, which they conceive to be just, the principal object the compilers had in view, will be attained.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE INHABITANTS OF E. FLORIDA.</head>
            <p>BY the Treaty of Peace, concluded at Paris in 1763, East-Florida being ceded and secured to the Crown and Empire of Great-Britain, his present Majesty was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased to issue his Royal Proclamation, notifying the great benefits and advantages, that his Subjects would derive to themselves, by settling there; holding out considerable encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and giving every assurance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for their liberties and properties; and, that they should, to the fullest extent, enjoy all the invaluable privileges of British Subjects. A Civil Government was established, and many persons from Great-Britain, and other parts of his Majesty's dominions, resorted thither; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained grants of lands, agreeable to certain terms prescribed by Government, which they settled and improved, and on which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed great labour and expence. Others resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Great-Britain, obtained letters patent for lands, which they also caused to be settled; and in various kind of improvement, laid out
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:018392_0005_0FA708F4C132AFB8"/>
large sums of money, in hopes of future gain and permanency, founded on the assurances of Government.</p>
            <p>The Colony began to flourish, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to reap the fruits of their industry, when, in the year 1775, the spirit of revolt manifested itself in North-America. East-Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida, however, continued unshaken in her loyalty, though strongly solicited to join in the confederation; and in the year 1776, when a storm appeared to be gathering in Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, which threatened Florida, the Inhabitants, at the instance of the Governour, signified by proclamation, met, chose, officers, embodied themselves, and chearfully prepared to make a defence. And in 1777, his Excellency found himself supported by a body of Volunteers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of about two hundred men, pretty well trained, armed and cloathed at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; who, when occasion required, and at particular periods, were continued on constant duty, occupied posts as far as Picolata; and, in short, were ready to devote their lives to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Sovereign, without pay or reward.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of the year 1775, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency issued proclamations, inviting all such loyal Americans as wished to quit the revolted colonies, on account of their principles, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Royal Cause, to resort to Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; and gave the most solemn assurances, on the part of Great-Britain, that they should meet a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

of which, families and individuals resorted to St. Augustine, and expended the wreck of their fortunes in purchases and improvements. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unfortunate Loyalists were also banished to Florida, at the evacuations of Savannah and Charlestown; who also settled, erected build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and made purchases, previous to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the preliminary articles of Peace.</p>
            <p>In the year 1781, when a Legislature was formed, both Houses, in the first moments of their existence, avowed in the fullest manner, in addresses to the Governour, their principles of loyalty; and acknowledged the supreme, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable authority of Parliament over the Colony. And they also, by act of Assembly, granted a perpetual revenue to the Crown, of two and an half per cent. on certain articles imported. They also, amongst other acts to strengthen the hands of Government, passed a law, empowering the Governour to call forth their Negroes, for the purpose of erecting and repairing publick works and fortifications, for the defence of the Colony: And his Excellency did, on more occasions than one, exercise the authorities so vested in him. They also repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly expressed, in addresses and resolves, their attachment, zeal, and affection for his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's sacred person, and the happy constitution of government, under which they lived; and tendered life, fortune, and every thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that was dear, in support of their declaration.</p>
            <p>Previous to the calling of an Assembly, as a Militia, they repelled the enemy, when inroa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

were attempted; and at one time, when a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar siege was planned in Georgia, and all Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was invited to share in the spoils of East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Florida, the then Rebels having advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross St. Mary's river, were beat back, and frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in their designs, chiefly by the spirited exertions of the Militia embodied by Governour Tonyn, for the defence of East-Florida, and paid by Government, under the conduct and command of that active and enterprising officer Lieutenant Colonel Brown. At another period, when it became necessary for his Majesty's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the defence of the Province, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp the Regular Troops, which was done by Lieutenant-Colonel Glazier, the Inhabitants, as a Militia, without pay, rations, or arms, from Government, chearfully mounted the guards, patroled, and did all the town duty; as indeed they did on other occasions, when deemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>In short, the Inhabitants did, at all times, with their purses and personal services, exert their utmost to support the honour, dignity, and sovereignty of their King and Parent Country, in their rightful possession. And it is asserted, that no one instance can be produced, wherein they were wanting in their duty as Subjects, or wherein they did not, with alacrity, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and, it may be added, with the warmest zeal, support the cause of Government. With the aid of his Majesty's Troops, they have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Divine Providence, weathered every storm incident to War; and at the expiration of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;

years struggle, Peace hath taken place, and the Colony is ceded and guarantied to the Crown of Spain; to be delivered up to such Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Commissaries, as shall be empowered by his Most Catholick Majesty to receive it: And the Inhabitants may withdraw with their move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects, and are at liberty to fell their real estates, if they can, to his Catholick Majesty's subjects. They, in consequence, are now prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to depart, in quest of new settlements, in some other part of their Sovereign's dominions.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing State of the Case, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Questions naturally arise.</p>
            <p>Have the Inhabitants of East-Florida dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged faithfully, all the duties of liege Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? If it should be found they have, it is then asked, What return is the Subject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, for a faithful discharge of his allegiance? Can the Subject be divested of his property, under the British Constitution, by the King, or by the Legislature, or by any man or set of men, without receiving a recom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent for it? Will the Inhabitants of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince be divested of their property, by the terms of Peace? If they will, are they then to have no compensation for their losses? Is this to be the reward of their past services and ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d?</p>
            <p>In order to know, whether the Inhabitants of East-Florida have faithfully discharged all the duties of liege Subjects, it will be necessary to enquire what those duties are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018392_0009_0FA708F7ED2023A8"/>
Allegiance is certainly that tie, which binds the Subject to his Sovereign, to support, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and defend him, in his possessions and just rights, against all his enemies; and is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, not only to his Royal Political Capacity, but to his Natural Person is due, without any oath of allegiance taken; and ought to be so strong and rooted, as to induce us, when neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, to hazard life, fortune, and all that is dear, in defence of our liege Sovereign; we say, in his possessions and just rights: And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it becomes equally obligatory on us, to submit to the Peace, as it was to defend and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Sovereign in his possessions, during the War.</p>
            <p>The King, by our Constitution, is vested with the Prerogative of making Peace and War; and being so vested, he may, to attain the ends of Peace, dismember this Province from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and a Treaty concluded by him with a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Crown, must irrevocably bind the Nation.</p>
            <p>This enquiry being made, we can now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the Inhabitants of East-Florida have faithfully discharged their duty as Subjects: For, during the whole course of the War, they, with their lives and fortunes, used their best exertions in the cause of their Sovereign; and they are now in the act of withdrawing from the Province, and of relinquishing their planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their comfortable houses, and real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, in consequence of the Peace, and have paid every obedience thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:018392_0010_0FA708FAB3E51090"/>
The next Question then naturally arises, What return is the Subject to receive, for a faithful discharge of his allegiance? We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Protection in his possessions, and in all his just immunities and privileges.</p>
            <p>Protection and allegiance are reciprocal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The thing itself is founded in reason, and the nature of government. A fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principle in the Feudal Law was, that a mutual trust subsisted between the Lord and the Vassal, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the Lord should give full protection to the Vassal, in his <hi>territorial property;</hi> and the Vassal was to defend and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Lord, to the utmost of his power, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all his enemies. All lands held by Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Subjects, are derived, mediately or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, from the Crown; and the oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, (before it was curtailed at the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) ran nearly in the same words as the Vassal's oath of fealty. They are both derived from the same feudal source; and the King is called our liege <hi>Lord</hi> and Sovereign.</p>
            <p>The Subject is not only to be protected in his possessions, but also in his just immunities and privileges; and, as a natural born Subject can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be discharged from his allegiance, or put it off, or cancel, or alter it, by any act of his own, by change of time, place, or circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note n="*" place="bottom">

so, he has a great variety of rights and privileges, acquired by being born within the King's allegiance, which he cannot forfeit by any distance of time or place, but only by some act of misconduct, or misbehaviour of his own.</p>
            <p>Having premised thus much, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary here to enquire, Can the Subject be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested of his property, agreeable to the British Constitution, by the Crown or Legislature, without receiving an equivalent for it? We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, He cannot.</p>
            <p>No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his freehold, or liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, <hi>or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise destroyed,</hi> but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. These are the words of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> My Lord Coke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon these words, says, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>hereby is intended, that lands, tenements, goods and chattels, shall not be seized into the King's hand; nor any man shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his lands or tenements, or dispossessed of his goods and chattels, contrary to this Great Charter, or the law of the land.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt, an individual, or a body compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing part of the community, may, by act of Parliament, that is, the law of the land, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of property, for the good of the whole;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018392_0012_0FA708FB754B72A8"/>
but the individual or body so deprived, must be compensated: And it is every day's practice to compel an individual to part with property, by act of Parliement, for publick use, for a road, or the like; but he must be paid for it. The Publick, in these instances, is like an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual treating with an individual, for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and so great is the regard of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for private property, that it will not admit of the least violation of it. <g ref="char:startq">“</g>The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good is in nothing so essentially interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> says Sir William Blackstone, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>as in the protection of every individual's private rights, as modelled by the municipal law.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
            </p>
            <p>It is part of the law of the land, founded on the principle of necessity, that a Subject, in time of War, may be deprived of his effects, for publick use; or his house may be burnt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, to prevent the enemy from occupying it: But he must be paid, out of the publick treasury, for his loss. So in a storm, goods may be thrown overboard, to preserve the ship; but the loss must be proportionably borne by all the shippers. So, it is conceived, that in our case. his Majesty, (as has been already said,) may, for the good of the Nation, by a Peace, lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield up this Province, and dismember it from the Empire. But if, in so doing, private property is sacrificed, individuals owning that property, must be paid for their loss.</p>
            <p>This then leads to the next enquiry, Will the Inhabitants of this Province be divested of their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018392_0013_0FA708FED05EC008"/>
property, by the terms of the Peace? Let us hear what the terms of it are.</p>
            <p>Peace is made by our Sovereign, and ratified by the Nation, in which it is stipulated, that East-Florida shall be yielded up and guarantied to the Crown of Spain; and his Majesty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may withdraw themselves, with their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, within a given time; and in the interim, they are at liberty to sell their immoveable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to the Subjects of his Most Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. Thus far the Treaty goes, and no further.</p>
            <p>But, in order to elucidate the matter more fully, it may be admitted, that his Catholick Majesty will permit individuals to stay. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Catholick Majesty's Subjects will not purchase, or will only give the most trifling sum for a valuable property; and the British propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor, agreeable to treaty, withdraws; where is the reciprocal duty of protection for the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Can it be said, that he is not divested or disseized of his property, by the Spaniards, in consequence of an act of Government. If he goes a step beyond the Peace, and can reconcile it to himself to change his religion, (a case put merely for the sake of argument, as it cannot happen,) and remain; where are his invaluable birth-right immunities and privileges? What has he done against his Sovereign, to forfeit his rights as a British Subject? And, in case a War should break out, at a future day, between Great-Britain and Spain, and he is called upon by the Nation that gives him protection in his property, to take up arms; what will he do in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018392_0014_0FA708FFC2E49DA8"/>
this case? No time, no place, no circumstances, can enable him to shake off his natural allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without the consent of his Sovereign. He has not the consent of his Sovereign, to stay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Treaty of Peace. On the contrary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Province is guarantied to Spain, yet care is taken to make it a positive stipulation, on the part of his Catholick Majesty, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Inhabitants may withdraw, with their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, without molestation; which plainly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that if any of his Majesty's Subjects remain, they do it at their own risk, and still owe allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Great-Britain. If that had not been the intention, the article ought to have gone on, and declared, that such of his Majesty's Subjects as chose to stay, were absolved from the duties of natural allegiance to the Crown of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>In the year 1747, Eneas, alias Angus, M'Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald was tried for high treason. He had been taken prisoner in the rebellion of 1745. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon the trial, that he was born in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but left it very young. He had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the French King, as his Subject: He was, in education, and all other respects, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by birth, a Frenchman. But he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed upon this principle, that no change of place, time, or circumstances, could enable him to get rid of the allegiance due to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which he was born.</p>
            <p>By this state of the case, the Inhabitants of East-Florida, agreeable to the Treaty of Peace, must either lose their property by withdrawing, or, if they go a step further than the Treaty has,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018392_0015_0FA708FFF73B57E0"/>
carried them, (that is, if they stay and become Spanish Subjects,) they must forego all their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and religious rights. But can it be supposed, that British Subjects will change their religion, and forego their civil rights, for the sake of gain? To conceive, that the People of East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Florida can, would be harbouring the injurious idea, that all governments were alike to them, provided they can hold their property. It would also be concluding, that their struggles for seven years, have not proceeded from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of attachment to the Constitution and Parent Country, and of loyalty to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. It is conceived, a moment's reflection must satisfy every thinking man, that such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are founded in gross error. They have, most of them, heretosore sacrificed their property, in discharge of their duty, as liege Subjects: And they still, notwithstanding all that has passed, are unshaken in their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and principles.</p>
            <p>We might here go on to shew, by maxims drawn from the Law of Nations, that where the interests and effects of a part of a Society are sacrificed for the good of the whole, the losses sustained by such sacrifice, must be borne by the whole. We might also shew, that we have, not only the implied assurance, founded on the doctrine of protection and allegiance, and on the principles of the Constitution; but there is, in our case, an express contract on the part of Government, entered into and declared, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and other publick and solemn acts,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018392_0016_0FA70900B5FC1180"/>
for the security of our privileges and property. And arguments might be drawn from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal principles of natural justice, to shew, where one of two contracting parties performs his part of the contract, if the other party can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform his, some other recompence must be made, by way of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>These, and many other arguments, might be adduced; but having already said so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the subject, we shall, lastly, enquire, Are the Inhabitants to have no compensation for the losses they must sustain, by withdrawing, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Treaty of Peace? Is this to be the reward of their past services and zeal?</p>
            <p>From what has been already said, from the principles of our Constitution, from those of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural justice, and from the present and past con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Mother Country, we must conclude, the means to make us compensation, for the loss of that property we shall be obliged to abandon by withdrawing, agreeable to the Treaty of Peace; as she cannot, or does not find it convenient to, protect us in the possession of it; and, for the accommodation of national exigencies, has thought proper to cede private property to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Crown.</p>
            <p>We must recollect, that hitherto nothing has been done, but what the Constitution warrants. Great-Britain gave us protection during the war, and nurtured us during our infancy. Here we must feel emotions of gratitude. She has, it is true, dismembered this Province from the Empire; but she had clearly a constitutional
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018392_0017_0FA7090189B75DA0"/>
right so to do: And it must be recollected, she has provided in the Treaty, that we shall be at liberty to withdraw. She has also given us the chance of selling our property, <hi>if we can;</hi> and ships are furnished, at the expence of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to accommodate us at our departure. We were formerly, and now are, told from authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that every attention will be paid to us, in whatever situation we may be placed. From all which we must draw, that ample and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial justice will be afforded us. To admit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary idea, would be to assert, that Great-Britain hath lost all publick faith; that, instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, she most severely punishes, her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful adherents; that the sacred principles of the Constitution, and the rules of natural justice, are by her disregarded; and, that from being a Nation renowned for her probity, justice, and good faith she has become the reverse; that she has untied the strongest bond, that unties Civil Society; and, that the Constitution hath l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas I have been informed, that some infatuated men, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this province, have wantonly joined the rebels of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, I hereby strictly require and charge all persons whatever, who can give evidence of their traiterous conduct, that they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the same to me, that means may be used to bring them to that punishment which their crimes deserve. And to prevent as much as may be all correspondence and intercourse with the rebels in the neighbouring colonies, and for the greater security of this province. I do hereby require, that no boats or canoes be allowed to remain in the night time on the north and west side of St. John's river, and that no person do pass, or be aiding and assisting in carrying others over the said river from this side, without leave from me in writing.

                              </gap>, in his royal proclamation of the 7th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1763, by establishing a provincial legislature for the purpose of making constitutions, ordaining laws, statues and ordinances, as near as may be agreeable to the laws of England, under such regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and restrictions as are used in other colonies, for the publick wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and good government of this province and its inhabitants.</p>
                           <p>To this period, his Majesty's honourable council have acted as a privy council, with respect to matters of government; and I am greatly indebted to that honourable board, for their ready assistance, and the candour they have ever discovered, in giving their opinions on such points as were laid before them.</p>
                           <p>From this date, they assume the authority and privileges of an upper house of assembly, in a legislative capacity; and you will, honourable gentlemen, I am convinced, maintain the same recard to the constitution, the same loyalty to his Majesty, and attention to the true interests of this province, which hath been your ruling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the capacity of privy counsellors.</p>
                           <p>It hath been frequently represented to me by the grand juries of this province, that local laws were much wanted, and that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap> that provincial laws were wanted; but sensible that numberless expences and hardships unavoidably attend forming new settlements, and imagining that it would be expected, the instant a provincial legislature existed, taxation for defraying the expences of government should be imposed, I thought it more eligible to suffer a few inconveniences, than either to burthen you in an infant state, or disappoint the reasonable expectations of our most gracious Sovereign and an indulgent mother country, by whose patronage, care and support, we have been fostered and protected, at a time of general revolt; when the untoward behaviour of the other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies might have justly induced the most benign Prince in the world to alienate his affections from such contumacious and refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory children, and the Parliament to withdraw its aid from breeding up others that, like them, might prove unworthy and ungrateful.</p>
                           <p>Of late, gentlemen, the increase of property from your success in commerce and planting, hath been considerable; and the industry and judgement of a few may evince to Great-Britain, that ample<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>returns in produce may be made for money laid our in raising a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce equally beneficial to the planter and the mother country, in one of the most healthy and fertile climates upon earth.</p>
                           <p>These and other motives impelled me to summon the freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this province, to elect representatives to act in the house of assembly, for the purpose of assisting in framing laws, statutes and ordinances, for the good government of the province, whose repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, gentlemen, you are; and I do assure you, that I shall most dispassionately and cordially concur with you, in framing such laws and ordinances, as best correspond with the constitution and laws of England, and best suit with our local situation and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; and that I am zealous of preserving inviolate the liberties of the subject, and the right and prerogatives of the crown.</p>
                           <p>My address to you, gentlemen, upon the present auspicious oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, shall be short, confident of your loyalty to the King, and attachment to the constitution, and that you have a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true interests of this colony.</p>
                           <p>Framing laws for the regulation of the conduct of the members of community, hath ever been deemed a most momentous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant object; they require the most penetrating discernment, and soundest deliberation; and particular circumspection is necessary, at this alarming crisis of publick affairs, and general revolt of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies: A revolt, which I cannot mention without the greatest indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and in which they have so wickedly persevered, that by their new and unnatural political alliances they have sacrificed to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices and prejudices, their most sacred rights, religious and civil; renounced their allegiance to the mildest and best of kings, and their attachment to the most ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

have attempted to destroy a constitution, under which they posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a freedom, restrained only by the most wholesome and beneficial laws, and all the sweets of good government, without feeling the weight of its support and maintenance.</p>
                           <p>The result of your deliberations, gentlemen, will not only be of consequence to this province, but to his Majesty's government in general, and it will at least give a tincture in future assemblies: And as one of the chief reason assigned for this unnatural rebellion, is the colonies refusing to acknowledge the supreme right and authority of the British Parliament, to prevent as far as possible any further contest upon so just and equitable a point, I hope your good sense and attachment to the constitution, will lead you, in the most pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and avowed manner, by an act of the provincial legislature, to recognize your allegiance to the blessed Prince upon the throne, and the supremacy of Parliament; thereby to establish, upon the most solid foundation, our constitution liberties and dependence.</p>
                           <p>As the King and Parliament have, with an astonishing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented condescension, relinquished their just right of taxation, provided the provincial legislature will make due provision for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying a reasonable part of the expence of the government of the empire at large, and for the internal government of the colony; I trust that you, gentlemen, in the first moment of your existence, will make a provision appropriated to these important purposes, more as a mark of your regard to justice and affection, and gratitude, for the government under which we have been protected, and generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fostered and maintained, than for any immediate real service our supply can afford it.</p>
                           <p>The quota you in your present circumstances can make, I am sensible, will not be adequate to the expences of the provincial go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but I am consident, that such provision, appropriated as I mention, will be an additional motive with our most gracious Sovereign to continue his immediate protection, and to an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced and liberal Parliament, its bounty in our progression to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards maturity.</p>
                           <p>In my correspondence with his Majesty's principal secretaries of state, I have ever represented the inhabitants of this province, to be loyal and well attached to his Majesty's person and government, and ready upon every occasion, to assist by their personal services; and I take this opportunity of returning my thanks, to those gentlemen, who, with a manly spirit, served in the militia, upon the repeated invasions of the province.</p>
                           <p>I presume, gentlemen, I have no occasion to mention, that the present situation of publick affairs, surrounded as we are on all sides by foreign and domestick enemies, demands our attention to the important object of defence; and that we may lend our aid in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018392_0029_0FA70912DDCC8A40"/>
and proportioned manner, a militia act will be beneficial to the province.</p>
                           <p>I have only to intreat, gentlemen, that you will preserve har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and good temper, in your deliberations; and be assured, I have nothing so much at heart, as to concur with you in promoting his Majest's service, and the prosperity and true interests of this province.</p>

                           <p>With the most heartfelt satisfaction we congratulate your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that during your administration of the government of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, it hath arrived at such a state, as to enable your excellency with propriety to fulfil his Majesty's most gracious m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Sensible from experience of the numberless hardships and heavy expences which unavoidably attend the forming of new settlements, we have hitherto cheerfully submitted to such inconveniences as our situations and circumstances subjected us to. But from the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing population of the province, the necessity of some local laws in this infant colony, became daily more evident; in the making and framing of which, and of such other ordinances and regulations as the publick welfare and good government may require, it shall be our study to conform, as far as may be, to the constitution and laws of Great-Britain, under such restrictions as have been used in our sister colonies.</p>
                           <p>Throughly convinced of the patronage, support and care, with which this province hath been and continues to be fostered, cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and protected by our most gracious Sovereign and indulgent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, we cannot altogether disappoint their reasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and will therefore cheerfully contribute towards the general expences of government, what on mature deliberation we shall judge suitable to the circumstances of our constituents; which being well known to your excellency, we hope the present smallness of our quota may not be considered as the measure of our loyalty and affection to the most beneficent Prince in the world, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But we find great satisfaction in the prospect that through a continuance of the benevolent assistance and attention of the British Parliament, the gradual increase of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty amongst us, from the returns of a produce valuable to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and beneficial to Great-Britain, will enable us in progress of time, to

to make our proportion of the general supplies, an object of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance than can at present be expected.</p>

                           <p>We hope your excellency will do us the justice to believe, that we shall pay every attention to your excellency's speech to both houses, at the commencement of the last session, and to those assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances we then most sincerely made to your excellency in our address.</p>
                           <p>Your excellency must have perceived from inspecting the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, that a bill was framed and passed this house, which we humbly apprehend did fully recognize the establishment of the crown in his present most sacred Majesty, whom God long preserve, as protector of our most invaluable rights and privileges, and the supremacy of Parliament; and recognizing at the same time, the great outlines of our rights and privileges, as British subjects; deeming them a mutual security to each other.</p>
                           <p>We are happy to find that your excellency is of opinion, that the laws of last session hear evident marks of loyalty, and of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in government, which are peculiarly necessary at this alarming crisis, when the wisdom and strength of all ought to be united and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018392_0036_0FA7091C74F42AE8"/>
exerted for the defence of the whole. And it is with pleasure we find the fortifications in such a state, as will render this town, we trust, a safe retreat to the inhabitants of the province, in case of an attack from his Majesty's enemies, and give his Majesty's brave troops and loyal subjects, a confidence of success against any hostile invader.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Our most gracious Sovereign ever zealous to promote the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests and happiness of mankind, by extending the influence of pure religion and free government, upon the cession of this province to the crown of Great-Britain, was most graciously pleased to give to those, who should become inhabitants, the fullest assurances of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of denizens of the realm of England, under a colonial constitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, resembling, as near as might be, the glorious constitution of the mother country, with authority to make laws, statutes, and ordinances for their internal government, to be confirmed or repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Majesty's approbation of disallowance.</p>
                           <p>This province, by the blessing of God, having arrived at some degree of importance, agreeable to those assurances, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Majesty's royal instructions, I called last year a general assembly, and a provincial legislature was established.</p>
                           <p>Some constitutional laws, expressive of our loyalty, were enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018392_0039_0FA7091ECF1B6A98"/>
the salutary effects of which are now visible in the fortifications, which, under the direction of Capt. Burrard, are nearly finished, and this town is thereby rendered in case of invasion, I trust, a secure asylum for the planters. The militia of the province is also established under proper regulations.</p>
                           <p>Sensible that you, gentlemen, are well acquainted with the situation of the province, the circumstances of the inhabitants, the attention due at this alarming crisis to our defence, and that your utmost endeavours will be exerted, to encourage and promote agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and commerce, I shall not be particular in pointing out objects for your consideration.</p>
                           <p>Let me only request, that you have a due regard to the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we are under to our most gracious Sovereign, for his paternal care of this infant colony, and to the Parliament for its bounty, in contributing so liberally to our support, protection and defence; and that we express our sense of those benefits, by a recognition of their respective rights, as well as by asserting our natural inherent birth rights, as denizens of the realm of England; thereby endeavouring to render the happy union incontrovertible and lasting.</p>
                           <p>There just acknowledgments ought the more readily and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be sanctioned by an act of the provincial legislature, because from the whole tenor of our most gracious Sovereign's conduct, we may have the utmost confidence in his most sacred regard to the rights of mankind, and the liberties of his subjects, in every part of his extensive dominions.</p>
                           <p>You know, gentlemen, that considerable expences were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by the last general assembly, and that immediate provision ought to be made for discharging them. Desirous of rendering the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations more formidable, I applied to the planters for their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and they have readily complied with my requisition, at a great expence to themselves.</p>
                           <p>In framing a tax bill, I have no occasion to suggest the justice and good policy of contributing our quota, according to our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, for defraying the expences of the empire at large; as by an happy and lasting union, and dependence thereon, this province can alone hope to become flourishing and prosperous; and such contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, however inconsiderable, I will venture to say, our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign will receive as a mark of our regard to justice, and expressive of our gratitude to them, and affection for our mother country.</p>
                           <p>With the deepest sympathy, let me call your attention to the unhappy situation of his Majesty's loyal subjects in the neighbouring colonies, who groan under the calamities and horrors of civil war. This worst of evils, by the blessing of God, hath been, and I trust will continue, remote from us. Did our circumstances and abilities correspond with our feelings for those distressed loyalists, they would
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018392_0040_0FA7091F800324B0"/>
soon find relief; and this province would have an accession of many valuable settlers, and we an additional security.</p>
                           <p>His Majesty, sensible of the oppression exercised by the tyranny of usurpers over those loyalisits, who with a truly landable fortitude, in spite of the cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>It is with concern that I view the ruinous condition of the parochial church in this town.

                           <p>In the fullest expectation, that the several branches of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial legislature will carry on publick business with harmony and mutual confidence, I am happy to meet you in general assembly.

your excellency our most hearty thanks for your speech to both houses.</p>
                           <p>When we compare our happy situation, as to pure religion and free government, with the state of other nations and people, we are impressed with the warmest sentiments of piety to an all directing Providence, and of loyalty and gratitude to our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, for those inestimable blessings. And we most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely implore the protection of Heaven, to preserve his Majesty's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>This province, by the blessings of God, under the fostering care of our most gracious Sovereign, and from the unwearied attention of your excellency to its truest interests, is of some importance to the mother country, and yields grateful returns, for the sums ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on its settlement; and we doubt not, that under the same favourable anspices, and with the advantage of a provincial legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it will proceed to maturity with accelerated progress.</p>
                           <p>It is with very great satisfaction, that we p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>In all our deliberations in a legislature capacity, we shall have in view, the obligations this province is under to our most gracious Sovereign, and to the Parliament and people of Great-Britain, for their bounty, in contributing so amply as they have done, towards our support, protection and defence.

                           <p>Sensible of the advantages of publick worship, and the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of piety and good morals in every community, and that the present ruinous state of the parochial church is prejudicial to these, we shall likewise take into our consideration the recognizing a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship and a ministry, upon the most liberal principles of toleration, conformable to that most excellent constitution of the church of England, which so perfectly harmonizes with the free constitution of our government; and we hope means will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be adopted, for effecting a thorough repair of that edifice, and rendering it suitable to so pions a purpose as that of religious worship.</p>

growing into some degree of importance, which we are convinced will be greatly advanced by the introduction of many necessary provincial laws, the want of which hath been long and severely felt by the inhabitants of this province.</p>
                           <p>We are happy to be informed by your excellency, that the fortifications about this town are nearly compleated. In the present critical situation of this province, nothing is more to be wished than that they were entirely so. We agree with your excellency, that the provision made by the last general assembly for this purpose, was a very heavy tax upon the proprietors of negroes.</p>
                           <p>Permit us to repeat to your excellency, our firm determination to act on all accasions becoming a loyal and grateful people.</p>

                           <p>In framing a tax bill, your excellency may be fully assured, that we shall give the requisition of contributing to the expence of the empire at large, the attention and deliberation due to a matter of so great moment: convinced of the justice and right of our venerable mother country, to demand a proportionable aid from all her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and dependencies, we have only to lament that our ability is not equal to our inclination, and that our mite must of necessity be so small, as hardly to be felt or acknowledged. Thus disagreeably circumstanced, we depend upon your excellency's known humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and benevolence, to represent the good disposition of us and our constituents, to comply as far as in our power, with all his Majesty's expectations.</p>

                           <p>Impressed with sentiments of loyalty, and a due veneration for the happy constitution under which we live, salutary effects to this province may be expected from your deliberations.</p>
                           <p>A few local laws will be of service, as that excellent system of jurisprudence, the laws of England, which we have hitherto enjoyed in their fullest extent, is not in all cases suited to the circumstances of infant colonies; and the application of them, must depend upon the decisions of the courts of justice.</p>
                           <p>The zeal and alacrity with which the planters have contributed to render the fortifications of this town respectable, deserve the highest commendations: in justice to them, I have represented the same to his Majesty's secretary of state.</p>
                           <p>As a few outworks only are wanting to render the fortifications compleat, I am happy from the sentiments of your address to expect your assistance in constructing them; and the more readily, as they will prove a great additional security to the province.</p>
                           <p>I have ever represented to his Majesty's secretary of state, in the strongest terms, the loyalty and attachment of his Majesty's subjects of East-Florida; and I flatter myself that your conduct in a legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive capacity, will evince the truth of my assertions, and that you are a loyal and greatful people.</p>
                           <p>The distresses of many of our fellow subjects in the neighbouring colonies, are indeed great, and their wants such as we cannot alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether supply; those who come here, may be assured of every assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and support in my power, and of fertile lands fit for producing
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018392_0045_0FA70929E6DFEF50"/>
grain and naval stores, to form settlements exempt from quit rents for ten years.</p>
                           <p>I am sensible that the expences incurred already, will be heavy on your constituents for the ensuing year. The state of the parochial church is become so ruinous, as to render it unfit for publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and religious ordinances, the discharge of which is so essential for the morals of the people. I shall therefore set about such neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary repairs, as the small fund in my hands will admit of.</p>
                           <p>The framing of laws in an object of the utmost importance, and merits clearness, precision and circumspection.</p>

                           <p>It is with the deepest concern, I have the honour of laying before you, a letter from Lieutenant. General Leslie, commanding his Majesty's troops in the southern district, and conveying to me the Commander in chief Sir Guy Carleton's express directions to him, for the evacuation of this province by his Majesty's troops, and such loyalists as are desirous of with-drawing with them. As this is of the most weighty and important consequence to his Majesty's faithful subjects, I take the earliest opportunity of communicating it to you.</p>

                           <p>We your Majesty's most dutiful, loyal and ever faithful subjects, the upper house and the commons house of assembly of this your Majesty's province of East-Florida, in general assembly met, at a time when it is fixed that they, as the representatives of the people, must soon for ever be disolved; when the political existence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as a body, is drawing to a speedy annihilation; at such a moment, the most critical they have hitherto experienced, they presume once more to approach your royal person.</p>
                           <p>Amidst the vicissitudes incident to a long and calamitous war, your Majesty's faithful subjects in East-Florida, strengthened from time to time by addition of virtuous men, breathing the same spirit of loyalty, trusted that by the protection of your Majesty's troops, the unwearied attention of your Majesty's Governour to the interest of the province, and their own exertions, they would be able, as the event has proved, to repel the attacks of your Majesty's enemies, during its continuance; and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

would have continued to enjoy the fruits of their industry and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, with this secret but satisfactory reflection, that they had to the best of their abilities, faithfully discharged their duty to their King and country, during the continuance of the contest.</p>
                           <p>Whilst with admiration we perceived your Majesty's condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in gratifying the wishes of your people, even at the expence of the dismemberment of the empire, your Majesty's subjects here felt themselves much disappointed at the event; as they had humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to entertain an idea, that as the strength, so the grandeur of the parent country, greatly depended on keeping the whole domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons entire; in the support of which idea, they ever were ready to assist with their lives and fortunes. Time must discover, and they trust they will be convinced by it, that the mother country, notwithstanding the separation, will continue her consequence in the class of nations.</p>
                           <p>Whatever may have been the true causes that induced your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's servants to conclude a peace, which places your Majesty's loyal American subjects in so humiliating a situation; whether the distresses of the nation made it necessary, or the politics of the day brought it forth, we beg leave to assure your Majesty, that as it is a plain and undisguised truth, that no success can change vice into virtue, so your Majesty may rest convinced, that the most grievous misfortunes will never shake integrity supported on the basis of fixed principle; and we trust the day will come, when our struggles in the cause of loyalty and the constitution, will command the esteem of all ranks of men in Great-Britain; and that when party and faction die away, calm and dispassionate reason will rise up in their stead. At a juncture, when we must soon expect to be deprived to those most inestimable of all blessings, during our stay here, that of protection in our lives, liberties and properties, under the mild and lenient administration of a British government; at a juncture, when the inhabitants must soon determine either to live for a time under a government in the hands of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enemies of their country, or abandon their territorial possessions, improvements and houses, many of them just finished and purchased with the small wreck of their effects saved at the evacuation of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina and Georgia, to seek another asylum, and that not pointed out, nor the means of conveyance; when we have also to dread the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of savages enraged by disappointment, and governed by those passions only, revenge and cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That the remainder of your Majesty's regin, may be long prosperous and happy, is the sincere and earnest prayer of the legislature and loyal people of East-Florida.</p>

We beg leave to assure your excellency, that your unremitted attention on all occasions, to the interest and welfare of the inhabitants of this over loyal colony, has made a deep and lasting impression on our minds; and during the distressful scene we are soon to experience, we are convinced your excellency will enjoy the pleasing reflection, that every thing on your part was done to avert the blow, and being disappointed in that, to soften the misfortune.</p>

                           <p>It must be recollected that this province, being ceded to the imperial crown of Great-Britain, at the peace of one thousand seven hundred and sixty three, our most gracious Sovereign, as an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for his subjects to settle in East-Florida, was pleased to issue his royal proclamation, declaring amongst other things, that the inhabitants should enjoy all the privileges of British subjects, and every protection in their persons and proprrty; and your excellency, no doubt instructed by his Majesty's servants, by repeated procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, invited the loyal inhabitants from the revolted colonies, to resort to East-Florida, as a secure and safe asylum; and we were also assured, that in all possible situations the utmost attention and regard would be paid to their welfare and safety; under all which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and assurances, his Majesty's province of East-Florida had arrived at some degree of opulence, and began to be in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing state.</p>

With these sentiments most powerfully prevailing, and still. wedded to that favourite principle, a subordination to legal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they do with readiness admit, that our most gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, armed by the constitution with the power of making war and peace, and the necessary of the state, and the publick interest no doubt requiring it, had an indisputable right to dismember this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince from the empire; and to this measure we submit, as it is our duty to do to every constitutional act of government, done by his Majesty, and sanctioned by his parliament; and being by this act of government reduced to this alternative, either to remain and forego our civil rights, as British subjects, and at the same time to become apostates in religion, or quit our comfortable and valuable settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and property; we, as a matter that requires little reflection, chuse the latter, and shall forth with prepare to withdraw to some other part of our Sovereign's dominions. But at the same time we beg leave to put your excellency in remembrance, that this dismember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not being chargeable to any vicistitudes accruing in the course of the war, nor to any internal convulsions occasioned by insurrection or revolt, nor to the political or natural wishes of the people; nor being sensible of having done any crime, for which we ought to be deprived of our property, or for which it ought to be given up to a foreign power; and the war not being chargeable to any particular fault of ours, but on the contrary, having ever during the storm, acted the part of faithful members of that nation, of which we are a part; we conceive, and we trust our conceptions are founded on the firm basis of constitutional principles, supported by the doctrines that have been adopted by mankind for the conduct of nations in similar cases, that as we are obliged to forego our property, and it is thus annexed to a foreign power by an act of state, and must have been coded for the good of the nation, we ought to bear no more than our proportion of the loss, and consequently will receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</p>
                           <p>It may perhaps be alledged; that the sovereignty only of East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Florida being coded, our territorial property is not thereby trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, but remains to the British proprietors becoming subjects to his Most Catholick Majesty, or otherwise for sale to the natural subjects of Spain; in answer to which sophistry, should any such be advanced, we beg leave to ask if it can possibly be supposed, that a people so renowned for national honour, publick faith, and liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
