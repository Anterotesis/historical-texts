            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>BROTHERLY LOVE is ſo agreeable to the uncorrupted principles of our nature, and ſo plainly neceſſary and conducive to the well-being and happineſs of human ſociety, that perſons of all perſuaſions will, in general, acknowledge it to be a virtue of peculiar excellency, which none ought to neglect. And while they thus allow its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, there are but few but what pretend to be poſſeſſed of it. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men ſo generally agree in commending and laying claim to this virtue, there are, it is probable, many who have but a very
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016307_0004_0F9C1EE6D3C44D80"/>imperfect idea of it. Some there are who ſeem to think that it conſiſts only in good words and good wiſhes, or in deſiring the welfare of others; altho' they do nothing to promote it any further than mere words will go. They are full of kind expreſſions; and <hi>there</hi> their charity begins and ends.</p>
            <p>This is the error which the Apoſtle cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions us againſt in the text; "Let us not love in word, neither in tongue." He does not mean that it is improper to uſe kind words, or to make profeſſions of love and good-will; but that we ſhould not content ourſelves with theſe only, or imagine that benevolence requires nothing more of us. Such language is agreeable and pleaſant, and uſing it is one way of ſhewing kindneſs, tho' it by no means proves a real principle of love in the heart, and in many caſes can be of no ſubſtantial ſervice to the perſon to whom it is addreſſed. For, in the language of the Apoſtle James, "If a brother or ſiſter be naked and deſtitute of daily food; and one of you ſay unto him, depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled: notwithſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful for the body; what doth it profit?" Is this true charity? Does this amount to loving our neighours as ourſelves? By no means. People do but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016307_0005_0F9C1EE78FE8E810"/>deceive themſelves, if they imagine they have either chriſtian faith, or chriſtian charity, unleſs they ſhew it by good works: But more eſpecially, if they ſcruple not to defraud, to defame and otherwiſe to injure their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, with ſuch good words as brotherly-love and charity in their mouths. Inſtead of contenting ourſelves with this merely verbal charity, the Apoſtle exhorts us to love in deed and in truth; i. e. to cultivate a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of love and benevolence in our hearts, that we may with truth and ſincerity make profeſſions of it; and be ever ready to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it by deeds of charity.</p>
            <p>This duty of brotherly-love is a very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive one: It virtually compriſes all the duties of the ſecond table, all moral and ſocial vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as they are diſtinguiſhed from the duties that immediately relate to God as their object: Accordingly, the Apoſtle Paul ſays, "he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law." Nor is it improbable that many who make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to this virtue are under other miſtakes about it, beſides that cautioned againſt in the text. It may therefore be uſeful to us all, and conducive to one profeſſed deſign of that ancient inſtitution which gave occaſion to this ſolemnity, to ſpend a little time in explaining that charity or brotherly-love recommended in the text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016307_0006_0F9C1EE84DBE18D0"/>
It is to be conſidered both in its principle, and in its effects or operations as it is called forth into exerciſe on various occaſions, and in different circumſtances.</p>
            <p>It primarily intends ſincere good-will or unfeigned benevolence; heartily wiſhing well to others, and deſiring both their temporal and eternal good. Seeing, ſays the Apoſtle Peter, in his firſt epiſtle, 1 chap. "Seeing ye have puriſied your ſouls in obeying the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren; ſee that ye love one another with a pure heart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently."—This is the general idea of chriſtian charity, or brotherly-love.</p>
            <p>But it will be proper to be more particular in explaining the nature of this virtue, by pointing out ſome of the principal properties of it and ſhewing what is contrary thereto. Love is an active principle in the ſoul: Wherever it is, it has a mighty influence upon the mind and behaviour; producing effects correſpondent to its nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſtraining the ſubjects of it from every thing contrary thereto: And it is to be made manifeſt both to ourſelves and others by its fruits, and not by an empty profeſſion. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a property of brotherly-love to rejoice in the goodneſs of God
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016307_0007_0F9C1EE911E0A518"/>to others; and to delight in their happineſs. We are enjoined to "rejoice with them that do rejoice," in teſtimony of the good-will which we bear to them. And if we ſincerely love others we are of courſe pleaſed when we ſee them happy and proſperous; eſpecially when we ſee them wiſe, good and virtuous; and ſo in a fair way to obtain eternal ſalvation. "Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth in the truth." And the apoſtle John, declares that he "had no greater joy than to ſee others walking in the truth."</p>
            <p>From hence it is eaſy to ſee, how contrary an envious temper and repining at the welfare of others is to brotherly-love. Accordingly one part of the Apoſtle's deſcription of this virtue is this, "charity envieth not." If then we would be poſſeſſed of this amiable virtue we muſt avoid all envy at thoſe who are wiſer, richer, more virtuous, more eſteemed, more proſperous, than ourſelves. Living in malice, and living in envy are akin to each other, and joined together in ſcripture, as being both oppoſite in their nature to brotherly-love or chriſtian charity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another property of brotherly-love is to ſympathiſe with others in their troubles and afflictions; bearing a part in their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and being ſincerely grieved for them
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016307_0008_0F9C1EEA48B08490"/>when they are in adverſity. Accordingly we are exhorted in ſcripture to "weep with them that weep," as well as to rejoice with them that do rejoice. Every one knows by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that whenever he ſincerely loves another, as for example, a child, a brother, or a friend nearer than a brother; he is of courſe grieved and afflicted for them when they are in trouble. So the truly charitable man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee any others in ſorrow and diſtreſs with an eye of indifference; but will as it were feel for them, and ſhare in their ſorrows; according to the exhortation of the Apoſtle —"Bear ye one another's burdens, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt;" that is, the law of love, which is emphatically the law of Chriſt, who ſaid, "Hereby ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one for another." If we can ſee our brethren or neighbours in ſorrow and difficulty, without any pity or compaſſion, without a tender ſympathy with them, we do not certainly love them in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and truth; eſpecially if we are rather pleaſed than grieved when we ſee them labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under adverſity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the property of this virtue to mourn for the errors and vices of others, by which their future happineſs is endangered, as well as for their worldly ſorrows and afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:016307_0009_0F9C1EEAB5817AB0"/>
Whoever is poſſeſſed of true benevolence, deſires the eternal happineſs of all men; and therefore cannot but be grieved when he ſees any walking in the ways of ſin and folly which lead to miſery and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>From this property of brotherly-love we ſee that it is inconſiſtent therewith to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly or willingly inſtrumental in leading others into wickedneſs; to tempt and intice them to intemperance, uncleanneſs, profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unlawful gaming, or any kind of vicious extravagance; or even to ſet them an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſuch wickedneſs: Whoever does thus is ſo far from imitating the father of mercies in benevolence, as we are exhorted to do, that he rather reſembles the grand adverſary of God and man, "who, as a roaring lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour."</p>
            <p n="4">4. Brotherly-love, or true benevolence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies doing good to all as we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; relieving their wants, comforting them in trouble, and doing what in us lies to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their welfare. Love is a generous boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful principle; it exerts itſelf in ſubſtantial acts of kindneſs, as occaſion and opportunity are preſented. He that loves in deed and in truth "does good to all men, as he hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;" according the Apoſtle's exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016307_0010_0F9C1EF49BC17BE8"/>who ſays alſo, "to do good and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate forget not; for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed." We are indeed directed by the Apoſtle to do good, "eſpecially unto them who are of the houſhold of faith." The reaſon of this direction is, that we, as chriſtians, are more nearly connected with them; they belong, as it were, to the ſame family and are our brethren in a more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate ſenſe, than mankind in general; and becauſe they are alſo ſuppoſed to be more worthy characters, better and more uſeful members of ſociety than others. And tho' chriſtianity has on this account been charged with recommending a contracted ſpirit: Yet, if I miſtake not, the other inſtitution above referred to, in like manner recommends to its profeſſors the members of their own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety as the firſt objects of their liberality and beneficence. Nor do I apprehend that any reaſonable objection can be brought againſt this direction. One end of all ſocial connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is to promote mutual affection among thoſe who form them: They have plainly a tendency to do this. Members of the ſame ſociety muſt be ſuppoſed to be better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wants and neceſſities of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than with thoſe of other men; and to be more concerned for their good. By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a particular connection with others
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016307_0011_0F9C1EF5F784E018"/>we take upon ourſelves a new obligation to love and do good to them, in addition to that which we are naturally under to men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, conſidered only as human creatures. We ought not indeed to confine our good-will and good offices to our brethren by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; nor does chriſtianity or the other inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution above mentioned require us to do ſo; but only to give them the preference. Both theſe inſtitutions leave the natural obligations to univerſal charity in their full force; and induce ſome new ones with reſpect to thoſe of our own particular fraternity. Our neareſt connections are naturally the firſt objects of our benevolence; from them it extends to others more remote.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Friend, parent, neighbour firſt it will embrace,</l>
               <l>"Our country next, and next all human race."</l>
            </q>
            <p>According to our ability we are to do good to all men, ſo far as we can conſiſtently with our obligations to thoſe to whom we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular engagements; not only to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtrangers and afford relief and aſſiſtance to the poor and thoſe who are in ſorrow and diſtreſs; but to do all we can to promote both the temporal and eternal happineſs of mankind. And therefore this excellent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue will naturally lead a man to lend his aſſiſtance for the ſupport of religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016307_0012_0F9C1EF6AF718DB8"/>of good order and government; for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the encroachments of tyranny and arbitrary power, for the encouragement of arts and ſciences, of uſeful manufactures, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, of agriculture, and of every thing which tends to the real good of mankind. And he who has it in his power to be uſeful in this way and neglects it, muſt be deficient in that brotherly love and charity which the goſpel recommends.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Loving in deed and in truth implies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and candor towards thoſe who may differ from us in opinion in ſome reſpects, inſtead of raſhly judging, condemning, perſecuting or reviling them. "Judge not, that ye be not judged," ſays our Saviour, "condemn not, and ye ſhall not be condemned." It is indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable for us to ſpeak of known errors in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or practice, as ſuch, as contrary to the truth and goſpel of Chriſt; yea, Chriſtians are commanded to contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints. But then it is in love that we ought to ſpeak the truth, to oppoſe error and to contend for the faith; not with wrath and bitterneſs, as is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done by different ſects and parties. We ought to remember that we ourſelves are fallible and liable to err, as well as thoſe that differ from us; that we have no more right
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016307_0013_0F9C1EF7585A5C18"/>to lord it over their faith and conſciences, than they have over ours; nor, conſequently, have we any right to harm them, merely for their religious opinions, though they are erroneous.</p>
            <p>The goſpel is a plan of liberty, allowing, and even requiring all men to exerciſe their own judgment and conſciences; and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to uſurp authority over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or uncharitably to cenſure each other. The holy ſcriptures abound with precepts to this purpoſe; and an habitual regard to them is required in the exhortation in the text.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This virtue implies a pacific diſpoſition; and endeavouring, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men; more eſpecially with our chriſtian brethen; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires humility and mutual condeſcention, without which there can be no peace, no dwelling together in unity; but uncharitable contentions and fatal diviſions muſt needs take place. "I therefore the priſoner of the Lord," ſays the Apoſtle, Eph. iv, "beſeech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called; with all lowlineſs and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; with longſuffering; forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016307_0014_0F9C1EF81377FE58"/>
Whoever loves his brethren in deed and in truth, will be deſirous to maintain peace and unity; even though in ſome caſes he ſhould be obliged for that end to give up his own juſt right. This muſt however be confined to things indifferent in their own nature; for we are not in any caſe to do evil, or ſin againſt God for the ſake of peace: Nor are we oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for this cauſe, to give up our temporal rights when they are conſiderable, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to become ſlaves to encroaching and ambitious men. But whatever can be done conſiſtently with a good conſcience, and the preſervation of our own valuable rights, brotherly-love obliges us to do, rather than contend.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This virtue implies a forgiving temper of mind, and a diſpoſition to overlook injuries. Forgiving others their treſpaſſes is a material branch of that charity which the goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. "Put on therefore," ſays the Apoſtle, "as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindneſs, meekneſs, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye." (Col. iii. 12.) And it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered what great ſtreſs our bleſſed Lord himſelf puts upon this, ſaying,—"If ye forgive
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016307_0015_0F9C1EF8D0583058"/>men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive your treſpaſſes: But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive you."</p>
            <p>And if this be the caſe, we ſee that it is plainly inconſiſtent with brotherly love, to indulge an implacable ſpirit and a deſire of revenge;—it is ſo let the injury be ever ſo great; but it is more inexcuſable when the injury is too trifling to deſerve the reſentment of a wiſe man; being only an idle word, or unguarded expreſſion, utterred perhaps in a paſſion. A man who for ſuch trifling offences inſiſts upon being revenged, even though it ſhould be by taking the life of the offender, has a ſpirit as contrary to that of love, as light is to darkneſs; even tho' he ſhould in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of common ſenſe and good breeding, and in defiance of the feelings of humanity and the laws of God, be abſurd enough to call this <hi>genteel ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. And laſtly; it is to be obſerved, that he who loves in deed and in truth, will be careful to abſtain from every kind of injury towards his neighbour, and to practice all thoſe ſocial and relative duties which are neceſſary for the good order, peace and happineſs of ſociety, All theſe duties have their foundation in love as their principle; and they naturally flow
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016307_0016_0F9C1EF98D6BFD48"/>from it, as ſtreams from their fountain. Nor can a perſon break any of God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, relative to ſocial life, without violating the great law of chriſtian charity at the ſame time. The Apoſtle Paul himſelf explains the chriſtian law of love in this latitude; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it as inconſiſtent with every kind and degree of fraud and injuſtice, and including in it every ſocial virtue—our whole duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour. For thus he ſpeaks Rom. xiii. "Owe no man any thing but to love one another; for he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, thou ſhalt not commit adultery; thou ſhalt not kill; thou ſhalt not ſteal; thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs; thou ſhalt not covet: And if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: Therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law."</p>
            <p>Having thus explained the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duty recommended in the text, I ſhall aſk your patience no longer, than while I briefly apply the ſubject. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us ever bare upon our minds the great extent, the comprehenſive nature of the law of love;—that it requires not merely good words and kind wiſhes, or even giving
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016307_0017_0F9C1EFA5183D360"/>alms; but the practice of all moral and ſocial virtues, and the abſtaining from all vice; and that if we allow ourſelves to lead diſſolute immoral lives, we in vain pretend to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of brotherly-love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the many obligations we are all under to the duty we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering;—from the relation we bare to all men, as our brethren, they in common with us, being all the offspring of the ſame great Father of our ſpirits; from the example of univerſal love and beneficence which this great Parent has ſet us;—from our weakneſs and inſufficiency to our own happineſs, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they ſtand in of help and aſſiſtance from one another;—from the ſocial nature of man, his love of ſociety, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be pleaſed with the exerciſes of benevolence, whether he feels them in himſelf or ſees the effects of them in others: And as chriſtians, we are obliged to this duty, by the repeated and expreſs commands of the goſpel, and the example of Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord and Maſter, who gave the moſt convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidences of ſincere affection to us, and has commanded us to love one another as he has loved us; and by our deſires and hopes of eternal happineſs in heaven, which cannot be obtained or enjoyed without a benevolent
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016307_0018_0F9C1EFB12C488F0"/>temper.—And let me add, that the brethren of the ancient Society of Free and Accepted Maſons, are under an additional obligation to this duty. They have voluntarily bound themſelves to obſerve the laws and orders of an inſtitution, one deſign of which is to promote brotherly-love, and which allows of nothing contrary thereto; of no immoral, no injurious practice. For, this, I am fully ſatisfied, may be truly ſaid of their inſtitution; that it was in part deſigned to make men bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent kind and virtuous; and that the more cloſely a brother conforms to the rules of his profeſſion, the more happy he will be in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the more uſeful to others. It may however and no doubt often does, fail of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting its deſign; as is the caſe of chriſtianity, though planed by the wiſdom of God himſelf. But it would be highly unreaſonable to make either of theſe inſtitutions anſwerable for the ill conduct of their profeſſors. Shame be to all unworthy, to all immoral brethren. But let not a blameleſs, a benevolent and a wiſe inſtitution be repreached for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>A vicious and uncharitable Maſon is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inexcuſable. He is bound to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the laws of nature, of revelation and of maſonry: And yet ſo great is his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo ſtrong his propenſity to wickedneſs,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016307_0019_0F9C1EFBD47993C0"/>that he breaks aſunder this three fold cord to the diſgrace of his profeſſion, and even of his humanity. Let then, the gentlemen of this fraternity be pleaſed to conſider, how ſtrongly they are obliged to the practice of charity and all virtue. Your inſtitution, you know, has been faulted by ſome, unacquainted with its principles, as having a bad tendency, and by others as trifling and uſeleſs. But it is not all the reproaches of its enemies that can ſo much diſhonor it, as the vicious lives of its profeſſors. Take care then to confute all ſuch inſinuations by ſhewing that it has a good influence upon your tempers and lives. Demean yourſelves according to the good rules and orders of your ſociety. Let there be found among you no inſtance of impiety, of profaneneſs, of intemperance, of impurity, of diſhoneſty, of covetouſneſs, of contention, or of any other vice: But ſtrive to excel in all the virtues of a good life. This will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the badges of your profeſſion honorable; will gain reſpect to your inſtitution from thoſe who do not profeſs it; will make you happy in yourſelves, and increaſe the happineſs and diminiſh the ſorrows of your family and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic connections, and cauſe thoſe who are not intruſted with your ſecrets to bleſs your inſtitution; it will make you good huſbands, good fathers, good friends, and good mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016307_0020_0F9C1EFC9A3993C8"/>of ſociety; you will be workers together with God in promoting the happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and in that day, when all <hi>ſecrets</hi> ſhall be diſcloſed, you will be approved by your Judge, and admitted <hi>free</hi> of the city that is above, whoſe builder and maker is God.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget the collection for the poor, which was propoſed to be part of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of this aſſembly. This benevolent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal coming from a ſociety of free Maſons, ſhews that tho' their charity regards in the firſt place their own members, yet it is not confined to them, but extends to all who need relief. In this good work they invite all who are able to join them.—Give me leave to ſecond the invitation.—Though giving alms is not the whole, it is yet an eſſential part of charity, where there is occaſion and ability for it. That there is at preſent great occaſion for it among us muſt be known to moſt of you. Beſides ſuch poor as we always have with us, there are many perſons now in this town re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by the conſequences that have reſulted from the war, from comfortable circumſtances, to ſuch poverty as to be unable to procure the real neceſſaries of life: This is ſaid to be the caſe with the families of ſome of thoſe who are now in the public ſervice, or have died fighting in defence of their country, for
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016307_0021_0F9C1F0130B97ED8"/>a very inadequate reward. And at the ſame time that the war has been thus unfavorable to ſome, it has given opportunity to others to acquire great wealth. Suppoſe then that you were thus reduced, ſo as not to have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to purchaſe bread and fuel to keep yourſelf and your family from ſuffering. Would not you think that thoſe around you who had enough and to ſpare ought to aſſiſt you: And if inſtead of doing it, they ſhould ſpend in ſumptuous living, in expenſive equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, furniture, ſervants, needleſs diverſions, and idle amuſements, enough to ſupport many ſuch families as yours, would you think that they did right? Or that they had any regard for the laws of chriſtianity, of maſonry, or even of humanity? Or ſuppoſe inſtead of being thus poor and neglected, you were one of thoſe who have, in this day of general cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, found means greatly to encreaſe your riches, and ſhould thus neglect a poor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or neighbour, though you every day ſpent in needleſs ſhow and luxury enough to ſupport a poor family with frugality; would not your conſcience accuſe you of a very criminal neglect of duty, if you ſhould reflect but a moment upon the matter? Would not your own heart condemn you? Could you think that you acted as became a chriſtian, a free Maſon, or even a man? And would it not chil your ſpirits in your gayeſt amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016307_0022_0F9C1F026A964090"/>to think, that there were many among us ſuffering for want of neceſſaries, which they could procure with what you needleſsly ſpend? Suppoſe farther; that inſtead of thus ſhuting up your bowels of compaſſion, you ſhould retrench ſome of your unneceſſary expences, and give what you thus ſaved to ſome poor worthy family, to diſpel the melancholy of an affectionate father, to revive the ſpirits of an anxious diſtreſſed mother, to ſpread a ſmile over the meagre, dejected countenances of half-famiſhed children, or to cauſe ſome widow's heart to ſing for joy, whoſe huſband has died in the ſervice of his country; ſhould you, I ſay, thus beſtow what you ſaved by denying yourſelf a needleſs gratification, would it not afford you more true ſatisfaction and joy of heart, than you ever received from an <hi>aſſembly</hi> or a <hi>concert,</hi> or any other diverſion or amuſement?—It certainly would, unleſs you are quite diveſted of humanity. And would not the bleſſing of perſons ready to periſh coming on you, be worth more than to be applauded by the unthinking votaries of pleaſure, as a jovial companion, a man of taſte, who knew how to ſpend money and make a figure?</p>
            <p>As to the families of ſoldiers, it is no more than juſtice to aſſiſt them, if they need aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016307_0023_0F9C1F0408794408"/>For you cannot but be ſenſible that it is principally owing to our army that you have had an opportunity of acquiring your affluence, and are now in the peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it; nor can you be ignorant that their wages have been inſufficient for their ſupport. And can you pretend to be poſſeſſed of brotherly-love, while you neglect to aſſiſt them—neglect to do juſtice?</p>
            <p>You cannot but know that the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures repreſent this duty as of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The paſſages to this purpoſe, both in the old and new teſtament, are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable: And they all deſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of every one who deſires to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God: But I would particularly aſk your attention to the words of our bleſſed Savior, recorded in the 25th chapter of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. There he has given us a repreſentation of the final judgment; in which we are taught, that the main thing, upon which the doom of every one will turn, will be the having prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, or neglected this duty:—That when the Son of man ſhall ſit upon the throne of his glory, and all nations be gathered before him. —"He ſhall ſay unto them on his right hand, come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world: For I was an hungred and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016307_0024_0F9C1F040F7AE7E8"/>ye gave me meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye cloathed me: I was ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.—Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on his left hand, depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in: Naked and ye cloathed me not: Sick, and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.—Inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me." Can any argument more forceable be deviſed to recommend the practice of charity? What! ſhall the great Judge of the world, ſeated upon his tribunal declare before angels and men, that our having relieved a brother in diſtreſs, was doing a kindneſs to him; and accordingly reward us with eternal happineſs; —And that our having neglected to ſhew kindneſs to the neceſſituous, was neglecting him; and accordingly puniſh us with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction! And do we after this, need to be urged to this duty? Shall we not rather be ſearching for objects of charity, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of employing as much of the wealth
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016307_0025_0F9C1F04D44EEDC8"/>which God has given us, in this way, as we can? Thus diſpoſed of, upon right principles, it will draw more than <hi>ſterling intereſt:</hi>— It will, in this world, gain us the "favor of God, which is life, and his loving kindneſs, which is better than life;" and, in due time, be repaid with glory, honor, and immortal felicity. One would think that this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation would induce the hard-hearted Miſer, the griping Extortioner, and even the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Voluptuary, with all the unpitying herd of Worldings, to abound in acts of charity, even from a principle of ſelfiſhneſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if this argument has no effect, I can think of no other that will be likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; and will, therefore, conclude with the words of king Solomon, to the ſame purpoſe with thoſe of our Savior juſt recited; "Whoſe ſtoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he alſo ſhall cry himſelf, but ſhall not be heard. —He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given, will he pay him again."</p>
