            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS memorable requeſt to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, was made by one of the malefactors which were cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him. One of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons joined with the ſurrounding multitude in inſulting the ſuffering Saviour in his laſt moments. One of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors which were hanged, railed on him, ſaying, <hi>If thou be the</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſave thyſelf and us. Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> mention both theſe perſons as joining in this railing accuſation.—It is common in the Scripture for a ſingle thing to be expreſſed in the plural number, eſpecially when it is not the deſign of the writer to be very particular.—That is ſaid to be written in the Prophets, which is written only in one of them. It is obſerved of <hi>Jeptha,</hi> that he was buried in the cities of <hi>Gilead,</hi> meaning one of thoſe cities.<note n="*" place="bottom">

THESE two Evangeliſts, not deſigning particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to relate the circumſtances of thoſe which were crucified with JESUS, expreſs themſelves in general terms: But St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives an exact detail of what paſſed reſpecting theſe perſons, and repreſents the one as having acted a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent part from his fellow-ſufferer.—<hi>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, rebuked him, ſaying, doſt not thou fear</hi> GOD, <hi>ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? And we indeed juſtly: For we receive the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing amiſs.—And he ſaid unto</hi> JESUS, LORD <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom.</hi> Some ſuppoſe that this requeſt implied nothing more than that CHRIST would exert his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power in delivering him from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſufferings, and that he would give him a place in a temporal kingdom on earth. But if we conſider, that our LORD's diſciples had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up all hopes of his being the temporal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, it will not appear very probable that this malefactor retained ſuch a ſentiment; eſpecially if we obſerve that he ſeemed perfectly ſatisfied with the anſwer which our LORD gave him, <hi>To-day ſhalt thou be with me, &amp;c.</hi>—He ſeems to have entertained juſt and exalted notions of the Meſſiah's kingdom, and to have believed that though CHRIST was ſuſpended on the croſs, he was poſſeſſed of ſpiritual dominion and regal dignity, and had power to ſave and to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>LET us conſider a little diſtinctly the requeſt itſelf, and the gracious anſwer which our LORD
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019037_0005_0FA99E542CEE3280"/>
returned. This perſon evidently believed in CHRIST as the promiſed Meſſiah, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world. Notwithſtanding the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and diſgrace of his ſituation on the croſs, he viewed him as the LORD of life and glory, and was willing to truſt his immortal intereſts in his hands. He was, in ſome way or other, brought to a ſenſe of his abſolute, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing need of a Saviour, and clearly ſaw that there was ſalvation in none other but CHRIST. If he had not firmly believed that CHRIST would be raiſed from the dead, and that he would take poſſeſſion of the kingdom of glory, there would have been no propriety in ſuch an addreſs.—By what means ſoever, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he became acquainted with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of CHRIST, it certainly diſcovered a ſtrong degree of faith to caſt himſelf upon the mercy of one who was then nailed to the croſs, and juſt ready to give up the ghoſt. He ſaw the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory of a ſuffering Saviour; and while one of his immediate diſciples had betrayed him, while another had denied him, and the reſt forſaken him and fled, he ſays, LORD <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom.</hi> He acknowledges that the dying JESUS is LORD of univerſal nature, and is able to beſtow bleſſings infinitely ſuperior to any thing that earth can yield.—The caſe with many ſinners is, that they do not ſee any beauty or comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in CHRIST that they ſhould deſire him. They fondly imagine that they are <hi>rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> when they are really <hi>wretched and miſerable, poor, blind and naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:019037_0006_0FA99E54ED2962D8"/>
BUT this penitent thief deeply ſenſible of the exceeding evil and malignity of ſin, and the fearful conſequences of it in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, flies to JESUS the only city of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and caſts himſelf upon his mercy <hi>who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom elſe can any ſinners go, but to him <hi>who has the words of eternal life?</hi> Where can other condemned malefactors who are on the brink of eternity look, but to him who poured out his moſt precious life in groans and agonies on the croſs, to ſave the <hi>chief of ſinners?</hi> By whom can they wiſh to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, but by him who has the dignity and glory of a kingdom to beſtow, to whom all power is committed in Heaven and earth? This petition ſeems plainly to imply that the thief on the croſs was a real friend of CHRIST, and that he was willing to be ſaved on the terms of the goſpel.—His converſion might not, perhaps, in all reſpects have been ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as ſome have ſuppoſed: It is evident that he had ſome knowledge of the character of CHRIST from what he ſaid to his fellow-ſufferer, <hi>This man has done nothing amiſs.</hi> It is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he might have heard ſome of our LORD's diſcourſes, and ſeen ſome of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works.</p>
            <p>DURING his confinement in priſon he might have been convinced of the evil and danger of ſin, and have had ſerious thoughts upon death and judgment.—Some have ſuppoſed that he might
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019037_0007_0FA99E55ABD3A678"/>
have been a good man before the commiſſion of the crime for which he ſuffered, and that this ſingle act of groſs wickedneſs which brought him to an untimely end, was not totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the truth of grace. But there ſeems no foundation for ſuch a conjecture.—The caſe of this perſon is rather recorded as a ſignal inſtance of the power and grace of the Redeemer; to ſhew that no crimes are ſo great, but that his blood can expiate the guilt of them; that no heart is ſo hard, but it may be brought, by his victorious grace, to <hi>the obedience of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"I CANNOT but look upon this happy man," ſays Dr. <hi>Doddridge,</hi> 
               <q>(for ſuch, amidſt all the ignominy and torture of the croſs, he ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was) as a glorious inſtance of the power, as well as the ſovereignty of divine grace; which, perhaps, taking the firſt occaſion from the preternatural darkneſs, wrought ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully as to produce by a ſudden and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing growth in his laſt moments, all the virtues which could be crouded into ſo ſmall a a ſpace, and which were eminently manifeſted in his confeſſing his own guilt, in his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his companion for a crime which he feared would prove fatal to him, in his vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the character of CHRIST, and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his confidence in him as the LORD of a kingdom beyond the grave, when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were triumphing over him, and he himſelf, abandoned by moſt of his friends, was expiring on the croſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:019037_0008_0FA99E566A8354D0"/>
IT is probable, that the previous knowledge he had of the character of CHRIST was merely ſpeculative, and that his heart was never effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually changed 'till this memorable day, in which he was to die on the croſs with the LORD of glory.—It is quite rational to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the divine Saviour whoſe life was a ſeries of wonders, who went about doing good to the ſouls and bodies of men, and who delighted above all things in acts of benevolence and mercy, ſhould, in a dying hour give ſome ſtriking inſtance of the power of his grace.</p>
            <p>WE cannot pretend to determine the exact time or manner of his converſion. But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that the power and grace of CHRIST are ſufficient at any time to bring a ſinner <hi>out of darkneſs into marvelous light,</hi> and to raiſe a ſoul, guilty, depreſt and polluted to the joyful hope of immortality and glory. A Being of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, does not confine himſelf to any particular mode of operation. He is ſometimes <hi>found of them that ſeek him not</hi> and prevents men with the bleſſings of his grace, while they are running on in a mad career of vice. In every age, there may be ſome ſignal monuments of the power of his grace, to ſhew that nothing is too hard for him to effect to whom Omnipotence belongs.</p>
            <p>THIS inſtance of the penitent thief cannot however, afford ſufficient matter of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others to perſiſt in ſin, hoping to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019037_0009_0FA99E594678E7F8"/>
pardon and life in their laſt moments. He had not ſinned againſt ſuch clear light and ſtrong convictions as perſons in general do, who enjoy the Goſpel: It would be preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for thoſe to take comfort from this example who have long reſiſted the ſtrivings of GOD's ſpirit; who have broken ſolemn vows and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, have ſlighted the promiſes, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the threatnings, been deaf to all the calls of GOD's word, and abuſed that grace and mercy which has been ſo freely offered them? This inſtance of late repentance, can never juſtify any who have been educated under the clear light of the Goſpel, in neglecting that <hi>great ſalvation</hi> which it offers, 'till death approaches. A ſingle inſtance of a late repentance produced and accepted in the article of death, and this under ſuch peculiar circumſtances as never can occur again,<note n="*" place="bottom">His ſuffering with CHRIST on the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>IF perſons retain their ſins as long as they poſſibly can, againſt the cleareſt light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and call upon CHRIST to <hi>remember</hi> them when they have obſtinately refuſed to <hi>remember</hi> him, can they with any propriety plead the caſe of this malefactor in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half? The probability is, that he had no fair opportunity of profeſſing faith in CHRIST 'till he was on the confines of eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

was in a ſituation far different from thoſe in general, who have been born and educated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the clear light of the Goſpel. Their caſe ſeems to come the neareſt to his, who have been educated in total ignorance of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and duties of religion, and whoſe manner of life has been ſuch, that they have had few opportunities to hear the word of GOD diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

THE general opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> reſpecting Paradiſe was, that it was a place into which pious ſouls were immediately received after death. This was the original of that oracle among the <hi>Chaldees, Seek Paradiſe the glorious country of the ſoul.</hi> This was their benevolent wiſh for a dying perſon, <hi>Let his ſoul be in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> This word is introduced only in two other paſſages in the ſacred volume; the one is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 4. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to have been caught up into Paradiſe, and to have heard unſpeakble words: The other is <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 7. where CHRIST promiſeth to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, that he ſhall <hi>eat of the tree of life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of</hi> GOD. This expreſſion plainly alludes to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful garden in which our firſt Parents dwelt while they retained their innocence; where the tree of life was fixed as a ſurety and pledge of immortality. As they would have enjoyed an immortal life, if they had not ſinned, ſo all the true diſciples of CHRIST will be admitted to a ſtate of glory, honor and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal bleſſedneſs in that <hi>Paradiſe</hi> which is above; an happineſs vaſtly ſuperior to that which the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was capable of yielding; even ſuch as <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, and which it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us however conſider for a moment, the account which the Scriptures give us of the heavenly happineſs. It is declared to be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019037_0012_0FA99E5AED1E4330"/>
a ſtate of perfect freedom from all evil and miſery. They who arrive at the manſions of bliſs <hi>hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, the ſun does not light on them, nor any heat, and</hi> GOD <hi>wipes away all tears from their eyes.</hi> There will be no danger from without, no pains and diſtreſſes from within to diſturb and perplex them. <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling and there the weary are at reſt.</hi> No <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> evil or defilement will any more cleave to them, nor will they be tempted any more to depart from GOD. No ſeducer or adverſary can have acceſs to them. When they enter the <hi>Paradiſe of</hi> GOD, they take their leave of ſin and miſery forever, and are fixed in thoſe calm and bliſsful regions, from whence ſighs and tears are perpetually baniſhed.</p>
            <p>IT is not, however, to be ſuppoſed that ſuch as <hi>die in the</hi> LORD, are, in their ſeparate ſtate, exalted to the higheſt dignity and glory of the heavenly world: But as we paſs thro' the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtages of infancy, childhood, youth, &amp;c. in the preſent ſtate, ſo it is probable that the happineſs of the next, will be progreſſive. It is evident from the general tenor of Scripture, that the happineſs of the ſaints will be greatly augmented at the reſurrection; that they will be admitted to the compleat and everlaſting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of GOD and the Redeemer. <hi>When</hi> CHRIST <hi>who is our life ſhall appear,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

            <p>THE time which our LORD mentions for conferring the bleſſings of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> on the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thief is worthy of particular notice, <hi>To-day ſhalt thou be with me, &amp;c.</hi> Some who deny con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious exiſtence in the intermediate ſtate, put this conſtruction upon the words, <hi>To-day I ſay unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> But this is a very forced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſenſe; for there could be no queſtion whether theſe gracious words were uttered on that particular day, or at any other time.—Others imagine that the phraſe is uſed inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, and intends only the certainty of his future happineſs without fixing any time for the commencement of it, juſt as it was ſaid to our firſt Parents, <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof, &amp;c.</hi> But this ſeems to be taking more freedom with Scripture than can be juſtified, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a favourite opinion.

            <p>THERE are ſundry other paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which confirm the plain and obvious ſenſe of this text, which the time will not permit me to enumerate.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 22, and on. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 8, <hi>Phil.</hi> i, 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 12, &amp;c.</note> I would only remark, what a happy and glorious change this penitent thief muſt have made, when he was removed from the pains and tortures of a croſs to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and immortal joys of Paradiſe!</p>
            <p>CAN we ſuppoſe that the hand of this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Redeemer is ſhortned that is cannot ſave? Does not he remain the ſame yeſterday, to-day and forever?

THIS ſolemn occaſion affords matter of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtruction to this whole aſſembly. We ſee here the ſad and awful effects of ſin. How has this defaced the beauty and glory of the works of GOD! What amazing havoc and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction has it made in this revolted world! How ruinous is the influence of unbridled luſts and paſſions! How do they prompt men to meaſures which impair the underſtanding and ſear the conſcience; which are diſhonorary to GOD and injurious to men; which blaſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and character, and end in miſery and death! How is that awful maxim of wiſdom verified, <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me wrongeth his own ſoul; all they that hate me love death!</hi> What aſtoniſhing progreſs do men make in vice when they have once caſt off the fear of GOD, and freed themſelves from the reſtraints of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!

            <p>THE ſcene before us is truly affecting: Three perſons,<note n="*" place="bottom">Not one of the Priſoners had reached the age of twenty-five.</note> young, healthful and vigorous, who, had they choſen the paths of wiſdom and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, might have been bleſſings to mankind, cut off in an inſtant and uſhered into eternity!</p>
            <p>WHO that has the leaſt ſpark of benevolence or even humanity can be unmoved at this diſmal tragedy. Let others be warned and admoniſhed to fly from ſin as their moſt dangerous and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemy, and excited to walk in virtues pure and peaceful path. Keep under your bodies
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019037_0021_0FA99E632B18BED0"/>
and bring them into ſubjection to your rational and intellectual powers. Never ſuffer any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, envious or malicious ſentiments to reſt in your boſoms. An inordinate thirſt after this world's goods leads men into ſnares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts which drown them in deſtruction and perdition. Let ſuch as are in the prime and vigour of their days be perſuaded to <hi>flee youthful luſts</hi> and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purſuits. Sin can never conſiſt with your intereſt as men. Its inſeparable companions, if perſiſted in, are infamy and ruin. "To hate ſin is to honour yourſelves, and to abſtain from it is your trueſt glory." Religion or early piety, will ever promote your beſt intereſts in time and eternity. It yields joy and ſatisfaction upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and affords the moſt reviving and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed proſpects. It is your beſt ſecurity in life and death.</p>
            <p>WE ſee from what has been diſcourſed that it is poſible to obtain true repentance in the near approaches of death: But let none be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from hence <hi>to continue in ſin that grace may abound,</hi>

THE preſent occaſion ſuggeſts a powerful motive to engage perſons to maintain family order and government, and to inſtill the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion and virtue into the minds of children and others committed to their truſt.

            <p>ALEXANDER WHITE, when brought upon his Trial before the Honourable Supreme Judicial Court, for Murder and Piracy on the High Seas, pleaded GUILTY.

SEVERAL other Miniſters who ſaw and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with him, were at firſt very apprehenſive that he was a mere <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> and that as death approached, he would change his ſtile: But upon further converſation, when the time of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution was at hand, they ſeemed much more ſatisfied of his ſincerity. It is worthy of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice, that he took great pains to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten his Fellow-ſufferers, by reading to them the Scriptures and other good books; by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and exhortations, and that he often prayed with and for them.</p>
            <p>As he was going to the place of execution, he was aſked, Whether he now heartily approved of the method of ſalvation through JESUS CHRIST, and could truſt in his merits and mediation for pardon and eternal life? He ſaid that it appeared to him moſt wiſe and excellent, and that he had not the leaſt wiſh for any other way of life than that through JESUS CHRIST, and that he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depend on the rich grace and mercy of GOD, through him, for pardon and ſalvation. When enquiry was made, Whether his faith and hope continued as ſtrong and vigorous as ever? He ſaid they really did, and that he viewed death with the utmoſt complacency and ſatisfaction; and further ſaid, that if theſe graces ſhould fail him in his laſt moments he would openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it: He added, that he ardently wiſhed the proſperity and ſucceſs of the kingdom of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer among men. He prayed very earneſtly with his laſt breath, and died commending his ſoul into the hands of GOD.</p>

IN this recital the ſtile of the Priſoner could not be exactly recollected; but his ideas are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as nearly as poſſible. Many other queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were propoſed to him, the recording of which, might too far protract this Appendix. Theſe facts are ſubmitted, leaving every one to form his own judgment upon ſo ſingular a caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Barrick</hi> and <hi>John Sullivan</hi> appeared exceedingly ignorant, and owned that they had never been taught to read. <hi>Barrick</hi> ſaid that he never knew his parents, but was ſent very young to the foundling-hoſpital. It was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him that proper proviſion was made there for the inſtruction of children. He ſaid that this was the caſe in ſome parts of it; but not ſo in others. <hi>Sullivan</hi> ſaid that his parents were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for the education of their children, and that of eleven he was the only one which was not taught, and that this was owing to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory temper and his diſobedience to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. When enquiry was made whether they believed the Being and perfections of GOD, and that men would be happy or miſerable after death, according to their conduct in the preſent ſtate? they anſwered in the affirmative. They were aſked whether they were ſenſible of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding evil of ſin as it is oppoſite to a holy GOD, and their need of pardon and mercy through JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST? They ſeemed at a loſs for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſaid they did not underſtand it. No ſmall pains was taken by ſundry Miniſters to lead them to a proper ſenſe of their ſtate, and to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019037_0028_0FA99E686DC4F6F8"/>
open to them the way of ſalvation through CHRIST.</p>
            <p>AT the firſt viſit they pretended to deny that they were guilty of the Robbery at <hi>Winter-Hill,</hi> for which they had been convicted; but after ſentence of death was pronounced by the Court, they both owned the fact.</p>
            <p>HAVING formed an inveterate habit of vice in early life, and been deſtitute of inſtruction and diſcipline, it was extremely difficult to make any impreſſion upon them. They ſaid they were afraid to die, ſenſible that they were unprepared, and wiſhed for more time.</p>
            <p>As the day of execution approached, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſiderably affected, and ſaid they were hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry for all their ſins, and wiſhed for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy through JESUS CHRIST. As they advanced to the Gallows, they ſeemed much diſtreſſed, and continued crying to GOD through CHRIST, 'till the moment arrived which uſhered them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternity.—Thus much is mentioned with reſpect to theſe two unhappy Men, to ſhew the extreme danger of neglecting the proper edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and government of children, and the neceſſity of reſtraining them while young from ſinful exceſſes.</p>
