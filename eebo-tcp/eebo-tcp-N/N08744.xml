            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MR. Hallowell attends, and is called in; he acquaints my Lords, that he left Boſton 20th June, that he landed at Weymouth the 17th Inſtant, and came to Town the 18th at Night; That when he came away, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were removing from on Board the Romney Man of War into Caſtle William; that the Town of Boſton was pretty quiet, but that it was not ſafe for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to return there; that Papers were ſtuck up in different Parts of the Town, declaring that they ſhould not return, and Centinels were poſted to prevent the ſaid Papers from being taken down; neither Mr. Temple, who remained in Boſton after the other Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, nor Mr. Venner, Secretary to the Board, were inſulted—He does not think, that the Determination to reſiſt the Revenue Laws is general, and is of Opinion, that the better Sort of People would be for Government, if they could be protected—That the Commiſſioners could not ſafely return to Boſton, till ſome Meaſures were taken for their Protection—He ſays, that the Number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in Boſton is computed to be from 16 to 18,000—That the Mob, which aſſembled at the Time of the Town Meeting, was not above 2 or 3,000, and there was no People of conſequence among them, except their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—

He thinks the preſent Spirit does not extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Boſton—The People of Salem and Marblehead have made no Oppoſition to the Payment of Duties—He does not think, that the People of Boſton would be joined by any of the better Sort of People in the Country, if actual Reſiſtance was to be made to Government. With Reſpect to the Seizure of Mr. Hancock's Veſſel the Liberty, he informs my Lords, that on the 9th of May laſt, the ſaid Veſſel arrived from Madeira with Wines, and two officers were put on Board her—On the 10th he made an Entry of 25 Caſks of Wine only. It was commonly reported, that he had a much larger Quantity on Board, and he heard Mr. Hancock himſelf declare, that before the Arrival of the Ship he would run her Cargo of Wines on Shore. The Officers on Board gave no Information; they were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and ſaid there had been no Wine run out of the Ship; but on the 10th June, Thomas Kirk, one of the ſaid Officers, gave an Information upon Oath, that on the Evening of the 9th May Capt. Marſhall came on Board the Liberty, and made Propoſals to him to conſent to the hoiſting out ſeveral Caſks of Wine that Night before the Veſſel was entered; that he peremptorily refuſed; upon which Capt. Marſhall took hold of him, and with the Aſſiſtance of 5 or 6 other Perſons unknown, forced him into the Cabbin, and nailed the Cover down. That he was confined about three Hours, during which Time he heard a Noiſe as of many People upon Deck at Work hoiſting out Goods; and that he diſtinctly heard the Noiſe of the Tackles; that when that Noiſe ceaſed, capt. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall came down to him in the Cabin, and threatned, that if he diſcovered what had happened that Night, his Life would be in danger, and his Property deſtroyed; Capt. Marſhall then went away, and ſet the ſaid Kirk at Liberty, but he was ſo much intimidated by the aforeſaid Threatnings, that he was deterred from making an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Diſcovery of this Matter. The other Officer, who was on board the Liberty with Kirk, ſaid, he was aſleep, but Kirk declared that he was drunk, and had gone home to Bed.—Kirk's Information was laid before the Board of Cuſtoms the 10th of June by Mr. Harriſon the Collector of Boſton, and the Board directed him to take Mr. Liſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011177_0003_0F862C5365E70C78"/>
ſeized, ſhould be delivered in Charge to the Captain of the Romney Man of War.—Many Perſons, and particularly Dr. Warren, had told Mr. Hollowell, that, if a Seizure was made, there would be a great Uproar: and Dr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren added, that he could not be anſwerable for the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences—The Captain of the Romney was applied to in the Name of the Collector and Comptroller to ſend a Boat to aſſiſt in making Seizure of the Veſſel—The Faſt of the Veſſel was thrown off by the Romney's People; and when they were hawling it, the Mob laid hold of the Ropes, and pelted the Officers and Seamen with Stones, ſo that they were obliged to tow the Veſſel under the Stern of the Romney, and the Collector and Comptroller deſired the Officer of the Romney to take Poſſeſſion of the Veſſel for her Security—About 200 Yards from the Wharf the Collector and Comptroller were ſurrounded by a Mob of 4 or 500 People, who beat and wounded them, and it was with Difficulty they eſcaped with Life—On Saturday the 11th June a Propoſal was made to Mr. Harriſon the Collector by Mr. Powell from Mr. Hancock, that if the Veſſel was brought back to the Shore, he would ſee herforth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming upon the Trial—This Propoſal was made by Word of Mouth. The ſame Propoſal was made to Mr. Hallowell by Dr. Warren, in the Name of Mr. Hancock, and Dr. Warren told Mr. Hallowell, that Mr. Hancock would give his own Bond as a Security—Mr. Hallowell told him he had no Objection, if Mr. Harriſon approved of it—Mr. Harriſon, as Mr. Hallowell was informed and believes, wrote to Mr. Hancock, that if he would even give his Word, that the Veſſel ſhould be forth-coming, ſhe ſhould be brought again to the Shore—Mr. Hancock went to Dr. Warren's Houſe on Sunday the 12th June with the ſaid Note, as Dr. Warren informs Mr. Hallowell; the Doctor was not at Home—The Doctor came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Mr. Hallowell, and told him, that all Matters were ſettled between Mr. Harriſon and Mr. Hancock, and that the Veſſel would be reſtored on Monday Morning the 13th of June; but at 12 o'Clock on Sunday Night Dr. Warren came to Mr. Hallowell, and told him that he had been at Mr. Hancock's, and was extremely ſorry that Matters could not be ſettled as he told him in the Morning, for that Mr. Hancock had taken the Advice of his Counſel and Friends, and would have nothing to do with the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but would let it take it's Courſe, and would give

Mr. Hallowell under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, that Mr. Harriſon informed the Commiſſioners on Sunday of the Steps that had been taken; they were then on Board the Romney. He does not know what Anſwer they gave Mr. Harriſon, but one of the Commiſſioners ſaid afterwards to Mr. Hallowell, that they would have had no Objection to taking Mr. Hancock's ſecurity, and making the Affair eaſy of him.</p>
