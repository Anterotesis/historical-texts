            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>COPY of a LETTER by a Gentleman in <hi>New-England,</hi> to his Friend &amp; Correſpondent at <hi>London,</hi> containing REMARKS on a late Pamphlet Entituled, <hi>Some Conſiderations on the French Settling Colonies on the</hi> Miſſiſſippi, in ſo far as concerns the Court of Admiralty within the Limits of Col. <hi>SHUTES</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>New-England.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Acknowlege it was a moſt Valuable preſent you ſent me by the laſt Ships, for which I ſhall ever account my ſelf ſingularly obliged: We in this Country being in great meaſure igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, and anxious to know what paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you in <hi>London</hi> concerning Us, in theſe Remote Parts of the World, eſpecially in the Winter Seaſon; yea and fond of all New Occurrences. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the other Papers and Pamphlets, That Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Some Conſiderations on the French Settling Colonies on the</hi> Miſſiſſippi; was what I did Read moſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, expecting. The Advantages or Diſadvantages that might thereby accrue to the Dominions of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> would have been ſet in a clear light. But after all, I obſerve, What was written therein with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that Settlement, was the Work of ſome Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Self-conceited Scribler: That Subject being treated of much more accurately in <hi>ſome of the Other</hi> Papers: and that the Author had embraced that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or Title to his Pamphlet, As a convenient way to Publiſh the Aſperſions and Reflections which he had in View, not only againſt Col. <hi>SHUTE</hi> the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039720_0002_1015824921937198"/>Governour and Vice Admiral of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the whole Officers of the Court of Admiralty therein eſtabliſhed; but alſo againſt the <hi>Lords Commiſſioners</hi> for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and which are contained therein, Namely, <hi>That he had given to their Lordſhips ſome grounds of Complaints</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>againſt Col.</hi> SHUTE <hi>the Governour, Master</hi> Menzeis <hi>the Judge, and other Offcers of that Court of Admiralty, and which their Lordſhips had not allowed to be Read.</hi> &amp;c. And becauſe you are deſirous to be informed, What truth is in theſe Suggeſtions, and that I incline to continue a Correſpondence with you, I ſhall give you as far as I have been capable to obſerve, not only my own thought, but alſo the general Sentiment of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try concerning theſe Reflections Publiſhed by that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor under Mask, and yet not ſo cunningly ſcreened, as not to be known who he is, or (at leaſt) whom he Perſonats; and you may depend upon it, I ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance nothing herein, but what can be made plain by Vouchers. <hi>Omni exceptione majores:</hi> if neceſſary.</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs by what therein concerns the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Lords Commiſſioners of Admiralty, it being beyond doubt in this place, That if the Author have perſevered in his <hi>Delirium,</hi> and diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their Lordſhips, he hath received his juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from them. Neither ſhall I inſiſt on a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Col. <hi>SHUTE,</hi> whoſe Wiſe and Prudent Conduct in all the ſteps of His Adminiſtration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, is ſo firmly eſtabliſhed, as puts him beyond the reach of Malice, and ſufficiently able to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all theſe falſe Accuſations charged upon him: And I preſume hath already done it to their Lordſhips of the Admiralties ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Judge,</hi> Regiſter and Marſhall of the Court of Admiralty in this Province: In regard the Charge
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039720_0003_10158255EF00B700"/>againſt the <hi>Judge</hi> conſiſts of ſundry Articles, and of weight (if true) That I might be able to anſwer fully your deſire, by a juſt &amp; true account of theſe Matters, I have not depended on, my own private knowlege and opinion of that Gentleman; tho' I have endeavoured very narrowly to obſerve his deportment in that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever ſince he came into the Country, and could not diſcover any failour therein tho' frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with him. And I may to you ſay, I would with as much pleaſure have Publiſhed any blemiſhes in him, as any others, if I had obſerved any thing in his Conduct blame-worthy. But I have alſo at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times taken occaſion to Diſcourſe with ſome of the moſt conſiderable Perſons in this Town, Such as Judges, Juſtices, Counſellours, Church-Men, Lawyers and Merchants, not a few, that I might have their Sentiments of him: Whoſe Teſtimonies do all agree in this, That he behaves himſelf very Prudently and Diſcreetly; is a firm adherer to His Majeſty's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as by Law eſtabliſhed, a Lover &amp; Promoter of the improvement of the Country: And that as his Station affords him opportunity, he gives ſufficient proof of his Qualifications; and was never tainted with being guilty of any of the Articles wherewith that Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer charges him. And moreover, the Articles of Charge are by the generality of Reſidenters in this Town conſidered as the Invention of One Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who was ſome time ago Advocate General in that Court, and the produce of his Vindictive Malice and Paſſion, in regard the <hi>Judge</hi> by advice of the <hi>Governour</hi> had ſuſpended him <hi>ab Officio,</hi> for his rude &amp; unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behaviour in Court toward the <hi>Judge,</hi> the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and others Members of Court; yea, and Scurrolous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to a great many of the Leidges reſorting thereto. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And who thereupon (as I am credibly informed) Swore to be Revenged on him; and now (as it ſeems) hath taken this Method, if poſſible to defame, and ſo to accompliſh his pernicious deſign againſt him.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039720_0004_1015824AA89ABEB0"/>Neither have I relyed wholly on the above-mentioned Teſtimonies, and my own proper knowledge of the <hi>Judge,</hi> but proceeded and obtained particular Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral Caſes mentioned in the Pamphlet, and of the <hi>Judges</hi> actings in theſe Caſes; And after a moſt ſtrict inquiry and exact ſcrutiny concerning the ſame; I obſerved as follows: And therefore that I may give you an impartial account of his actings therein, and do him juſtice in the caſe, albeit his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and decrees did not always ſuit with my intereſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas in Page 33 of that Pamphlet it is ſaid, <hi>The Judge was unwilling to proceed in the Governours abſence on the tryal of Capt.</hi> Smart <hi>ſeizour, until he got a promiſe of Forty Pounds, a Hogſhead of Claret, and a Cask of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that then he gave decree, and allowed all to be diſpoſed of by the Captain, for his Majeſty's uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have obſerved from the Records of Court, that any ſmall delay therein, was occaſioned by the Captains, not producing of the Writts found in theſe Veſſels, when ſeized. And that the Court was continued and Twenty-four Hours allowed that theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings might be produced in Court as the Laws directs. I alſo endeavoured by all means poſſible to diſcover if with Capt. <hi>Smart,</hi> or any other Perſon, the <hi>Judge</hi> had in that caſe or any other caſe made bargain for the Fees or Coſts of Court before Sentence; or was in uſe to defer pronouncing of his decrees on any ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and could not find ſo much as one ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon either in Town or Country to aſſert it as true, or ſo much as to ſay, They had at any time heard it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt him. And I alſo obſerved, That the <hi>Judge</hi> in that caſe of Capt. <hi>Smarts</hi> had exacted no more for the dues of Court than is allowed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. 6. <hi>Anne Cap. ult.</hi> And which was divided as the Law directs. As to the Hogſhead of Claret and Cask of Brandy, mentioned. I obſerved, That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039720_0005_1015825A254970D0"/>after the tryal was over, and Capt. <hi>Smart</hi> had got the decree, and was diſpoſing upon his Wines, he made Preſents of ſome Part thereof to his friends and acquaintance in the Town, that commodity being ſomewhat rare in this Place; and amongſt others be ſent to the <hi>Judge</hi> his Houſe a Hogſhead of Claret; and to the others ſome more, ſome leſs, as he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to beſtow. As to the Brandy, The Author of the Pamphlet can find out what way it went if he pleaſe, for the Vapors thereof ſeem as yet to affect his brain.</p>
            <p>Whereas in Page 57 the <hi>Judge</hi> is charged with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Maritime Laws, and Unintelligible kind of Speech. I obſerve the Judges and Lawyers here are of a contrary opinion: As alſo I have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally ſeen his Act of Admiſſion as a Barriſter in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which teſtifyeth, That he is a Gentleman who after a ſolemn tryal upon the Civil Law, which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume comprehends the Maritime Law, Many Years ago, was found ſufficiently qualified; which you may eaſily be informed of where you are, by His Majeſty's Advocate for <hi>North Britain,</hi> or other Gentlemen of that Country. And whereas it is Inſinuated in the ſame Page, <hi>That the Judge is guilty of Corruption, and in most Caſes frames his deciſions in favour of the higheſt bidder.</hi> The Author, I obſerve, is at a loſs in not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpecial Inſtances to condeſcend on, For I have with great application endeavoured to find out if there was any ſuch thing true in Fact, and have not been able to diſcover any caſe that had the leaſt tendency thereto: And the beſt and moſt eminent in this Place will readily aſſert his Innocence and Vindicate him from that Aſperſion. And as to the Story contained in that Book or Pamphlet of the <hi>Judge</hi> his having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one Whale as coſts of Court, for dividing another between two contending Parties: It is altogether Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, without any ſhadow of foundation, hatched by the Author.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:039720_0006_1015824E0E5BC800"/>
As to the acquittal of the Ship called King <hi>GEORGE</hi> mentioned, Page 58, unjuſtly (as is alledged) <hi>when brought to tryal for Unlawful Importation of Iron, French Brandy &amp; Iriſh Prizes, Anno</hi> 1718. <hi>And that for pronouncing the decree</hi> Abſolvitor; <hi>the Judge received aſſignment to two Servants time, valued at</hi> 22 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> each. It conſiſts with my own proper knowledge, That the deciſion in that caſe made a little noiſe, &amp; the Informers alleadged, That Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the then Advocate General had not done his part fairly; but however be that as it will, I alſo know that the <hi>Judge</hi> did <hi>exincontinenti,</hi> order the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in that caſe to be exemplified, and the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification thereof tranſmitted to the Lords of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, that their Lordſhips might be apprized with the circumſtances of that Caſe; which accordingly was done, and neither have the Lords Commiſſioners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their diſlike of that Sentence, nor hath the Informer obtained the decree to be reverſed, which he had ſufficient time and opportunity to have done, either by Appeal or Review, if the decree had been unjuſt. And as to the two Servants time mentioned in the Article, I muſt ſay the Author ſpeaks without Book: For I have diſcourſed the Merchants who had the diſpoſal of theſe Servants time; they are Men of good Credit, and I preſume well known to the late Advocate General, Who are ready if called thereto to make Oath that the <hi>Judge</hi> payed 32 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> in Province Bills for them, which was the full Value, as others of the like kind were Sold.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Pampleteer goes on and perſiſts in a Billinſgate way of arguing, <hi>That the Judge his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is unbecoming, and inconſiſtant with the Character of an Upright Judge in ſo far as he ſolicits and draws vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious Suits before him, for the ſake of Coſts, and encourages Attorneys,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To create Quarrels between Sailors and Maſters, and gives advice to Parties, both before &amp; during tryal, how to proceed, and altering the Sentences after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, upon applications made to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:039720_0007_1015825D39DAAB40"/>
I have to a Nicity ſearched for the Truth of theſe bold and arrogant Allegations, and all I can inform you of is that every branch of theſe Aſſertions are void of proof, unleſs it be taken for granted upon the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteers word: But I obſerved in the courſe of my ſearch that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> when Advocate General, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Propogate ſuch Practices, and to take Money from both Parties, which how ſoon diſcovered was one of the Motives that induced the <hi>Judge</hi> to Suſpend him.</p>
            <p>Whereas in Page 59, it is ſaid, <hi>That the Court is made up of ſuch Members, with whom one honeſt Man would think it a Scandal to act in Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All I ſhall ſay is, That the Author it ſeems is not as yet informed, That Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the <hi>bane</hi> thereof, whilſt Advocate General therein is now turned out of that Society, for the cauſes mentioned in the decree of Suſpenſion pronounced againſt him; and an other Gentleman much more deſerving put in his Place, by Commiſſion under the Great Seal of Admiralty. So that he muſt be altogether a Stranger to the Members of that Court as now Conſtituted, (or not <hi>Compos Mentis</hi>) who talks ſo of them.</p>
            <p>As to the Regiſter of Court, all I ſhall inform you of, is, He is a very ingenious Gentleman, of pleaſant Converſation, behaves very well in his Office, and moſt aſſiduous in his application, and gives great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch in all caſes to the Satisfaction of all Parties except to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> when a Member of that Court, by whom he would not be impoſed upon: and who as I formerly repreſented to you is of all Men the moſt Unſatisfiable, where his Notions, however ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd are not received and acquieſſed in as Maxims of Law. And albeit it be true, That the Regiſter is alſo
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039720_0008_10156642AEF97788"/>Secretary to Col. <hi>SHUTE</hi> the Governour; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obſerve any inconveniency to the Leidges that way, for it is moſt certain the Governour doth not in any Manner take upon him to divert or influence him in the Sation as Regiſter of Admiralty; and the Regiſter is capable and hath time abundantly to execute both Truſts.</p>
            <p>As to the Marſhal of Court, He was about twelve Months ago alſo an Officer of the Cuſtoms by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from thence, which being Notified to the Lords Commiſſioners of Admiralty, Their Lordſhips did conſider theſe two Offices as incompatable in One Perſon, and therefore required the Governour to call for &amp; intimate to him their Lordſhips pleaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould make choice of one of theſe &amp; abandon the other: This was complyed with, and he made his election to retain the Marſhals Commiſſion, &amp; hath ever ſince acted as ſuch, without having any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints laid in Court againſt him, for miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or unwarrantable exactions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Conclude,</hi> I obſerve, and cannot in juſtice to the <hi>Judge,</hi> The other Members of Court, and Leidges who are concerned in Caſes brought before it, forbear to declare, That ſince Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was laid aſide, buſineſs is carried on with great Moderation &amp; Diſpatch, <hi>ſine ſtrepitu</hi> as the Law directs; whereas whilſt he was one of the Members of that Society it was much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</p>
