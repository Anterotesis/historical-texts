            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some have given the Names, Temperatures, Virtues, History, and Figures; and mention the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that have treated on particular Herbs. Some have given their Descriptions and Names; but say little of their Virtues; as <hi>Pena</hi> and <hi>Lobel.</hi> Some have described the Plants exactly, but omit their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; as <hi>Cesalpinus.</hi> Some have omitted their

Some have given a most exact and noble History of their different Genusses and Species; but have been very sparing in their Virtues, and wholly omitted the Uses of many; as the immortal <hi>Ray,</hi> the best systematic Botanist that ever wrote in <hi>England.</hi> To their Natural History some have added a <hi>Chymical Analysis,</hi> on which they have made their Virtues depend; as Dr. <hi>Herman, Lemery,</hi> and the great <hi>Tournefort.</hi> In writing on Plants, some have given us counterfeit Figures, says <hi>Johnson,</hi> as <hi>Mathiolus</hi> on <hi>Dioscorides;</hi> and others counterfeit Cures, as <hi>Amatus Lusitanus;</hi> which <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> says, were <hi>Potius fictae quam factae.</hi> Several have treated each only of one Plant, as <hi>Antonius Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> on <hi>Betony; Formius</hi> on <hi>Maidenhair; Blotwitzch</hi> on the <hi>Elder-Tree; Hertodt</hi> on <hi>Saffron; Scharfius</hi> on <hi>Juniper; Christoph.

Feher</hi> on <hi>Wormwood,</hi> &amp;c. each of which forms a Kind of small Dispensatory on his favourite Herb. Some, in treating on the Virtues of Plants, have separated their Uses; putting the Internal first, and the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast. Others have Wire-drawn their Discourses still further; not only in separating their internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Uses; but, in different Sections, given the various Forms in which they are used, and Examples of those Forms; and, lastly, their hurtful Qualities; as <hi>Pemel</hi> of <hi>Crambrook.</hi> But this present Work not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Learned, and Gentlemen of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but chiefly for the Benefit of the Poor, and

their generous Benefactors (tho', perhaps, the first may find some Things in it not below their Notice) I have endeavoured fully, clearly, and concisely, to collect the Virtues of the following Plants from the most eminent and approved Authors; as <hi>Dodonaeus, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Gerard, Parkinson, Sim. Pauli, Schroder, Ray, Tournefort, Herman, Clusius, Dioscorides,</hi> &amp;c. which may perhaps neither be an unacceptable nor unprofitable Labour; as it is,</p>
            <p>First, An Essay toward reviving and restoring the Use of Simples; which are now so much neglected, that many of them are reckoned not only useless, but troublesome; to get clear of, or keep under which, the Possessors of Grounds are often put to a yearly Expence and Labour. <hi>2.</hi> The Neglect and Contempt of a great Part of our own Plants has made Way for a <hi>Farra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> of <hi>Exotics</hi> imported, and <hi>palmed</hi> on us; which, being neither of our own Growth, Soil, nor Climate, may probably not be so well suited to our Constitutions, as these produced in the same Soil and Climate with ourselves. <hi>3.</hi> From the encouraged and increased Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of <hi>Exotics,</hi> and Neglect of the greatest Part of our own physical Simples, we forget their Virtues and Uses: Hence they become Strangers to us, whilst we familiarize ourselves to the Foreign. <hi>4.</hi> As a Consequence of the last, a Disuse of our Simples has produced a great Multiplicity of <hi>Nostrums,</hi> the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors whereof still retain the Use of our Plants as great <hi>Secrets,</hi> and often with such astonishing Success, as may put the regular and fashionable Practisers to the Blush. <hi>5.</hi> From this Neglect of our Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and running into Mixtures of a Scantling of them with a Number of <hi>Exotics;</hi> or our Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Compounds, or trusting too much to the Production of the Furnaces; we must be at an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty what to charge their Effects upon, whether they are good or bad. <hi>6.</hi> This Dependance upon <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006783_0005_1029993A53511D38"/>
too many Compounds, and chymical Preparations, in too great a Measure deprives the Poor of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Gifts of kind Providence, to their too frequent Loss, and often Danger; and not seldom disables charitably disposed Persons, of moderate Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, from doing that Service to their poor Neighbours in many slighter Disorders, that they have both a Will and a Power to do. And it lies too hard on many Parishes, who have Abundance of Poor, but little or no Trade; especially when so few now know the common Virtues of our own Herbs. It is not only a Hardship upon the Poor, that so few Simples are used in Practice, but must often disappoint our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, frustrate our Desire, and the Hopes of the Sick; such a small Handful of Simples not being able to grapple with and vanquish such a Multitude of Diseases and their Symptoms; tho' it must be confessed to be a very easy Way for Tyro's to come at the Knowledge of a Profession, when a few Lines contain all Necessaries for its Practice. And, since the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent small Number of Materials may suffice for Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, any Person that can remember them may turn Physician; and Physicians may become what they please besides. Not that I would hereby encourage crowding Prescriptions with a great Number of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, where different Indications require it not; for so, we could never be certain what one or two Ingredients of the whole Jumble answer'd the Design; besides the Nauseousness of such Farrago's, and Bulk of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, thrust upon the Sick. <hi>7.</hi> To consult botanical Writers on the Virtues of Plants, is a Task beyond the Reach of most private Persons, on many Accounts very obvious to the Reader. <hi>8</hi>thly, and lastly, I have not only endeavoured to give a fair, impartial View, of the Simples here treated of; but, as every Age, and every Author, on this large Subject, have made some further Discoveries and Additions; so I have thrown

in several from my own Observations, the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Friends, and from many practical Authors of the best Repute: And, had I made no other Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, it had been enough to say, that I have given the <hi>English</hi> Reader a good Part of the Observations and Receipts communicated by several of the most learned Physicians of the last Age to the excellent Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> in his <hi>Historia Plantarum;</hi> and of the faithful and ingenious Dr. <hi>Sim. Pauli,</hi> in his <hi>Quadripartitum Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicum,</hi> and <hi>Cruso</hi>'s <hi>Medicamentorum Thesaurus:</hi> Many Articles of the last are put together at the Ends of several Plants in the Notes.</p>
            <p>To shorten the Work, and to bring it into as narrow a Compass as I could, and yet to render it as easy and familiar as possible, I have, <hi>1.</hi> Omitted <hi>all foreign</hi> and imported Roots, Woods, Barks, Excrescences, Gums, Resins, Balsams, Fruits, Leaves, Flowers, and Seeds; and took in only such as are now produced in <hi>our</hi> Gardens and Fields. <hi>2.</hi> By omitting all our own Productions, whose physical Uses we know not, the Kinds and Species of which are very numerous, and even some whose Virtues we lay little Stress on. <hi>3.</hi> By omitting the Descriptions and Enumerations of the various Species whose Virtues we formerly knew and used. <hi>4.</hi> By omitting such as are the Stores of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, Kitchens and Cellars; as <hi>Wheat, Oats, Rye, Barley, Beans, Pease, Coleworts, Cabbages, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, Parsnips, Vines, Spinages, Celeri, Shallots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>5.</hi> By omitting the civil, mechanical, social, and delicious Uses of those Things treated of; as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, Furniture, Utensils, Buildings, Wines, &amp;c. <hi>6.</hi> By omitting their chymical Analyses, Preparations and Uses. <hi>7.</hi> By omitting their many officinal Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the various Compositions in which they are used. <hi>8.</hi> By not separating their inward and outward Virtues and Uses, nor making distinct Articles of their good and bad Qualities, nor insisting on the various

Forms in which they are used. <hi>9.</hi> By omitting the many prolix Wranglings and Disputes that have been raised about their Virtues, Uses, Preparations, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, for such and such Diseases, Forms, <hi>&amp;c. 10.</hi> To consult the Benefit, and avoid the Danger, I have omitted most of the poisonous Tribe; and, of the few taken in, only so much of them as cannot well be wanted, and in that Manner wherein they cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily do Harm. <hi>11.</hi> By neglecting the Qualities as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed them by the Ancients, of hot, cold, dry, or moist, in their several Degrees, and the various Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of those Qualities: And also the Whims of astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Practitioners, of the sundry Herbs being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of such and such Planets, and when they were to be gathered, prepared, and used, under their respective, or opposite Planets, or their Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Oppositions. <hi>12.</hi> By passing by the idle, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, superstitious Uses ascribed to them, against Sorceries, Witchcrafts, Possessions, and other Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Product of <hi>distemper'd Brains, wrong Heads,</hi> and <hi>Druids,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>13.</hi> I have industriously concealed some of their most detestable and pernicious Uses, as how to provoke Lasciviousness, Whoredom, and Uncleannesses, unlawful and unseasonable; as how by Violence to provoke the <hi>Menses,</hi> cause Abortion, destroy the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and whatever might tend to the Increase of Wickedness. <hi>14.</hi> I have avoided lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Discourse by an useless and pompous Quotation of a Crowd of Authors, or extracting a Multitude of tedious Receipts. <hi>15.</hi> Most of the cold Applications mentioned for the Gout, Erysipelas, or arthritic Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are left out, knowing how dangerous and fatal they may be: Yet it is a Presumption, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions are dwindled from those of our Forefathers, who used that Course with Safety and Success. <hi>16.</hi> I have omitted a <hi>Rationale</hi> of the Effects and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Operation of Simples. I once designed that the
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:006783_0008_102999433432F5F8"/>
Remedies which appear to me, or I had found most successful in Practice, should have been put in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Letter; but, as that had been forestalling the Reader's Judgment, and discouraging his further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in the rest, I omitted it.</p>
            <p>Of the few Plants still retained in our present Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues, a great Part of their formerly experienced and commonly known Virtues are omitted; because it is objected, that our Ancestors ascribed far more Virtues to them than they really had, or deserved; but then let it be considered, <hi>1.</hi> That various Constitutions and Habits of Body do necessarily produce a Variety and Difference of Effects in Medicines on our Bodies, as we see from daily Experience; the Bilious require one Sort, the Phlegmatic another, the Melancholic a third; gross, corpulent Bodies, and hectic, atrophic Habits, must be differently treated, and often in the same Disease. <hi>2.</hi> The same Disorders, in different Persons, arise from very different Causes, and so challenge different Treatment, though the Diseases are the same. <hi>3.</hi> The same Cause often generates various Diseases, as Inflammations of the Brain, Throat, Sides, Lungs, Midriff, Liver, Stomach, Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c. 4.</hi> The same Diseases in sundry Ages of Life challenge different Treatment: What is adapted to Infancy, is too weak for the Aged: <hi>Fox-glove, Groundsel, Hellebore, Spurge,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly prepared, may be safely given to the last, but sure none will adventure them on the Stomachs of the first. <hi>5.</hi> Things, that at one Time may be most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable and beneficial, may at another Time be as hurtful and mischievous in the same Disease; as in hysteric Disorders, or where the Breast is stuffed with much tough Phlegm: In the first, nervous and hysteric Things are best; in the last, Attenuants, inciding and stimulant Pectorals; but what prudent Person would advise either to be given uncorrected to Women with Child? <hi>6.</hi> Sundry Stages of the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:006783_0009_1029994658BD3C98"/>
same Distemper require very different Courses; as, in the Beginning of a Pleurisy, the Cough must be treated with Anodynes and Incrassants; but, when they begin to spit Phlegm, Attenuants and Inciders should be used, to prevent Suffocation; or, if the Fever runs high, the Sick very Asthmatic, and spit profusely, if he takes Salt of Hartshorn, he is quickly choaked. <hi>7.</hi> The same Distemper, in different Bodies, must be differently treated; <hi>e. g.</hi> Of two Persons in a Fit of the Stone, one must have Lubricants and Anodynes, to check the Irritation, and prevent an Inflammation; the other strong stimulant Diuretics. Of three Patients afflicted with a violent, constant, tearing Cough, in one it is catarrhous, he surely requires Incrassants and Anodynes; in another it is phlegmatic, he wants mild Evacuants and Attenuants; in the third it is nervous, and needs nervous and anodyne Things mix'd. <hi>8.</hi> Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ways and Employments of Life, and Use of the Non-naturals, demand a Variation in Practice in the same Disease; he who has been accustomed to nothing but Water and Milk, must have cooler Things in a Fever, than he who daily swallows Claret and Punch. <hi>9.</hi> The same Diseases, at different Seasons of the Year, call for another Change; for Spring Fevers and Inflammations, when the Vessels are full, require lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Evacuations, and a more temperate <hi>Regimen,</hi> than in Harvest, when the Heat of the late Season, stronger Exercise and Labour, have exhausted the Body more. <hi>10.</hi> Different Constitutions of the Air must also be considered; for in a long, moist, cloudy, rainy, blustering Season, Who will pretend to cure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents with the Bark and Salt Draughts, so as the Fever shall not return as often? And in a droughty Season, with excessive Heat, no wise Man will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cure Inflammations by Bleeding; but, during, and immediately after a great Frost, or during the Reign of dry, cold North and East Winds, scarce
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:006783_0010_102999499A8F4930"/>
any Man can fail of it. <hi>11.</hi> Different Situations of Habitation must be regarded; for the Inhabitants of low, wet, fenny Countries often want Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics more than the Inhabitants of dry, rocky, parch'd Grounds. <hi>12.</hi> In <hi>Acutes</hi> the Tendencies of Nature toward a <hi>Crisis</hi> should always be consulted, but never opposed; <hi>e. gr.</hi> To attempt a <hi>Crisis</hi> by the Skin when Nature indicates it by the Bowels, or by the Bowels when it inclines to the Skin, would be unpardonable and dangerous Practice. <hi>13.</hi> Different Quantities of the same Simple, produce different Effects. If Diuretics are given in too large a Quantity, by putting the Blood in too great a Hurry, they prove Diaphoretics. Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, given in too large a Dose, by irritating too quickly, prove Vomits. <hi>14.</hi> Different Forms alter the Effects of some Simples; for <hi>Elder-Bark,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused or boiled, purges; but, dried and powdered, is only a little diuretic. Green <hi>Asarum</hi> Leaves, eaten raw, vomit violently, but their Decoction, long boiled, is deobstruent and diuretic. <hi>15.</hi> Different Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the same Plant, often produce sundry Effects: A Decoction of <hi>Elder-bark</hi> purges, but its Powder does not: A Decoction of <hi>Ash-keys</hi> vomits, but the Salt of the Wood given with Diuretics is a powerful Sudorific. No volatile Plants can bear boiling; nor Astringents, or Bitters, Distillation. <hi>16.</hi> The same Forms of a Plant's Preparation may differ in its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as to the Time of its Preparation: Thus, <hi>Asa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> slightly boiled, purges; long boiled, it is diuretic: The more it is beaten, the more diuretic, and less pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; the less it is beaten, the more purgative. <hi>17.</hi> Plants may sometimes have different Effects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Times they are got in; all Herbs, gathered too young, abound more with an Acid than they do after. <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> gathered in <hi>June,</hi> is vulnerary, but not so after: Unripe <hi>Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts</hi> purge, but the ripe do not. How many tender
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:006783_0011_1029994E80E96218"/>
young Buds are eaten in the Spring, which afterwards cannot be so used? And are not almost all physical Roots taken up either in the Spring-Time, when they begin to sprout, or after their Leaves are fallen? And what are unripe Seeds good for? <hi>18.</hi> Different Mixtures will produce Effects different from the Simples used separately; thus <hi>Elder-bark</hi> with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Poppies</hi> is sudorific; the same is the lixivious <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> given with Diuretics. <hi>19.</hi> The Time of giving them may likewise make a Difference; for white <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore,</hi> given in a small Dose, may be safer on a full Stomach, than on an empty. <hi>20.</hi> The different Places of Growth of the same Species of Plant make some Difference in its Effects: <hi>Wild Arrach</hi> is drier than that in the Garden, which is cooler and moister: Sea <hi>Arrach</hi> vomits and purges more than either of the other. <hi>English Tobacco</hi> is milder than that of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>21.</hi> The several Parts of the same Plants very often have different Effects; no Wonder then that we find sundry Virtues ascribed to it. Thus, <hi>e. gr.</hi> The Leaves of <hi>Agrimony</hi> are vulnerary and deobstruent, the Root astringent, the Seed detergent and attractive. The Oil of <hi>Sweet Almonds</hi> softens and loosens; the <hi>Gum</hi> of the Tree conglutinates. <hi>Arrach</hi> Leaves cool and moisten; the Seed vomits and purges unsafely. Green <hi>Asarum</hi> Leaves, eaten, vomit vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; the Root vomits mildly. A Decoction of <hi>Ash-keys</hi> vomits, but that of the Bark sweats. <hi>Beech Leaves</hi> are cooling and binding; the Nuts are warm and moist. <hi>Betony Leaves</hi> are excellent and useful; the Root is quite loathsome, causes Vomitings and Belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Barberry Berries</hi> cool and bind; but the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the yellow inner Bark purges. <hi>Bullace Bark,</hi> Leaves and Fruit, are astringent; the Flowers are purging. Unripe <hi>Chesnuts</hi> purge; the Root and Bark astringe. <hi>Water Hemp</hi> Roots purge; the Tops in small Doses are alterant, but in great Doses they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:006783_0012_10299951DC8EF578"/>
               <hi>Mugwort</hi> is an Alterative; but its Ashes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, purge, and sweat. <hi>Primrose Flowers</hi> are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne, but the Root vomits. Yellow, fragrant <hi>Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose Flowers,</hi> are known to be cephalic; but those, without Smell, we know not their Use. <hi>Elder-tree Flowers</hi> are cordial, emollient, and discutient; the Wood binding and cooling; the Seeds vomit, open, loosen, and purge; the Berries provoke Urine and Sweat; the Leaves purge; the Bark vomits and purges. The Skin of a ripe <hi>Apple</hi> is fragrant, the Pulp almost inodorous. The like Observations I might make on the different Parts of many other Plants. <hi>22.</hi> As a Corollary to the Whole, here we may see the great Pains and exact Observations of our Ancestors on the Parts and Uses of Plants, and how faithfully they have transmitted them to us for our Use and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; which may reprove our Ingratitude, in neglecting their Discoveries. Give me Leave to add, that, after all that has been done, the History of the Virtues of Plants is still incompleat: Who dare say, that all the Virtues of any Plants are yet discovered, and that they have no more, or other, besides what we know? Of some Thousands of <hi>British</hi> Plants, we do not know the Virtues of above four Hundred: And, of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Tribes of Marine Plants, the little that we know of them, bears no Proportion to what we know not: Time and Chance only, not Philosophy, can make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Discoveries; but Philosophy, not Chance, must direct us to a more extensive, beneficial, safe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Use of them, when discovered. But, tho' we are Strangers to many, and perhaps the best Virtues of Plants, yet let us always be cautious, that our Credulity may not impose upon us fictitious, instead of real Uses.</p>
            <p>I would here advertise the Reader, that, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places, for his Ease, I have thrown a Heap of the most approved Simples in the same Cases, as on Dropsy, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Notes.</p>

               <pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:006783_0013_10299955165E1300"/>Some may perhaps query, Why did the Deity crowd the Surface of our Earth with such a Number of different Sorts of Plants, many of whose Virtues we are entire Strangers to, if they have any; others we are uncertain of; others the fatal Experience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny has proved to be certainly noxious; and those that we are best acquainted with, we cannot at all Times infallibly depend upon their salutiferous Effects; and by late Discoveries from improved Microscopes, we have Reason to suspect that there are yet many Genusses and Species of minuter Vegetables still undiscovered? Had it not been much better to have garnished the Earth with just so many Plants as had been necessary for Food and Physick for us, and the Creatures subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to our Uses; each physical Plant having been suited to the Cure of one particular Disease, and so had no more physical Herbs than we are liable to Diseases?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. 1.</hi> This sounds like a tacit Wish, that the Deity had been confined to our Rules and Measures; that the supreme Being, who is not accountable to his Creatures, had consulted them, that their shallow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity might have dictated to his infinite Wisdom. But, <hi>2.</hi> and more directly, Had that been the Case, there had been a Defect of one of the most noble and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Displays of infinite Wisdom and Goodness: Wisdom in contriving, making, and suiting, to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Soils and Climates, such a numerous Variety of Plants, all adapted to endless, and, to us, unknown Uses: Goodness, in providing and accommodating his whole Animal World with all Conveniencies and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries for their respective Food and Physick; yea, for the Delight and Entertainment of our outward Senses of Sight, Smell, and Taste. <hi>3.</hi> They afford a good Man a large Field of Meditation, even by viewing them, tho' cursorily; but especially when he attentively and judiciously considers their Variety, Growth, Kinds,
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:006783_0014_102999569BDBBAA8"/>
Beauty, Uses, Nutrition, circulating Juices, <hi>&amp;c</hi> he will rationally conclude, How manifold are thy vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Works, O Lord? Yet in Wisdom hast thou made them all: So that thine invisible Things, from the Creation of the World, are clearly seen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood from the Vegetables that are made, even thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Wisdom, Power, and Godhead. <hi>4.</hi> Who dare pronounce any of them useless, even to us? For, tho' we know not their Uses at present, yet they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for excellent Purposes, in due Time to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And tho' they should indeed be useless to us, yet are there not many yet unknown Tribes of Insect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals to be supplied both with Food and Physick? And what is Physick, or Poison to us, may be their Food; and what is their Poison may be our Food. <hi>5.</hi> May not this suggest a Design to us, that, as he has created such Variety of Kinds of little Animal Beings, and suited all with proper Sustenance and Helps, as we see al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every different Plant and Shrub has its own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Insect to feed and cure, which, being removed from their own to any other Pasture, cannot live: I say, this hints to us, as tho' he intended to confine every living Creature to its own proper Food, without safely incroaching on the Rights of another; lest, in Time, the stronger Races should monopolize all Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themselves, to the Starving and Extirpating of the lesser and weaker Tribes, and so have made a great Chasm in the Animal Creation: Man, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures immediately subservient to his Purposes, pasturing at greatest Liberty, far more Vegetables being nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, salubrious, and useful, than hurtful or fatal to them, while probably it is otherwise with the inferior, lesser, and more obscure Animals. <hi>6.</hi> Even of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Species there is a great Variety of Tastes, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, Ages, and Constitutions, to be served; hence a Necessity of many different Vegetables to gratify and answer them. <hi>7.</hi> Had there just been the same Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

of physical Plants created, as Mankind is liable to different Distempers, and each Plant specifically adapted to its own respective Disease; then, <hi>1.</hi> All Men must have been of one Constitution, Habit of Body, had the same Food, and Use of the Non-naturals, inhabited the like Climate and Situation, and followed a like Manner of Business and Rules of Life. <hi>2.</hi> Every different Disease must have arisen perpetually, in all, from one and the same respective Cause, and been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in all with alike Symptoms, and been always of near alike Duration; and these in all Nations, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Countries, in all Seasons of the Year, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Air, Conditions or Kinds of Food, by Land or Sea, in City and Country: There had been no Difference between Infants, Youth, Manhood, and old Age; none between Exercise and Rest, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Repletion and Inanition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But suppose God had (which is not impossible with him) created only one, or a few Plants, to have fully answer'd all the Ends both of Food and Physick to all Mankind; yet, what must have become of the rest of the Animal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both for Nutrition and Medicine, if a sufficient Supply had not been provided for them? They should either not have been created, or made to starve, and be immediately extirpated; especially Insects, and, to the naked Eye, invisible corporeal Beings.

            <head>Mr. <hi>Bartram</hi>'s PREFACE TO THIS WORK.</head>
            <p>THE first Man that was famous for the Practice of Physick in the <hi>Grecian.</hi> History, was <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who practised an Age before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and, as they say, was so skilful in his Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to cure Diseases, and raise the Dead; whereby he gained so great a Fame, as to have a Temple built to him, where those People that were afterwards cured of their Infirmities, either by his former Directions, or their own Discoveries, wrote their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure particularly, and reposed
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:006783_0017_10299961AEFEA7A8"/>
it in that Temple; from whence, after Six Hundred Years, and about the Time of the Captivity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the famous <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who was born and lived near the Temple, in the Island of <hi>Coos,</hi> searched the medicinal Receipts, and by those Informations, and his own Ingenuity, so enlarged his Knowledge in Practice of Physick, as to be to this Day called, <hi>The Divine</hi> HIPPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES; but the <hi>Christians</hi> say, that he learned his wonderful Knowledge from the Writings of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his Treatise of Plants, which was procured from the captive <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> after they had burnt the Temple: However, it is certain that most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tho' never so barbarous, have made use chiefly of Vegetables for the Cure of their Diseases, and doubtless with good Success; and certainly we have in our Country, a great Variety of good medicinal Plants, which may be administred to the People with great Advantage, if properly adapted to the Season, Age and Constitution of the
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:006783_0018_10299966AEDED720"/>
Patient; the Nature, Time and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Disease: Without which Caution, it is not likely that the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice should succeed generally. But it is very common with our People, when a Root or Herb hath been given with good Success several Times in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Disease, and the Patient recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed soon after the taking of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, to applaud that Medicine exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; then many that are sick of the same Disease, or any other, that hath near the like Symptoms, apply directly to this famed Specifick, expecting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Relief; which often failing, by Reason of its improper Application, as to Time, Constitution, or Nature of the Disease, many choice Medicines grow out of Repute again, are disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and little Use made of them, especially if they are common and easy to come at; whereas if their Virtues were well known, and a skilful Person had the Administring of them, who knew how to properly correct and fit them to the Constitutions of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,

Plantain Water, or its own Decoction, cures such as cannot hold their Water. A Poultise of it boil'd in Wine, or Vinegar, and laid to the Cods, certainly takes off Inflammations of the Stones. The distill'd Water is a good Gargle for Ulcers of the Mouth; it is also good to drink against the Stone. <hi>Doloeus</hi> says its Decoction in Water, drank, is a Specific in Madness; in which Disease, the Ancients depended more on some Doses of <hi>White Hellebore</hi> judiciously prepared.

The Root of <hi>Agrimony</hi> dug up in <hi>May,</hi> has a most odoriferous Smell; the Herb warms and dries, is of thin Substance, opens, cleanses and strengthens; 'tis a good Stomachic and Purifier of the Blood: Its Decoction or Infusion is used in the <hi>Lues Venerea</hi>; Fomentations of it are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ease Night-Pains of the Joints. The Roots are good in a Scurvy, with a Laxness of the Vessels, and Toughness of the Humours; in all weak, lax <hi>Viscera</hi>; in the <hi>Lochia</hi>; in Maids and Childrens Diseases; in bloody Urine; Blood-spitting, or Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentery; in Convulsions or Falling-Sickness. This Root may be used in Powder, Infusion or Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the last is excellent in all inward Bruises or Hurts, or Stoppage of Urine; it cleanses the Breast, and helps a Cough. The Seed heals old Sores, and Ulcers of hard Cure; draws extraneous Bodies out of the Flesh; strengthens luxated or relaxed Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and cures Ulcers of the Ears. I have often seen its Success, both as it is an aperient and vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Pectoral.—For a Falling down of the <hi>Anus,</hi> foment with a Decoction of Plantain, then fumigate with <hi>Ginger-Root</hi>; lastly apply a Poultise of <hi>Agrimony</hi>

or given in Clysters, Baths, Ointment, or in any other Form prepared; for, by its abundant slimy, smooth Juice, it softens, widens, relaxes, and makes the Passages slippery. It is beneficial in Coughs, Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Breath, Consumptions, and Inflammations in the Breast. The Decoction of the Roots, or Mucilage of the Seeds, is good in Erosions of the Bowels, Bloody-Flux, constant griping Pains, from sharp Humours. Its Poultise or Ointment softens, ripens, and eases the Pain of hard Swellings. Its Conserve is proper in sharp Rheums, Hoarseness, and other Disorders of the Wind-pipe. Clysters of the Decoction are a Specific in a Dysentery. A Liniment made of the Roots heals chopped Nipples. A Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage of the Root, in Rose-Water, is good to drink for the Strangury after Blisters. The Plant seems not wholly destitute of Sharpness, for a Poultise of the Root boil'd in Water, has been known to raise some small, red, painful Pustles, which were healed by applying Frogspawn; but that might happen either from the Poultise lying on too long, or from the Sharpness of the Person's Juices, or from both. A Decoction of the Root has eased some old People in a Strangury, and others in a <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi> The Root is an Ingredient in most cooling, softening, Pain-easing Ptisans for a violent Cough, with a watery, thin, sharpish Spittle, and in Gravel Pains with Heat, Sharpness of Urine, and Inflammation; but let Nitre be added to the Decoction. The Root is not to be used too long, lest it thicken the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours too much. <hi>Quercetan, Lemery,</hi> and <hi>Charas,</hi> have very much improved the Preparation from this Root, both in Syrup, Ointment, and Poultise. <hi>Dios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides</hi> recommends this Root for Wounds, the King's-Evil, and Swellings on the Neck, and behind the Ears; in Inflammations of the Breast, Excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Anus,</hi> Cramps or Convulsions; provided

it be boil'd in Wine or Mead, bruise it and apply it; and the Decoction of it drank at the same time: Or boil'd, and with Hogs-lard, Goose-greese, and Turpentine, reduced to an Ointment, it cures In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations in the Womb, which are cleansed by a Decoction after the Birth; its Decoction in Vinegar, for a Gargle, cures the Tooth-ach. The Seed, mix'd with Vinegar, clears the Skin from Morphew, or other Discolourings.—<hi>Mallows</hi> are possessed of the same Virtues, but in a lower Degree, and may be used where the other is not to be got: A Decoction of either, with Parsley and Fennel-roots, loosens the Belly, and brings Plenty of Milk into Nurses Breasts. A Decoction of common <hi>Mallow-Seed,</hi> in Wine or Milk, is fitter for hot Diseases in the Breast, than of <hi>Marsh-Mallows,</hi> if to drink for some Time. An Ointment of the Leaves with Camphire, is good for the <hi>Achores.</hi> The Leaves, bruised and rubb'd on any Part stung with Bees or Wasps, take off Pain, Redness, and Swelling. A Poultise of the bruised Leaves, boil'd in Oil of Roses, with Bean and Barley-Flour, is good against hard Swellings and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Imposthumes or Tumours of the Cods, and other Parts, or of the Liver and Spleen, and eases their Pain. <hi>Mallow-Juice,</hi> boiled in old Oil, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, cures the Roughness of the Skin, Scurfs and dry Scabs of the Head, and other Parts, and Falling off of the Hair; and is good for Scalds and Burns; and for hot, red, and painful Swellings in any Part. A Decoction of the Flowers, with a little Honey and Allum, makes a good Gargle for a sore Throat. A Decoction of the Leaves is a fine <hi>Pediluvium</hi> for Rheums and Waterings. <hi>Mallow-Tops,</hi> boil'd in Milk, and drank, ease the Gripes in a Dysentery, take off the Heat and Tension of the Belly, check the Blood, and sometimes cure the Disease.

               <p>APPLES are grateful and useful to hot and bilious Stomachs, but not to the cold, moist and flatulent; eaten raw, they move the Belly a little. A Poultise of roasted sweet Apples, with Powder of Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, is good in a pricking Pain of the Side; or a Poultise of the same Apples boil'd in Plantain Water to a Pulp, then mixed with Milk, and applied, takes fresh Marks of Gun-powder out of the Skin. Boil'd or roasted Apples, eaten with Rose-Water and Sugar, or with a little Butter, is a pleasant cooling Diet for feverish People. An Infusion of sliced Apples with their Skins in boiling Water, a Crust of Bread, some Barley, and a little Mace, is a proper cooling Drink in Fevers. Roasted Apples, eaten with Frankinencse, are good in an Asthma, Apples, eaten raw, roasted or boil'd, are good in Inflammations of the Lungs, Breast, and Sides, or in Consumptions. Their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup is a good Cordial in Faintings, Palpitations, and Melancholy. The Pulp of boil'd or rotten Apples in a Poultise, is good for inflamed Eyes, either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied alone, or with Womens, Asses, Goats, or Cows Milk, or with Rose or Fennel Waters. The Pulp of five or six roasted Apples, beaten up with a Wine Quart of Water, to Lambs Wool, and the whole drank at Night in an Hour's Space, cures in one Night such as make Urine by Drops, with racking Pain and Heat; if it cure not the first Time, repeat it the next Night, and it never yet fail'd, says <hi>Gerard:</hi> I knew it try'd, and it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

A Decoction of the Leaves is a proper Gargle for the Mouth when dry, rough and furr'd in hot Fevers, nor is it amiss if they swallow a little of it; their Verjuice is good for Heat and Weakness of the Stomach, and for great Belchings and Vomitings.

               <p>ARACHE <hi>(Artriplex)</hi> (stinking) is cooling and moistening, it is eaten boil'd as <hi>Cole</hi>; it is famous for opening the Belly; hence some number it with the five opening Emollients, tho' it is mostly used in Clysters, and Epithems; its Seed powerfully purges and vomits, but neither safely nor easily. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> gave its Seed with Mead in the Jaundice. It is an Antidote to the Mischiefs from the Use of <hi>Cantharides</hi>; its Juice applied to Tumours dissolves them; applied to the Gout with Vinegar and Nitre, it eases the Pain, but it is not adviseable.—<hi>Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rache,</hi> from its being more salt, purges more, and is very troublesome to the Belly; but eaten in fat Broth, it is good in a Dropsy; and prevents too great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency, and preserves from Putrifaction. The Smell of the former is good for Women in Hysterics. The Herb or Juice kills Worms in the Sores of Horses, Cattle, or Sheep. The Juice is useful in a Suffocation of the Womb, and for Inflammations. The Seed vomits and purges severely, and with

               <p>ASARUM or ASARABACCA Roots, eaten raw, cause violent Vomiting, but boil'd in Water they open Obstructions, are diuretic, and the Remedy of slow Fevers, especially from obstinate Obstructions in the Hypochondres. The Roots work more mildly than the Leaves, whose Powder taken too freely, has proved fatal to the Strong. The Dose of the Root in Substance is, from Half a Dram to a Dram; in Infusion from one to three Drams; it brings up thick Phlegm, and Bile by Vomit. The powder'd Leaves are a good Sternutatory in an Apoplexy or Lethargy, as is the fresh powder'd Root of <hi>Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort,</hi> laid about the Grinders in the Mouth; or the Infusion of dried Sage for common Drink; or Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard Seed Posset Drink after due Evacuations. <hi>Asa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> Leaves are given in Infusion or Decoction from four Ounces to nine. The Herb is a wonderful Diuretic, and Emenagogue, the smaller it is beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, more diuretic, and less purgative, it is; it has excellent Effects in a Dropsy, Jaundice, Tertian, and Quartan Fevers, and is good in Arthritic and Sciatic Pains, its Decoction in Wine or Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sweetened and drank. The more it is boil'd, the less it purges.</p>

               <p>ASPARAGUS is one of the opening Roots, it is diuretic, wastes the Stone, and brings it away; it warms and dries a little, it discusses; it removes thick and tough Matter from the Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys; for which Purposes the Root is used in Decoction, as it is in Gargles for the Tooth-ach, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006783_0034_1029999C1391CFB8"/>
to fasten the Gums; the Seed answers the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but is seldomer used. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> says it is good in the King's-Evil, and works powerfully by Urine; but all Diuretics, long or much used, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Ulceration of the Bladder; for which Dr. <hi>Bowle</hi> mix'd Vulneraries with them. <hi>Hoffman</hi> thinks it increases Seed, and stimulates phlegmatic Persons, but has a contrary Effect on the bilious. <hi>Parkinson</hi> prefers young Buds of wild Asparagus to those of the Garden and Physick; it is also good against Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of making Water, or making it by Drops; and to ease nephritic Pains, and expel Sand and Gravel; for the Jaundice; and taken in Wine it expels the Poison of the Phalangium and Serpents; or, boil'd in Vinegar, and applied, it braces up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed Arteries, and helps the Sciatica. A Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roots in Wine, drank, helps a Frenzy, Falling-Sickness, and Pain of the <hi>Uterus</hi>; boil'd in Water, it clears a dim misty Sight, and held in the Mouth, eases the Tooth-ach; it cures Pains of the Breast, Stomach, and Bowels, and drank every Morning, several Days together, it excites venereal Desire. A Dram of its Seeds,—and Cummin Seeds, given in four Ounces of Wine, helps bloody Urine; some reject its Use in a Dropsy. The Back and Belly bath'd with a Decoction of the Root or Seed in Wine, or sitting in it as in a Bath, has been found a good Remedy against the Pains of the Kidneys and Bladder, <hi>Uterus,</hi> Cholick, or other Pains in the lower Parts of the Body; and for Stiffness and Numbness of the Sinews or Cramps, Sciatica and Convulsions. The Herb provokes the <hi>Menses,</hi> is stomachic, nourishes much, and exhilerates; it must not be eaten too immoderately, especially by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, lest it sharpen the Humours.

               <p>ARSMART <hi>(Persicaria)</hi> is plain or spotted; the first is mild, cooling or drying, the last is hot and dry; it kills all Worms, both on Man and Beast, and cleanses putrified Sores, if the Juice be dropped into them, or otherwise applied; it consumes all cold Swellings, and dissolves coagulated Blood, from Falls or Bruises. A Piece of the Root, or some of the Seed, put into an aching Tooth, eases the Pain. The bruised Leaves laid to a Joint that has a Felon takes it off, The Juice dropped into the Ears kills Worms or Fleas there presently. The Leaves strowed in a Room kill or expel all the Fleas in it. The Herb or Juice, rubb'd on a Horse or Beast's Sores, drive away Flies, and all Vermin, even in the hottest Summer. A Handful of the Herb, put under a tired Horse's Saddle, makes him go fresh and vigorous.

               <p>ARUM <hi>(Wake Robin,</hi> or <hi>Cuckow Pint)</hi> is good in continued Quotidians; the Lees or Dregs of the Root, instead of a Digestive, far exceeds all others. The Root of the spotted Sort, whether dry or green, taken in Powder to Half a Dram, is a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against Plague or Poison. <hi>Targus</hi> says, he knows not a more healthful Herb, than its green Leaves, laid to a Bile, or Bubo. The boil'd Root taken with Honey, cures Diseases of the Breast from thick Phlegm, for it powerfully expectorates thick tough Matter, therefore good in an Asthma; it promotes the Discharge of Urine, and is said to cure Ruptures. The dried Root is a noble Remedy for the Scurvy, and in Diseases of the Liver and <hi>Uterus,</hi> from a cold Cause. A Poultise of fresh Leaves beaten up with Cow Dung, is good in the Gout. A Water distilled from the Root, makes a fine beautifying Wash, takes off Spots, and makes the Face shine; but the Juice of the Root, dried in the Sun, and beaten into Meal, like a Ceruse, is far better. <hi>Ray</hi> says, that the Root, mixed with Powder of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, is a sovereign Remedy in Consumptions, and was a Secret, communicated by a dying Gentleman. The Powder, taken in Wine, or other proper Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or the Juice, or Powder of the Berries, or their Decoction in Wine, provoke obstructed Urine, or <hi>Menses,</hi> purge Women after Child-bearing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the After-Birth. Taken in Sheeps Milk, it heals inward Ulcers of the Bowels. In all which Cases the distilled Water is no contemptible Remedy, a Spoonful whereof taken at a Time, cures the Itch, and an Ounce or two of it taken daily, cures Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The Leaves, either green or dried, or their Juice, cleanse all Sorts of rotten and filthy Ulcers, and the Polypus of the Nose, and heal them. A Decoction of the Root in Water, dropped into the Eyes, clears them from Films, Clouds, or Mists,

that weaken the Sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hinders their Watering or Redness. The Root made into a Poultise, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Bean-flour to an inflamed Throat or Jaws, relieves them. The Juice of the Berries, boiled in Rose Oil, or the Powder mixed with Oil, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the Ear, eases its Pain. A Decoction of Leaves and Roots in Wine and Oil, cures the Piles, and Falling down of the <hi>Anus,</hi> or even Sitting over the Fumes of them does it. The bruised Root di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled in Milk, affords a fine Face Wash.

               <p>ASH-TREE <hi>(Fraxinus)</hi> Bark and Wood, dry and attenuate, they soften the Hardness of the Spleen, and reduce its morbid bulk.

The Juice of the Leaves and tender Sprouts, taken daily in a small Quantity, is serviceable in Dropsies. The Salt of the Wood, mixed with Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, is a Sudorific, and so is the Decoction of the Bark. The Seed (called its Keys) warms and dries much, is useful in the Stone, Obstructions of the Liver, and Pleurisies. The Powder of the fully ripe dried Keys is a most efficacious Remedy, not only for the Stone, but Jaundice and Dropsy; Dose a Dram in Wine. The Bark or Leaves boiled in Vinegar and Water, and laid to the Stomach, stay Vomiting; or boiled in Wine and drank, cure the Liver and Spleen. A few of the Leaves, taken every Morning in Wine for some Time, both cure and prevent Corpulency.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Bark boiled in Spring Water is good in the Gout, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diuretic and Sudorific.

A Decoction of the Root of white Briony, in Wine or Water, drank, cures a Dropsy. A Syrup of Root used is a Specific. A Decoction of Dwarf Elder Roots in Wine, drank fasting every Morning for thirty Days, is good; or its inner Bark infused in Wine drank. An Infusion of Ground-Ivy and Wormwood in Table Beer, has cured very Hydropic Legs, and the strain'd-out Herb may be laid warm to the Parts. Fresh Juice of the green Roots of Flower-de-luce, from Half an Ounce to two Ounces, drank in Wine or Small Beer warm, is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but works very roughly.

I have known obstinate Head-achs, that for many Months had resisted all other most probable Means, cured by daily Breakfasting, for a Month or six Weeks, on a Decoction of Wood Betony in new Milk, and strained. The dried Leaf, smoked with Tobacco, has been serviceable in some Diseases of the Head. The Roots are very different from all the other Parts; they have a bad Taste, are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to the Stomach, cause Loathing, Vomiting, and Belching. <hi>Antonius Musa,</hi> Physician to the Emperor <hi>Augustus,</hi> wrote a whole Book on this one Herb. <hi>Pliny</hi> is in downright Raptures with it. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> says it is good in innumerable Distem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Powder with Honey, and a little Vinegar, strangely refreshes the Weary; it stops Bleedings by the Mouth, Nose, or Urine; bruised and applied to green Wounds, it quickly heals them, or cut Veins or Sinews; it draws Splinters, Thorns, or other Bodies, out of the Flesh; it, with a little Salt, cures Sores and Ulcers, even the Fistulous. <hi>Turnefort</hi> says, the Herb is too full of Sulphur, mixed with a little volatile oily Salt and Earth.

purulent Matter. The Seed, either in white Wine or Emulsion, is good in the Stone, nephritic Pains, and Cholick. The Leaves cleanse Ulcers, and a Poultise of them roasted under the Embers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, eases the Gout; some boil them in Milk, and lay on. The Water, Juice, Decoction, and Extract, are all good in the above Cases; a Tea of it, and wild Angelica Root, drank daily, with a little powder'd Gumguaiac, is a good Preventative of the Gout. The Leaves not only cleanse Wounds, and obstinate tedious Ulcers, but are good in loose Joints. In Gout or Gravel, the powder'd Seed should be daily drank for 40 Days. A Decoction of the Root has cured several Quartans. The Leaves applied to shrinking Sinews, help them much; their Juice taken with Honey, provokes Urine, and eases the Pain of the Bladder; the Leaves, bruised with the White of an Egg, take out Fire or Burns, ease them quickly, and heal them up; a Fomentation of their Decoction stays the Corrosion of fretting Sores or Canker; they should be anointed after, with an Ointment of the Juice, Lard, Nitre, and Vinegar, boiled up and strained. A Conserve of the Roots is good in Consumptions, Fluxes, and Stone. The lesser Burdock Seeds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest; the Roots or Seeds bruised, and often laid on hard Kernels in the Flesh, dissolve them; the unripe Seeds bruised, and steeped in warm Water or Wine, and the Hair moisten'd therewith (having been first rubbed with a little Nitre) makes it yellow. I have often seen three or four Ounces of great Burdock Seed boiled in Water, and strain'd (it would be better in Wine) and Half of the Liquor given to drink, the other Half injected in a Clyster, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued from the Jaws of Death in flatulent pituituous Cholics, when the small Intestines were slipp'd into the Cods, and could not be put back, and the

wretched Sufferers in the utmost Extremity; tho' I have often known it used so in the Cholic, yet never without Success: But its Decoction is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably saltish and bitter, that only strong Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs can retain it; it purges Phlegm and Flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency out of the Bowels roughly, but safely, and effectually; it kills and expels Worms, with their Eggs and Nests: People often subject to Boils should drink a daily Tea of this Root, and Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Tops, it will cure them. The green Leaves, worn daily under the Soles of the Feet, are reported to cure an Anasarca.</p>

The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sprinkled on Ulcers hinders their spreading. Its Conserve is excellent in bloody Urine: Some commend it as an Antidote to Madness, from the Bite of a Mad Dog. The Herb is said to thin, warm, dry, cleanse, and open Obstructions of the Liver, Kidneys, Lungs, and <hi>Uterus</hi>; it is good in the Gravel, Strangury, Cholic, Cough, Asthma, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Breathing, beginning Inflammation of the Lungs, Crudities or Weakness of the Stomach; it is an Antidote to the too liberal Use of Quicksilver; outwardly it cleanses off Spots of the Face, increases Milk, opens Buboes, or cancerous Tumours, cleanses and heals new and old Wounds. The Root fryed in fresh Butter, used in a Poultise, draws Balls out of any Wounds. Its Powder strew'd on Cancers is good, and so is Powder of Spurge Lawrel steeped in Vinegar, dried, powdered, and strewed on them, or Roots, Juice, and Leaves of Moonwort applied <note n="*" place="bottom">For an Excess of the <hi>Menses,</hi> a Decoction of Ladies Mantle drank often is good, or a Bag of Pimpernel, with Purple Flowers hung to the Pit of the Breast, or two Handfuls of it held in the Hands till it is warm, stops all Discharges of Blood.

               <p>BRYONY (White) <hi>Bryonia alba</hi>) purges Phlegm and watery Humours strongly, from its viscous Parts, sticking to the Coats of the Bowels; the Root opens Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, and <hi>Uterus</hi>; expels the <hi>Menses,</hi> brings off Water in a Dropsy, both upwards and downwards; brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Birth and After-Birth; repels Hysterics, heals the Asthma, and is useful in the Gout. <hi>Platerus</hi> took up the Root, just as it began to sprout in the Spring, peel'd off its Bark, sliced it, hung it on Threads, and dried it, either in the Sun or Shade, then infused it in Wine, and dried it again; the same he repeated a second and third Time; being thus prepared, it purged without any Trouble: Or he powder'd the prepared Root, and with a little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luatic Wine, wherein Ginger had been slightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, he made it into Troches, which, dried and powdered, he used in Infusion, which made it as mild as Agaric; the Bigness of a Nutmeg of its Conserve taken twice a Day, for a long Time, often conquers either Epilepsy, or Hysterics; or a Bit of the Root put into the Cup, out of which the Sick drinks. Formerly, some boiled and eat its first tender Buds, but it is too rough, except for very strong Bodies. The inward and outward Use of the Root is most efficacious in a Dropsy; a Poultise of it beaten up with Linseed Oil, and laid warm to the Hip, and often renew'd, does Wonders in a Sciatica; nor is it less efficacious in dissolving and drawing out clotted Blood from Bruises, Falls, and Blows, Slices of the fresh Root, laid hot to the pained Side in a Pleurisy, eases it. Take Half a Pound of a large Root, slice it, and fry it, till it is much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; strain, and add Turpentine of the Fir-Tree, Half a Pound, Bees Wax four Ounces, make an

Ointment, spread it on Linnen, apply it to scrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Swellings, and it either resolves or ripens, breaks and heals them: <hi>Zacutus</hi> swears it never once failed. <hi>Doloeus</hi> says, in the Spring Time, lay open the Ground round the Root, cut off the upper Part, hollow what remains in the Earth, cover it with the Part cut-off, and strow the Earth over all; next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hollowed Part will be full of Juice, a Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of which drank, purges gently downwards, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, Sweet-bread, and other Parts of the lower Belly, and if drank every Morning, from one to three Spoonfuls, it does, and has cured abundance of Dropsies. The Root, bruised and applied, draws Splinters out of the Flesh. The Leaves, Fruit, and Roots, cleanse old filthy Sores, fretting, running Cankers, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes and Tetters. The Root clears the Skin from all Spots and Discolouring; but, for all its good Qualities, its inward Use requires great Caution, and should be very well prepared; it, being so powerful a Purge, is fit to draw Humours from the remotest Parts of the Body, therefore in a Palsey, Cramp, Vertigo, Convulsions, and to expel Sand and Gravel from the Kidneys, and purge the <hi>Uterus,</hi> it may be of special Service. The powder'd Root, made into an Electuary with Honey, clears the Breast from thick Phlegm, and is good in obstinate Coughs and Shortness of Breath. The Berries often rubbed on, cure Tetters, therefore called Tetter-Berries. The Root applied with a little Wine, breaks Boils, and helps Whitloes, or Whitflows.

               <p>COCKLE (<hi>Nigellastrum</hi>) Some ascribe the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Nard to it, and extol it for curing Tetters, Ringworms, Scabs or Sores of the Skin, and for healing up of Wounds and Fistula's, as well as its surprising Effects of stopping Blood even by holding in the Hand, or under the Tongue, for which <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> and <hi>Sim.

Powder of dried Cranes Bill, strewed on a Wound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stops Blood, and cures it quickly. Powder of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort Seed, from Half a Dram to a Dram, drank in a Docoction of the Herb. Bruised Root of common Water Flag applied in a Poultise, stops Blood.

An Infusion, or Decoction of Yarrow Drink; or put to the Place fresh Cinquefoil Root, held in the Hand till it is warm; Burnet is of great Service; a Fomentation or Poultise of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with a little Vinegar or Crab-juice laid to the Temples, and Forehead, stops Bleeding at the Nose. As does from two to five Ounces of the Juice, drank daily in a Morning, cure all Bleedings; or, for Bleeding at the Nose, hold <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal, and Knot-Grass in the Hands till they are warm, or longer, if needful; or their Decoction, drank, and a Poultise of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied outwardly cold; or Poplar Buds gathered in <hi>May,</hi> and thrown by till they mould, which Mould stops Blood pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully.

Two or three Grains of the black Excres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence on the Top of Wheat Stalks, eaten, stops all Fluxes of Blood.

               <p>CARDUUS BENEDICTUS, holy or blessed Thistle.

Decoction of the Stalks makes Nurses flow with Milk; it helps Childrens Colour, drank in Wine; it is good for Asthmatics, and such as have the Strangury; the Juice dropped into the Ears eases their Pains.

Black Cherry Water is of late fallen into Disgrace and Disuse. Since, by several curious and useful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is found to have the same fatal Effects on Brutes, as Lawrel Water has. Fresh sweet Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries loosen the Body a little, but the dried bind it. The rough and sharp are most grateful to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach as Morella's; they agree best with palled, phlegmatic Stomachs; for they brace a little, quench Thirst, and excite an Appetite. <hi>Fernelius</hi> commends a Decoction of dried sour Cherries, as exceeding good in the Hypo, and by it many have been cured. In Diseases of the Head, but especially of the Tongue, Spirit of black Cherries has been much extolled. <hi>Bauhinus</hi> says, some admire a Mixture of black Cherry and Lime Flower Waters in Convulsions. The expressed Oil of the Kernels takes off Spots of the Face; eases Arthritic and Nephritic Pains. The Gum of the Tree drank in Wine cures old Coughs, mends the Complexion, sharpens the Sight and Appetite, and expels small Stones. Sweet Cherries are more grateful to the Taste, but not to the Stomach, for they soon putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. Most Fruits should be eaten before they are quite mellow-ripe, whilst they retain a sharp, brisk, and quick Taste; for then they are less offensive to the Stomach, and not so liable to speedy Putrefaction. But I would caution all Persons against swallowing the

Stones; a Custom that I have known fatal to some, and others have been restored with great Danger and Difficulty; yea I have known the last the Effect of swallowing Grape Stones.

Its insipid Water was used to be given to Children, for Fits, and its Juice is yet used for their Gripes. The Herb is profitably given in Broth, and other Diet, for an Atrophy, Hectic, Consumption, Inflammations of the Lungs, Breast, or Sides. It safely and powerfully cools all feverish Heats, and Heat of Urine. Its Decoction in Wort has cured a black Jaundice, when other Things fail'd. It is certain, that its Juice, outwardly applied warm, with Cloths or Spunges, and often renewed, cools the Heat of the Liver, or other <hi>Viscus,</hi> powerfully. The Herb applied in a Poultise, or its Juice used as above, or its Decoction in Fomentations, are all wonderful and efficacious Coolers and Discussers of outward Inflammations. But for this Purpose the best Poultises are made of it, Rag weed, and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, roasted under hot Ashes in a Cabbage-Leaf, for boiling dissipates their nitrous Salts, and weakens them much. Its Decoction used outwardly, stops the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Flux of the Piles, and eases their Pain. Its Infusion or Decoction in Wine, is a great Restorative after long Sickness, or violent Fevers. Its Powder is used for the Falling-Sickness; or laid to the Piles, it presently stops their Flux. The Juice is vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and cleansing, it heals sore and inflamed Mouths, and used in Diet, is good against spitting of Blood. It dissolves and discusses coagulated Milk in the Breasts. The Herb helps the Appetite and Digestion. The Juice used as above, is effectual against all hot Imposthumes and Swellings, Redness of the Face, Wheals, Pimples, Itch, Scab, Cramps, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, whether the Juice be used alone, or mixed

with Lard; the last cures sore Legs. For a strained Sinew, boil Chick-weed and red Roses in a Quart of Muscadine Wine, till a fourth Part is wasted; then add a Pint of Sheepsfoot Oil, boil it some Time, then strain and anoint herewith Evening and Morning, at a warm Fire. The Juice dropped into the Eyes, cures their Heat and Redness. It eases Pain and Heat from the Sharpness of the Blood, in any Part of the Body. It is good in hot and virulent Ulcers, and Sores in the private Parts, or on the Legs. The Herb boiled with Althaea, Foenugreek, and Linseed, made into a Poultise, and laid on Tumours and Impost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes, ripens and breaks them, or at least eases Pain, and abates Heat and Swelling.</p>

It heats and dries the cold Moisture of the Stomach, comforts it, helps Digestion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses Vapours arising from it; is good in the Cholic, for Stoppage of Urine, expels Wind, and nourishes; it corrects a bad Breath, and prevents Hurt from bad Air.

In a Word, it is one of the greatest and powerfullest Openers of Obstructions that we have; especially as it both cools and binds much; which are rare and singular Properties in Deobstruents. Its Salt with Fern Root is a Specific in Worms. The Salt lies at the Bottom of the distilled Waters.</p>

washing in this, and laying on the boiled Dock Roots all Night like a Poultise, will cure it; this he saw from Experience. The fresh Roots must be cut, and boiled to a Mucilage, and strain'd; in this Mucilage dissolve the White of the Hens-dung. For this same nasty Disease, he gives us two good Receipts; first, Take Juice of this Dock, Monks Rhubarb, and greater Celandine, of each a Dram; Butter four Ounces; mix, and boil to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the Juices; then add <hi>Diapompholigos</hi> one Ounce, Cerus two Drams, Allum a Dram, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incense Half a Dram, Flour of Brimstone a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; beat them all in a wooden or leaden Mortar; if it is too dry, add more Butter to bring it to a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment; second, Take of this Dock Root, and of Althaea, of each Half an Ounce; Elecampane Root; two Drams, Leaves of Birth-wort, Money-wort, Scabius, Plantain, of each Half a Handful; boil all in Spring Water to a Mucilage, put it through a Hair Sieve, and add Flour of Brimstone, two Scruples; Balsam Peru, to make a Liniment to rub on. Powder of Dock Root with Vinegar, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Remedy for Tetters, Ringworms, rubbed with Dock Bark, are soon taken off. The Root infused in Beer, and drank, is a special Antiscorbutic. A Decoction of the Root alone, or with other Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fics, is of great Efficacy in the Jaundice. The toughest Flesh, boiled with Dock, becomes very tender. The powdered Seed strengthens the Liver, and stops Fluxes; especially if mix'd with Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Roots, and Sugar of Roses. A Decoction of the Leaves, drank warm, loosens the Belly, like boiled Lettuce. Its distilled Water clears the Face. A slippery Decoction of the Root, drank to Half a Pint in a Morning, purges smartly.</p>

               <p>The great WATER-DOCK <hi>(Hydrolapathum)</hi> which grows in watery, marshy, stagnant Places, or in watery Ditches. The Root (if old) is thick, broad, round, spongy, and juicy; divided below into several thickish Parts, compassed with Fibres, black without, and, when just dug up fresh, it is white within; but in the Air quickly turns yellow; and when dry it is brown. It has the fewest and longest Leaves of all the Dock Kind, being from a Foot and a Half to two Foot long each; and three or four Fingers broad; broadest in the Middle, and sharp at the Point, of a leaden blackish Colour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and paler below; with palish green Veins, of a thickish firm Substance, and hard to the Touch; they fall in the End of <hi>August.</hi> The Stalks are from

It cures the Nerves and their Disorders, as broken, cut, contracted, shaking, Cramps, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, feverish Heats and Colds. It expels Venom, drives away Serpents, and cures their Bite; hence it is justly reputed Alexipharmac; it is an astringent; it heals all Sorts of Quinsies, Relaxations of the <hi>Uvula,</hi> and Disorders of the Mouth, Jaws and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. It cures Imposthumes, Tumours, and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and stays sundry Rheums. It cures Ulcers of the Legs, by applying green fresh Leaves to them every twelve Hours.

The inner Bark purges wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Humours, and is good in a Dropsy. The young tender Buds boiled in Wine, Table Beer, or Water, and sweetened, do the same, but more mildly; fitter therefore for weak Bodies. The same, powdered and drank, only move a costive Body; for in drying they lose their purging Quality, with their Moisture. An Ointment of the inner Bark, is good for Burns. The Flowers discuss, soften, and resolve; cause Sweat, and ease Pain; they are often used inwardly, to cure or prevent St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire, Inflammations, and Quartans; and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Clysters for the Cholic, Burns, and Erysipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's in Ointment. A Vinegar of them is grateful to the Stomach; excites an Appetite; cuts, and thins, thick, crude Humours. The Berries are Alexipharmac, and Sudorific. Their Spirit is justly rank'd among the best Diaphoretics, and is a fine Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuge. Their Wine, mixed with either white Wine,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:006783_0103_1029830E42AEBCB0"/>
or <hi>Rhenish,</hi> is proper in Dropsies. Or their Juice mix'd with Chicken Broth, wherein much Parsley Root was boiled and strained out, is not despicable for the same Purpose. The Seeds cleanse and purge violently upwards and downwards. A Decoction of the middle Bark, given with Syrup of Poppies, is a powerful Sudorific; for Narcotics, added to Diuretics or Diaphoretics, render them strong Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics. The Leaves boiled in Oil, with Salt, for a Fomentation, cure Swellings, or Puffings up of the Feet. The Flowers, candied with Sugar, are good in arthritic Pains. An Earthen Vessel filled with Leaves, stretched out straight, without Folds, often press'd down, and filled up, then covered, and set under Ground a Year, and taken up, at the Top is a nasty Crust, at the Bottom a most noble effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Oil; often found successful in arthritic Pains. Dwarf-Elder is both more disagreeable to the Stomach and Smell, and purges more violently than Elder. A Rob of the Berries is often used to prevent Dropsies, for it is a good Sudorific. Two Parts of Elder-Flower Water, and one of Spirit of Wine mixed, are often used with Success in a St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s Fire.

some others, and failed in none. Take Bark of Elder Root, one Ounce; of Asarum, two Ounces; Cinnamon, a Dram and an Half; boil all in Milk, strain, and drink it, just as the Fit of an every Day Ague begins; it works upwards and downwards, and cures. The Leaves and tender green Buds, are loosening; the middle Bark purges; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Bark purges strongly. The powdered Seed, drank daily, a Dram at a Time, reduces too corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Bodies. The Leaves, boiled in Water till they are soft, then add Linseed or Sallad Oil, lay it on a Cloth, and apply it to the pain'd Piles, till it cool, then apply another; so change them for an Hour or more; then put the Patient warm to Bed, <hi>Gerard</hi> says, it has not once failed to cure at once or twice using. The green Leaves pounded, and laid to hot Swellings, or Gout, give great Relief. A Dram of the powdered Seed drank daily, in white Wine, does Service in a Dropsy. A Poultise of the Leaves, and Barley Meal, cures hot Swellings. The Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus on the Tree, called <hi>Jews</hi> Ears, gathered dry, will keep good a Year. A Decoction of it in Milk, or its Infusion in Vinegar, is used for a Gargle in a Quinsy; or other Inflammations in the Mouth, Throat, <hi>Uvula,</hi> or Jaws. Given in Rose Water, or Wine, <hi>Tragus</hi> says, it is good in all Swellings and Inflammations. Its Infusion in Vinegar, helps Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of the Eyes. After Elder Berries are bruised, and their Juice expressed, there may be an Oil got by Expression, which moves both by Vomit and Stool; it is a curious Secret, and notable Experiment in a Dropsy. To cure Blood-shot Eyes from a Stroke, take Elder Flowers, an Ounce and an Half; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry Roots, six Ounces; <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal, two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Bean-Meal, one Ounce; boil them in Water, strain out the Liquor, and foment with it; and let the Ingredients in the Bag be used in a Poultise.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006783_0105_1029831A94E88230"/>
An excellent Pain-easing, and ripening Poultise, is, Flowers of Elder, one Ounce; Roots of Althaea, white Lillies, of each two Ounces; Leaves of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Handful; Powder of Linseed one Ounce; boil them in Milk or Water to a Pulp; add to them an Onion roasted under the Ashes, Ointment of Basilicon Half an Ounce; Oil of Lillies enough to make a Poultise, and apply it. The middle Bark scrap'd off, and boiled in Oil to an Half, then strained and used, eases general Pains, by anointing the Parts. For old Ulcers on the Legs, apply Juice of Elder Leaves, or add Plantain Juice, with Sugar of Lead to it; but let the Juice be daily fresh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd; for, if they are clarified to keep, they have not the like Effect. For the Dropsy boil three Handfuls of the inner Bark in Milk Water to a Half, and drink it daily. Pound and boil the inner Bark, gather the Liquor that swims on the Top, and, after shaving, and strong rubbing, anoint the Head with it; it brings on new Hair, where it was fallen off. Leaves of black Elder put hot into two warm Sacks, and, the Sick complaining of general out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pains, laid between them, let him sweat free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if they are not cured, let them repeat it again. A strong <hi>Lixivium</hi> of the Ashes of Cabbage-stalks, and Roots, to wash the Head, restores the Hair; or the shaved Head, often rubbed with raw Onions, and Honey; or a Lee of the Ashes of Mallow Roots rubbed on, and Mallow Juice used after it; or an Ointment of pounded Water Lillies, made with Butter, strained and used as before; or the Juice of great Radishes often rubbed on the Head; or rub it with the Decoction of Vervain in Oil. To cleanse the Head from Scales, and Brans, use Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Spindle-tree Berries. To kill small Insects that eat the Hair Roots, and make it fall off; use a Liniment of white Briony Root, and Honey; or

wash the Head with a strong Decoction of Master-wort Root; or with a Decoction of Roots, and Tops of Mallows, made in the Person's Urine, to steam the Head. For little Ulcers on the Head, wash them with a Decoction of Oak Leaves and inner Bark. For slight Wounds on the Head, drink a Tincture of Betony Flowers drawn in Spirit of Wine, in small Beer.</p>

               <p>DWARF ELDER, SWALLOW WORT, or DANE WORT (<hi>Ebulus</hi>) answers all the Purposes of Elder; but, as it has a more offensive Smell, so it is much stronger in Operation. The Bark and Seeds purge Water strongly, therefore is a Specific in a Dropsy, and in all Diseases from watery Humours. Its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion works more violently than its Decoction; for in boiling it loses much of its purging Quality; but both should be corrected. The Roots, Berries, and Seeds, work more powerfully than the Leaves and Buds. The bruised Leaves laid on Burns heal them. A Decoction of the Leaves, in some Lee for a Fomentation, eases gouty Pains; but the expressed Oil of the Seed is better; three Ounces of the distilled Water of the Roots, drank twelve Days together on an empty Stomach, cures Pains, Infarctions or Stuffings of the Spleen; the Leaves used either in a Fomentation, or Poultise, or both Ways, discuss hard Swellings; and used in a Bath, or Stove, to sit over, they relieve Disorders, Pains, and Swellings of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> or Belly.

be proper in cold Cases from Phlegm and Rheum, for he thinks the Herb very hot and dry: But it is not its Heat, Dryness, or Bitterness, that makes it beneficial to the Eyes, but the Subtilty of its Parts, or perhaps some other yet unaccounted for Property.

Measles there is nothing better than a Decoction of the Seed. The powdered Seed, taken every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fasting with Sugar, wonderfully strengthens the Sight; or if the Seed is infused in Vinegar, dry'd and mixed with Sugar, and a little Cinnamon, it surprizingly preserves the Sight, even to the very old Age. Nothing exceeds Fennel to cure Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Vision. The Juice of the Leaves and Roots, or the distilled Water dropped into the Eyes, does the same. The Seed strengthens the Stomach, takes away Loathings, and expels Wind. It is also good for Diseases of the Breast; for the Plant opens, discusses, resolves, in diuretic, breaks Wind; expectorates tough Phlegm, increases Milk, and softens the Throat. The Seed corrects purgatives. A Decoction of the Root and Seed is good against Fumes of Mercury. Put powdered Sugar Candy into the hollow Stalk of Fennel, Seal up the Stalk, and let it grow 'till the Sugar is melted, then pour it into a Bottle to be dropped into the Eyes. The Seed provokes Urine, and eases Pain of the Stone. Leaves and Seed boiled in Barley-water, and drank, increase Milk in Nurses. It is good in a Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough; and cures Loathing. The Herb boil'd in Broth, and used in Spoon-meat, reduces or prevents Corpulency. A Decoction of the Seed, in Urine drank, is an Antidote to the Biting of Serpents, and Poison of Mushrooms.

Dried Figs are used in Coughs, Asthma's, and Disorders of the Lungs; and in Decoctions, to Children in Small-Pox, and Measles; and in Gargles for Inflammations of the Jaws and Tonsils. Being laxative, they are eaten by Big-bellied Women, from four to twelve at a Time, in a Morning; and they mostly open the Belly. They also eat them roasted, daily, some Time before their Labour, to make it easy, and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the Birth. Applied in a Poultise, they soften and ripen Imposthumes and <hi>Buboes,</hi> very much; but, being loosening, they are very unfit for them that have too slippery Intestines, nor are they suited to bilious Constitutions. A Decoction of Hyssop and Figs, in Water, causes easy Spitting. Figs, Wheat-flour, Powder of Fenugreek, and Linseed, with Althaea Roots, all made into a Poultise, soften, ripen, and break Boils, <hi>Buboes,</hi> Imposthumes, and all hot Swellings behind the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Figs boiled in Wormwood Wine, with Barley-Meal, and made into a Poultise, and put to the Belly, are good in Dropsies. The Leaves, boiled with Althaea Roots, and beaten to a Poultise, are good in scrophulous Tumours. The Milky Juice of the Leaves, and Barley Meal, used in a Poultise, takes off the Discolouring and Deformities of the Skin. This

Juice with Grease, takes away Warts. This Milk, put in a hollow Tooth, cures the Tooth-ach, or laid to the <hi>Anus,</hi> it opens the Piles. This Milk put into a green Wound, from the Bite of a mad Dog, or other venomous Animal, presently eases the Pain, and cures the Part. <hi>Haec Gerard.</hi>

               <p>FIG-WORT <hi>(Scrophularia Major)</hi> is bitter and stinking, resolvent, and emollient, and fit to discuss the most obstinate Tumours, either cold, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory. It is good for Wounds in the tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Parts. Its Juice cleanses the most putrid Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, even though carcinomatous. An Ointment made of the Roots of this, and Pile-wort Tops, with Wax and Turpentine, to dissolve scrophulous Tumours, and abate Pain, Swelling, and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Piles, has wonderful Success; nor is it bad in Tetters and Ringworms; but then a Dram of the powdered Root should be drank every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a Glass of its Infusion in Wine. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, Infusion, or Powder, Ointment, Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or even the bruised fresh Root, applied out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, do all give surprizing Relief in the Piles, and other Diseases of that Place; and also in the Scab, Itch, cancerous, and malignant creeping Ulcers. The Root expels Worms. The Water cures the Redness of the Face. <hi>Tragus</hi> makes an Ointment, of the Juice of the Root and Plant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd in <hi>May,</hi> kept a whole Year in an unstopp'd Bottle; then made his Ointment of Half Juice, and Half Oil and Wax; boiled till the Juice was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled, then strained it, and kept it for Use.

consider some medical Effects of its Seed, which is Softening, Digesting, and Ripening, and of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Warmth. It is of great Use in Coughs, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, Gripes, Pleurisies, and Consumptions; outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it eases Pain, smooths, softens, and ripens. The Oil being mostly used inwardly, it should be purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before it is taken; which is soonest done by mixing it with Spirit of Wine, and boiling both till the Spirit is exhaled; this carries off the Acidity of the Oil. Two Ounces of this Oil, drank in any suitable warm Liquor, is excellent in a Cholic, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risy, or Iliac Passion; some of the Oil at the same Time being applied outwardly. But what is used in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, unpurified, should always be fresh drawn. Outwardly, it softens Hardness, loosens Stiffness, and Contraction of the Nerves, and mitigates rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pains. The fresh Oil is a fine Remedy in Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies; for it makes Breathing easier, and promotes Spitting. It is excellent in Spitting of Blood. It cures Cramps, and Convulsions; is good in Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Lungs, Sides, or Throat; outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it loosens bound up Parts, softens the hard, smooths the rough, and opens what was shut up. A Tea of the bruised Seed, drank, sweetened with Honey, is good in a tearing Cough, in the Stone and Gravel, Gripes, Cholic, Nephritic Pains, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the Breasts or Sides, Stitches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An Electuary of the Seed, made with Honey, and a little Pepper, drank daily, is good in a Cough.

It may also be used in Clysters for these Disorders; and for sharp and inflammatory Diseases of the Guts and Bowels. Poultises and Ointments are made of it to ease Pain; loosen, ripen, or discuss, any Swellings or Hardness. Baths and Fumes are made of it for Hysterics. The Seed mixed

Mixed with wild Cucumber Root, it draws Splinters, Thorns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the Flesh. Boiled in Wine, and applied to running fretting Sores, it prevents their spreading; mixed with Olibanum and Water, or Myrrh and Wine, it cures wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Eyes; mixed with Honey, Suet, or Wax, it discusses hard Kernels, or Swellings on the Neck, or under the Ears; and clears the Skin from Spots, or Blemishes. The Oil, beaten up with Rose Water, is good for Burns. The Oil or Seed is good for the Piles.

               <p>FOX-GLOVE, (<hi>Digitalis</hi>) some strong Rusticks venture on a Decoction of the Leaves in Water, for a Vomit; it works upwards and downwards with great Violence; sometimes causes a Superpurgation, Fever, Phrenzy, or other dangerous Symptom; therefore should either be totally refrained, or used with Judgment and Caution. Yet <hi>Parkinson</hi> affirms that two Handfuls of it, with four Ounces of Polypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Root, boiled in Ale, and drank, cured the Falling Sickness in those that had it severely for twenty-six Years.

Some make an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Flowers, by stopping as many of them as they can into <hi>May</hi> Butter or Lard, and set them in the Sun the whole Summer; or bury them forty Days under Ground; thus they preserve the Flowers with the Ointment, and spread them on Linnen, and apply to the Tumour, which they ripen and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss; or cleanse, fill up, and heal, the Ulcers. During that whole Time they purge every fifth or sixth Day, and drink constantly a Decoction of Herb Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.

Let the finer Part of the Ointment be laid on the inflamed Part of the Ulcer, and the coarser Part be spread on Rags not to be changed during the whole Time of the Cure. Some make a double or treble Decoction of the expressed Juice of the first Sprouts, or Buds of the Herb, in <hi>May</hi> Butter, 'till the Juice is wasted; this is preserved and used daily, and, though it make the Tumour larger at first, yet afterwards it will cleanse and heal it.

Its Juice or Essence, taken daily in Whey, is good in Melancholy. Its Juice or Water takes off Spots of the Eyes.

It is a Specific in Diseases of the Skin, Melancholy, and Cachexy. It is good in a Dropsy. The Root cleanses and dries up Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Mouth. Its Syrup is good in Winter. An Ointnment made of the Juices of it, Dock, and Elecampane Roots, with Lard, is good for Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Skin. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> says, that its Juice, with Gum Arabic, rubbed on the Eye brows, after the long Hairs are pulled out, hinders their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again.

               <p>GARDEN-CRESSES <hi>(Nasturtium hortense)</hi> Herb and Seed are acrid, hot, and dry; they attenuate, open, and cleanse; are good in Swellings of the Spleen, expel <hi>Menses</hi> and <hi>Foetus,</hi> if the Infusion or Decoction is drank.

It heals inward Wounds; and, eaten with Oil, helps a Cough, Shortness of Breath, and Pains of the Breasts and Sides. Chew'd in the Mouth, it eases the Tooth-ach. The bruised Herb rubbed or laid on, takes Spots out of the Skin. A Poultise of it is good in a Sciatica. It draws Bones, Splinters, and Thorns, out of the Flesh; and checks the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosion of creeping Ulcers. Boiled in Vinegar, and laid to the Throat and Neck, it is good in the King's Evil; boiled in Hog's-Lard, and applied, it quickly ripens and breaks Plague Sores.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:006783_0132_10299ACE15BC02B8"/>
boiled in Milk, it kills Worms; it warms the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and preserves from infectious and pestilential Diseases. Sitting over a Steam of its Decoction, brings down the <hi>Menses,</hi> and <hi>Secondine.</hi> Beaten up with Honey, and anointed, it cures Morphew, Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Ringworms, Scald Heads, Scurf, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driff. Applied with Fig-Leaves, and Cummin Seeds, it cures the Bite of a Shrew. Boiled in Milk or Broth, it is good in a flatulent or nephritic Cholic. Boiled in Honey and Water, it provokes Urine and Sweat powerfully. Boiled in Milk, it is good in a Catarrh or Cough. The Roots stamped, and laid to the Soles of the Feet, Sides, Wrists, Ulcers, or Wounds, may, in a few Hours after, be smell'd in the Breath. Some say that its Juice, drank, is Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but later Observations contradict it. But to bilious, or sanguine Persons, or such as have sharp Juices, it is certainly hurtful in all Shapes; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides its intolerable Smell, it raises Thirst, Pains of the Head, and all the Instruments of the Senses. But it is well adapted to cold, pituitous, phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, or aged People; whose Juices are either very watery, and their Circulation slow; or very thick, gross, or phlegmy. I have often ordered the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diet Drink, with good Success, to cachec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, aged, phlegmatic, asthmatic, or scorbutic Constitutions, with swell'd Feet, Legs, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Thighs; or in a beginning <hi>Anasarca</hi> or <hi>Leuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmatia.</hi> Take fresh Roots of Garlick, Horse-Radish, Elecampane, Knee-holly, of each two, three, or four Ounces; Tops of Broom, Scurvy-Grass, Wormwood, wild Sage, Camomile Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of each a Handful; Juniper Berries, an Ounce and an Half; fresh inner Bark of Elder, four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; bruise the Roots and Berries, cut the Herbs, infuse all in five or six Quarts of Table Beer, or in a Gallon of white Wine; keep it close some Days,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:006783_0133_10299AD2DDA5D800"/>
then bottle it off; Dose, from a Fourth to Half a Pint, thrice a Day. It may be renewed till the Symptoms vanish, which they mostly do pretty soon. Seafaring Men use Garlick with Success, for Disorders occasioned by salt and stinking Waters, and unwholesome or uncommon Foods; it is a good Stomachic to them. It is also of Benefit in a Hoarse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. It makes the Skin red, and sometimes bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters it. It is good to recover such as are almost lost by Cold or Frost. Its middle Stalk quickly cures Corns, if stamped, or bruised, and laid on. The roasted Root, put into the Ears, cures a beginning Deafness. A Poultise of Garlick, Bay, and Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Berries, and Barley-Meal, laid to the Sharebone, is very Diuretic. The Root is also good in the Tooth-ach. <note n="*" place="bottom">For the Tooth-ach, hold in the Mouth a warm Decoction of Garlick, with a little Olibanum; or Garlick Juice, with a little <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, dropped into the Ear; or a small Clove of it put into the Ear, on the same Side; or wash the Mouth often with a Decoction of wild Tansy and Vinegar; or put a bruised fresh Leaf of Betony up the Nose; or bruised Leaves of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's Purse, put warm into the Ear; or first wash the Teeth with Onion Juice, then wash the Mouth with a Decoction of Sage in rough Wine.

It is used outwardly to creeping Ulcers, raging Pain of the Piles, Ears infested with Worms, Scab, and Itch. Its inward Use dries Catarrhs. Its distill'd Water, or Decoction in Wine, has been serviceable in the Gout; and is little inferior to wild Betony. Its Decoction is celebrated for Stoppage of the <hi>Menses:</hi> It is proper to be added to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions against other Obstructions. <hi>Ray</hi> says, about <hi>Cambridge</hi> it was called the <hi>English Treacle</hi>; being found an Antidote against Poison. He says, one, noted for curing the King's Evil, gave a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Herb in white Wine, from a Quart to a Pint; Dose, two Spoonfuls, Evening and Morning, for a Month. Then he gave Infusion in four Pints of white Wine, of Rosemary and Hart's-tongue, of each a Handful, cut and infused twenty-four Hours; Dose, eight Spoonfuls, twice a Day; and also fomented the Parts affected, with their Decoction. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> admire its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Intermittents; and Country People have cured Quartans with its Powder, taken some Days in Broth: <hi>Sim.

and very opening. It is a Febrifuge, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machic, and Diaphoretic. A Handful of Leaves infused all Night in white Wine, with Half a Dram of vegetable Salt, and drank fasting, is good in the Green Sickness. A Dram of the Extract of the Leaves and Bark, and one or two Drops of the Oil of Cinnamon, taken every Morning, with two or three Cups of Germander Tea, is good for the Gout and Sciatica. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> says, the Powder with Honey, is good in a Cough, for a hard Spleen, and for such as can hardly make their Water; and in the Beginning of a Dropsy. Its Juice, with Honey, cleanses foul Ulcers. The Herb is good for a Cramp, and Stitches in the Sides; in obstinate Head-achs, Melancholy, Lowness of Spirits; a Spoonful of its Powder, taken every Morning in a raw Egg, for some Months together, cures the Falling Sickness.

               <p>HOLLY-TREE (<hi>Agrifolium</hi>) ten or twelve of its Berries, eaten, are very good in the Cholic; for they bring off, by Stool, thick, gross, and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Humours.

The Bark of this Tree affords an excellent Bird-lime, but fatal if taken inwardly, because of its Glutinousness. A Dram of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Leaf, drank in a Glass of warm Liquor, is commended in Pains of the Back. For Gripes, Holly Leaves, boiled in Posset Drink, and drank; or a Decoction of Vervain Mallows drank; or Root of Master-wort in Infusion, or Decoction.

Two Ounces of the Syrup,

with twenty Drops of Oil of Tartar, taken every Day thrice, for some Time, is an excellent Remedy for the Jaundice. The Herb opens Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, as well as purges the Breast and Lungs from Phlegm; or causes the <hi>Menses</hi>; and expels the <hi>Lochia</hi> and Secundine; or outwardly cleanses, digests, and is good for the Itch, and running Tetters; young People, especially bilious and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, must not be so free with it, as the old and phlegmatic. Too long and free Use of it hurts or endangers the Kidneys and Bladder, and exposes them to Exulcerations. <hi>Mathiolus</hi> says, that two Ounces fresh, boiled in three Pints of good white Wine, till a Half is wasted, with Roots of Bugloss, Elecampane, and Agrimony, of each a Dram and a Half; Rhubarb and Lign-aloes, of each a Dram; Dose two Ounces every Morning, for nine Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the Jaundice; but he says, aguish People should make this Decoction with Water. A Stove of the Decoction of this Herb, sat over, is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for the Whites. A Wash of the Decoction heals moist or dry Scabs. The Herb put in new Milk, and set in a Place pestered with Flies, kills them all quickly. The Herb, used for the <hi>Menses,</hi> should be used with Tincture, or Syrup of Steel, but not to the Sanguine. Ground-ivy, in Diseases of the Lungs and Breast, should be used to the young San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, instead of the Horehound. A Decoction of Horehound, boiled up to the Consistence of a thin Syrup, is good for Spitting of Blood.

Its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Buds, eaten as Asparagus, are good in those Cases. A Poultise of it, laid on, heals great Wounds, even where the Nerves are cut; whereof <hi>Sim.

A Dram of the Root powdered, given in Pomegranate Juice, Morning and Evening daily, cures a Spitting of Blood; as does two Ounces of its Juice, or two Ounces of it, taken the same Way, cure Ulcers of the Breast and Lungs. A Dram of its Powder, taken often in Plantain Water, is commended in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions. <hi>Bauhinus</hi> says, it is good in Pains of the Stomach, for the Stone, and involuntary Urine.

and the strained out Leaves applied in a Poultise, they cure. An Ointment of its Juice, with Honey and Turpentine, is wonderful in old malignant and fistulous Ulcers and Chops in the <hi>Anus.</hi> Being a narcotic Poison, like Opium, it is seldom given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, except with great Judgment and Caution, though it is used outwardly with much Freedom, Safety, and Advantage, like Poppies. A Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Root, drank, and a Poultise of it laid on outwardly, was used with great Success in scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous Tumours. An Amulet of the Root hung about the Neck, is good in the lousy Disease. The Bark is bitter, saltish, styptic, and glutinous. The Pills made of it, stay all thin Defluxions of Rheum on the Eyes, Nose, Stomach, or Lungs; they are good in Coughs and Shortness of Breath. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Leaves in Lard, rubbed on, hinders Falling off of the Hair, and cures Burns and Scalds. The Leaf bruised, and laid to a Wound, quickly heals it.

Hyssop, with Oxymel, purges gross Humours by Stool, and taken with Honey it kills Worms in the Belly. Taken with new Figs, it loosens the Belly. It restores the natural Colour of the Body, when spoiled by a Jaundice, or Cachexy. Taken with Figs and Nitre, it cures Dropsy and Spleen. A Gargle and Lotion of it, boiled with Figs, is good in a Quinsy or sore Throat. A Gargle of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in Vinegar is good for the Tooth-ach.

It dries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Biting or Sharpness, therefore the Antients used it not only in Loosenesses and Bloody Fluxes, but for the Whites. The Roots and Seeds of the white Lilly (which is mostly used when it can be got, but, in Want of it, the other may be taken) cool, dry, and bind.

It is diuretic, by abating Inflammations, or Sharpness that may stop, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, or suppress Urine. The Root is cooling and emollient, very good in all Inflammations; the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup disposes a little to Sleep, as well as cools. The Root and Flower, by their viscous Parts, check a too violent Motion of the Humours. Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction sweetens the Blood; is good in burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; to stay Rheums. Outwardly they soften and supple the Skin, easily cause soft Sleep, and are beneficial in Inflammations. The Root and Seed of the white Lilly, boiled in black Wine, and drank, powerfully stop the Excess of the <hi>Menses,</hi> even when all other Things fail, and the Case is desperate. The green Leaves laid on slight Wounds, stop the Bleeding. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> used the bruised Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Leaves, wherever Heat attended a Disease.

               <p>MARJORAM wild (<hi>Origanum</hi>) opens and cleanses; it is chiefly used in Obstructions of the Lungs, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Wombs, of gross phlegmatic Habits; for a Cough, Asthma, or Jaundice; it increases Milk; and, used before Bathing, it purges off I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorous Humours by Sweat. But it is more used outwardly in Bathes for the Womb, Head, and whole Body, against Itch or Scab. The Herb is biting, aromatic, and detergent; abounds with a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, aromatic, oily Salt. It is a diuretic, and diaphoretic Plant, good to cause Spitting, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries off gross Humours. It is best used in <hi>Tea</hi> for an Asthma, Cough, and an Indigestion, or a ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Pleurisy. Washes of its Decoction, used to the Feet, are good in Vapours, Green Sickness, and Palsy. The dried Herb, wrapp'd up warm in a Cloth, and laid to the Head, and Neck, is good for a Crick in the Neck. The Heads and Flowers, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Wine, are useful against the Biting of venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beasts. Its Decoction drank with a few Cloves, and Sugar, gives great Relief in a Hiccup. A thin

Electuary of its Powder, with Salt-petre and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, makes the Teeth, often rubb'd with it, whiter, and faster. Its Oil is excessively hot, but, mixed with milder Oils, it may be made a fine Warmer and Strengthener of the Nerves.—The wild Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram is the hottest, and Pot Marjoram the mildest of the Class. All of them have the same Virtues, but in different Degrees, according to their Heat. Their Oil is used in Poultises and Ointments for cold Swellings, Laxness, Weakness, Pains, Numbness, and Stiffness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from Cold; and in Bathes and Fomentations for the same Intentions.</p>

               <p>SWEET MARJORAM <hi>(Majorana)</hi> is of subtile small Parts; of an aromatic, lively, and quick Taste and Smell; warms, dries, attenuates, and digests. Taken in any Form it relieves the cold Distempers of the Head and Brain. The powdered Herb is a Sternutatory, brings away much Phlegm, and strengthens the Brain. The Juice of the Leaf, snuffed up the Nose, does the same. It is good in Disorders of the Breast, strengthens the Stomach, and relieves the disordered Liver and Spleen. It is proper in Diseases of the Womb, and expels Wind. Taken in Drink, it provokes Urine, and sends off watery Humours. If chew'd, or laid to the Tooth, it eases the Tooth-ach. A Handful of it, and Half a Dram of white <hi>Hellebore,</hi> boiled in six Ounces of Water to four, strained, and the Decoction snuffed up the Nose, from the Hollow of the Hand (the Mouth being full of Water) often, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Errhine in a violent, but not mild Head-ach. A Decoction of the simple Herb may be used the same Way for a Catarrh, but drawn much higher up the Nose, by having the Mouth full of Water,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:006783_0194_102982C523233570"/>
and stopping one Nostril, while it is snuffed up the other. A Decoction of this, with Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Long Pepper, used in a Gargle, recovers lost Speech. Its Oil strengthens, and warms the Nerves much. The Herb is used in odoriferous Waters, Powders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Ointments, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Pot Marjoram being milder, and not so bitter, is scarce used in Physick, but chiefly in the Kitchen to relish Meat, help cold Stomachs, and expel Wind.</p>

Its Root may be used against Contagion, instead of the Carline Root. The whole Plant is good in a Cachexy and Asthma. The Decoction purges the Blood; it is diuretic, dissolves tough and thick Matter in the urinary Passages. The Juice is good for Bruises. A Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of it boiled in Butter-Milk, is the chief Ripener. The powdered Herb, given often, cures pissing the Bed.</p>

their Redness and Inflammations. A Decoction of the Flowers, used in Posset Drink, has been long taken as a safe Expulsive in the Measles and Small Pox. The cut Flowers, eaten in a Sallad, with Oil and Vinegar, are an Antidote against the Plague; and, for Cure, an Ounce or two of the Juice of the Flowers drank fasting, and Sweat after it, this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully expels the Poison of the Plague. Their Conserve is also excellent in this Case, or their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar used to the Wrists, Temples, and Nostrils. The Juice of these Flowers, or of Celandine, rubbed often on Warts, certainly cures them. The Leaves in a Bathe, hasten the Birth. The following was an ingenious Gentleman's Method in the Want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsives of Small Pox and Measles: Take Claret and Vinegar, of each four Ounces; Ale and Milk of each Half a Pound; make a Posset, and to the clear Whig, or Whey, add Marygold Flowers a Dram; (more if green) Butterbur Root one Ounce; Grains of Kermes, two Drams; Cochineal, a Scruple; Saffron, Half a Scruple; boil all an Hour in a close Vessel, strain; Dose from one to three Ounces thrice a Day; boil the strained out Ingredients in their common Drink, and give. It proved most success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The green tender Herb loosens the Belly, the dry binds it. The bruised Leaves, or <hi>Colewort</hi> Juice, put up the Nose, are good Errhines.</p>

Either a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle made of it, or a Piece of the Root, put into, or between the Teeth, cures the Tooth-ach, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Plenty of sharp Rheum. Its Fumigation is good in Catarrhs, Tumours, and Nephritics. As it resembles, so it comes very near <hi>Angelica</hi> in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but is stronger. Its Lotion is good for the Scab of the Head, for inveterate Tetters (being first anointed with Lard) and drawing forth extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things out of Wounds. Its Powder and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction cure the Cramp, and all Diseases of the Nerves, from cold Causes. They also cure the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, Asthma, and Hysterics, from that Origin. From the Warmth and Subtilty of its Parts, it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates notably, and cleanses, and is a most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful searching Remedy; hence it cures cold Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs and Bowels, hastens the <hi>Menses,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes Fruitfulness. Its Decoction in Wine, drank Morning and Evening, is good against all cold Rheums, Distillations on the Lungs, and Shortness of Breath. It provokes Urine, expels Gravel, Sand, and dead <hi>Foetus</hi>; and is good for Vapours. The Decoction of the Root in Wine revives the almost extinct Inclination and Ability to Venery; but <hi>Galen</hi> contradicts <hi>Tragus</hi> in this. What grows wild in hot Countries, contains more Salt and Oil, than what is produced in our Gardens. It has also much the same Virtues as <hi>Lovage,</hi> but stronger; it burns the Mouth like Fire. A Tea of the Root is

proper for cold, phlegmatic Constitutions. Its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled Water, Conserve, and Spirit, are all good. The fresh Roots sliced, and hung about the Neck, are good in a Quinsy.

Henbane Leaves, and three Pugils of Melilot Tops; boil all in Water to a Consistence, put a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Oil of Tartar to it, mix and apply. The Juice or the Infusion of the Flowers, in boiling Water, with a little strain'd camphorated Spirits of Wine, abates the Inflammation of the Eyes.

And in Inflammations, or Swellings of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> Reins, or Hypochondries, What out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Application can equal, far less exceed that excellent Plaister communicated by <hi>Sim.

to the Breast. He advises, that wherever we meet with Melilot and Foenugreek absolutely, in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, only their Seeds are understood. A Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Decoction of Melilot, Agrimony, and Camomile, is best for the <hi>Anus</hi> inflamed, except it is from some sharp Things applied to it, then use a Fomentation of new Milk. For the Legs inflamed, a Fomentation of Melilot may be used; but the Leaves of Elder, warmed in a Frying-Pan till they begin to sweat, then applied like a Poultise; or a Poultise of Oats boiled in strong Wine, and laid on; or the warm Juice of Plantain, rubbed on, are much better, says <hi>Stockerus:</hi> Who says, that, for Ulcers on the Legs, Powder of burnt Horse Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Root, sprinkled on, cleanses and heals the moist Sort.

               <p>WOOD MERCURY, or DOG MERCURY (<hi>Cyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crambe</hi>) is more purgative, and often vomits. I have heard of a Dose of it taken, that caused a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpurgation and Death; and others have used it with very good Success. <hi>Horstius</hi> commends the following Clyster in the Stone, Cholic, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac Melancholy: Take Mecury, Althaea, Agrimony, and Betony, of each two Handfuls; Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyroyal, Marjoram, Bayberries, of each a Handful; Senna one Ounce; Camomile Flowers Half a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; boil to a Pound and strain; add common Oil, three Ounces; Salt, a Dram or two; mix and inject. The Mercuries are rareley used inwardly, but only externally. It and Beet Roots, boiled in Broth, loosen the Belly, if eaten an Hour before Dinner.</p>

Its Decoction, drank, prevents Abortion. Its Juice clears the Redness and Bloodiness of the Eyes. A Draught of the Decoction before the Ague Fit, three or four times, cures it, and helps Incontinence of Urine. The

Juice, drank in Goats Milk, cures the Whites. The Powder of the dried Herb and Flowers cures bloody Urine. A Bag of the Herb, worn on the Stomach, is vouched to cure Agues. Its Root, chew'd in the Mouth, cures the Tooth-ach. It is so eminent a Vulnerary, that <hi>Hollerius</hi> tells of a Rustic who had his Nose almost cut off; he had the loose hanging down Part quickly put up, joined to the other, and, with the Herb bruised in a little black Wine, he bound it clumsily on, the Blood was quickly stopped, and the Wound cured with a pretty Scar. The bruised Herb, with a little Cobweb, speedily cures Wounds.</p>

Applied out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it takes away the Hardness of the Breasts, Curdling of the Milk, and cures Head-achs. The Leaves, steeped in Milk, hinder its Curdling for Cheese. It hinders the Curdling on the Stomachs of Infants, tender, sick, and weak Persons.

Salt Mixture, and Opiates, which very rarely fail. For Loss of Appetite and Loathing, an Elixir of Mint, with its own Spirit by Infusion, with a little Sugar, is a good Remedy. <hi>Borellus</hi> gives it as a Secret, that if Women, reputed barren, will, as soon as their <hi>Menses</hi> are over, apply a Cake made of wild Horse Mint to their private Parts, in the Form of a Crown, presently before Coition with their Husbands, and keep easy both in Body and Mind, they will soon conceive. A Poultise of Mint, Rue, and Carraway Seeds, boiled in Vinegar, dissolves coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Milk in the Breasts. Black or red Water Mint, in Tea, or its Infusion in Beer or Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is stronger, and more stomachic, than Spear Mint; therefore preferred by such whose Stomachs can bear it. But Pepper Mint Water has a far more agreeable Smell, and pleasanter Taste; it is now in great Repute in private Families; it is an excellent Dram, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids not the Drinker; it is hot in the Mouth, and warms the Stomach; but in two or three Minutes after it is drank, the Mouth feels cold, hath little Taste of Mint, and feels as it were glazed over with Oil. Its distilled Water, if clear and fine, is so much worse, having its Oil separated from it; but that which is whitish and muddy, has the Oil mixed with it. It is an admirable Water against Surfeits, in Digestion, Flatulency, Belchings, Loathing, Palling of the Stomach, Gripes and Cholic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Juice of Spear Mint, taken with Vinegar, stays Bleeding; it kills Worms, even the round Sort, says <hi>Dioscorides.</hi> In a Poultise with Barley-meal, it dissolves Imposthumes.

               <p>CALA-MINT (<hi>Calamintha</hi>) whose Leaf (for the Root is never used) consists of very subtile, volatile Parts; it is more hot and pungent than Mint. It is chiefly used for the Stomach and <hi>Uterus.</hi> It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Urine and <hi>Menses,</hi> opens Obstructions of the Liver, and is good in a Cough; and whether it be infused in Wine, or its Powder drank in Wine, it discusses Flatuses. Some use it for Shortness of Breath, bilious Gripes in the Belly and Stomach, and for the yellow Jaundice: Taken in Wine it stays Vomiting; or with Honey and Salt, drank in Whey, kills Worms in the Belly. A Poultise of the Herb, or Juice applied, cures the Leprosy. A Pessary of it brings down the <hi>Menses.</hi> A Decoction of the green Herb in Wine, the Liquor used in a Fomentation, and the boiled Herb applied in a Poultise, cures black and blue Marks of the Skin and Face. Its Decoction drank, and a Poultise of the fresh Herb, applied daily for some Time, cures the Sciatica. Its Juice, dropped into the Ears, kills Worms there. Its Decoction in Wine, drank, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Sweat, and opens Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen. After the Body has been duly purged, the Use of this Herb cures Tertians. Its Decoction, drank with Sugar, helps the Overflowing of the Gall, old Coughs, Shortness of Breath, Hardness of the Spleen, or cold Disorders of the Bowels; for which Disorders, its Infusion, Syrup, Decoction, or Juice, are good. The low Cala-mint is very Opening, Cleansing, and Vulnerary; it expels Urine and Gravel; it is best taken in Broth and powdered Sugar, or in its own distilled Water.

The ripe Fruit eaten before Dinner loosens the Belly, but taken after Meat, it corrupts quickly, and is hurtful to the Stomach. The Berries quench Thirst, and excite an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. Not only the Fruit, but the whole Tree, has something in it both loosening and binding; but the Bark of the Root is most loosening; it is a little bitter, and kills broad Worms. A Gargle of the Leaves, or of Leaves and Bark boiled, is good for the Tooth-ach. They and Oil make a good Ointment for Burns. A Syrup of the Berries allays Thirst and Heat in Fevers much, and is very effectual for Inflammations, Pustules, and little Ulcers of the Mouth, Throat, and all those Parts. Some use the Juice for the Bite of Serpents, and the Eating of Night-shade. The Leaves with Vinegar are good to lay on Burns. The Leaves of Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Vine, and early Fig-tree, boiled in rain Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are good to wash the Hair, and make it clear and fair. If the naked Root have a little Slit cut in it, and a small Hole made in the Ground about the Slit, in the Harvest Time, a Juice comes out of the Tree, which being hardened, next Day is good for the Tooth-ach, and to dissolve Knots, and purge the Belly.

               <p>MULLEIN MALE. <hi>(Tapsus Barbatus, Verbascum)</hi> The Leaves are of a saltish, styptic Taste, and smell like Elder. A Decoction of the Herb, drank, is good for the Cholic. If boiled in Milk, it is good for a <hi>Tenesmus</hi> and Piles. Boiled in Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith's Trough Water, and two Cup-fulls of it drank daily, Clysters injected, and Fomentations of it used at the same time, cure the Bloody Flux, and other involuntary and expensive Losses of Blood; in which Cases, some add Oak Leaves and Silver-weed to it. Aloes dissolved in a Decoction of this, then boiled up to an Extract, it either ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritates the Piles, or causes Loss of Blood, which often makes its Use dangerous. Its distilled Water cures Burns, St <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire, Gout, and all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Skin. a Poultise of the Leaves, Leek Tops, and Crumbs of Bread, is good for pained and swelled Piles. Some esteem the Herb a Specific for the Cure of a Tympany; others will have it to be chiefly intended for Diseases of the Breast; as Cough, Blood-spitting, and to heal Gripes of the Belly. <hi>Ray</hi> says, its Leaves, worn some Days between the Feet and Stocking Soals, gently promote the <hi>Menses.</hi> Its Decoction, drank, is good in Ruptures and Cramps. A Fumigation of the Seeds and Flowers, with Camomile Flowers, and powdered Turpentine, thrown on live Coals in a Chafing-dish, set in a Close-stool; and such as are troubled with the Piles, Falling down of the <hi>Anus,</hi> Bleeding Haemorrhoids, bloody Flux, or Tenesmus, set over it, find it very beneficial. An Oil or Ointment, made of the Flowers, is good for the Piles. The Root boiled in red Wine, or Water wherein Steel was often quenched, is good for a Flux, and takes off Stoppages of Water.

Three Ounces of its Flower Water, drank Evening and Morning, for some Days together, is good in the hot Gout. The Juice of the Leaf and Flower, or the Powder of the dried Roots rubb'd on, takes away rough (but not smooth) Warts. The powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Flowers are good for Gripes and Belly-ach. A Decoction of Roots and Leaves, is good for Swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Neck, and Inflammations of the Throat. A Poultise of Seed and Leaves, boiled in Wine, draws out of the Flesh Thorns, Splinters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eases the Pain, and cures the Part. The bruised Leaves wrapped in wet Paper, and roasted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hot Embers, and laid to any Blotch or Boil in the Groin, dissolves and heals it. The Seed boiled in Wine, and applied to any lately dislocated, and new reduced Joint, takes away Swelling and Pain presently. A Poultise of Leaves and Flowers of white Mullein, boiled in Water, and applied, eases the Gout Pain. The bruised Leaves, bound on a Horse's Foot that is prick'd in Shoeing, heals it surprizingly in a little Time. The Juice rubb'd on, and Poultises of the Leaves laid to any Bruise, quickly dissolve the clotted Blood, and take away the blue and black Colour of the Part.

as are in Danger of an Apoplexy. It recovers a flagged Appetite, restores a true Taste of Meat, cures Loathing and Squeamishness (except from Whetting, Dramming, or habitual Drinking.) It causes Sneezing, and penetrates most powerfully into the Head, and Brain, proper therefore in Epileptic, and Hysteric Fits, Lethargic Drowsiness, Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and Apoplectic Disorders.

               <p>NIGHT-SHADE. (<hi>Solanum</hi>) The Berries are more cooling, but repel more strongly than the Leaves, which, as they allay and mitigate Pain, do also dissolve, cleanse, and absorb. They afford much concrete volatile Salt. Night-shade allays Inflammations, discusses Swellings, softens, and relaxes the Fibres, under too great Tension. The bruised Herb is laid to the Piles, or the Part is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the warm Juice, which, being some Time stirred in a leaden Mortar, is also laid to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. It, with a sixth Part of well dephlegmated Spirit of Wine, is accounted most efficacious to cure St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire, Tetters, Pimples, Pus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules, and the like Disorders of the Skin. Night-shade is added to most Pain-easing Poultises, as well as the Poplar Ointment. <hi>Caesalpinus</hi> says, its Water may be taken inwardly, in an Inflammation of the Stomach, and Heat of Urine; and that Waters of this and Wormwood, of each three Ounces, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

by Sweat. This Plant is always reckoned a Poison taken inwardly. <hi>Tragus</hi> says, it kills Hogs, and would not have even its Water used, under two or three Years old. Antiently it was used as a Food, and given internally (but must be done with the greatest Caution and Judgment) and externally, for the Cure of an <hi>Erysipelas,</hi> fretting and corroding Ulcers, the Head-ach, and Swellings of the Neck. <hi>Dodonoeus</hi> justly condemns its Use in an Erysipelas, because it is too cold, and too great a Repellent. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> says, that its Juice, with the yellow Part of Hens Dung, fed in a Pen, certainly cures the Lachrymal Fistula. A Liniment or Poultise of it is a noble Remedy for venereal Inflammations of the Yard. The Application of the Juice to the Wrists is said to cure Fevers. A Liniment of the Juices of this, and Housleek, and the White of an Egg, beaten up and mixed, is wonderful in the Cure of cold hard Tumours, bred in Womens Breasts.</p>

A Decoction of it, or the Leaves, given in a Looseness (after due purging) or Bloody-Flux, or Spitting of Blood, is powerful. The Acorns have the same Effect, though not to be used for Food, to rob the Swine, except in a Famine. A distilled Water of the Leaves is used for the Whites, and raging Dysen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Some use a Powder of dried Acorns to expel Urine and Stone. The <hi>Norvegians</hi> make a Meal, and Bread of them, to eat in a Dearth; or a Gargle of the tender reddish Leaves, boiled in Wine, and used, cures a Tooth-ach from Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Lithotomists</hi> use a Decoction of the Bark, for the Patients to sit in, to forward the Cure of their Wounds.

               <p>ONIONS (<hi>Cepa</hi>) are very pungent and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, of thick Parts, fit for them that abound with cold and viscid Humours; they procure them Sleep, help Concoction, and cure acid Belchings; they loosen the Belly of some, and bind it in others; they carry off Obstructions, promote Urine, and insensible Perspiration. But they are very injurious to the Bilious, affecting their Head, Eyes, Sleep, and Stomach. Onions cut and steeped all Night in Spring Water, and given Children to drink in a Morning, kills Worms. An Onion hollowed and filled with Treacle, then roasted under hot Ashes, the outward Skin taken off, and the rest beaten up to a Poultise, and applied, effectually softens and opens Plague Sores, poisonous Ulcers, and other Collections of putrid Matter. Bruised raw Onions, with a little Salt, laid on fresh Burns, not blistered, quickly draws out the Fire, and prevents Blisters. The Head rubb'd with raw Onions, Evening and

A white Onion cut through the Middle, steeped in Brandy, and laid to the pained Part, cures Head-ach and Megrim. Onions boiled in Fat, and laid to kibed Heels, cure them effectually. Onions boiled in Wine, then fried in a Frying-pan, bruised, and laid to the Belly, give immediate Relief in After-Pains. Bruised Onions, or their Juice, with Goose-grease applied, are good for Swellings of the Feet. Onions, or white Lilly Roots boiled in Water and fresh Lard, then beaten up with two Drams of Treacle, and applied Evening and Morning, draw a <hi>Bubo.</hi> Bruised Onions without the Skins, either raw or roasted, perfectly cure the dry Piles. Cut Onions roasted under the Embers, and mixed with Cream, and laid to the Side or Breast, have cured several Pleurisies. Onions boiled in Wine, and Sallad Oil, then bruised to a Poultise, and put in three Bags, one laid to the Back, and one to each Groin, gives the speediest Ease in racking Pains of the Stone and Gravel. Their Decoction is commended in a severe Cough, and Spitting of Blood. Their Seed provokes Venery. An habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Use of the Root, wastes the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Bladder, excites an Appetite, and is good in an Asthma, Scurvy, and Dropsy. They quickly ripen Abscesses. Their Use is fittest for cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aged and phlegmatic People, whose Lungs are stuffed, and their Breath short. Roasted and laid on the Ear, they, or the Juice of Elder Buds, ripen and break Imposthumes in it. <note n="*" place="bottom">For the most raging Pains in the Ear, fill a scooped Onion with Juice of Wormwood, Oil of Sweet Almonds, and Breast Milk, of each alike; shut it up, and roast it in an Oven till it is black; express the Juice, put a few Drops of it into the Ear warm, stop it with Wool and a little Musk, and lie on the opposite Side; repeat this five or six Times. The Steam of Savoury boiled in Wine, is good. For Deafness, put three or four Drops of Onion Juice warm into the Ear; or fill a scoop'd Onion with Wine, seal it up, and roast it under the Embers, express the Juice, and often drop it warm into the Ears.

of the same Nature, for the <hi>German,</hi> or wild Flower-de-luce, or the worst common Purple Flower-de-luce, is exceeding hot and dry, purges Water, and causes Sneezing. It is mostly given to purge off Water in Dropsies. Applied outwardly, it cures Tetters and Ring-worms, and cleans the Skin from these and other Spots and Deformities; but it is injurious to the Stomach and other <hi>Viscera,</hi> therefore must be well corrected. It affords several Preparations, as first, the express'd Juice purified by Digestion, and given fresh to purge. Secondly, The <hi>Faecula,</hi> or Lees made of the Juice, which purges not so much as the Juice. Thirdly, The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Oil. The Root of <hi>Florentine Orrice,</hi> or <hi>Flower-de-luce,</hi> hung in Ale or Wine, preserves the Liquors fresh, and gives them a fine Flavour, like that of Raspberries. The Root of this Plant has many Virtues; it dries, warms, cuts, thins, and expectorates, digests, cleanses, and softens. It is chiefly used for Mucilage and Tartar, in the Lungs, for a Shortness of Breath, Stoppage of the Terms, and Gripes in Children. Applied outwardly, it cleanses the Skin. Mixed with Hellebore and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it corrects a bad Breath. The Juice taken from Half an Ounce to an Ounce and a Half, and increase the Dose every Morning, till it comes to four Spoonfuls, it purges Water strongly, and has cured many Dropsies. And <hi>Hollerius</hi> gives it for a most sovereign Remedy, and great Secret. An Ounce of its Juice, says <hi>Schenkius,</hi> is incomparable in a desparate Costiveness. It first purges Water,

then Bile; but, being so very hot, it inflames not only the Mouth, but the whole Body. But tho' this is the Effect of the Juice of the common wild Sort, which ought not to be given crude, but cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, corrected, and given in Whey to cool it, whereby it is made safe and successful; yet this is not the Effect of the Juice of the white Florentine. The crude Juice of the other Kinds should not be given above two Drams to a Dose. Issue-Peas are made of the Roots. The white Florentine has a fragrant Smell, and makes a good Hair Powder. Its Powder is given to Infants for the Gripes, from acid Humours. It is put into Electuaries to thin thick and tough Phlegm, in Shortness of Breath, and old Coughs. Some commend it for the Spleen, Convulsions, and Cramps. The Root, boiled up to a Poultise, and applied, softens scrophulous, and other hard Tumours.</p>

The bruised Root steeped in Sack, or any other sweet Wine, and drank, is good for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, Cramps, Ruptures, Gout, or Sciatica, Incontinence of Urine, or other Overflowings. Half a Dram of the Seed, drank in Wine, provokes Urine powerfully. Drank with Vinegar, it is good for the Spleen. The purging Juices are corrected by Honey and Spikenard; they kill Worms, ease the Stone and Gravel, cure involuntary Loss of Seed, vomit and purge. A Decoction of the Root, in Wine, expels Urine and <hi>Menses,</hi> and eases the Cholic. The Juice eases the Piles.

with a Glass of Wine after it. It is best preserved with Sugar in form of a Syrup; thus it is agreeable to the Sick that have parched, dry, chap'd Tongues, and Mouths, Thirst, and in hot Diseases. <hi>Brassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola</hi> gave one or two roasted under the Embers to his Patients. <hi>Amatus</hi> says, they are a most delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grateful Food to the Sick. <hi>Peaches</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Brandy, but then they are too hot for Physic. The Leaves boiled in Milk, or bruised and laid to the Navel, kill Worms in Children. <hi>Parkinson</hi> says, if taken in due Time, they loosen the Belly. A Syrup or Conserve of the Flowers purge, but they often cause Vomiting, make Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren sick, and disturb the Bowels; therefore they are seldom used now. Some eat the Flowers in Sallads. The distilled Water beautifies the Face. The Gum of the Tree is commended in a Loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for Stone and Gravel; Swellings of the Jaws, Roughness of the Windpipe, Spitting of Blood, Disorders of the Lungs, and Bloody-Flux. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus</hi> commends the Kernels for the Gripes, and eaten to prevent Drunkenness; rubbed on with Vinegar, they prevent Falling off of the Hair. Their Oil induces Sleep, eases the Megrim, and, either drank, or given in Clysters, it eases the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, Iliac Passion, and Stone. A Water made of Thirty of the bruised Kernels, and One Hundred Cherry Kernels, and a Handful of Elder Flowers, all infused ten days in three Pints of white Wine, in an earthen Pot, well covered, and buried in Horse Dung, then distilled: <hi>Mathiolus</hi> calls it a wonderful Remedy to waste and expel the Stone.

If Mushrooms are baked with them, they are said to correct their Malignity; but I should be loth to try. They are either baked in Ovens, or preserved like other Fruits to keep. Harsh and sour Pears, cool and bind; the sweet loosen and nourish. The Ashes of the Wood, or the Lee of them drank in Wine, is good for those that are in Danger of Suffocation, from eating Mushrooms.

The Juice of the Root snuffed up the Nose, or its Decoction with a little Honey, gargled, purges the Head effectually, and the last purges the Breast from tough Phlegm, or gross Humours, and helps a running Itch. The following may ease some in the Heat and Swelling of the Piles: Take Linseed Oil four Ounces, boil in it Pile-wort and Flix-weed, of each what you please; strain, and add Wax, three Drams; Poplar Ointment, Half an Ounce; Oil of Box-wood and Opium, each a Dram; Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Althaea, an Ounce; mix all, and, when used, add a little Yolk of an Egg. Some take Oil of Juniper, drawn by a Retort in an open Fire, from which the Spirit is separated by the Tunnel; rub the outward Piles every fourth Hour with a Feather dipp'd in this Oil. But, in the internal Piles, throw up by a Syringe a Fourth of a Spoonful of this Oil. The Pain eases in two Hours, and the Swelling vanishes. Others make only a simple Ointment, by a triple Decoction of Pile-wort, in Lard or Butter, and to the last strained Liquor, add Turpentine and Wax, to give it a Consistence, and always apply it warm on Rags dipp'd in it, and applied, and kept on with a Bandage. Some to the Pile-wort here add Fig-wort, Flix-weed, and greater Housleek.

The Flowers boiled in Vinegar, and applied, discuss Scrophulous Tumours. A Gargle of their Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, heals swell'd Throats.

It checks Lust, hinders venereal Dreams, and nocturnal Pollutions, therefore good for the Lovers of Chastity, and the too Lascivious. The Leaves eaten raw, fasten loose Teeth, and cure such as are set on Edge; it is good for Children that have Worms, but must not be given too liberally, for its Coldness and Moistness causes it soon to putrefy on the Stomach, and relax its Tone. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> advises its Use in hot Agues, to stop bilious Fluxes, Womens <hi>Menses, Fluor albus, Gonorrhoea,</hi> Defluxions from the Head, Want of Sleep, and Phrenzy. The Seed is better than the Herb, and is very good for Heat and Sharpness of Urine, and to restrain excessive Leachery. The Juice of the Herb is good in Inflammations and Ulcers of the private Parts of both Sexes, if injected by a Syringe. The bruised Herb, applied to the Temples and Forehead, eases excessive Heat and Pain, from Want of Sleep or Rest. It takes away Redness

The Juice with Vinegar cools those Parts where Pustules, Wheals, amd Pimples break forth, the Juice with Oil of Roses, is good for Womens sore Breasts; for Burns by Gunpowder, or by Lightning. The thickened Juice, made into Pills with Gum Tragacanth and Arabic, and taken, is good against making Bloody Urine; some use the distilled Water for the Tooth-ach.</p>

               <p>QUINCE-TREE. <hi>(Cydonia)</hi> The Fruit, from its noble Astringency, is most agreeable to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; it is good in a <hi>Coeliaca,</hi> and for them that have Bloody Fluxes or Bilious, or Spitting of Blood, and in all Kinds of Fluxes; but its Bracing and Astringency, is much lessened by Boiling. Eaten before Meat it binds the Belly, but after Meat it loosens it. In hot Fevers, when the Gullet is parch'd and Swallowing hurt, a Mucilage of the Seed made with Frog-spawn Water is excellent. Though the Fruit binds, yet it provokes Urine; but in a Heat of Urine, either with or without an Ulcer, it must be refrained. The Wine of Quinces is astringent, grateful to the Stomach, Bowels, and Kidneys. The Marmalade, often eaten, is good for Women with Child, for it not only strengthens the Infant, and gives it a fine Complexion, but prevents Abortion, and causes quick and easy Labour to the Mother. The Juice boiled up gently to the Consistence of a Syrup, and Half an Ounce of it given to Infants, and more to the grown up, fetches up tough Phlegm from the Lungs; or gives a very mild Puke, or moves the Belly, and strengthens the Sick. <hi>Sylvius</hi> extols it highly. The Seed sprinkled and softened with Rose Water, and brought to a thick Mucilage, is good for Burns and Parching of the

Tongue, Mouth, and Throat, in Fevers, and for the Pain of the Piles, in Clysters, and for chapped Nipples. If a little Vinegar be added to the Juice, Syrup, or Conserve, it rouses a flagged Appetite; and, if some Spices be added, it streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and raises the Spirits, and helps the languid <hi>Viscera.</hi> To make them more loosening, use Honey instead of Sugar, and a little Rhubarb or Turbith to purge Phlegm, or Scammony for Water. If to bind more, use unripe Quinces, with red Roses and Sloe Juice, with toasted Rhubarb. Their Juice is a wonderful Antidote against deadly Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, especially of white Hellebore. Their Oil rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on the Stomach, Belly, or relaxed Sinews, strengthens them much. A Decoction of their Down, in Wine, heals up Plague Sores; or, used in a Plaister, with Wax, and applied, restores Hair to bald Places, or prevents its falling off.

They are applied with Salt to the Soles in Fevers, and to the Neck in Pains of the Head, that attend malignant Fevers. If in the Wane of the Moon Corns are cut to the quick 'till they smart, and the Juice of this Root is dropped on them, they certainly vanish. Applied in a Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise with Goose-grease, they draw Thorns and Splinters out of the Flesh. Taken with Honey they ease a Cough, and are reckoned good against the Poison of Toad-stools and Hen-bane. The Juice given with Honey to drink, is good for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Coughs, and Shortness of Breath. Two Ounces of the Garden Root, shred, and Mead poured on it, and the express'd Juice given warm; or rather three Drams of the Seed bruised, and Mead, Whey, or Barley Water, poured on it, and squeez'd off and drank, <hi>Fernelius</hi> says, is the easiest and safest Vomit in the World.

For a bad or depraved Taste, preserv'd Roots of Succory are good eaten; or Juice or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Sorrel; or Radish Root eaten before Dinner. Juice of Radishes, but chiefly of Water Cresses, or Tents dipped in the Juice of Wake-Robin, are all three good for a <hi>Polypus,</hi> if put up the Nose. <hi>Assuerus</hi> gives us this excellent Water for the Stone: Take Roots of Smallage and Parsley, <hi>Cum toto,</hi> of each six Handfuls; Radish and Horse-radish, Onions and Nettles, of each three Handfuls; Juniper Berries, a Pound; Winter Cherries, fifty; cut, bruise, and infuse, eight Days in <hi>Rhenish</hi> Wine, then distil in <hi>Baln.

If drank, and repeated several times before the Fit of a Quartan, it alters its Course. A Poultise of it, beaten up and applied, is good in the Sciatica, Gout, and other Joint Achs, and for Swellings of the Spleen and Liver.

A Fomentation of it and Wormwood is good in a Dropsy, Gangrene, or Tendency to a Mortification. The bruised Leaves, put up the Nose, stop its Bleeding. A Fomentation of its Decoction, with Bay Leaves, is good for swelled Cods. Its Decoction in Wine, with Pepper and Nitre, takes away Warts and Morphews from the Parts bathed with it. Its Decoction in Water, with Allum and Honey, cures the dry Scab, Tetters and Ringworms. Its Juice warmed in a Pomegranate Rind, and dropped into pained Ears, eases them. Juices of Rue and Fennel, with a little Honey and Ox Gall, mixed and dropped into the Eyes, helps Dimness of Sight. An Ointment of it cures run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sores on the Head, and foul Ulcers on other Parts. An Electuary of Rue, Nitre, Pepper, and prepared Cummin Seeds, made with Honey, is good for Pains of the Breast, Stomach, Sides, Belly, Spleen or Liver, and in Stoppage of Urine, and helps to prevent too great Corpulency. In a Cholic from Viscidity or Acidity of the Contents of the Guts give this: Take Powder of Rue, <hi>Sal Gem.</hi> of each alike; Honey, enough to make it into Pills to take; or use his notable Secret: Take Leaves of wild Fig-tree, growing on the Ground, Half a Dram; Elm Leaves, a Scruple; powder, mix, and give; it is like a Charm in Nephritic Pains.

It stops the Terms, and all Fluxes by the Mouth or Stool. It cures Ulcers of the Kidneys, or Pains of the Bowels.

Hoarseness and Cough. The Leaves boiled in Wine, and laid on any paralytic Part, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor drank, are of special Service. Sage both brings down the <hi>Menses,</hi> and checks their superfluous Discharge. It is good in the Stings and Bites of Serpents, and kills Worms bred in the Ears, or in Sores.

A Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Herb, laid to Plague Sores, dissolves or breaks them in three Hours. A Decoction of the Root, or its Powder, drank forty Days, helps such as have dangerous running or spreading Scabs, Tetters, or Ringworms.

Scurvy-grass, or Spoon-wort, is hot and biting, abounds with vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, whereby it thins tough fixed Humours, and makes them volatile. Its Juice, Infusion, or Sallad, (if eatable) is good in a cold Scurvy, but is as injurious in the hot inflammatory Kind. It is a good Herb in the Hypo, and tartarous Diseases,
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:006783_0281_10299CB8C88F6030"/>
and greatly resists Putrefaction. It should not be infused above four or five Days in Beer or Wine, till it be taken out. Such slight Infusions should be the constant Spring-drink in cold Scurvies, or where Phlegm, or fixed Salts, abound in the Juices, which is too often the Case of the Inhabitants of low Fenny, Marshy Grounds, especially Sea Coasts, and Eaters of Salt Fish, and Smoke-dried Meat. The bruised Herb and Juice, laid to the Face, takes off Spots in six or eight Hours; then it must be washed off with Bran. It with spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spices, but especially its plain Spirit, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully nourishes the Parts disordered by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsy, Cramps, or Convulsions. The Juice, with burnt Allum, is excellent to rub scorbutic, or swelled Gums with; or, in Want of this, a Decoction of Stone-crop, with Allum and Honey, is every whit as good. Its Conserve, Infusion, or Juice, are the only Forms in which Country People can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it; for the Fire spoils its Syrup or Extract.

Outwardly in Wounds, and in a Gargle for the Quinsey, and Diseases of the Mouth and Jaws. The dried Root rubbed on an aching Tooth, till it brings Blood, eases the Pain, if it be thrust into a bored Willow, and the Hole shut up with a Piece of Willow. It and Fluellen cured a Pissing of Blood, when all other Things failed. It is scarce credible how efficacious a Remedy Self-heal is, in burning and in hectic Fevers; <hi>Sim.

A Decoction of the Root, Bark, or of the dry or green Sloes, is most used. Conserve or Syrup of Sloes, has the same Effect. A distilled Water from the Flowers infused in Sack, and drawn in the cold Still, eases all Gnawings in the Sides, Heart, Stomach, or Bowels; or Gripes or Pains in those Parts, if drank warm in small Doses, when they are pained. A Decoction of the Leaves is a good Gargle for sore Mouths or Throats, and to stop the Defluction of Rheum on the Eyes, or other Parts; to bathe the Head and Temples with, to cool the Heat and Inflammation of those Parts, or of the Head. The distilled simple Water of the Flowers, or the thickened dried Juice of the Fruit, or the Water of the unripe Berries; or their Pulp, boiled; or the Powder of the dried Leaves or Bark, do all cool, brace, bind, and stay all Fluxes, or <hi>Haemorrhages,</hi> or ease their Pains.

The Roots in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in Bean Flower, or white Lilly Flower Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a natural Day, the strained off Liquor makes a good Wash for Womens Faces; but, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion is longer, it excoriates the Skin. <hi>Agricola</hi> says, the distilled Water applied, with Rags dipp'd in it, dissolves coagulated Blood under the Skin, and takes Spots out of the Skin, The Root beaten up to a Poultise, or boiled tender, or powdered alone; or it and Comfry Root, boil'd, and made a Poultise of; or the Pulp of Burdock Root, in a Poultise, all of them take out black or blue Marks from Strokes or Blows.

A Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of it, Fumitory, and Liver-wort, is excellent in Children's Scab or Itch, for which, its Juice and Vinegar are good outwardly, and for Chafing, Tetters, and Ring worms.

This Herb is not only mixt with the Vulnerary Plants, in Broths, Potions, and Ptisans, but many drink it as a Tea, and find great Benefit by it; its many rare Virtues challenge a far more general Use of it. Its Decoction, drank plentifully for some Time, cured one of the Stone who had it lying in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies sixteen Years. A Woman, who had been bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren many Years, drank the powdered Leaves in its distill'd Water for some Days; she soon conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and communicated the Secret to several of her Female Acquaintance, in the like Circumstances, who used it as she did for some Time, with like Success, for ten out of twelve conceived. This Water cured a Fistula of the Breast, which had eluded the Power of all other Remedies. Cloths dipp'd in this Water cured the most violent Pains and Inflammation of an Ulcer of the Leg for many Years.

A Decoction of the Herb or Root in Wine (if no Fever attend, for then it must be given in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the white Decoction) answers the same End. If, after any violent Heat by Exercise, or hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a Person's Urine seems covered with Fat, Grease, or Oil, the Person being feverish at the same Time, a Decoction of this Root, drank, cures in a few Days; it is said to cure Sheep of the Rot, and several other Diseases; its Juice opens Obstructions of the Liver and Lungs, and is good in the Jaundice. A Bath of its Decoction, often sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in, prevents Abortion; or its strong Decoction, sweetened with Syrup, or Conserve of Roses, drank; or, if a Plaister of it and Vinegar is laid to the Back. Its Powder, drank in Plantain Water, is good against Incontinence of Urine; it is also good in Ruptures, and to dissolve clotted Blood, and for Wounds, Sores, Bruises, and Hurts; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly used, is said to be good in all Knots and Tumours about the Neck, Throat, and Ears; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inwardly, it is good for Catarrhs and Whites; the Juice, with Vinegar, is good to rub sore and scurfy Heads, and to wash the Piles, either the Leaves of Cinquefoil, or Roots of Bistort, are very good and sufficient Substitutes to this.

The powdered Seed, taken daily, was the famous Dr. <hi>Butler</hi>'s great Secret to waste and bring away Stone. The Root is saltish, the Seed salter, all the Parts have a gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sap, which prevents the Loss or Flying off of the other Parts. It is a diuretic, loosening, and cleansing Herb. The Leaves, as an Emollient, are often used in Clysters, Fomentations, and Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, and sometimes in hot Fevers; their Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is drank as a safe Cooler. Salt of Wormwood, put to the Infusion of the Root, draws out its Principles; more Salt makes it more purgative, and gives it a better Tincture. A Dram of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Flowers loosens the Belly, but the Root pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upward and downward. The Syrup is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cordial and loosening, but good in Diseases of the Breast, from saltish and sharp Humours, if it is made without Boiling.

as Jaundice, Dropsy, and putrid Fevers; expels vicious Humours by Urine and plentiful Perspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and kills Worms and Moths in Clothes. It is good in all Agues, for which it is given in Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Infusion in Water, Ale, Wine, or in the Juice only: but its Infusion in Wine or Ale (if the Disease will allow of Malt Liquors (is an easy, and as good a Preparation as any. Its simple distill'd Water is good for little. There is little more in its Salt obtained by Incineration, than in any other lixivial Salt. Its Decoction, Wine, Extract, and both Oils, are good, and its compound Water not bad. Its Juice is more watery and detergent, the Herb more astringent, only the dried Herb should be infused in Wine, or Ale. The Infusion, drank Evening and Morning, for some Time, helps Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterics, Obstructions of the Spleen, and Weakness of the Stomach. Its Oil, taken on Sugar, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what drank after, kills Worms, resists Poison, and is good for the Liver and Jaundice. The Use of the Herb checks immoderate Venery. The Root has a slow Bitterness, which affects not the Head and Eyes, like the Leaves; hence the Root should be accounted among the best Stomachics. The Extract, mixt with the Precipitants and Absorbents, or fix'd or volatile Salts, is good in Tertians or Quotidians. Oil of the Seed, given from half a Scruple to half a Dram in some Liquor, or a Spoonful of the Juice in some Wine, taken before the Fit comes on, and the Person is put to Bed, cures Quotidians and Quartans. In a Looseness from eating too much Fruit (after the Use of Rhubarb) Wormwood Wine is excellent. A Woman raised, spread, and maintained her Reputation for the Cure of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, by only using a Fomentation to the Part of green Roots of wild Cucumber sliced, and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, of each alike, boil'd in two Parts Water,

The Extract has cured several Dropsies. I have cured some of Anasarca's, by causing them to drink every Day three times, for five or six Weeks, a Decoction of Wormwood, Broom-Tops, and Camomile Flowers, strained out and Horse-radish infused in it after. Its Ashes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused three Hours in white Wine, strained and drank often, cures an <hi>Anasarca.</hi> Whenever I have any great Expectation from the Use of Wormwood, I always order the common Sort, for the <hi>Roman</hi> comes far short of it in Virtue. That hot Rheum which runs down from the Eyes, and excoriates the Skin of the Cheeks, is cured by Juice of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, beaten up with the White of an Egg, and applied. A too habitual and free internal Use of this Herb dims the Sight for some Hours. I have known Poultises of Wormwood boil'd in Grease, Baum, or Wine, and applied with good Success to white Swellings. It boiled in Lard, and laid to Swellings of the Tonsils and Quinsey, is serviceable. A Poultise of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HAVING said enough in the Preface of my <hi>Medicina Britannica</hi> to recommend the Use of Simples, or <hi>British</hi> Remedies, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Poor especially, I shall here give some general and necessary Directions; first, for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preserving, drying, and keeping of Simples; then for the Preparations, Uses and Doses of the several Forms of private or Family Medicines; a Thing which has hitherto been omitted, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected in Essays of this Kind, and thereby, in a great Measure, either frustrated the whole Design, or by ignorant and injudicious Management ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it abortive; but that Defect being here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, it may be hoped will much contribute to make this Work of far more extensive Use and Benefit.</p>

               <p>Without any Regard to Astrological Whims of Herbs being under certain Planets, or to be taken up at fixed Ages of the Moon; we are to gather them when in their full Vigour and Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Smell, Colour, Taste and Growth, and their Vessels full of mild well concocted Juice, some when they begin to flower, others when in full Flower, as Fumitory, Lesser Centaury, Penny-royal,

Hyssop, Thyme, wild Thyme, Majoram, Origanum, Germander, Ground Pine, Calamint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Vessels not being yet sticky or woody. They must be cut down in a Sun-shiny or dry Day, when they are free from Moisture or Dew; this must happen at several Times and Seasons, according to the Growth of different Plants. All Herbs that afford little or nothing in Distillation, from the Grossness, Viscidity, or firm Attachment of their Earth and Salts, or whose Parts are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with Difficulty, as Astringents, Bitters, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollients, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be dried in the Sun, but such as consist of thin, easily separable, volatile Parts, as the aromatic, cephalic and uterine, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>doriferous Flowers, which readily send their Virtues over the Helm, must be dried in the Shade, spread out on a dry boarded Floor, and several times turned over; or if they have dry, sticky Stalks, tied up with Packthread in small Handfuls, and hung up. When dried, both Herbs and Flowers (woody Stalks excepted) should be put clean up in Paper Bags, and laid up in Drawers or Chests in a dry Place, till used: If Plants are gathered too young, they contain little else beside a watery, acid Juice, having attained neither Maturity of Growth, Principles, nor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; if too old, most of their Principles are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther descended to the Root, or exhaled, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming dry, woody, and fibrous. But some will not dry at all, as Aquatics, Antiscorbutics and succulent Plants; these are only gathered for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Use, as Water-cresses, Brooklime, Scurvy-grass, Housleek, Orpine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they will either continue growing till their Juices are wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, as Orpine, or they will run into Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or Fermentation.—Roots should not be taken up after they have put out their Sprouts,

                  </gap>ne Leaves begin to wither and dry, for during that time the Root is sapless, tough and pithy: But when they are full of Sap, and of proper Age, they should be taken up, cleared, sliced, put on Thread, and hung up to dry. The Roots of perennial Plants should be taken up in the Spring before they bud forth, and Annuals in the latter End of Harvest, when their Stalk and Leaves are fallen; Roots at these two Seasons, are full of Juice, and if of proper Age, their Principles and Virtues are come to Maturity, but if Annuals stand longer, they are apt to be killed with the Frost, or rot in the Earth. Some Roots indeed may be taken up at any time, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excepted, as of Sorrel, Althaea, Dragons, Aserum, Sowbread, Bugloss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bulbous, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culant Roots, will keep but one Season, and so should be gathered every Year, as of Onions, Lillies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aromatic and odoriferous Roots also lose by long keeping: Inodorous, gummy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinous, firm, ponderous Roots, will keep good some Years. In taking up Roots in the Spring, Slips should be cut off from their Tops, and put down in the Earth to grow again; by not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this easy, plain and necessary Caution, both Roots and Herbs are often extirpated and lost in many Places. Most Flowers, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thin-leaved and odoriferous, must be carefully dried in a dry Shade, and when dried, put into Paper Bags, laid up in Drawers or a Chest. Seeds should be gathered or shaken when they are full ripe, and begin to dry before they shed or shake, put up in Paper Bags, and hung up in a cool dry Place, that they neither sprout nor turn rancid, and many of them will keep their Virtues eight or ten Years. Fruits should be got before they are quite ripe; such as have a very soft Pulp should

               <p>The first and easiest domestic medicinal Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Herbs is in Broths, either without Flesh, as in Fevers or Inflammations, which will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, or with Flesh, as in chronic Disorders without a Fever. In Diseases of the Breast very proper Assistance may be given by Broths pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with soft, lubricating, aperient, pectoral Herbs.

In Dropsies, Diuretics may be put in; in case of Obstructions, Deobstruents may be used; in nervous Distempers, or Diseases of the Kind, Cephalics may be used; in habitual Costiveness, Laxatives join'd are proper; in a bloody Flux, or Looseness, Astringents should be added; in a great Weakness, Restoratives come in good Play; in an alcaline State of the Blood, Acids are greatly beneficial, or in bilious Cholics, or rather Redundance of Bile; in windy Cholics, Carminatives and Cracers; in too great a Heat of the Blood, Coolers: Thus we see the profitable Use of proper Broths is very extensive, and has this double Advantage, that Food and Medicine are both carried into the Blood together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix with it over the whole Habit, and may be persisted in longest with the least Offence, and that Medicine thus conveyed into the Body is most agreeable, familiar, easy, and least nauseous; but then it is necessary not only that Herbs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Distemper be pitched on, but that they be rightly prepared, for if they are such as afford

If the Herbs are green, the Broth must be made daily, or they will be sour, which intirely changes their Nature, except for cooler or Acids. The Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Herb used must be according to that of the Broth made, the Strength and Design of the Plant, the Case, Strength, Taste and Stomach of the Sick. For a Quarter of a Handful of some Herbs is as much as three or four Handfuls of others; <hi>ex. gr.</hi> All Pectorals, Coolers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storatives, require a larger Quantity, than Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, or nervous Medicines, as from one to two or three Handfuls of Maidenhair, Liver-wort, Sorrel, Ground Ivy, Chick-weed, to two Quarts of Broth. Whereas half a Handful of the odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Aramatics will suffice, or from two Ounces to a Quarter of an Ounce of Roots; or from a Dram to two Drams of Seeds.</p>
               <p>The next easily parable and familiar Form is Juices; these are prepared either by gathering a H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006783_0364_10299DD180329150"/>
its crude Juice, and giving it immediately with a little Piece of Sugar, dissolved in it, from one to four or five Spoonfuls, once or twice a Day; and every Dose must be fresh made, as Juice of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Plantain, Millefoil, Shepherds Purse, Horse Tail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in involuntary Losses of Blood, Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where the Stomach is weak, and cannot bear such thick crude Juices, another Way is, gather and cleanse any Quantity of well grown Herbs as before, put them into a glazed earthen high Pot, cover and paste them close, put them into an Oven, not too hot, let them stand till it is cold, take out the Pot, pour off the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor through a Hair Sieve, sweeten it with Sugar, Dose from one to three, four or five Spoonfuls, once, twice or thrice a Day, at the physical Hours, which are Morning early, three or four Hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner, and going to Bed; thus may Juice of Ground Ivy, or other green succulant Plants, or of tuberous Roots, as of Turneps, be prepared. A third Way is, to pound and express the Juice of any green Herb as before, let it either stand a few Hours till it settle, then pour off the clear, and give as before, or boil and clarify the expressed Juice, let it settle, pour off the clear, sweeten and use; but both the last Ways are far short of the first, for much of the best Part of the Plant is lost by the Sedepurations and Clarifications; therefore the former two are best, especially the first, if the Stomach will easily bear it.</p>
               <p>Infusions are the next common and easy Form; the use of Tea has made the Preparation of these so well known, that every Housewife has the Art of drawing them; odoriferous, sapid, aromatic, cephalic, uterine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Plants, which cannot bear Boiling without the Loss of some of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Parts; or whose boiling renders them too

ropy, slimy, thick, muddy, or otherwise ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or nauseous, are fittest for this Form, dried Herbs are best here. Put the cut Herb, or sliced or bruised Roots or Seeds, into a Tea-pot, with its Spout stopped or corked; or other like close Vessel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pour on them a sufficient Quantity of Water, just ready to boil, cover it close up, and set it at some Distance from the Fire, from half an Hour to two, three, four Hours, or all Night, according to the Density, Solidity, Oleaginous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or Resinousness of the Subject, or as the Herb or Root is green or dry, has volatile or fixed Parts; when it has stood a due time, pour out some of it into a Tea or other Cup, sweeten it, if proper, and give of it to drink, as often as is needful, as in Fevers every Hour or two; in Coughs, Catarrhs, and Pleurisies, once in two or three Hours; in chronic Cases, two or three Dishes, once or twice a Day. Such Plants, as will bear Decoction, without the above Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, a Decoction of them is better, especially of the Woods, except Sassafras, which is lost by boiling; dry oleaginous, balsamic, saponaceous, resinous Roots, will give out their Virtues much better, when rubbed in a Mortar with a little Salt of Tartar, or if the Salt is put into the Water; but this must not be done, when cooling, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Bile, alcaline Salts, or Acrimony in the Blood, is intended; for Plants proper in these Cases want it not, and it either retards or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates these Designs; nor will mucilaginous Plants bear this Addition, or stand so long in Infusion, for they become nauseously ropy and slippery. Noviscous and austere, astringent, saponaceous, restorative Subjects, are properly suited for this Preparation.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006783_0366_102982D6E7E30770"/>The next familiar domestic Form is Diet Drinks, and sure nothing was ever more injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously managed than these, and simple dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled Waters, have been. This Article includes all medicated Wines, Meads, Ales and Wheys, but the last two are chiefly used in the Spring, and next to Broths is certainly the most agreeable Way of conveying Medicines into the Body, and all the animal Juices, in chronic Diseases (for they have no Place in Acutes) as they are to be continued some considerable time. The Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Herbs put in, is ordinarily four Handfuls to a Gallon of Ale or Whey, Seeds from half an Ounce to an Ounce, Roots from half an Ounce to two Ounces if dry, but of green double the Quantity. The Ale, with the Ingredients, should be wrought in a Vessel that admits only Air enough to carry on the Fermentation, where odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or volatile Ingredients, are in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; nor should the Liquor stand longer on them than three, four or five Days, after the Fermentation, but be bottled off, and well corked. The time of drinking them, if purgative, is chiefly the Morning; if laxative, Morning and Afternoon, if only laxative, at all the three me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Hours. The common Dose, when made with Wine, is from one Ounce to four, according to the Age, Strength, and Constitution of the Patient, and Intention of the Medicine, if made in Ale or Whey, Dose from two to eight Ounces. If Diet Drinks, made with Ale or Whey, are rightly prepared, there are often some Ingredients fit for boiling, others for Infusion, if the latter are boil'd, they are lost, and only leave their Flegm or earthy Parts in the Liquor; if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are infused, their Body is not opened, nor the Cohesion of their Parts loosened and dissolved

to mix with the Liquor; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> latter are all Things, fit to bear boiling, as Woods, dried, heavy, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, inodorous Roots or Herbs, Astringents, Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Stiptics, some Emollients, austere earthy Ingredients, Cream of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kind are Aromatics, such as have volatile Parts, or pungent light, readily separable Salts, as Antiscorbutics, the Action of Fermentation is sufficient to loosen, open, and draw out their Parts, which would be lost by Decoction; Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is sufficient for green Herbs; but such Herbs, as will bear drying, are best dried, their Infusion is more agreeable, both to Sight and Taste, and keeps longer, but some cannot be dried as Antiscorbutics and succulant Plants. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Ingredients should be cut, Roots bruised and sliced, Seeds and Berries, a little pounded, and all put loosely in a Bag, and hung in the Liquor during Fermentation, the Bag should be taken out several times, squeezed into the Liquor, and put in again. Acid Juices, or Herbs, as of Citrons, Lemons, Oranges, or Limes, Sorrel, Liver-wort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should never be boiled at all. If Jalup Root is put in, it should be grossly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, rubbed in a Mortar with Salt of Tartar, and boiled; Senna Leaf, with a little Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, may be infused, to prevent griping. If Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, Methoacan, or such others as are unfriendly to the Stomach are added, with them should be put in not only Seeds, but some Cinnamon, Quince, or a little Ginger, Diet Drinks, Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or Decoctions, are often crouded, either with too many Ingredients, Articles of different Nature, and Intentions, or too great a Quantity of one Thing; but I would here observe that a Liquor may easily be over-loaded with any one Article, for all Liquors are porous Bodies,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006783_0368_10299DDB47DA1608"/>
whose Pores or Interstices may be filled with other Matter of any one Figure, till it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more of that, and the rest is lost; but will still receive and contain new Particles of a different Figure from another Subject, and so from a third and fourth, as we see Water may have its Pores so filled and surcharged with Sea Salt, that they can sustain no more, yet will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve fresh Sugar readily, till its Interstices are full of Matter of that Figure; yet it will dissolve Nitre, then Allum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that after the Pores were filled, the Remainder is lost. But if too little of any one Salt is dissolved in Water, short of the Intention, it is too weak, and either will not answer the Design, or do it too slowly; so Diet Drinks, or other Preparations, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der done, or too weak. This also shews us, that a few Articles, judiciously calculated to the Purpose, are better than one, for they make the Liquor more powerful and medicinal; but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Jumble or Farraga is always to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, as it shews want of Judgment in the Orderer, may have contrary Effects, and may disappoint the Design.</p>
               <p>Another Form is Decoction; this is of one or more Herbs, Roots, Seeds or Flowers, which by boiling communicate their Strength and Virtue to Water. In this, both the Order of the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, Liquor used, and Degree of Heat, may be varied, as the Ingredients give out their Virtues more slowly and difficultly, or easily and quickly; the former require longer boiling, the latter less, or should be put in when the others are near boiling. Dried Herbs are fitter for this Use than green. All Plants are not fit for it, <hi>viz.</hi> Such whose Virtues consist in an easy, separable Salt, or essential Oil, or abound in volatile Parts, or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,

or sulphureous Substances, or are of a very mucilaginous, or viscous Nature; the Virtues of the first Sort are lost in the Preparation; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind will not communicate their Virtue to Water, for it cannot open their Body, loosen, separate, nor sustain their Parts; and the last, if much boiled, spoil, thicken and muddy, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction; tender, odoriferous Flowers, are also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, they, and such as belong to the first Class, are fit only for Infusion, or Distillation, in both which they readily communicate their Virtue to the Water; the second Sort should be infused some time in hot or boiling Water in a warm Place, with some alcaline Salts, which may soften and open their Substances, prepare and loosen their Parts, and expedite their Separation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to the Water; and after this Infusion, they must have both a stronger and longer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, as Woods, Barks, dry, hard and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorous Roots, earthy Substances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third Class, if much boiled, make the Liquor slimy and ropy, as Seeds of Line, Fleabane, the cold Seeds, Mash-mallow, Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Purgatives should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in boiling Water with Carminatives, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boiled slightly with a little Salt of Tartar, otherwise their austere, acid Salts, being drawn out by long boiling, causes grievous Gripes, and sometimes Discharges of Blood; which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from a Decoction of Colicinth drunk.

Herbs, whether green or dried, must be cleaned and cut; Roots and Seeds must be grossly bruised, put into the Water, and boiled away sometimes to three Fourths, other Times to two Thirds, or a Half, as the Ingredients let out their Virtues more readily, or slowly, then take them from the Fire, when cold, strain, and if for drinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sweeten it a little, if needful, as two or three Ounces or Sugar to a Quart of Liquor, or two or three Ounces of distilled compound W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Distillation is another Operation belonging to the Preparation of domestic Remedies; and here we are to consider what Things are fit and proper for it, that we spend not Time and Labour in vain, and our Expectation, and that of the Sick, be not disappointed. Distillation and Decoction are direct Opposites, for, in general, whatever will not bear the former, without Loss of its Parts and Virtues, is the proper Subject of the latter, and what will afford nothing significant, either for Food or Physic by the latter, is to be used the former Way. The cooling, stiptic, emollient, astringent, consolidating, nutrimental, healing Plants, afford not their Powers and Virtues by Distillation, but must be used in Infusion, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, Extract, or Substance.

               <p>Some few inodorous Things indeed, which have no aromatic Smell, do yet communicate conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unexpected Virtues to their Water, as Corn Poppies, Arsmart, to which add Frogs Spawn, tho' no Plant.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:006783_0372_10299DE85E20EBD0"/>The Virtues of some Plants are partly volatile, partly fixt, as lesser Centaury, Germander, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, Blessed Thistle, Ground Pine, Mugwort, Scordium, Sage, Wormwood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To obtain their medicinal Parts, they may be first digested, then distilled; when the Water is come off, the Fire would be stopped, and the Ingredients let stand in the Still till they are cold, then take all out, strain off the Liquor, boil it up to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of thin Honey, and mix with the Water, so have you the Virtues of the whole Plant, except its Earth, and perhaps a little fixt Salt.</p>
               <p>When heavy, solid, tough, resinous, or gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my resinous Wood-barks or Roots, are to be distilled, they must first be cut or sliced very thin, or grosly bruised, and put in a very close Vessel, pour boiling Water, with a considerable Quantity of Sea Salt upon them, to loosen and open the compacted Body of the Ingredients, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Putrefaction, stir all well together, shut the Vessel up close, let it stand three, four or five Weeks, in a warm Digestion, then distil the Water off.</p>
               <p>The aromatic, strong smelling, resinous, olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous, balsamic, gummy Plants, which retain their natural Fragrance, may be dried a little in the Shade; then cut them grossly, and put them in the Still, and keep them in a warm Digestion seventy Hours, then draw off their Waters, as Baum, Hyssop, Pennyroyal, Mints, Rosemary, Marjoram, Origanum, Sage, Rue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

without Digestion, for either that, or their lying in the Air, hurts and weakens them, as Flower of Roses, Jessamin, Borage, Bugloss, Lilly of the Valley, white Lillies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These Flowers should be got before they are quite open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or begin to shed. The different Colour of distilled Waters is from their Oil, for Camomile Water is blue, and Wormwood green. Sapona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous Plants communicate not their Virtues by Distillation, for these, consisting in an intimate Union of their Oil and Salts, rise not; some Plants are as good for Decoction after Distillation as before; red Roses retain their Astringency af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Wormwood, its Bitterness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Having thus proved the Way, and shewn what Plants are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subjects of Distillation, and the several Ways they are to be managed to the best Advantage; come we next to the Operation itself, which is of three Kinds, either by simple Distillation, Coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or Fermentation; for the last we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to <hi>Daniel Ludovicus,</hi> and all of them have been much improved by the late learned and great <hi>Boerhaave.</hi>

Things being thus ordered, let all stand in a warm Infusion for twenty-four Hours, then gradually raise the Heat till the Water boil, which is known from its hissing Noise, the Heat of the upper End of the Worm, the smoaking of the Water in the Worm Tub, and the dropping of the Worm till it come to a small, thread-like Stream; then raise the Heat no higher, for a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Degree will not raise the necessary and expected Virtue of the Plant; by a greater Heat the Plant is suddenly raised into the Still Head, and either fouls the Worm, or distilled Liquor, or plugs up the Head, and throws the Herbs and Liquor about; in which Case, if the distilling Ingredients are oily, tenacious, gummy, or resinous, as the Fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to distil these must be greater, the Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will be stronger, and not only the Subject will be lost, but the Operator's Life, if near it, will be in Danger; but the just Degree of Heat being observed and kept up, and all Things going on regularly, whilst the Water distilled into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver is white, thick, sapid, frothy and muddy, it is good, and should be carefully kept by itself. That which follows is thin and clear, destitute of much Taste or Smell of the Plant; it is rather fouled and tartish, a white dreggy Matter, whose Acid will corrode the Copper-head, if not well tinn'd, and the Water thereby become green and nauseous, having a Degree of Poison (from the dissolved Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) is dangerous to Childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and downwards, with severe Gripes, which are only relieved by plentiful Draughts of Milk sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with Honey, or of mucilaginous, emollient Decoctions. The first Water contains the Oil, and presiding Spirit of the Plant, and somewhat saline, which is mostly acid, but in pungent Antiscorbutics, it is a volatile Alcali. The Fire and Water, by Digestion and boiling, dissolve the Oil of the Plant, and reduces it to so small Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as are carried up by the help of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, along with the other Parts of the Herbs, which by this Means become volatile, and in close Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, all these Parts being closely united, will come over without much Loss or Alteration, having the Smell, Taste and Virtues, of the volatile Parts of the Plant, but has neither all the Parts nor Virtues of its Juice. If the first and second Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are mixt, both are spoiled, therefore in distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Receiver should be often changed, that as the Water alters the Process may be stopp'd. The second Water is only cooling, and by the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Acid of the untinn'd Copper, it kills Worms, but the Experiment is dangerous. The first Water should neither be fined nor filtered to clear it; for that robs it of its vegetable, aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Oil, weakens it, nor will it keep long after, nor should it be kept in Bottles papered over the Mouth to keep out the Dust, but well corked with the best Corks, for what comes over the Helm in distilling, its lighter Parts will evaporate in the Air, and weaken the Water. And because some People, either ignorantly or wilfully, will distil such Plants as afford little, beside a little Flegm, or Acid of the Herb, which cannot preserve the Water from mothering, if they will have such they should have a little powdered Salt Petre to keep it. Thus we may observe, that the volatile
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006783_0376_10299DF591C04020"/>
Oil, Salt and Spirit of Plants, are lost by Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that the Decoction of pungent, saline Antiscorbutics, is ridiculous; and that odoriferous, sapid and aromatic Plants, should not be boiled. That by the Force of Fire, and too long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Operation, very opposite Virtues may be raised from Plants, or a Water obtained of very different Nature and Effects, and that different Ingredients require different Ways of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and various Degrees of Fire to obtain their useful Properties. This also intimates a Way how to substitute distilled Water, in Cases where no great Stress is laid on their Use, besides a Vehicle; thus, drop a few Drops of the distilled Oil of the Plant, as of Mint, Fennel, Pennyroyal, (whose Water is wanting) into rectified Spirit of Wine, so as the Oil be dissolved wholly, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit, put two Drams of this Spirit into a Quart of Water, shake and mix them, and you have the Water wanted. Or if for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Use, drop some drops of the distilled Oil on a Piece of Sugar, or Salt of Tartar, rub it well in a Mortar, and mix with Water, this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This also teaches us how to improve the Strength of simple distilled Waters, <hi>viz.</hi> By adding a Dram or two of the above dissolved, distilled Oil, and rectified Spirit, to each two or three Pounds of the Water. But this is done far more effectually by Cohobation, which may be made even to exceed the Virtues of the Plants from which it is drawn, thus.</p>
               <p>The Distillation being over, take out the Plant, and Water remaining in the Still, press them strongly in a Strainer, till all the Liquor is exprest,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006783_0377_10299DFA8FE7DA88"/>
pour the distilled Water into it, put both back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Still, having first put as much of the same Plant fresh got into the Still as before, and if need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, put in as much fresh Water as will make up the first Quantity, clean the Worm as before, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Hole in the Still Head-pipe, lute the Pipe and Worm, close up the Vessel well, let all stand in a gentle Heat three Days and Nights, till the separable Parts of the Plant are opened, loosened, and disposed to communicate its Virtues to the Water, then observing more exactly the Rules in the former Process, distil it as before, only as this Liquor is richer and stronger than the former, it requires a less Degree of Heat and Fire, till half the Quantity of Water put on is obtained; then stop the Process. This Water is whiter, thicker and muddier, than the former, has a stronger Smell and Taste, as well as richer, is more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and may have its Virtues still exalted by repeating the Operation oftener with Herbs; and if renewed a great many Times, the last Liquor may be taken out of the Still, strain'd off, and in an earthen, or well tinn'd Vessel, set on a slow Fire, that it neither burn, nor carry off its remaining Parts, and boiled up to an Extract of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of Honey or Melasses, this mix exactly with the Water obtained by several Distillations, thus will the Virtues of the Plant be concinerated and brought into a little Room, and a Medicine not only far surpassing the Virtues of the Plant, but scarce otherwise imitable.</p>
               <p>The third Way of Distillation is by Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which alters them very little, and makes them very penetrating and volatile. It is thus, Take any aromatic or odoriferous Plant, cut and bruise it, if needful, put it in a large Oak Cask, leaving four or five Inches empty Space at Top, in cold

                  </gap>k to the same Height with this Liquor, let it stand upright, and cover the Bung-hole in the upper End, with a Piece of loose Board, let it stand warm, and continue in this State till the Herbs, which at first rose to the Top, subside, and fall to the Bottom, which will be in four, five, or six Days, then distil directly as before, observing all the Rules there laid down. This Liquor being much stronger and spirituous will rise sooner, and with greater Force; therefore must be distilled more slowly, especially at first, it requires less Heat, and greater Caution. There comes over first a very strong, clear, penetrating Liquor, which is best for Use; then a dark, mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, milky Liquor, possessed of some little Taste and Smell of the Plant. Lastly, a thin, acid, scarce odorous Liquor; all which must be kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, what remains in the Still is chiefly the Substance of the Honey, Sugar or Yeast, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Virtue of the Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, to make an Extract from. The first Liquor, tho' clear, yet mixt with Water turns Milk white, which shews, that it has brought over all the Oil of the Plant; and that the Whiteness of distilled, simple Waters, is owing to that Oil, and when cleared by fining or Filtration, the Water is effete and spoiled.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what Plants will afford us by sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and cohobated Distillations, <hi>viz.</hi> The proper Water of the Herb, the Spirit contained in that Water, and the volatile Oil of the Plant, which turns its Water white, and a thin, separable, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, acid Liquor; most of these are lost in their
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006783_0379_10299DFF4578F870"/>
open Decoction. What remains behind all this, not to be obtained by Infusion, Distillation or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, is the constitutive Oil of the Figure of the Plant, which binds its earthy Parts together, and gives it its Form and Cement; a great deal of its proper, native Salt, and that Part which by Fire is changed into a fix'd Alcaline, and a great Part of its constitutive, elementary Earth, tho' it has lost some in the Decoction, which may be found both in the Oil, and Liquor left in the Still. Could we obtain all the fixed Oil by Distillation or Decoction, the cementing, or cohesive Principle, would be lost, and the Plant lose its Figure and Form, and having only Earth left, would fall down to Dust, the fix'd Salt going with the Oil, these two being the soapy Part of the Plant. To obtain this fix'd Salt, take the Herbs strained out of the Liquor after Distillation (for I here suppose the strained Liquor made into an Extract, if not so used, take both Liquor and Herb out of the Still) put them into a clean Iron Pan over a slow, clear Fire, which raise by Degrees, there will first arise a Fume, then the Plant turns black, then takes Fire and burns, glows, sparkles, and leaves a white Ash; thus is consumed the fix'd Oil of the Plant, which gave its Parts Cohesion and Figure. Take up these white Ashes, which are only the Earth and fix'd Salt of the Herb, put them in Water, let all stand till the Water is clear, then pour all into a filtering Cup, so will the dissolved Salts and Water go through, and leave the Earth in the Cup; evaporate the filtered Liquor in an earthen, or rather glass Vessel, in a Sand Heat, or over a slow Fire, it leaves a white, alcaline, lixivial Salt, which was in the Plant, but now altered by the Fire, mix this Salt with the distilled Water; so have you all the Parts of the Plant except the fix'd
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006783_0380_10299E02A5CD5E40"/>
Oil and Earth, which can only be got by using the Plant in Substance in Powder, Pills, or Electuary. The Liquor and Herbs left in the Still from Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by Fermentation with Honey or Sugar, afford not this Salt, for Honey burns to a Coal. The cold Still is only fit for tender Flowers, which yet are better distilled by the Alembic, with proper Care. <hi>English</hi> Plants fit for Distillation are, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica, Baum, Spirement, Pepper-mint, Calamint, Hyssop, Pennyroyal, Rue, whose Water is good for little without several Cohobations, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in hysteric Convulsions; Camomile, Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Aromaticus, Chervil, Clary, Dill, Dittany, Fennel, Feverfew, Jessamin, Lovage, Lilly of the Valley, white Lillies, Marjoram, Masterwort, Motherwort, Tansey, Maudlin Tansey, Origa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Savory, Roses, Sage, Spinnel, wild Thyme, Savin, Juniper Berries, Corn Poppies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Besides those Extracts made from the Residum of distilled Waters, several other excellent Ones might be prepared the same Way, as of Elecam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane, Wormwood, Berberry Bark, Broom, Lesser Centaury, white Horehound, Tormentil, Liquorice, Garden Rhubarb, Mugwort, St. John's Wort, Rue, Feverfew, Elder and Dwarf Elder, Barks, Plantain, Maidenhair, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

worth, only a little light, separable Oil of the Flower is brought over, that gives it a Smell, which makes it little cordial and reviving, but without any regard to Distillation, a good astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Extract may be got from the former, and a lovely, laxative Syrup, from the latter, better than that of Rhubarb, for no Purgatives are worth distilling, that Part of the Plant being too gross or ponderous to come over the Helm. The Dose of distilled Waters is from Half an Ounce, to two, three, or four Ounces, according to the Age of the Patient, and Nature of the Water, the Dose of Extract is from ten Grains to a Dram. Thus much for Infusions, Decoctions, Distillations, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Incineration, as they relate only to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic, not officinal Remedies.</p>

One great Use of them was to render seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Forms of Remedies more palatable, which is now mostly answered by using Sugar or white Syrup, (which is only made of Sugar and Water) in their Room. No Plants proper for Distillation, or consisting of volatile Principles, can be used in this Form without the Loss of these Parts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those only fit for Decoction are proper for it; these are the best which are of a saline and earthy Nature. Dried Herbs (if they will bear drying) are much the best, for only the Phlegm, or Water of the green, being dried away, they will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate more of their saline and substantial Parts to the Water, so that the Syrup will be both stronger

of the Ingredients, finer, and keep longer. But the best of them, if not boiled up to a due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, will turn acid and four, mouldy or spoil, especially if made of green Herbs, so that saving Sugar, Coal and Time, is bad Husbandry here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Syrups made of the Juice of Herbs is far worse, for in drying nothing is lost but the Flegm, but in the Juice some of the Parts are not disposed to separate so easily from the constituting earthy Part of the Plant, and of those that depart from it, several are lost in the necessary Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Clarifications of the Juice, and still the Syrup is more unsightly, and not so pleasant. The several Ways of clarifying Infusions, Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Juices, are, either to let them stand some Hours in a cool Place, in a clean Vessel, well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, till they let fall their gravelly, earthy, or other gross or heavy Parts, then pour off the clear, or pass them several Times through a Hyppocras Bag or Strainer, till they become clear, but tho' they are hereby made finer, yet some of their gummy, resinous or viscous Parts, may be lost, which is the Reason that purging, mucilaginous, and anodyne Syrups should never be clarified. Or mix fresh Whites of Eggs with the Decoction, and whisk them long together, then boil all, and as the Whites of Eggs harden in boiling, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the grosser Parts with them, so that the strain'd Liquor put through a Hyppocras Bag is clear. Syrups should be prepared either in earthen or well tinn'd copper Vessels.—Some useful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Syrups are made without any Heat, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Trouble or Expence, as these of Snails, or Earth Worms, which are gathered in a dewy Morning, the former are taken out of the Shells, and slit; the latter are wash'd and cut; to a Pound of either of them, put half a Pound of fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

Sugar, mix them well, and hang all up in a Bag in a cool, moist Cellar, and let the Syrup drop from the Bag into an earthen Vessel under them; they are good for weak, hectical Children, Dose from half a One to two Spoonfuls.— Syrups of fragrant Flowers of thin, loose, volatile Parts, as Roses, Violets, Clove-gilly Flowers, Cowslips, Peach Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much boiling Water on them as will scald them well, let them stand ten or twelve Hours, or all Night, in a close, well-covered, glaz'd, or well-tinn'd Vessel (tho' all Metals are in Danger to spoil their Colour and Beauty) strain them off, and to every Pint of the Liquor, add a Pound and a Half of Loaf Sugar (which is enough for Family Use, if made yearly, and too much Sugar spoils the Design of the Medicines, (if it meant any thing.) Set all on the same Vessel, cleared on a Sand, or other gentle Heat, till either the Sugar be well dissolved and mix'd, or they come to the Consistence of a Syrup; Dose of the Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, pale Rose, and Peach Flowers, from half an Ounce to two Ounces, but the Second is the best; the first is little worth, except to give Mixtures a fine Colour or Flavour, or with Oil of sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, or Linseed, to give Children for a Cold; the third being found too churlish and griping a Purge for Children, is mostly laid aside, and in making it requires four or five Infusions of the same strained Liquor on fresh Flowers. The Dose of the rest of those Syrups is what you please, for they will neither do Good, nor Harm. Syrup of Corn Poppies is made by a double Infusion of four Pints of Water, on two Pound of the Flowers; or rather by pouring just so much as will scald them; a Pound and a Half of Loaf Sugar to each Pin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it would be better Husbandry to take two or three Ounces of what remains in the Still after the Spirit is drawn off; to two Ounces of this, put eighteen Ounces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, mix them well, and filter the Liquor, and with double Quantity of Sugar make a Syrup, Dose as above.—A good pectoral Syrup may be made by infusing two Ounces of Liver of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, three Days in a Pint of Canary, then filter it, and add a Pound, or a Pound and a Half of Sugar, melt it without boiling, Dose from one Quarter to one Ounce.—Several Syrups are made of the Juices of Fruits, as of Rasberries, Quinces, Berberries, Mulberries, Elder, Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are made by putting a Pound and a Half of Sugar to a Pound of Juice, and boiling them up to Syrup, Dose of all these what you will, except the last, which is from half an Ounce to an Ounce or two, but it is too harsh for most Children, this Juice is neither to be clarified nor made with Loaf, but coarse Sugar.— Many Syrups are made by Decoction, or boiling the Ingredients, but most of them are good for nought; but such as are in love with the Form may take the Roots, dried Herbs, Flowers, or Seeds they intend, cut or bruise them, pour boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water on them, to the Height of three or four Fingers above the Ingredients, cover them up, and let them stand a Night or two; then in a

Peel to be conserved, should be taken fresh pared off from the Fruit, put in an earthen Vessel, with as much Sugar, and let stand a few Weeks in a Cellar, till the Rind mellow, then it will be much easier made. Fruits, as Hips, should be gathered ripe, laid up till well mellowed, then pick'd, clean'd, and with equal Weight of Sugar, beaten to a smooth, fine, clear Pulp, or Conserve, having first pulped the beaten Fruit through a Hair Sieve, before the Sugar is put in. Conserves of Elecampane and Comfry Roots are both done this Way, only they are boiled first in a little Water till they are soft. Sloes are first baked in an Oven, then pulp'd, and put through a Hair Sieve, and if still too moist, boiled a little over the Fire, and stirred all the while, till they come to a due Consistence; then put the Sugar to them, and beat it up. All Conserves should be kept in a dry Place, that their Sugar draw not in Water from the Air, and so melt and spoil the Conserve. Sugar of Roses is only a Pound of Sugar dissolved in Rose-water, and an Ounce of fine powdered Rose Leaves added, with a few

Drops of Spirit of Vitriol to brighten and preserve the Colour, mix all well, lay it on a Marble, roll it out, and cut into small Pieces, lay them on Paper, dry them, and keep them, to give to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive People, or to mix with Asses Milk, from half a Dram to a Dram. The common Conserves are made of red or Damask Roses, Flowers of Borrage, Bugloss, Mary-gold, red and white Dead Nettle, Rosemary, Lavender, Primroses, Clove Gilly-Flowers, Tops of Rue, Sage, Roman Wormwood, thin Outtersline, Rinds of Oranges, Leaves of Scurvy-grass, Wood Sorrel, Roots of Elecampane, Comfry, or any others a Person pleases, or is willing to bestow Money and Time on.</p>
               <p>Powders must be prepared of Roots, Herbs, or other Ingredients, well cleaned and picked from Stalk or decayed Leaves, or other Parts. Flowers should be as fresh as they can be dried, and well cleaned, seeing all that passes the Sieve is to go into the Stomach. Let the whole Subject or Ingredient designed for Powder, be powder'd and sifted at one Time, and not at several Times; for if the Ingredient consist of different Textures and Cohesions, these may have various Effects, and should be given in different Doses; for Instance, should one Part purge upwards, and another downwards, and one of these should be powdered, and not the other, both given, the Patient would be deceived in the Operation. As Things used in this Form are given in Substance; Ingredients of a volatile and aromatic Nature, should be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd only in such a Quantity as is used at once, that they may be always fresh and good, what remains must not be put into wide-mouth'd Glasses, papered over, as is too much the Custom, for they either lose their pungent, volatile Parts, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006783_0389_10299E1FC3EB2C80"/>
become effete, as Powder of Arum Root, or turn rancid, as of the cold oily Seeds, which not being reducible to a fine Powder, should never be given in that Form, but in Electuaries, fresh Emulsion, or Troches. The most medicinal and effectual Parts of Aromatics, are often their lightest and loosest, which fly off in powdering, therefore should be greatly moistened with just so much Spirit, as will hinder their flying off, without making them ball or cake under the Pestle, like resinous Substances, unless the Mortar and End of the Pestle be easily greased with a little Oil first. Compound Powders, made with several Aromatics, are called Species. Acrid, bitter, resinous, nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous and ungrateful Ingredients, must be avoided in this Form, as much as may be; nor should it consist of Ingredients of an opposite Nature, as Allom and lixivial Salts; and all confused, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent Jumbles and Farrages, must be guarded against, especially of different Intentions and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; Powders are given from a few, as five or six Grains to a Dram or two, according to their Nature and Intentions.</p>
               <p>Electuary is a Form of various Ingredients pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and made up into a soft Consistence, either with Syrups or Honey, but they must be made stiffer for keeping, than for present Use, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Electuary of Treacle, or Opiate, tho' nothing be in it to induce Sleep. When Honey is used, it should be first boiled and well scummed, and so should all Syrups be, especially these with coarse Sugar or Honey. Salts, whether lixivial or acid, espeically both together, must not be mixed with Electuaries, for they generate Air, swell the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and apt to cause it to ferment, if not used instantly. If Pulps are to be added, they should first be boiled, and then put through a Hair Sieve;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006783_0390_10299E24CD259DA8"/>
Honey must be first warmed to thin it; if odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous, chymical Oils, are to be put in, let it be with the Powders, and work all together carefully, with a wooden Pestle in a Marble Mortar; if Salts are wanted, let them be put in when they are to be used. Let as few ingrateful Things be put in the Form as may be. Their Dose is the same as of Powders, only allowing for the Quantity or Weight of the Syrup or Honey in them. Bolusses or Morsels are only a small Portion of Electuary made (for the present Purpose) into one, or a few Doses.</p>
               <p>Pills are another Form, wherein often Things are put of a disagreeable Taste, sticking in the Teeth or Mouth, or cannot be otherwise safely taken, as Bitters, Gums, Mercurials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whose Dose lies in less Bulk, being from a Scruple to two in Purgatives for grown up Persons, or to a Dram or two in Alteratives, but such large Doses must be made up in Rotulae or little Balls. Some Opiates, Diuretics, Alexipharmacs Emenagogues, Pectorals, Openers of Obstructions, and some Medicines against Worms, Cephalics, and Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, are capable of this Form. No volatile, or fix'd Salts, should be put in them, for they cause them to ferment, huff and break. The fewer and smaller they are taken more easily; their Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence should neither be too hard, nor too soft. Laxative Pills are taken at Night, Purgatives early in the Morning, other Alteratives Morning and Night, in the Pulp of a roasted Apple, in a Raisin, Wafer Paper, or in the Flesh of Prunes, and drink something after to wash them down; a little aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Oil, as of Cloves, Anise, or the like, may be put to them to give them a finer Flavour, and expel Wind.—Troches, or Lazerges, are made to hold in the Mouth till they dissolve slowly, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006783_0391_10299E27ECA5A448"/>
swallow their Solution, either for a Cough, or other Disorders of the Breast, or Heart-Burn. They are prepared of several Powders made up into a hard Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ugar dissolved in the Mucilage, or with the Juice of some Herb. The Paste is rolled out, and cut into small Pieces, laid on Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and dried in the Shade, or in a cool Oven; they are seldom used now.</p>
               <p>Of Oils, only these by Insolation, or Decoction, are of domestic Preparation. The former are made by infusing Flowers, as of Roses, white Lillies, St. John's Wort, or Mulewort, in four Times their Weight of Oil in a close Vessel, set them several Days in the warmest Sun, strain off the Oil, and pour on fresh Flowers and Tops (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of white Lillies) and set in the Sun as before, at last strain out for Use; thus you preserve both Virtue and natural Smell of the Parts without Loss or Burning. But the Virtue of green Plants must be drawn out by a single, double, or triple De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in Oil, over a slow Fire, till they are crisp; this both spends the watery Part of the Plant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents its burning, and that nasty yellow Colour, which they have; but to avoid all three, strain out the Oil into a clear Pan, set it over a gentle Fire, let it simmer, till a Drop taken out of it be a fine pure green. Oil obtained from Fruits, as ripe Bayberries, whilst undried, must be boiled in Water, and the Oil scummed off as it rises to the Top, till it is all gathered, then put it into a clean Vessel, and simmer it over the Fire, till the Water in it is exhaled, or no more Smoak or Reek rises; then put it up for Use. Oils from Animals, as new whelped Puppies, or Earth Worms, is made by boiling them in Oil, till the former fall to Pieces, and the latter are crisp.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:006783_0392_10299E2979F612E0"/>Ointments and Liniments differ chiefly in their Consistences, the former being the stiffer, the latter the softer, is made by putting in a little more Oil into the made Ointment to soften it, or by putting in less Turpentine and Wax in it: Liniments are also made by mixing Oils and Ointments, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Balsams with Ointments, and incorporating them well; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by melting down a Plaister with more Oil to soften it. The same Cautions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite here as in Oils, to prevent the Burning, and obtain and preserve the Virtue and Colour of the Ointment, and to make them stronger by a double or triple Infusion or Decoction of the same fresh Ingredients in the same strained off Oil, or Lard. Ointments are made with Butter, or Hog's Lard. Some Ingredients must be infused or boiled in Vinegar first, to open their Body, but it must be well exhaled in boiling; the Wax, Resin and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, should not be added till the Liquor is strained off. Very few of this Form will answer all domestic Purposes; Exercise, Bathing, and Friction, taking up now a great deal that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to them. Ointments that have Wines or Juices in, must have these well exhaled, as well as the Juice of Herbs or Vinegar, or they will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Colour of the Ointment, as well as spoil it. Embrecations, Fomentations and Baths, are now mostly used for Ointments, and sometimes succeed better, and are more sweet, cleanly and neat, but neither should be rejected; for I have often found, that where one of those would not answer, another would; and diseased, pained, lame People, will readily sacrifice a little Cleanness to their Ease and Health. Embrecations are only a Mixture of several Sorts of Spirits, sometimes with resinous, gummy, or soapy Things, added to them, to be rubbed and chauffed into the Part, to attenuate the Humours lodged there, stimulate and invigorate
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006783_0393_10299E2B02C30800"/>
the Vessels, to propel them: Fomentations are a Decoction of three, four or five Handfuls of Herbs, with some Berries or Seed in three Pints of Water to two, then strained off, and some Spirits put to it, and used warm in Flannels wrung out of it, one Flannel on the Part, and another ready to take out of the Liquor, when the other is cool; twenty or thirty Flannels may be thus applied. Fomentations loosen the Fibres and Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of the Part, open its Pores, whilst the Skin admits some of the thinner Parts of the Liquor to dissolve and thin the Humours, fit them for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration and Circulation; sometimes Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are immediately followed by Embrecations, as soon as the Parts are rubbed dry. All Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations used to relaxed, weak Parts, should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied hot; but to stiff, rigid, or contracted Parts, tepid or Milk warm; this Degree of Heat relaxes, the other contracts. Baths are only general Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, where instead of Flannels, the whole Body is immersed in the Bath; in which they may continue according to its Degree of Heat and their Strength, from fifteen Minutes to an Hour.</p>
               <p>Plaisters are made chiefly of Oils, Lard, Waxes, Resins and Powders, in making of which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, 1. That if there are any Minerals in them, as Letharge, it be first boiled in Vinegar, till it is almost dry, before any Oils or Lard be added. 2. That if there are any green Herbs used, they may be infused in white Wine, then boiled in the Oil till crisp, and strained out, and their Humidity exhaled, before any other Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients be put to the Oil. 3. That when Juices or Mucilages are used, they be boiled in the Oil till their Humidity or watery Parts be spent, before other Articles are added. 4. Gummy and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Substances are not to be put in before all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006783_0394_102982D0C7083390"/>
or watery Parts of the former Ingredients are exhaled. 5. Indissolvable Powders are not to be put in till the Plaister is taken from the Fire, and cooling. 6. Plaisters must be constantly stirred whilst making, or some Parts will often burn; the whole not incorporated, the Colour lost, and the whole spoiled. 7. If a Plaister is boiled too much, it should be lowered with more Oil; if too low boiled, and come not to a Consistence, let it either be boiled higher, or have more Powders sifted into it; if brittle and crumbling, that it will not stick, put more Turpentine, white Pitch, or other tough Body to it. 8. When Quicksilver is added, it must be exactly mix'd with Turpentine, or it and liquid Styrax in a Mortar, then put to the Plaister when almost cold and well mix'd. 9. When Opium is added, it must either first be dissolved in that Vinegar which is boiled with Minerals, or dried, powder'd and put in, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in the Wine strained from Herbs, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in the Juices to be boiled. 10. When Plaisters are to be spread, they must not be made too hot, lest they either burn, or become brittle, that they will not stick. 11. Many Plaisters are much better kept in Pots well bladdered over than in Rolls. 12. Several, especially warming and discussing Plaisters, should be spread pretty thick.</p>
               <p>Glysters and tepid Bathing in common Water are too much neglected in the present Practice, especially as it has not yet supplied us with better Succedantures. Glysters are used of tepid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, to relax, dilate, or mitigate Irritation, or of fresh Broth, or Milk and Sugar, for an easy Laxative; or of the common Decoction of Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients and Purgatives to purge; or with Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients, Turpentine, and some Drops of liquid Laudanum, in reaching Pains of the Stone without Inflammation; or of the same Decoction, and

Nitre, and Laudanum, with Inflammation; or made of the bitterest Decoctions, and given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oil for Worms; or of the most stimulating, acrid Ingredients in Apoplexies or Lethargies; or of Astringents and Balsamics in Dysenteries; or of most nutritive, liquid Food, in Pains of the Gullet, or other Stoppages of swallowing without Inflammation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Quantity thrown in at a Time, is from two Ounces to a Pound, according to the Age of the Patient, and Intent of the Glyster. If Purgatives work not within three Hours after they are taken, let a Glyster be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; if the Person cannot retain it, but it comes away immediately, give another: Two, or at most, three in a Day are sufficient (except in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Cases) at four or five Hours Distance. But if one answer the End it is enough. When it is intended to lie long in the Body, as in the Gravel, bloody Flux, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it must be given in small Quantity, as from four Ounces to six<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if several Glysters of different Purgatives are given in one and the same Day, without Operation, give a small one of six Ounces of tepid Water, and from two Drams to six of Sea Salt, mix and throw up, it will work immediately.</p>
               <p>Suppositories are useful, either when Glysters have been given in vain, or the Person cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Glysters, or cannot be laid in a right Posture to receive them. But they are not proper where Costiveness is from much hardened Excrements in the Rectum; or from a Crump, Convulsion, or Contraction of the Sphimter. They may be made of Salt and Honey boiled up so stiff, that they will roll up; or of the small End of a Candle dipped in sweet Soap, and put up; or of Salt and Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picra boiled up in Honey; they should be dipped in Oil before they are put up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:006783_0396_10299E36ABF80AE0"/>Injections are sometimes Decoctions of Roots, Herbs, or Seeds in Water, strained and mixed with other Things, as Honey, to throw up with a large Syringe or Glister pipe into the Womb or Yard; or are sometimes of distilled Waters and Honey; sometimes of Powders and Water, as Rhasis, white Troches and Camphire, of Sugar of Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of meer Emulsions made with Turpentine, the Yolk of an Egg, and Linseed Oil, with Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pessories are made with proper Powders mixed with the Yolk of an Egg to the Consistence of an Ointment, and rubbed over a Piece of Gentian, or other spungy or stimulant Root, or scattered in Wool, and put up; or Juice of Herbs and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Wool dipped in them. They should have a String tied to their lower End; if sharp, they should not lie in above an Hour, if mild, all Night; they are fittest after bathing. If they give Pain, use Oil of Violets and Mucilage of Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane after; Gravids should not use them.</p>
               <p>Gargles are used, either for Inflammations of the Mouth and Throat, as cooling acid, sub-astringent Washes, or for cleansing the Mouth and Throat from Phlegm; or for cooling, soften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moistening, as in Fevers. All these are made, either of boiled Herbs and Vinegar, Spirit of Vitriol, Honey, or Syrups put to the strained Liquor.

            <head>Mr. <hi>BARTRAM</hi>'s APPENDIX: CONTAINING <hi>Descriptions, Virtues</hi> and <hi>Uses,</hi> of sundry PLANTS of these Northern Parts of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>; and particularly of the newly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Indian</hi> Cure for the <hi>Venereal Disease.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>ARALIA,</hi> called by some <hi>Spikenard,</hi> by others <hi>Wild Liquorice</hi>; this bears large Clusters of Berries, ripe in <hi>September,</hi> which are pleasant and wholesome to eat: The Roots are of a balsamick Nature; the back In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants use them to cure fresh Wounds; they bruise the Roots, then pour a little Spring Water to them, mixing them together, which brings the Mass to a mucilaginous Balsam, which they apply with good Success; the Roots chewed, and the Juice swallowed, help the Pains of the Loins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aralia Caule Nudo,</hi> commonly called <hi>Sarsaparilla,</hi> hath a long creeping Root, something like the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi> but is really a very different Plant, yet of great Virtue. The Decoction daily drank as Diet-drink, is much commended for cleansing the Blood, and curing a Dropsy; and outwardly applied is extoll'd for curing of the Shingles, and cleansing and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g of Ulcers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erigeren,</hi> used by some for the Bite of a Snake; it bears a white Flower in the Spring, something like
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006783_0400_10299F327B709938"/>
a large Daisy, about a Foot high, the Roots run under the Surface of the Ground in small Fibres or Threads, of a hot Taste: The <hi>Indians</hi> pound this Root, and apply it to cold hard Tumours to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saururus.</hi> Some of the <hi>Dutch</hi> call it <hi>Aristolochia,</hi> I suppose, because the Shape of the Leaf hath some Resemblance to that Plant. It grows in wet Places, and produceth a long Spike of white Flowers; the Root is spungy like a Rush, and runs near the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Mud.</p>
            <p>IT is of excellent Virtue; being made into a Poultice, and applied to sore and imposthumated Breasts, it ripens and heals them. The dried Leaves made into a Tea and drank, is commended for the Pains of the Breast and Back.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Collinsonia.</hi> This Plant grows five Feet high; hath, in the Fall, after Harvest, a Smell, something like Hops; the Seed is much like Sage Seed. This, in some Parts of the Country, is called <hi>Horse Weed,</hi> not only because Horses are very greedy of it, but it also is good for sore gall'd Backs. The Root is hard and knobby, and is much commended for Womens After-pains, being pounded, boiled, and the Decoction drank.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chelidonium,</hi> or <hi>Sanguinaria,</hi> called by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People, <hi>Red Root,</hi> or <hi>Turmerick.</hi> The Leaves broken yield a yellow Juice, like the Garden Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine; the Flower is white, and opens early in the Spring; the Root dried and powdered is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Dr. <hi>Colden,</hi> as a Cure for the Jaundice, the Powder being given to the Weight of a Drachm in Small Beer; and by others, for the Bite of a Rattle-Snake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virga-aurea,</hi> or that Species of <hi>Golden Rod,</hi> that is so famous for the Bite of a Rattle-Snake. This elegant Species hath slender purple Stalks, rising a
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006783_0401_10299E451FBA96D0"/>
Foot high, with a Spike of fine yellow Flowers for near one third Part of the Length of the Plant; the Flowers grow out of the Bosom of the Leaves, three or four in little Tufts. This is extolled as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effectual Cure for the Bite of a Rattle-Snake; the Herb boiled, and the Decoction drank, and the warm Herb applied to the Wound. It is used with good Success to cure the Swelling of the Throat and Neck, and Pains of the Breast, it being a powerful Dissolver of viscid Humours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacea,</hi> called by some <hi>Throat-wort,</hi> because of its Virtue for the Cure of Sore-Throats. The Roots are as big as a Hiccory Nut, with some small Fibres; the Stalk is about four or five Feet high, without any Branches, with long narrow Leaves growing alternately thereon; the Flowers put forth toward the Top, surrounding the Stalk in a long Spike of purple Flowers.</p>
            <p>THE Root bruised and boiled in Water, and the Decoction drank and gargled in the Mouth, and the Root applied, with warm Cloths dipped in the hot Decoction, to the Throat, gives Relief, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a warm discussing Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uvulary.</hi> It was formerly taken for a Species of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Seal,</hi> having smooth Leaves like it; but the Stalk grows through the Leaf, and the little yellowish Flowers something resemble a Lilly; it grows about a Foot high, the Root is white, and spreads like a Crow's Foot; some People call it by that Name for that Reason; it is a good Root for gathering and breaking a Boil, and makes a fine Salve for healing Wounds and Ulcers; it makes a sine maturating Poultice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Triosteospermum,</hi> called in our Northern Colonies Dr. <hi>Tinker</hi>'s <hi>Weed</hi>; in <hi>Pennsylvania, Gentian</hi>; and to the Southward <hi>Fever Root,</hi> where it is used for the Fever and Ague: With us it was used with
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006783_0402_10299E4D9A44E250"/>
good Success for the Pleurisy, and in <hi>New-England,</hi> for a Vomit. It is a powerful Worker, a little churlish, yet may be a noble Medicine in skilful Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blazing-Star,</hi> as it is called by the back Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by others, <hi>Devil</hi>'s-<hi>bit,</hi> both fanciful Names; the Leaves spread on the Ground, four or five from one Root, and are three or four Inches long; and near one broad; in <hi>June</hi> it shoots up a Stalk eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Inches long, with a fine Spike of white Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers six Inches long; it grows plentifully in the back Parts of the Country, on dry rich Soil; the Root is white, and about as thick as a Pipe-shank, and extremely bitter.</p>
            <p>THIS precious Root is a great Resister of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Poisons, and the grievous Pains of Bowels, taken in Powder, or the Root bruised and steeped in Rum, of which take a Spoonful at once, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> often as Need requires, until the Pains remit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Star-Grass.</hi> This hath some Resemblance to the last, but the Leaves are narrower and more pointed, and in Winter more yellow, and this grows in moist Places, amongst Hurtle-berries, very plentiful in <hi>Jersey,</hi> and some low Grounds in <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Decoction of this Root drank, easeth the Pains of the Stomach and Bowels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liriodendrum,</hi> commonly called <hi>Poplar.</hi> The Bark of the Root steeped in Rum, and the Rum drank, is much commended for the Cure of the Fever and Ague; and to the <hi>Northward,</hi> for the Gout and Rheumatism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apocinum.</hi> From the Roots that run deep in the Ground, arise several hairy Stalks about two Feet high, with narrow long Leaves set alternately round thereon; at the Top grow large Tusts of orange-coloured Flowers, which are succeeded by long
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006783_0403_10299E4F1FC84E88"/>
Pods, containing flat Seeds, joined to white Down, which is by the Wind carried away when the Seed is ripe and bursts open; this hath been for many Years used with good Success for the Cure of the Bloody Flux; the Root must be powdered and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Spoonful of Rum, or rather as the <hi>Indians</hi> give it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bruise the Root, and boil it in Water, and drink the Decoction: <hi>Peter Kalm</hi> saith it is excellent for the hysteric Passion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orchis.</hi> It hath a Root as big as an Onion, it hath one or two Leaves green all Winter, which are six or seven Inches long, and two broad, striped with white Lines from one End to the other. This Root bruised and applied to the Ears, easeth the Pains thereof, and helps to break Boils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contuarium Luteum,</hi> commonly called <hi>Ground-Pine.</hi> It grows about a Span high, its slender Branches spread all round from one small fibrous Root, like our <hi>Penny-royal,</hi> but as small as Wire, or the Leaves of Pine, from which it had its Name; the little Flowers are yellow, succeeded by little red Pods on the Tops of the Branches; it smells as strong as the Leaves of <hi>Pine</hi>; it commonly grows on old poor Clay Ground; it is of excellent Virtue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made into an Ointment with Penny-royal, Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock and Henbane (or it may do alone made into an Ointment) for Bruises and Strains, if it be green, for it loseth much of its Virtue when dry, it being of an active penetrating Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elichrysum,</hi> called also <hi>Cotton-weed,</hi> or <hi>Life-ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi> is very good for Baths or Fomentations for cold Tumors, Bruises or Strains; it may be mixed with Ground-Pine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lobelia.</hi> This curious Plant riseth from a fibrous Root to three or four Feet high, with a Spike of blue Flowers surrounding the Stalk for near a Foot in Length: It grows in rich shady Ground; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is a scarce Plant in many Parts of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006783_0404_10299E50A9C45A30"/>THE learned <hi>Peter Kalm</hi> (who gained the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it from Colonel <hi>Johnson,</hi> who learned it of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who, after great Rewards bestowed on several of them, revealed the Secret to him) saith, That the Roots of this Plant cureth the <hi>Pox</hi> much more perfectly and easily than any mercurial Preparations, and is generally used by the <hi>Canada Indians,</hi> for the Cure of themselves, and the <hi>French</hi> that trade amongst them, tho' deeply infected with it. They take a Handful of the Roots, and boil them in a Quart of Water, and drink the Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beginning with Half a Pint at first, if the Patient be weak, then increase the Dose every Day as he can bear its purging; but if he can't bear it every Day, let him omit it a Day or two, then take to it again, as he finds Occasion, until he is cured: They wash the Ulcer with the Decoction; but if it be deep and rotten, they put some Powder of the inner Bark of the Spruce-tree into it, which helps to dry it up; but if the Disease is inveterate, they drink the Decoction of <hi>Ranunculus Folio Reni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formus.</hi> An old <hi>Sachem</hi> told Colonel <hi>Johnson</hi> of another Shrub, with a red Root, from which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds several slender Branches, eighteen Inches or two Feet long, on which grow Spikes of white Flowers, which produce three-square black Seed-Pods; the Leaves some of our People drink as Tea, and some smoak it with Tobacco; the Roots of this, bruised and boiled, and the Decoction drank, the <hi>Sachem</hi> said, he rather preferred to the <hi>Lobelia</hi>; but the <hi>Lobelia</hi> seems to be of the most general Use, and with extraordinary Success.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>More particular Directions how to use the</hi> Lobelia-<hi>Root for the Venereal Disorder, obtained from the</hi> Indians, <hi>by Col.</hi> J.</p>
            <p>
               <q>AFTER making a Decoction of it, the Patient is to drink about-two Gills of it very early in the

Morning, fasting, the same before Dinner, and Bed-time. Add or diminish as you find it agree with the Patient's Constitution: The third Day begin Bathing, and continue it twice a Day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Sores are well cleansed, and partly healed, then use the Lotion but once a Day till quite well; observing all the Time to use a slender Diet (vegetable Food, and small Drink) as in other Courses of Physick, a Salivation excepted. These are the Directions I have had from the Person who gave me the Secret.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Veronica Spicata.</hi> This Plant, from a fibrous Root, raiseth two or three Stalks from three to five Feet high, with three or four Leaves set at one Joint (if they are set across) with a long Spike of white Flowers on the Top of each Stalk.</p>
            <p>ONE Handful of the Roots of this Plant, boiled in a Pint of Milk, and drank, is used by the back Inhabitants for a powerful Vomit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eupatorium Folium Perfoliatum.</hi> This Plant grows in moist Places; the Stalks grow (through the Leaves, which are rough and pointed) two or three Feet high, branching out towards the Top, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a large Bunch of white Flowers, which are succeeded by fine Down, which bloweth away with the Seed.</p>
            <p>THIS Herb boiled in Water, and the Decoction drank, is commended for a Vomit in intermitting Fevers, and used as a Fomentation for Pains in the Limbs.</p>
