            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any enquire into the Reaſons of this Publication; the Importunity of ſome Friends, and the Judgment of others, together with ſome Deſire to do good, are the general Arguments of a modern Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: And the Author hopes he has ſome Right to this common and uſeful Train of Thoughts.</p>
            <p>The Sermons are Plain, &amp; adapted to a popular Audience. They were compoſed without any Tho't of the Preſs, and when they were perſwaded out of the Author's Hands, be could not find Leaſure from his other Studies to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them: for which Cauſe the Reader will not expect to find any thing laboured or uncommon. The Author imagines that lively Deſcriptions, a clear Method, and pathetick Language beſt become the Desk: And this poſſibly may be one Reaſon why be inſiſted no more upon
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003510_0003_0FF854091AF7A020"/>Philoſophical Arguments in his Diſcourſe upon the <hi>vile Body changed.</hi> Tho' he believes the Doctrine of the <hi>Stamen</hi> will as eaſily account for a Reſurrection, as for Generation, yet he ſuppoſes ſuch Talk in the Pulpit ſerves more to amuſe the Auditory, and complement the Preacher himſelf, than to honour CHRIST, or do good to Souls.</p>
            <p>If by looking over the enſuing Pages, any Chriſtian ſhall have one more holy or proper Tho't. the Writer will think his Pains well rewarded.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the Chapter open before us, after ſome Precepts laid down, concludes with Two Motives to perſwade Men to the Practice of them: And theſe are, the <hi>Coming of</hi> CHRIST, in the Verſe preceeding my Text; and the <hi>Reſurrection of the Saints</hi> now read unto you. Both of them are very ſolemn and ſublime Thoughts: But it is only the latter which comes immediately with in the Compaſs of our preſent Meditation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> and, which is much the ſame thing, the <hi>Transformation of theſe found alive</hi> at the coming of CHRIST, are very clearly revealed in the New Teſtament, eſpecially by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> But the Glory of a Believer's Raiſed Body is not nor indeed can it be any where more ſully expreſs'd, than in the Words under our immediate View. <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us, Our Bodies are now <hi>vile;</hi> our vile Bodies ſhall be <hi>changed;</hi> it is our Lord JESUS CHRIST <hi>who</hi> ſhall change them; and they ſhall be <hi>faſhion'd like unto his glorious body.</hi> How much is crowded into a few Words! how emphatical are they! how copious! how ſublime! How amply do they fill the Mind, and Exhauſt, the Imagination, inſpire our Faith, and awaken our Joy?</p>
            <p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
In handling theſe Words, I ſhall only have Time to ſpeak to Three of the Four Articles (or if you pleaſe, <hi>Doctrines</hi>) which you ſee are plainly contained in them.</p>
            <p n="1">I <hi>Theſe Bodies of ours, in their Preſent State, are</hi> VILE BODIES <hi>Who ſhall change our vile bodies?</hi> Shall we here let our Thoughts looſe upon a few Particulars, which will render it plain, and humble us with the ſad Conviction. Theſe Bodies, of whoſe Beauty and Vigour we are ſo apt to boaſt, alas, they are vile Bodies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their <hi>Original</hi> is mean and deſpicable. In the Senſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, our Body was vile, even in the Purity of its firſt Creation The Word which we tranſlate <hi>vile,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: The Body of our <hi>Humility.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>humble</hi> Body. It carries <hi>Humiliation</hi> even in its Origin and Conſtitution. It comes from <hi>Humus;</hi> the <hi>moiſt Ground;</hi> The <hi>Clay,</hi> the <hi>low Earth.</hi> The Firſt Principle of <hi>Humane,</hi> is <hi>Humus.</hi> Humiliation and Vileneſs is thus entail'd upon our Body, even from the primitive Materials out of which it was framed. Even <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe and Innocence, might in this ſacred ſenſe, have own'd a Vile Body.</p>
            <p>And now, Let the Proud Creature look down to the Earth, &amp; view the Duſt from which he ſprung, &amp; then confeſs his Body Vile. <hi>And the Lord God formed man out of the duſt of the ground</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 7.</note> Out of the Clay was this living Frame faſhioned; here it had its humble Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and from this abject Earth, did it ariſe and ſhoot up, thus cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in its Form and Conſtitution. This beautecus Arrangement of finer Duſt, was taken from the common Glebe, into which it muſt quickly fall, and reſolve again. The Limbs which now ſhew the exacteſt Symmetry and Proportion, the Pulſes which beat with the ſtrongeſt Energy and Life, and the Aſpect that is fluſh'd with Health and Beauty, owe all their Exiſtance to the ſame Clods of Earth which harbour our Brethren, the Worms: The Worms, which wait to Feaſt upon our moulding Carcaſe; and riot in our waſting Fleſh. The Body <hi>is of the Earth, earthy: Duſt it is, and to Duſt it ſhall return.</hi> Let us reflect thus, &amp; then confeſs, This VILE BODY.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>ſinful</hi> Body, and therefore a vile Body. It has in it a Body of Death; and no wonder it looks ghaſtly, and loathſome, and vile. All its Appetites are vitiated, and diſorder'd, and it leads the Soul about like a Malefactor in Chains. The Spirit which God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes,</hi> is depraved and polluted by it: and Original Sin is <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> thro' the Veins of the guilty Parent. The ſeveral <hi>Senſes</hi> of the Body, prove ſo many Traitors to the nobler Faculties of the Mind, and continually captivate and debaſe it. How many Sins enter at the <hi>Eyes?</hi> and how many idle Ideas paſs in at the <hi>Ears, forever open</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003510_0006_0FF853E126DDE7C8"/>to the Vanity of empty and corrupted Air. The Luxuries of the <hi>Palate</hi> debauch the enſlaved Mortal, and drag him on to Exceſs and Intemperance. He wanders among ſenſible Appearances, and for gets ſpiritual and divine Reallities. He is hardly brought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the <hi>things which are SEEN are temporal, but the things, which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> Is not the Body, that thus abuſes the Soul, the Rational principle within, a vile Body? The Body, the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Workmanſhip of an Alwiſe Artificer, how is it ſunk beneath the Level of the brutal World, by its Sin againſt God? O <hi>wretched that we are! who ſhall deliver us from the Body of this Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Body is a weak, <hi>infirm</hi> Body, and therefore a vile Body. It is a feeble Houſe of Clay, that totters to every Blaſt. Diſeaſe and Mortality lurk in every Member, and Vein, and Muſcle. It is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Contagions and Diſtempers of all Sorts. They March ſilent and unſeen, in the fine Air about us. They lie brooding in their Venom, thro' all the Fluids within: Latent Deſtruction! Death in Ambuſcade! A thouſand different Fevers ſtand ready to ſeize this Body; to torment it, and to burn away its Life: To lick up the finer Spirts, and ſhap the Vital Cord. It may be at once <hi>blinded</hi> by a Defluxion of Rheum, fetter'd with the Tortures of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and broken in the Agonies of the <hi>Stone:</hi> Like <hi>Sampſon</hi> in the Philiſtian Priſon-houſe, at the ſame Time <hi>blinded,</hi> and <hi>ſhackled,</hi> and <hi>grinding.</hi> Every Nerve about us, is capable of Pains too great for us to bear, too ſtrong for us to reſiſt, and too ſubtil for us to eſcape. The Strength of the moſt athlerick Body, is ſtill on the Wing; may fly away ſuddenly; will do it ſpeedily; and muſt at laſt wholly leave it. The Beauty of the moſt amiable Body, is every Day haſting to fade, and go out in obſcure Darkneſs. Our daily eating and drinking, proclaim a feeble Body, that would faint and die if theſe were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Every Time we ſet down to a Table, or take a Cup in our Hand, we confeſs we are Creatures that need conſtant Support and Nouriſhment. When we lie down to the neceſſary Sleep of the Night, we own the Sleep of the Night muſt relieve us a little from the long Slumber of the Grave. Every Breath we draw, inſinuares, in a ſilent Whiſper, our Frailty, our Dependance on God, and our ſhorn Continuance: It warns us that our <hi>Life is Wind.</hi>—So Weak is out Body, that it take away much of our Thought from our Souls, to contrive for its Life, and Health, and Suſt, nance.—Let us look now upon the brittle Frame, and exclaim, O the vile Body!</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>dying</hi> Body, &amp; therefore a vile Body. Here our Bodies now ſtand, perhaps flouriſhing in all the Pride and Bloom of Youth: Strong our Sinews; moiſt our Bones; active and ſupple our Jomes; our Pulſes beating with Vigour, and our Heares leaping with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Life and Energy. But oh! Vaim Appearance and gaudy Dream! Surely every Man at his beſt Eſtate, is altogether Vanity. He walks in a vain Show; he glitter, with deluſive Colours; he ſpends his Years as an Idle Tale. What avails it, that he is now
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003510_0007_0FF8540D8226B090"/>hardy and robuſt, who muſt quickly pant upon a Death-bed. What avails it, that his Limbs are ſprightly in their eaſy Motions, which muſt quickly ſtretch in the dying Agony. The Lips now fluſh'd with a Roſey Colour, will anon quiver and turn pale. The Eyes that roll with a ſparkling Vivacity, will fix in a ghaſtly Horror. The moſt muſical Voice will be ſtop'd; and the tuneful Breath fly away. The Face where Beauty now triumphs, will appear cold, and wan, and diſmal, rifled by the Hand of Death. A Cold Sweat will chill the Body; a hoarſe Rattling will fill the Throat; the Heart will heave with Pain and Labour, and the Lungs catch for Breath, but gaſp in vain. Our Friends ſtand in Tears about our Bed: They weep; but they cannot help us. The very Water with which they would cool and moiſten our pearched Mouths, we receive with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Groan, Anon we give a Gaſp, and they ſhriek out in Diſtreſs, <hi>'Oh! He's gone,—He's dead!'</hi> The Body in that Inſtant ſtretches on the Sheets, an awful Corpſe. This is the End of our Body for this World: Pronounce now; Is it not a Vile Body? But this brings me to the laſt Article.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Body will quickly be a <hi>dead</hi> Body, and this proclaims it a vile Body. The Silks and ſoft Linnen which now fold and adorn theſe Bodies, muſt be changed for a winding Sheet. The Applauſe and Complement which now flatter us, are not heard in the Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Grave, to diſturb its aweful Silence: Nor ſhall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Revilings break in upon our Reſt there. Our pleaſant Habitations will be left for others, while we have no Apartment left us, but a Coffin, or a Tomb at moſt. We ſhall forſake our Diſhes and our Tables; and our ſelves become Food for the crawling Vermin of the Duſt. How quickly ſhall we haſten to Clay and Aſhes, in the ſolitary, and dark, and cold Grave?</p>
            <p>In a few Years, the moſt beautious, or learned, or pious Head will grin a hideous Skull. Our broken Coffins will ſhow nothing but black Bones, and black Mould, and Worms &amp; Filth. The Places that know us ſhall know us no more. The perſons who were moſt intimate in our Acquaintance; who ſooth'd us with their Viſits, or careſs'd us in their Boſoms, will now forget us. When they ſhall perhaps enter our Tombs and take up our Bones in their Hand, they'll not ſuſpect the frightful Carcaſe to be Ours, ſave by the Letters on the broken Coffin, or the Inſcription on the mouldring Monument.</p>

The Great Name, the loud Applauſe, and the Brutal Pleaſure? His Riches are left to others: And to whom he knows not; whether a Wiſe Man or a Fool.

            <p>The Spirit is given up; and ſee the Body drops down, pale, and ſtiff, and cold. The Eyes are fixt; the Teeth are ſet; the Breath is fled.

Where are the proportioned Limbs, the ſupple Joints, the vigorous Pulſes, the beating Heart, the working Brain, and the breathing Breaſt? Lo, the Body is laid in the Duſt, and the Worms cover in. Polluted Vermine crawl over every Part of the elegant Form, and the beautious Face. It is folded in a winding Sheet, it is nailed in a black Coffin, and it is depoſited in a ſilent Vault, amidſt Shades and Solitude. The Skin breaks and moulders away; the Fleſh drops in Duſt from the Bones; the Bones are covered with black Mould, and Worms twiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. The Coffins break, and the Graves ſink in, and the diſjointed Skelliton ſtrows the lonely Vault. This ſhapely Fabrick muſt leave its Ruins among the Graves; lie neglected and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got; moulder away without a Name, and ſcatter among the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements. 'And were theſe Bones once living like ours? and muſt ours be as they'?

Some ſhall never die, but be found alive at the Appearance of CHRIST: Theſe ſhall be caught up to meet the deſcending Judge, and ſhall be changed in the ſhining Aſcent. See in the Iſt Epiſt. Cor. xv. Chap. where the Apoſtle treats this Subject at large, ver. 51, 52. <hi>Behold I ſhew you a myſtery; we ſhall not all ſheep, but we ſhall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye, at the laſt Trumpet, (for the Trumpot ſhall ſound) and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptable, and we ſhall be changed.</hi> So that in the End, there will be very little Difference between the dead Believers, and thoſe whom our Lord finds alive at his coming. Both ſhall be changed at our Lord's deſcent; caught up to meet him in the Regions of Air, as his fiery Chariot rolls down amidſt Thunder, and Clouds, and Whirlwinds. The Living Saints ſhall be ſnatched from the Earth, and changed from the feeble State they are now in: Thoſe who are Dead, and ſleep among the Tombs, ſhall ſhake of the Diſhonours of the Graves, and be changed from the Vileneſs of Duſt and Worms. Of theſe in their Order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This vile Body ſhall be changed from the STATE <hi>of</hi> DEATH. What though our Bodies die; they ſhall revive from the Conditior of Curſe and Corruption. <hi>If a man die, ſhall he live again?</hi> Yes; at the Reſurrection of the Dead ſhall he be raiſed. GOD ſhall raiſe the Dead, by the Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he has given Aſſurance unto all Men in that he raiſed him from the Dead. So long ago as the Time of <hi>Job,</hi> the holy Man could look to a Redeemer, who ſhould call him from the corruptions of the Grave, and renew his conſumed Limbs to Strength, and his Eyes to Light. [Job xix. 25, 26, 27.] <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter Day upon the Earth. And tho' after my Skin, Worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee GOD; whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and my Eyes behold, and not another, tho' my Reins be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed within me.</hi> We muſt die, but what then, we are as ſure of a Reſurrection as we are of Death. But Oh! what a bleſſed Change will the Reſurrection make upon our dead Bodies. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Worms have feaſted themſelves upon our Laſt Duſt; But they ſhall refund it, and give back every Attom: All that really belongs to our numerical Body. The Fiſhes perhaps have eaten the Careaſe, buried in the Waves, and loſt in the Depths of the Ocean: But <hi>the Sea</hi> alſo ſhall return it back,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xx. 13.</note> and <hi>give up the Dead that is in it.</hi> Theſe Bodies may diſſolve, and ſcatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Elements. Our Fluids may forſake their Veſſels; the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003510_0011_0FF85411773871B0"/>Solid contract, and fold up in its primitive Miniature. And even after that the little inviſible Bones may moulder to finer Duſt, the Duſt may refine to Water, wander in a Cloud, float in a River, or be loſt in the wide Sea, and undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Drop among the Waves. They may be again ſucked up by the Sun, and fall in a Shower upon the Earth; They may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the Fields with Dew, flouriſh in a Spire of Graſs; look green in a Leaf, or gaudy in a Flower or a Bloſſom. For we know Matter is continually changing, and one Element perpetually looſing it ſelf in another. But let our Duſt wander where it will, thro'out the whole material Creation, yet at the firſt Blaſt of the laſt Trumpet, it ſhall all at once ruſh together, and ſtart up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Man. The vile Body ſhall be changed, where ever it lay hid: The Duſt ſhall be called together; the Bones ſhall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the Joynts connect; a new, unknown, incorruptible Fluid ſuddenly fill the Veſſels; the Sinews ſhall brace with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Strength, no more to be parted; and the Skin cover all with everlaſting Beauty, never to fade any more. This ſhall be the Change from the <hi>State of Death,</hi> which our vile Bodies ſhall paſs through.—The prophetick Viſion of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſhall be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally fulfilled at that day. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxx<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            <p n="2">2. This vile Body ſhall be changed from its PRESENT STATE. Tho' it ſhall be raiſed from the Dead, it ſhall <hi>not</hi> revive to its <hi>preſent</hi> mean and diſhonourable Condition, but ſhall be changed. Now it is a Body full of Uncleanneſs and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Diſeaſe and Death. But it ſhall be changed. <hi>Tho' it is ſown in corruption, it ſhall be raiſed in incorruption.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xv. 42.50, 44, 53.</note> Now our Body is mean and vile, and upon many Accounts diſhonourable; But it ſhall be changed. <hi>Tho' it is ſown in Diſhonour, it is raiſed in Glory.</hi> Now they are weak, and faint, and ſoon exhauſted, and ſpent with long and cloſe Labour. But they ſhall be changed from their feeble ſtate. <hi>It is ſown in Weakneſs, it is raiſed in Power.</hi> Now how groſs and heavy are our Bodies? How ſluggiſh and unactive the unweildy Fleſh? But it ſhall be changed. <hi>This I ſay Brethren, Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption,</hi> vor. <hi>It is ſown a natural Body, it is raiſed a Spiritual Body,</hi> vor. What can we ſay more to illuſtrate the bleſſed Change? Our Body is now in a thouſand reſpects an infirm and dying Body: But, O glorious Transformation! <hi>This corruptible muſt put on Incorruption; and this mortal muſt put on Immortality,</hi> vor.

               </gap>, ſhall receive a like <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Shape,</hi> and be <hi>changed into the ſame Image.</hi> So ſays the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. xv. 47.49. <hi>The firſt man is of the Earth earthy; the ſecond Man is the Lord from Heaven. And as we have born the Image of the Earthy, we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is this Image? and what is implied in that moſt expreſſive Idea, our vile ſhall be changed; and faſhioned like unto CHRIST's glorious Body? I ſhall juſt hint at a few Particulars very briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To have the vile Body faſhioned like unto CHRIST's glorious Body, implies in it, that it be made <hi>ſplendid and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> The Body of CHRIST is a ſhining Body, and <hi>ſcatters Light and Glory round about it. Saul</hi> was ſtruck blind, dazled with the unſufferable Blaze, that ruſh'd in a Tempeſt upon his Eyes, from the Body of the Son of GOD. <hi>John</hi> beheld him, with his Face ſhining like the Sun in its meridian Flame, and his Body beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an anſwerable Glory. The Angels and the glorified Saints behold him, as the great Ornament and the Light of Heaven: <hi>For the Lamb is the Light of it, and they need no Sun, or Moon, or Candle.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xxi. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If CHRIST's Body be thus ſplendid, our's ſhall be ſo too; for they ſhall be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body. They ſhall put on a ſhining Form; ſhoot like a Flame from the Grave, and glitter like a Ray of Light up the Ether. Dan. xii. 3. <hi>They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they which turn many to Rightcouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It implies that our Bodies ſhall be <hi>immortal.</hi> CHRIST's Body is immortal; <hi>Being raiſed from the Dead, he dieth no more,</hi> Rev. vi. 9. He pronounces with a Voice of Triumph, Rev. i. 18. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold, I am alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Amen.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003510_0013_0FF85413BB107008"/>
Is the Body of CHRIST immortal? our Bodies ſhall be faſhioned like unto his own immortal Body. <hi>This Mortal muſt put on Immortality.</hi> We muſt all die; we ſhall die but once, Being raiſed frow the Dead, Death ſhall be ſwallowed up in Victory; and <hi>there ſhall be no more Death.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xxi. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It implies that our Bodies ſhall be glorified with very <hi>myſterious and aſtoniſhing Powers.</hi> The Body of Chriſt could aſcend and deſcend with equal eaſe. It could ſtand aloſt in the Air, without any viſible Support: So he looked down thro' the opened Heavens, upon the expiring <hi>Stephen: Act.</hi> vi. 56. So he dazled the Eyes of <hi>Saul</hi> in the Road to <hi>Damaſous;</hi> Act. ix. 3. It could riſe up gradually from the Ground, and tower away thro' the upper Skies, to the World above. So he aſcended in the View of the Men of <hi>Galilee,</hi> till a Cloud ſail'd ander his Feet, and raviſhed hun from their gazing Eyes; <hi>Act.</hi> i. 9. The Body of CHRIST could ſhift its form as their was Occaſion, and vary its Shope and Dreſs, according to the Diſpoſition of his Soul. To <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> he aſſumed the Form and Habit of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener; <hi>Joh.</hi> x<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 15. While the ſame Day, the Two Diſciples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Emmans,</hi> miſtook him for a Traveller, from his Air and Dreſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. xxiv. 13. Mark xvi. 12.</note> 
               <hi>For after that he appeared in another Form unto two of them as they walked, and went into the Country.</hi> In a Word, the Body of CHRIST could appear or vaniſh juſt as he pleaſed, and it ſhould ſeem without Reſiſtance from groſſer Matter. Thus to his Diſciples met together, with the Door ſhut, on a ſudden, he ſtood confeſs'd in the midſt of them, to their Wonder and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Joh. xx. 19, 26. Luk xxiv. 36, 37.</note> I can ſee nothing tending to Hereſy in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture: Nor do I think we have any reaſon to read the Paſſage, <hi>after the Time of ſhutting the Door.</hi> But it is indifferent to our preſent Head, whether the Body of our Lord penetrated thro' the Pores of the Wood, as Light, which is a Body, does thro' the much finer Pores of Glaſs; or whether it had a power ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, as to open and ſhur the Door, at once ſo ſwift, and ſo ſoft, as to be entirely unperceived both by their Sight and Hearing. Either the one or the other, ſhow the wondrous Powers of the raiſed Body.</p>
            <p>And are theſe the Glories of CHRIST's Body? our's ſhall be faſhioned like it. When we are raiſed from the Dead, our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will be active as the Flames, and vigorous as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams. They will be able to command their Shape, or to ſhift their Place as they pleaſe. To glide over Oceans, life thro' the Clouds, dart like a Stream of Lightning from Eaſt to Weſt, and range ſuddenly over the whole Creation.</p>

4. It implies, That our Bodies ſhall be renewed, <hi>holy</hi> Bodies.

He was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeperate from Sinners.</hi> His Body was ſhered, and conſecrate, and perfectly holy from its Birth.

            </p>
            <p>Is the Body of CHRIST holy? our's ſhall be ſo too; ſhall be faſhioned like unto his own holy Body. Theſe Senſes ſhall be refined, theſe Paſſions rectified, and theſe Appetites adjuſted to a perfect Order and Oeconomy.

The Doctrine of CHRIST now before us is this, DOCT. <hi>Converſion is of abſolute Neceſſity in order to our Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the clear and profitable Handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall endeavour theſe three things. I. To explain to you the Nature of Converſion here ſpoken of. II. To ſhew what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Kingdom of Heaven. And III. To prove that this Converſion is abſolutely Neceſſary in order to our Entrance into this Kingdom. And to make ſome practical Inferences.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to <hi>explain the Nature of True Converſion. Except ye be converted,</hi> ſays the Text. Converſion, and to be converted, are Phraſes often found in the Holy Scriptures; and our Salvation turns upon our right underſtanding what they mean. The Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſe of the word <hi>Converſion</hi> then is no more than this, <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about.</hi> And this is the meaning of the Word in this Place: and ſo it is explained in many other Texts. Sinners are called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>turn:</hi> and this Short Word comprizes in it all Salvation. Let us meditate a little here, and endeavour to underſtand it well.</p>
            <p>Man was at firſt created holy and happy in the Enjoyment of GOD. The Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> was filled with Thoughts of GOD, and love to him. The Glory of GOD was his. End in all that he did. The Senſe of GOD, Love to GOD, and Satisfaction in the Will of GOD, made up the Happineſs of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. The Soul was ſatisfied and crowded with the Enjoyment of the Infinite Being; and a Senſe of his Glories, and his Love.</p>
            <p>Well. But no ſooner did <hi>Adam</hi> ſin, and renounce this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than GOD forſook him, and he was left deſtitute and empty. That Soul that was once filled full of GOD, has now in it a vaſt Caſm. We feel indeed our want of Happineſs: But our dark Minds know not where to find it. The Deſire remains: but the Satisfaction is loſt and gone. Our Souls feel ſomething want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There's a vaſt Hollow there without any thing to fill it up. It is conſtantly craving, <hi>Give, Give.</hi> That's the Reaſon that Men are never perfectly eaſy and at Reſt. They are forever purſuing that Happineſs which they conſtantly miſs of. GOD is gone, and Happineſs with Him: and they try to fill up the empty Space, with every thing they can lay their Hands on. Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Senſual Pleaſures, theſe they fancy will make them happy. They try; and try again; and repeat their Tryal: But they ſtill meet a Diſappointment. They think; If ever I obtain ſuch a thing I ſhall be ſatisfied. If ever I get into ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I ſhall ſet down contented. They obtain what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003510_0020_0FF853F443A8F748"/>and are juſt where they were before. Then they put off the Point of Happineſs a little further, and ſtill think on ſome Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good which they have not yet enjoyed. If they obtain this too, they are ſtill diſappointed. Thus they go on from one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to another, till Death overtakes them, before they have tryed their laſt Project. This has been the Caſe of all Mankind from <hi>Adam</hi> until now: Nor will Men take Warning after all. All paſt Examples, and all their own Experience to this Moment, will make no laſting Impreſſion on them. They have loſt Happineſs in GOD: they wander from Creature to Creature in Purſuit of it. Madneſs is in their Hearts while they live; and after that they go down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dead. I am not at all wandering from my Text, in theſe Obſervations, but making clear the Way to it.</p>
            <p>Converſion then lies here. The Man as he is purſuing Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Creatures, is ſtop'd ſhort and convinced that theſe will not do. GOD gives him a New Sight of things. He ſees an End of all Perfection below GOD. He ſees he is undone every where elſe. Now his Will is renewed. He <hi>turns about:</hi> (THAT'S CONVERSION) he TURNS ABOUT to GOD, and from this Time ſeeks all Happineſs in Him alone. He ſays, <hi>Who ſhall ſhew me any Good?</hi> and he replies, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me. Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſive beſides Thee.</hi> For ever after this Turn of Soul, the Man is ſet upon pleaſing GOD: upon yielding to the Will of GOD: upon approving himſelf in the Sight of GOD. He never ſeeks his Happineſs in the Creature any more. He may indeed, under the Power of Temptation, caſt a wiſhing Look at them. But he recalls it in a Moment. He never can reſt caſy one Moment ſhort of the Favour of GOD. Like the Needle touch'd by the Magnet, ſtill pointing Northward. When it is ſhaken indeed, and toſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, it trembles, it wavers, it vibrates, it varies a Point this way and that, but it never fixes but right North again. So a Soul thus touched by the SPIRIT of GOD, may be toſt by Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Hurries of the World, and look this Way and that among the Creatures, till the Violence of the Shock is over, but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> never fixes; never reſts, till be points full and ſteady to GOD again. This ſhort Paragraph is, I think, a full and clear Account of Converſion.</p>
            <p>We all are ſeeking Happineſs. Every Natural Man ſeeks for it ſomewhere below GOD. Converſion is, The Man ſeeing he is infinitely wrong, <hi>turns about</hi> to GOD again to ſeek his whole Satisfaction there. I hope I have now ſaid enough in a few Words to explain the Matter, and ſhew what Converſion is. Before we proceed to the next Head, we may make one or two ſolemn and affecting Inferences.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003510_0021_0FF8541DF3E20F08"/>
1. From what we have heard, we perceive that <hi>Converſion is out of our Power.</hi> It is impoſſible for us to convert our ſelves; or for all the Angels in Heaven to do it for us. To convince you of this, Let the Natural Man make the Experiment. Try this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Try and ſee whither you can bring your Hearts to this, to rehounce all Happineſs in every thing but the Favour of GOD; to let GOD order for you; to have no Will of your own; to be ſwallow'd up, and raviſh'd with his Will, whatever it is. Can you forego every Creature-Comfort? Can you leave this World, and all the Delights of it, to go to a World where you will have none of them, but the Love of GOD will ſwallow you up? Theſe things are ſo diſtant from an unrenewed Heart, that they look like wild Paradoves to it. The Man finds he can't bring his Heart to this; and he thinks no Body ever could. And yet, there is not a Good Man upon Earth, but knows a little what this means. He knows a little what it is to love GOD; to have his Happineſs in GOD; to exult that the Will of GOD is done. Not a Good Man upon Earth, but would gladly leave all the Delights of Life, only to be made perfectly holy. Nay, all he fears in Death is, leſt it ſhould not convey him to a World of perfect Holineſs. Could he be ſure conſummate Holineſs would be to him the immediate Conſequent of Death, he'd die chearfully; without a Struggle or a Groan. Seeing then that Converſion is not in our own Power, let us ſeek to GOD for it. Senſible, and amazed at our own Incapacity, let us go to GOD, and take to our ſelves Words and ſay with repenting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. xxxi. 18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the Lord my</hi> GOD. Be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſinful Nature which ſtill carries us away from him. Be ſenſible of that firſt Sin, by which we departed from him, and pray, Pſal. lxxx. 19. <hi>Turn us again, O Lord</hi> GOD <hi>of Hoſts, and cauſe thy Face to ſhine and we ſhall he ſaved.</hi> To ſee our own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency is the firſt Step towards Converſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From what we have heard we learn <hi>our Neceſſity of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. We can't turn again to GOD without Him. No man can come to the Father but by Him. The Enmity between GOD and us is irreconcilable but by CHRIST. Out of him GOD is a conſuming Fire. We may indeed feel the Want of Happineſs, but we ſhould never dare to go to GOD for it. He would be our Enemy, and we ſhould hate him for it. <hi>Falſe Notions</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice and Mercy could never bring us truly to him: And <hi>true ones</hi> would only drive us farther from Him. So that ſet CHRIST aſide, and there can be no Converſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We Infer <hi>the Honours of the</hi> HOLY GHOST. He is the Agent who performs this Work. One Reaſon that Men fall Short of this ſaving Change, is the not acknowledging him as they ought. Did men regard the Operation of the Holy SPIRIT more, there would be more frequent Converts. Men are apt to truſt to
<pb n="5"
                   facs="unknown:003510_0022_0FF853F5D129E7D8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>their own Strength when they ſet about the Work of Converſion. They rob the Spirit of GOD of his Glory, and ſo it all comes to nothing. He it is who makes this great Change in men. He muſt be the Almighty GOD then: and we ſhould honour him as ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You ſee <hi>how many miſtake in their Notions of Converſion.</hi> Some think that to be converted is only to profeſs the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They fancy that to turn from Heatheniſm to Chriſtianity is all that is implied in it. To talk of a Baptiſed Perſon's being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward converted they think is Cant and Superſtition. This is the modern (I wiſh I could not add, the obtaining and faſhionable) Scheme. If we ſpeak of our being <hi>Converted,</hi> they ask, why what were you before? <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Heathen?</hi> Alas, the fatal Miſtake! We are all undone in our Natural State, unleſs we know what Converſion means. We are all naturally departing from GOD, and ſeeking Happineſs in ſomething below him. If ever we are happy then, it muſt be by our ſtopping here, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to him. Converſion does not conſiſt, in embracing a new Sect, or Party: in Baptiſm, or Approach to the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or any external Privilege, or Advantage, or Alteration. No; it conſiſts in turning from the Creature to GOD.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From what we have heard, we learn the Propriety of the Expreſſion in the Text, Except ye <hi>become as Little Children.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion implies ſuch a Change as will bring us to begin our Life anew. We muſt become as Little Children: modeſt, unambitious, teachable as they. Like them, we muſt begin to live again: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin another kind of Life: purſue a quite different End, by quite different Meaſures. Like a weaned Child, muſt be weaned from Creatures, and the things we were formerly fond of. But I would not enlarge here. I proceed to the Second thing propoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew <hi>what we are to underſtand by the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> ſpoken of in the Text. <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the KINGDOM</hi> OF <hi>HEAVEN.</hi> I ſhall not be long in explaining this Phraſe. The <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> GOD, are principally uſed in the Evangeliſts for the State of the Goſpel in This World; or the Rewards of it in the Future. Sometimes it means the Kingdom of Grace; and ſometimes the Kingdom of Glory. And I ſuppoſe that tho' the Text may ultimately refer to the Latter, yet it takes in the former alſo. And therefore we ſhall conſider them both in our Handling the Third Propoſition: Which is this.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Except we be converted and become as little Children, we ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Without this we cannot enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Grace.</hi> God cannot receive us as his Favourites even in This World, till

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>we have had this Change paſſed upon us. He will take no Delight in us, while we openly neglect him, and ſet up Self and Creatures in his Throne. We may indeed belong to his Kingdom of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and he may have Deſigns for our Salvation before our Converſion: But we are by no means Subjects in this Kingdom of <hi>Grace</hi> before this. By no means intitled to his Special Favours, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his peculiar Delight.</p>
            <p>We may indeed belong to the Viſible Kingdom of CHRIST in the World, and not be ſavingly Converted. We may be Members of his Church here, and eat and drink in his Preſence, and yet he know nothing of us. But here too, in order to our being worthy Gueſts at this ſacred Feaſt, Converſion is neceſſary. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Without this Converſion beſure we cannot enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Glory.</hi> Rev. xxi. 27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it, any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination.</hi> And not only has GOD <hi>declared</hi> this, all over his New Teſtarnent, but it is impoſſible even in the <hi>Nature of the Thing.</hi> The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Happineſs in the Kingdom of Glory is, in being perfectly conformed to the Will of GOD: And this, we know, is only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by Converſion. We entertain juſter Ideas of Heaven, when we apprehend it as a <hi>State</hi> than a <hi>Place.</hi> There is indeed ſuch a glorious Place; but we know not where, or what it is. But as to the Temper and Happineſs of this Holy World, this every Good Man feels a little of in his own Breaſt. What do they do in Heaven? What do they Enjoy there? Truly they praiſe GOD; they love GOD; they ſeek their whole Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in GOD; and are perfectly conformed to his Will. And now, how can an Unconverted Man enter that glorious World? His whole Soul is bent upon Self and Creatures; here he termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, and he knows nothing further. Should ſuch a Soul but once get into the Manſions of Glory, he would be like a Swine in a Golden Palace: He'd be quite out of his Element; and long for the Puddle and the Mire again. Like <hi>Uzziah</hi> with his Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in the holy place, 2 Chron. xxvi. 20. <hi>And Azariah the chief Prieſt, and all the Prieſts looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his Forehead, and they thruſt him out from thence, yea, himſelf haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo to go out.</hi> So would be the Caſe of the Polluted Soul in the Holy Heavens. Not only would the <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Juſt Spirits drive</hi> him our from among them, but he <hi>himſelf</hi> would <hi>haſte</hi> alſo to <hi>go out.</hi> What ſhould he do there? His Soul has no turn to this Sort of Happineſs. Unmortified Luſts, and raging Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; Pride, and Senſuality, and Self-Will would be a Hell in his own Boſom, amidſt all the Glories of Heaven. His whole Nature muſt be changed; he muſt be converted, and begin a New Life, or he could never enter into that bleſſed State.

               <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured as clearly as I could, to explain and demonſtrate the Doctrine, and I come now to the Solemn Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shall not the Unconverted enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Where then ſhall they go?</hi> They muſt go ſomewhere. They are in Being, and they muſt exiſt for ever. <hi>Here</hi> they cannot always live: In a ſew Days more they muſt leave this Earth; not ſuffered to tarry by Reaſon of Death. To <hi>Heaven</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go. They have no Part there; nothing to do there; The Voice of CHRIST, like a Flaming Sword, guards the Paſſage againſt them. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, they ſhall not enter</hi> there. Well then, what will become of them! O fearful, deſtitute, ruined State! The infallible Word of GOD informs us where the miſerable Creatures muſt take up their Eternal Lodging, Matt. xxv. 46. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> Mark ix. 43.48. into <hi>the Fire that never ſhall be quenched: where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi> Rev. xiv. 10, 11. <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of</hi> GOD, <hi>which is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out without mixture, into the cup of his Indignation, and he ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and in the preſence of the Lamb; and the Smoke of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſoendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no reſt day nor night.</hi> He that overcometh, indeed, ſhall inherit all things: He that is converted and has his Nature changed, ſhall enter into the World of Glory: <hi>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and all liars, ſhall have their Part in the lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone which is the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. xxi. 7, 8. See now the Place to which the unconverted muſt go! See the gloomy Landskip of that infernal World! And O, are we not amazed? are we not in Agony, about our eſcape from this Ruin? Who can dwell with devouring Fire? who can dwell with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Burnings? Is not the Caſe awful and dreadful? And do not our Hearts quiver, and our Souls ſink and die within us. Behold, Life and Death ſet before us: Eternal Life, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire; and are they inſignificant Things! O ſtupid! O mad! if they make no Impreſſion upon us. On the one Hand we are informed, <hi>Repent and be converted, and your Sins ſhall be blotted out;</hi> and <hi>Except ye be converted ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> Nay, on the Contrary, we muſt take up our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Abode in the World of Darkneſs, and Fire, and Chains. Ah! miſerable Caſe of Unconverted Men! Who would not fear, who would not fly their Doom? And therefore,</p>

2. From what we have heard, <hi>O let us labour inſtantly after ſaving Converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye die.</hi> Conſider the matter, and debate it with your own Hearts. Converſion begins in ſerious Conſideration. <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my Feet unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> was the good old way, Pſal. cxix. 59. Let us then go alone, and put the Caſe to our ſelwes, <q>Am I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or not? What Happineſs am I purſuing; a Happineſs in the Creature, or a Happineſs in the Enjoyment of GOD? Can I think that the Poſſeſſion of any Temporal Good can make me Happy? Have I not often made the Experiment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and have I not as often been diſappointed? And why ſhould I try any more? Is it not high Time for me to <hi>turn about,</hi> and ſee if I cannot find that Happineſs in GOD, which till now I have in vain ſought for in Objects below him?</q> Propoſe theſe Queſtions to your own Souls, and ſee what anſwer your Conſcience will frame upon them.</p>
            <p>Now be convinced that you cannot give this Turn to your ſelves. Learn to feel and be ſenſible how atached to Self and Creatures you are. Mourn it and confeſs it before GOD: and tell him how undone you are without his Almighty Grace. Plead with Him in Tears and Agony to change your vile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: to turn you ſavingly to Himſelf. Be importunate, be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs till you find this done for you: Till you find a Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely forſaking the Creature and purſuing its whole Satisfaction in GOD alone. Till CHRIST appears tranſcendently dear and lovely to you; and you can joyfully leave this World to go to His Arms and his Boſom. This divine and ſaving Turn of Soul, may be given to you, as you are in the Uſe of theſe appointed Means labouring to obtain it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>O Let thoſe of us who have been converted, live becoming the Change we are under.</hi> Be thankful, be joyful: thankful to the GOD who has turn'd us, and joyful that we are paſſing to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let us labour more and more after the Heavenly Temper: Love GOD more; think on him, work for him, long and wiſh to be with him. If ever we find a prevailing Fondneſs for Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures after this; if ever we find our Wills going to rebel, or our Deſires tend to this World; let us immediately check the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affection, and ſay, <q>No, I have renounced theſe long ago. I have choſen GOD for my Portion, and his Will for my Law long ago. GOD forbid, that after having eſcaped the Snare, I ſhould be again taken and entangled therein. No, No, farewell Creatures: no more ſhall you tempt me from my true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Farewell the Riches I once coveted; the Applauſe I once graſp'd after; the Pleaſures that looked ſo charming. Farewell Felicity on Earth: and welcome the Will of my GOD: welcome Everlaſting Life. Welcome the Good Taings of Earth, which my
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003510_0026_0FF853FC90AA5F68"/>GOD pleaſes to give me: But adieu all Thoughts of Happineſs in the Poſſeſſion of theſe. Welcome Afflictions too; the Gifts of my GOD, and the Purchaſe of my SAVIOUR? Shall I receive Good at his Hands, and not receive Evil? 'Tis the Cup which my Father gives me, why ſhould I not drink it! Other Lords have had Dominion over me: But what have I any more to do with Idols?</q>
            </p>
            <p>And while are thus awakening the Piety of our own Souls, how ſhould we pity a miſerable World about us? Poor Creatures! they know not what this Love to GOD means. They never felt what it was to be reſigned to the Will of GOD, and ſwallowed up in his Love and his Praiſes. They are, as we once were, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to Senſe and Creatures; and have no Idea of Converſion and the New Birth. You may talk them eternally of theſe things; but they diſcern them not: you had as good go to explain the Myſtery of Colours to a Man born blind. Ah, Poor Men! how ſhould we pitty and pray for them: How ſhould we contrive to ſhew them their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Miſery; and labour with them to make their eſcape? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>He that converteth a Sinner from the Error of his Way, ſhall ſave a Soul from Death.</hi> Sure we never need envy them the little Good they poſſeſs: But O how ſhould we admire the Free Grace which has diſtinguiſhed us from them! There's no Room for boaſting in the Caſe. 'Tis all ſovereign, and all free: To GOD belongs the Glory; and to us Wonder, and Gratitude, and Humility.</p>
            <p>We draw on towards a Concluſion. And how can we leave off better than with a View of that Heavenly World, ſpoken of in the Text? This then ſhall be the laſt Inference from the whole.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>What a Holy and Happy Place is the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> There is not one <hi>ſinful Perſon,</hi> not one <hi>ſinful Frame</hi> in that World. The Spirits of <hi>Juſt men</hi> are <hi>made perfect</hi> before they are admitted there. Tho' the Good Man <hi>here</hi> loves GOD above all, and chooſes his Portion in him, yet this gracious Temper is often ſhock'd and broken by Temptations and Indwelling Sin. But <hi>There</hi> is no Sin, no Corruption, no Tempter. All the Employment, all the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and every Thought is about GOD and his Glories. <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luia, for the Lord GOD omnipotent reigneth;</hi> This is the Language, the Temper, the Work, the Felicity of Heaven. There, they are <hi>filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD.</hi> There, <hi>GOD is all in all.</hi> In that happy World, every Inhabitant, and every Object, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies GOD, and is filled with his Glory. His Perfections, and his Love takes them intirely up; and nothing elſe is ſeen, or heard, or thought of. O happy, happy State! The Converted Soul knows a <hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> what this means: but what it <hi>fully</hi> is, we <hi>know not now, we ſhall know hereafter. Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can the Heart of man conceive it all.</hi>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003510_0027_0FF85423350C6DD8"/>
Theſe, ye Converted Souls, are the Joys ſet before you! Theſe are the Glories, and this the Felicity reſerved in Heaven for you. Here you perceive a <hi>little Taſte</hi> of it, in your Conformity to the Will of GOD; There you ſhall ſet down to the <hi>full Feaſt,</hi> and be <hi>perfectly</hi> conformed to his Will. Here the Joy of the LORD <hi>enters into you;</hi> There <hi>you ſhall enter into the Joy of your Lord.</hi>
