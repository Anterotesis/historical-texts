            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Phaon, the admirer of Sappho, both of the isle of Lesbos, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately forsook this first object of his affections, and sat out to visit foreign countries. Sappho, after having long mourned his absence (which is the subject of one of Ovid's finest epistles) is here supposed to fall into the company of Ismenius a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who informs her that he saw the tomb of a certain Phaon in Sicily, erected to his memory by a lady of the island, and gives her the inscriptions, hinting to her that, in all probability, it belonged to the same person she bemoans. She thereupon, in a fit of rage and despair, throws herself from the famous Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian rock, and perishes in the gulph below.</p>

            <head>THE HOUSE OF NIGHT: A VISION.</head>
            <p>ADVERTISEMENT—This Poem is founded upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, inasmuch as these sacred books assert, that <hi>the last enemy that shall be conquered is Death.</hi> For the purposes of poetry he is here personified, and represented as on his dying bed. The scene is laid at a solitary palace, (the time midnight) which, tho' before beautiful and joyous, is now become sad and gloomy, as being the abode and receptacle of Death. Its owner, an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able majestic youth, who had lately lost a beloved consort, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless with a noble philosophical fortitude and humanity enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him in a friendly manner, and by employing Physicians, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to restore him to health, altho' an enemy; convinced of the excellence and propriety of that divine precept, <hi>If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink.</hi> He nevertheless, as if by a spirit of prophecy, informs this (fictitiously) wicked being of the certainty of his doom, and represents to him in a pathetic manner the vanity of his expectations, either of a reception into the abodes of the just, or continuing longer to make havock of mankind upon earth. The patient finding his end approaching, composes his epitaph, and orders it to be engraved on his tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, hinting to us thereby, that even Death and Distress have vanity; and would be remembered with honour after he is no more, altho' his whole life has been spent in deeds of devastation and murder. He dies at last in the utmost agonies of despair, after agreeing with an avaricious Undertaker to intomb his bones. This reflects upon the inhumanity of those men, who, not to mention an enemy, would scarcely cover a departed friend with a little dust, without certainty of reward for so doing. The circumstances of his funeral are then recited, and the visionary and fabulous part of the poem disappears. It conclude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <l>There endless plains the eye surveys</l>
               <l>As far from land the vessel strays;</l>
               <l>No longer hill nor dale is seen,</l>
               <l>The realms of death intrude between,</l>
               <l>But fear no ill; resolve, with me</l>
               <l>To share the dangers of the sea.</l>

               <l>Dear Thomas, I wish you would move from that town</l>
               <l>Where meet all the rebels of fame and renown;</l>
               <l>When our armies victorious shall clear that damn'd nest</l>

               <l>But again—on reflection—I beg you would stay—</l>
               <l>You may serve us yet better than if mov'd away—</l>
               <l>Give advice to Sir Harry of all that is passing,</l>
               <l>What vessels are building, what cargoes amassing;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Inform to a day when those vessels will sail</l>
               <l>That our cruisers may capture them all without fail—</l>
               <l>By proceedings like these your peace shall be made,</l>
               <l>The rebellious shall swing, but be you ne'er afraid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I cannot conceive how you do to subsist—</l>
               <l>The rebels are starving, except those who 'list,</l>
               <l>And as you reside in the land of Gomorrah,</l>
               <l>You must fare as the rest do, I think, to your sorrow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>(I mean not for you but for rebels indeed)</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The rebels must surely conclude they're undone,</l>

            <l>HAIL, great destroyer (equall'd yet by none)</l>
            <l>Of countries not thy master's, nor thine own;</l>
            <l>Hatch'd by some demon on a stormy day,</l>

            <l>To you, like him, no prospect Nature yields</l>

            <head>AN EPISTLE FROM Lord CORNWALLIS to Sir HENRY CLINTON.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>October,</hi> 1781.</head>
            <l>FROM clouds of smoke, and flames that round me glow,</l>
            <l>To you, dear Clinton, I disclose my woe:</l>
            <l>Here cannons flash, bombs glance, and bullets fly;</l>
            <l>Not Satan's self endures such misery.</l>
            <l>Was I foredoom'd, like Korah, to expire,</l>
            <l>Hurl'd to perdition in a blaze of fire?</l>
            <l>With these blue flames can mortal man contend—</l>
            <l>What arms can aid me, or what walls defend?</l>
            <l>Even to these gates last night a phantom strode,</l>
            <l>And hail'd me trembling to his dark abode:</l>
            <l>Aghast I stood, struck motionless and dumb,</l>
            <l>Seiz'd with the horrors of the world to come.</l>
            <l>WERE but my power as mighty as my rage,</l>
            <l>Far different battles would Cornwallis wage;</l>
            <l>Beneath his sword yon' threat'ning hosts should groan,</l>
            <l>The earth should quake with thunders all his own.</l>
            <l>O crocodile! had I thy flinty hide,</l>

            <l>By my own prowess would I rout the foe,</l>
            <l>With my own javelin would I work their woe—</l>
            <l>But fate's averse, and heaven's supreme decree</l>
            <l>Nile's serpent form'd more excellent than me.</l>
            <l>HAS heaven in secret for some crime decreed</l>
            <l>That I should suffer, and my soldiers bleed?</l>

               <pb n="220" facs="unknown:019658_0226_0FAC981C20F7B668"/>Or is it by the jealous skies conceal'd,</l>
            <l>That I must bend, and they ignobly yield?</l>
            <l>Ah! no—the thought o'erwhelms my soul with grief.</l>
            <l>Come, bold sir Harry, come to my relief;</l>
            <l>Come, thou brave man, whom rebels <hi>Tombstone</hi> call,</l>

            <l>Come with your ships to this disast'rous shore,</l>

            <l>Come, and lost empire o'er the deep regain,</l>
            <l>Chastise these upstarts that usurp the main:</l>
            <l>I see their first rates to the charge advance,</l>

            <l>There, undisturb'd by dogs, lord Rawdon sleeps!</l>
            <l>TIR'D with long acting on this bloody stage,</l>
            <l>Sick of the follies of a wrangling age,</l>
            <l>Come with your fleet, and help me to retire</l>
            <l>To Britain's coast, the land of my desire—</l>
            <l>For, me the foe their certain captive deem,</l>
            <l>And every school boy takes me for his theme—</l>
            <l>Long, much too long in this hard service try'd,</l>
            <l>Bespatter'd still, be-devil'd, and bely'd;</l>
            <l>With the first chance that favouring fortune sends</l>
            <l>I'll fly, converted, from this land of fiends:</l>
            <l>Convinc'd, for me, she has no gems in store,</l>

            <l>Constrain'd to shun the bold theatric show,</l>
            <l>To act long tragedies of real woe,</l>
            <l>Heroes, once more attend the comic muse;</l>
            <l>Forget our failings, and our faults excuse.</l>
            <l>IN that fine language is our fable drest</l>
            <l>Which still unrivall'd reigns o'er all the rest;</l>

               <l>(And they have been curious beyond all comparison)</l>
               <l>He now must go home, at the call of his king,</l>
               <l>To answer the charges that Arnold may bring.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But what are the acts that this chief has atchiev'd?—</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Sir Clinton, thy deeds have been mighty and many,</l>
               <l>You said all our <hi>paper</hi> was not worth a penny,</l>
               <l>('Tis nothing but rags <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Letter to Gen. Parsons.</note>, quoth honest Will. Tryon,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But Clinton thought thus—"It is folly to sight,</l>

               <l>Returning to York with your ships and your plunder,</l>

               <l>The first thing that struck you as soon as you landed</l>
               <l>Was the fortress at West Point, where Arnold command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thought you, "If friend Arnold this fort will deliver,</l>

            <head>SIR GUY's ANSWER.</head>

               <l>WE have reason to think there will soon be a peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>And that war with the rebels will certainly cease;</l>

               <l>That as matters are changing we soon may change too;</l>

               <l>Though the war should continue, yet <hi>we</hi> may depart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Four offers in season I therefore propose,</l>
               <l>(As much as I can do in reason, God knows)</l>
               <l>In which, though there be not too plentiful carving,</l>
               <l>There still is sufficient to keep you from starving;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>And, first, of the first, it would mightily charm me</l>
               <l>To see you, my children, <hi>enlist in the army,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or <hi>enter the navy,</hi> and get for your pay</l>
               <l>A <hi>farthing</hi> an hour, which is <hi>sixpence</hi> per day—</l>
               <l>There's Hector M'Lean and Arthur O'Gregor</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If these do not suit you, then take your new plan,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Make your peace with the rebels</hi> (that is, if you can)</l>
               <l>There rank and distinction perhaps you may find</l>
               <l>And rise into offices fit to your mind—</l>

            <l>Who from twelve numbers down to eight decreas'd,</l>

            <l>Then rush'd abroad, a Jesuit in disguise,</l>
            <l>Borne on the wings of malice, rage, and lies,</l>
            <l>To this new world a nuisance and a pest</l>

            <l>And take off the soldiers that serve for our guard,</l>

            <l>Yet still I surmise, for aught I can see,</l>
            <l>No Congress or <hi>Senates</hi> would meddle with me.</l>

            <l>Was I to be blam'd if the king offer'd most?</l>
            <l>The King's Royal Printer!—Five hundred a year!</l>
            <l>Between you and me 'twas a handsome affair:</l>
            <l>Who would not for <hi>that</hi> give matters a stretch</l>
            <l>And lie back and forward, and carry and fetch,</l>

            <l>Live on them a week, and you'll find they're but nonsense.</l>
            <l>THE late news from Charleston my mind has perplext.</l>
            <l>If that is abandon'd, I know what goes next:</l>
            <l>This city of York is a place of great note,</l>
            <l>And that we should hold it I now give my vote;</l>

            <l>These people at helm steer us just where they please,</l>

            <l>They'll steer us at last to the devil, I think:</l>
            <l>And though in the danger themselves have a share,</l>
            <l>It will do us small good that they also go there.</l>

               <pb n="312" facs="unknown:019658_0318_0FAC9C81E15B2F40"/>IT is true that the Tories, their children and wives</l>

            <l>And gain to themselves an immortal renown</l>

            <l>In truth we should be in a very fine box,</l>

            </l>
            <l>To sing like the Jews at the river Euphrates,</l>

            <l>And he that goes there (though I mean to be civil)</l>

            <l>FOLKS may think as they please, but to me it would seem,</l>
            <l>That our great men at home have done nothing but dream:</l>
            <l>Such trimming and twisting and shifting about,</l>
            <l>And some getting in, and others turn'd out;</l>

               <pb n="314" facs="unknown:019658_0320_0FAC9C8361129550"/>And yet, with their bragging and looking so big,</l>
            <l>All they did was to dance a theatrical jig:</l>
            <l>Seven years now, and more, we have try'd every plan,</l>
            <l>And are just as near conquering as when we began,</l>
            <l>Great things were expected from Clinton and Howe,</l>
            <l>But what have they done, or where are they now?</l>
            <l>Sir Guy was sent over to kick up a dust,</l>

            <l>The object delusive we wish to attain</l>
            <l>Has been in our reach, and may be so again—</l>
            <l>But so oddly does heaven its bounties dispense,</l>
            <l>And has granted our king such a small share of sense</l>
            <l>That, let Fortune favour or smile as she will,</l>
            <l>We are doom'd to drive on like a horse in a mill,</l>

            <l>'Tis but to return to where we sat out.</l>
            <l>FROM hence I infer (by way of improvement)</l>
            <l>That nothing is got by this circular movement;</l>
            <l>And I plainly perceive, from this fatal delay,</l>
            <l>We are going to ruin the round-about way!</l>
            <l>Some nations, like ships, give up to the gale,</l>

            <l>OUR parson last Sunday brought tears from my eyes,</l>

            <l>(As if he had been in its <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi>)</l>
            <l>Recounted its beauties that never shall fade,</l>

               <l>BY the side of the sea, in a cottage obscure,</l>
               <l>There liv'd an old fellow nam'd Charlot Boncoeur,</l>
               <l>Who was free to his neighbour and good to the poor,</l>
               <l>Catching fish was his trade,</l>
               <l>And all people said,</l>
               <l>That mischief to nothing but fish he design'd,</l>
               <l>To all <hi>people</hi> else he was candid and kind.</l>

            <lg n="2">
               <head>2.</head>
               <l>One day as he went to the brink of the lake,</l>
               <l>Persuading the fishes their dinner to take,</l>
               <l>(The last he intended they ever should make)</l>
               <l>While his hooks he employ'd to their sorrow and woe,</l>
               <l>A grunting he heard in the waters below,</l>
               <l>And casting his eye to the bottom (for here</l>
               <l>We'll suppose that the water was perfectly clear)</l>
               <l>He saw on the bed of the liquid profound</l>
               <l>An unfortunate wight who was drowning, or drown'd.</l>

               <l>That the man to the surface once more might ascend,</l>
               <l>He took up his pole, with a hook at the end,</l>
               <l>And to it he fell,</l>
               <l>And manag'd so well,</l>
               <l>That soon to the margin the carcase was drawn,</l>
               <l>And who should it be but his old neighbour John!</l>

                  <pb n="361" facs="unknown:019658_0367_0FAEE0DA0F406B40"/>Now, some how or other, it popp'd in his head,</l>
               <l>That in spite of his drowning the man was not dead,</l>
               <l>And while he was thinking what means to devise</l>
               <l>That his friend might recover and open his eyes,</l>
               <l>He saw, with vexation and sorrow, no doubt,</l>

                  </gap>—</l>
               <l>However, convinc'd, from what he had heard,</l>
               <l>That John might be living for aught that appear'd;</l>
               <l>To his cottage he took him, and there had him bled,</l>
               <l>Rubb'd, roll'd on a barrel, and then put to bed.</l>
               <l>So in less than a week (to his praise be it said)</l>
               <l>In less than a week the man was as found</l>
               <l>(Excepting the loss of his eye, and the wound)</l>

               <l>And forgetting what service his neighbour had done him,</l>
               <l>Went off to a lawyer, and clapt a writ on him,</l>
               <l>Talk'd much of the value of what he had lost,</l>
               <l>That Charlot must pay all the damage and cost,</l>
               <l>And if with such sentence he would not comply,</l>

               <l>That Charlot was vex'd, we hardly need say,</l>

               <l>"That the action was wrought without malice propense,</l>

               <l>To purchase his life with the loss of an eye—</l>

                  <pb n="362" facs="unknown:019658_0368_0FAEE0DAD1C61068"/>That the loss of an eye was a serious affair</l>
               <l>Was certain—and yet he'd be bold to declare,</l>
               <l>That the man who can shew but one eye in his head,</l>
               <l>Is better by far than a man that is dead."</l>

               <l>In answer to all the defendant's fine pleading,</l>

               <l>The lawyers and judges were all at a stand</l>

               <l>'Till a half-witted fellow, who chanc'd to be there,</l>
               <l>Undertook to decide on this weighty affair,</l>
               <l>And cry'd, "Can you doubt in a case that's so plain</l>
               <l>Be guided by me, and you'll ne'er doubt again:</l>
               <l>The plea of the plaintiff rests wholly on this;</l>
               <l>In fishing him up he takes it amiss,</l>
               <l>That Charlot manoeuvred with so little skill,</l>
               <l>So aukwardly fumbled and manag'd so ill</l>
               <l>As thus with his bungling to ruin John's look,</l>
               <l>And put out an eye with the point of his hook—</l>
               <l>Well, now, my lord judges, attend my decree,</l>
               <l>Straitway let the plaintiff be thrown in the sea,</l>
               <l>And after reposing a while on the bottom,</l>
               <l>If he get out alone from where Charlot got him,</l>
               <l>Safe, sound, and undamag'd—why, then 'tis my sentence</l>
               <l>That Charlot be punish'd and brought to repentance;</l>
               <l>But if, after gasping and flouncing about,</l>
               <l>He drowns in the water, and never gets out,</l>

                  <pb n="363" facs="unknown:019658_0369_0FAEE0DB8EBC6A48"/>Why, then, it is justice, it must be confest,</l>
               <l>That Charlot forthwith be discharg'd from arrest,</l>
               <l>Absolv'd from all punishment due to the wound,</l>
               <l>And paid in the bargain, 'cause John was not drown'd."</l>

            <head type="sub">1785.</head>
            <l>THE reign of old Saturn is highly renown'd</l>
            <l>For many fine things that no longer are found,</l>
            <l>Trees always in blossom, men free from all pains,</l>
            <l>And shepherds as mild as the sheep on their plains.</l>
            <l>In the midland Equator, dispensing his sway,</l>
            <l>The Sun, they pretended, pursu'd his bright way,</l>
            <l>Not rambled, unsteady, to regions remote,</l>
            <l>To talk, once a-year, with the <hi>crab</hi> and the <hi>goat.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>From a motion like this, have the sages explain'd,</l>
            <l>How summer for ever her empire maintain'd;</l>
            <l>While the turf of the fields by the plough was unbroke,</l>
            <l>And a house for the shepherd, the shade of the oak.</l>
            <l>YET some say there never was seen on this stage</l>
            <l>What poets affirm of that innocent <hi>age,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When the brutal creation from bondage was free,</l>
            <l>And men were exactly what mankind should be.</l>
            <l>But why should they labour to prove it a dream?—</l>
            <l>The poets of old were in love with the theme,</l>
            <l>And, leaving to others mere truth to repeat,</l>
            <l>In the regions of fancy they found it complete.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="374" facs="unknown:019658_0380_0FAEE0E6E16E70F0"/>THREE ages have been on this globe, they pretend;</l>
            <l>And the fourth, some have thought, is to be without end;</l>
            <l>The first was of Gold—But a fifth, <hi>we</hi> will say,</l>
            <l>Has already begun, and is now on its way.</l>
            <l>Since the days of Arcadia, if ever there shin'd</l>
            <l>A ray of the first on the heads of mankind,</l>
            <l>Let critics dispute—but with us it is clear,</l>
            <l>That the aera of PAPER was realiz'd <hi>here.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>FOUR ages, however, at least have been told,</l>
            <l>The first is compar'd to the purest of <hi>Gold</hi>—</l>
            <l>But, as bad luck would have it, its circles were few,</l>
            <l>And the next was of <hi>Silver</hi>—if Ovid says true.</l>
            <l>But this, like the former, did rapidly pass—</l>
            <l>While that which came after was nothing but <hi>Brass</hi>—</l>
            <l>An age of mere tinkers—and when it was lost,</l>
            <l>Old <hi>Iron</hi> succeeded—we know to our cost.</l>

            <l>The <hi>stuff</hi> might be chang'd, but the <hi>staff</hi> would remain.</l>
            <l>The lawyer would still find a client to fleece,</l>

            <l>The parson, some hundreds of hearers prepar'd</l>

               <l>When you march'd into York all in battle array,</l>

            <l>ACCORDING to custom, once more I appear</l>
            <l>With the verse you expect at the dawn of the year:</l>
            <l>For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> we have got into EIGHTY AND THREE;</l>
            <l>And in spite of proud Britain, are happy and free.</l>
            <l>If the times have been hard, and our commerce gone wrong,</l>
            <l>We still have been able to struggle along.</l>
            <l>If some, through misfortunes, are slack in the purse,</l>
            <l>It is not so bad but it might have been worse.—</l>
            <l>Great things, the year past, were reveal'd to our eyes:</l>
            <l>The Dutch have confess'd us their friends and allies,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="382" facs="unknown:019658_0388_0FAEE0F0CDC0A910"/>And humbled the pride of our haughty invaders,</l>
            <l>By fighting their fleets and destroying their traders,</l>
            <l>If the English succeeded in taking the COUNT,</l>
            <l>To what, in the end, did their conquest amount?</l>

            <l>It but sav'd them from ruin—not ruin'd our cause.</l>
            <l>BUT leaving the weight of political cares</l>
            <l>To those, who are plac'd at the helm of affairs,</l>
            <l>To the humours of fortune in all things resign'd,</l>
            <l>I mean by my visit to put you in mind,</l>
            <l>That, as true as a clock, both early and late,</l>
            <l>With the news of the day I have knock'd at your gate,</l>
            <l>And gave you to know what the world was a doing,</l>
            <l>What LOUIS intended, or GEORGE was a brewing.</l>
            <l>If sometimes the papers were trifling and flat,</l>
            <l>And the news went against us,—I cou'dn't help that;</l>
            <l>If parties were angry, and vented their spite,</l>
            <l>I bro't you their wranglings—not help'd them to write.</l>
            <l>I therefore presume (and not without reason)</l>
            <l>You'll remember your NEWSMAN, and think of the season;</l>
            <l>The markets are high, and the weather is cold;</l>
            <l>No <hi>party</hi> I serve, and no <hi>pension</hi> I hold.</l>
            <l>We Hawkers are men, and have children and wives</l>
            <l>To comfort our hearts, and to solace our lives:</l>
            <l>But if I say more, you'll think it is stuff;</l>
            <l>And <hi>a word to the wise is,</hi> in reason, <hi>enough.</hi>

            <l>Though on the land our foes we beat,</l>

            <l>THE American world, as our histories say,</l>
            <l>Secluded from Europe long centuries lay,</l>
            <l>But peopled by beings whom white men detest,</l>
            <l>The sons of the Tartars that came from the west.</l>
            <l>These Indians, 'tis certain, were here long before ye all,</l>
            <l>And dwelt in their wigwams from time immemorial;</l>
            <l>In a mere state of nature, untutor'd, untaught,</l>
            <l>They did as they pleas'd, and they spoke as they thought—</l>
            <l>No priests they had then for the <hi>cure</hi> of their souls,</l>
            <l>No lawyers, recorders, nor keepers of rolls;</l>
            <l>No learned physicians vile <hi>nostrums</hi> conceal'd—</l>
            <l>Their druggist was nature—her shop was the field.</l>
            <l>In the midst of their forests how happy and blest,</l>
            <l>In the skin of a bear or a buffalo drest!</l>
            <l>No care to perplex, and no luxury seen</l>
            <l>But the feast, and the song, and the dance on the green.</l>
            <l>Some bow'd to the moon, and some worshipp'd the sun,</l>
            <l>And the king and the captain were center'd in one;</l>
            <l>In a cabin they met on their councils of state,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>age</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> alone might debate:</l>
            <l>With quibbles they never essay'd to beguile,</l>
            <l>And nature had taught them the orator's stile;</l>
            <l>No pomp they affected, nor quaintly refin'd</l>
            <l>The nervous idea that glanc'd on the mind.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="399" facs="unknown:019658_0405_0FAC9BE8E0CF3F08"/>When hunting or battle invited to arms,</l>
            <l>The women they left to take care of their farms—</l>
            <l>The toils of the summer did winter repay,</l>
            <l>While snug in their cabins they snor'd it away.</l>
            <l>If death came among them his dues to demand,</l>
            <l>They still had some prospect of comfort at hand—</l>
            <l>The dead man they sent to the regions of bliss,</l>
            <l>With his bottle and dog, and his fair maids to kiss.</l>
            <l>THUS happy they dwelt in a rural domain,</l>
            <l>Uninstructed in commerce, unpractis'd in gain,</l>
            <l>Till, taught by the loadstone to traverse the seas,</l>
            <l>Columbus came over, that bold Genoese.</l>
            <l>From records authentic, the date we can shew,</l>
            <l>One thousand four hundred and ninety and two</l>
            <l>Years, borne by the seasons, had vanish'd away,</l>
            <l>Since the <hi>babe</hi> in the manger at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> lay.</l>
            <l>What an aera was this, above all that had pass'd,</l>
            <l>To yield such a treasure, discover'd at last—</l>
            <l>A new world, in value exceeding the old,</l>
            <l>Such mountains of silver, such torrents of gold!</l>
            <l>Yet the schemes of Columbus, however well plann'd</l>
            <l>Were scarcely sufficient to find the main land;</l>
            <l>On the <hi>islands</hi> alone with the natives he spoke,</l>
            <l>Except when he enter'd the great <hi>Oronoque:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In this he resembled old Moses, the Jew,</l>
            <l>Who, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,</l>
            <l>When at length the <hi>reward</hi> was no longer deny'd</l>
            <l>From the top of Mount Pisgah he saw <hi>it</hi> and dy'd.</l>
            <l>These islands and worlds in the wat'ry expanse,</l>
            <l>Like most mighty things, were the offspring of chance,</l>
            <l>Since, steering for Asia, Columbus, they say,</l>
            <l>Was astonish'd to find such a world in his way!</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="400" facs="unknown:019658_0406_0FAC9BE9A403AE48"/>No wonder, indeed, he was smit with surprize—</l>
            <l>This empire of nature was new to their eyes—</l>
            <l>Cut short in their course by so splendid a scene,</l>
            <l>Such a region of wonders intruding between!</l>
            <l>YET great as he was, and deserving, no doubt,</l>
            <l>We have only to thank him for finding the rout;</l>
            <l>These climes to the northward, more stormy and cold,</l>
            <l>Were reserv'd for the efforts of CABOT the bold.</l>
            <l>WHERE the sun in December appears to decline</l>
            <l>Far off to the southward, and south of the line,</l>
            <l>A merchant <note n="*" place="bottom">Americus Vespucius.</note> of Florence, more fortunate still,</l>
            <l>Explor'd a new track, and discover'd Brazil:</l>
            <l>Good Fortune, <hi>Vespucius,</hi> pronounc'd thee her own,</l>
            <l>Or else to mankind thou hadst scarcely been known—</l>
            <l>By giving thy name, thou art ever renown'd—</l>
            <l>Thy <hi>name</hi> to a world that another had found!</l>
            <l>COLUMBIA the name was that Merit decreed,</l>
            <l>But Fortune and Merit have never agreed—</l>
            <l>Yet the poets, alone, with commendable care</l>
            <l>Are vainly attempting the wrong to repair.</l>
            <l>THE bounds I prescribe to my verse are too narrow</l>
            <l>To tell of the conquests of <hi>Francis Pizarro</hi>;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Cortez</hi> 'tis needless to bring into view,</l>
            <l>One Mexico conquer'd, the other Peru.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Montezuma</hi> with credit in verse might be read,</l>
            <l>But Dryden has told you the monarch <note n="†" place="bottom">Indian Emperor, a tragedy.</note> is dead!</l>
            <l>And the woes of his subjects—what torments they bore,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>De Casas,</hi> good bishop, has mention'd before:</l>

            <l>The annals of Death, and the triumphs of Spain.</l>
            <l>Poor <hi>Ata-bualpa</hi> I cannot forget—</l>
            <l>He gave them his utmost—yet died in their debt,</l>
            <l>His wealth was a crime that they could not forgive,</l>
            <l>And when they possess'd it—forbade him to live.</l>
            <l>Foredoom'd to misfortunes (that come not alone)</l>
            <l>He was the twelfth In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a that sat on the throne,</l>

            <l>At the palace of <hi>Cusco</hi> confin'd him in chains.</l>
            <l>BUT what am I talking—or where do I roam?</l>
            <l>'Tis time that our story was brought nearer home—</l>
            <l>From Florida's cape did <hi>Cabot</hi> explore</l>
            <l>To the fast frozen region of cold <hi>Labradore.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In the year fourteen hundred and ninety and eight</l>
            <l>He came, as the annals of England relate,</l>
            <l>But finding no gold in the lengthy domain,</l>
            <l>And coasting the country, he left it again.</l>
            <l>Next <hi>Davis</hi>—then <hi>Hudson</hi> adventur'd, they say,</l>
            <l>One found out a <hi>streight,</hi> and the other a <hi>bay,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whose desolate region, or turbulent wave</l>
            <l>One present bestow'd <hi>him</hi>—and that was a grave.</l>
            <l>IN the reign of a virgin (whom some call a whore)</l>
            <l>Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh in squadrons came o'er—</l>
            <l>While Barlow and Grenville succeeded to these,</l>
            <l>Who all brought their colonies over the seas.</l>
            <l>These, left in a wilderness teeming with woes,</l>
            <l>The natives, suspicious, concluded them foes,</l>
            <l>And murder'd them all without notice or warning,</l>
            <l>Ralph Lane, with his vagabonds, scarcely returning.</l>

               <pb n="402" facs="unknown:019658_0408_0FAC9BEB2123CF78"/>IN the reign of king James (and the first of the name)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>George Summers</hi> with <hi>Hacluit</hi> to Chesapeake came,</l>
            <l>Where far in the forests, not doom'd to renown,</l>
            <l>On the river Powhatan <note n="*" place="bottom">James River, Virginia.</note> they built the first town. <note n="†" place="bottom">James Town.</note>
            </l>
            <l>TWELVE years after this, some scores of Dissenters</l>
            <l>To the northernmost district came, seeking adventures;</l>
            <l>Outdone by the bishops, those great faggot fighters,</l>
            <l>They left them to hell with their cassocks and mitres.</l>
            <l>Thus banish'd forever, and leaving the sod,</l>
            <l>The first land they saw was the pitch of Cape Cod,</l>
            <l>Where famish'd with hunger and quaking with cold</l>
            <l>They plann'd their new Plymouth—so call'd from the old.</l>
            <l>They were, without doubt, a delightful collection;—</l>
            <l>Some came to be rid of a Stuart's direction,</l>
            <l>Some sail'd with a view to dominion and riches,</l>
            <l>Some to pray without book, and a few to hang witches.</l>
            <l>Some came, on the Indians to shed a new light,</l>
            <l>Convinc'd long before that their own must be right,</l>
            <l>And that all who had died in the centuries past</l>

            <l>Set out for <hi>Rhode-Island,</hi> to think as they pleas'd.</l>
            <l>Some hundreds to Britain ran murmuring home—</l>
            <l>While others went off in the forests to roam,</l>
            <l>When they found they had miss'd what they look'd for at first,</l>
            <l>The downfal of sin, and the reign of the just.</l>

            <l>Ah, sweet recollection of juvenile dreams</l>
            <l>In the groves, and the forests that skirted his streams!</l>
            <l>How often, with rapture, those streams were survey'd</l>
            <l>When, sick of the city, I flew to the shade—</l>
            <l>How often the bard, and the peasant shall mourn</l>
            <l>Ere those groves shall revive, and those shades shall return!</l>
            <l>Not a hill, but some fortress disfigures it round!</l>
            <l>And ramparts are rais'd where the cottage was found!</l>
            <l>The plains and the vallies with ruin are spread,</l>
            <l>With graves in abundance, and bones of the dead.</l>
            <l>The first that attempted to enter this <hi>streight</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(In <hi>anno</hi> one thousand, six hundred, and eight)</l>
            <l>Was HUDSON (the same that we mention'd before,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="407" facs="unknown:019658_0413_0FAC9BEEE0E13898"/>Who was lost in the gulph that he went to explore.)</l>
            <l>For a sum that they paid him (we know not how much)</l>
            <l>This captain transferr'd all his right to the Dutch;</l>
            <l>For the <hi>time</hi> has been here, to the world be it known,</l>
            <l>When all a man sail'd by, or saw, was his own.</l>
            <l>The Dutch on their purchase sat quietly down,</l>
            <l>And fix'd on an <hi>island</hi> to lay out a town;</l>
            <l>They modell'd their streets from the horns of a ram,</l>
            <l>And the name that best pleas'd them was, <hi>New Amsterdam.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They purchas'd large tracts from the Indians for beads,</l>
            <l>And sadly tormented some runaway Swedes,</l>
            <l>Who, none knows for what, from their country had flown</l>
            <l>To live here in peace, undisturb'd and alone.</l>
            <l>NEW BELGIA, the Dutch call'd their province, be sure,</l>
            <l>But names never yet made possession secure,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Charly</hi> (the second that honour'd the name)</l>
            <l>Sent over a squadron, asserting his claim.</l>
            <l>(Had his <hi>sword</hi> and his <hi>title</hi> been equally slender,</l>
            <l>In vain had they summon'd Mynheer to surrender)</l>
            <l>The soil they demanded, or threaten'd their worst,</l>
            <l>Insisting that <hi>Cabot had look'd at it first.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The want of a squadron to fall on their rear</l>
            <l>Made the argument perfectly plain to Mynheer—</l>
            <l>Force ended the contest—the right was a sham,</l>
            <l>And the Dutch were sent packing to hot SURINAM.</l>
            <l>'Twas hard to be thus of their labours depriv'd,</l>
            <l>But the age of republics had not yet arriv'd—</l>
            <l>Fate saw—tho' no wizzard could tell them as much—</l>
            <l>That the crown, in due time, was to fare like the Dutch.</l>
