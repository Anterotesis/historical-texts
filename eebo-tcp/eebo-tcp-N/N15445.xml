            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Phaon, the admirer of Sappho, both of the isle of Lesbos, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately forsook this first object of his affections, and sat out to visit foreign countries. Sappho, after having long mourned his absence (which is the subject of one of Ovid's finest epistles) is here supposed to fall into the company of Ismenius a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who informs her that he saw the tomb of a certain Phaon in Sicily, erected to his memory by a lady of the island, and gives her the inscriptions, hinting to her that, in all probability, it belonged to the same person she bemoans. She thereupon, in a fit of rage and despair, throws herself from the famous Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian rock, and perishes in the gulph below.</p>

            <head>THE HOUSE OF NIGHT: A VISION.</head>
            <p>ADVERTISEMENTâ€”This Poem is founded upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, inasmuch as these sacred books assert, that <hi>the last enemy that shall be conquered is Death.</hi> For the purposes of poetry he is here personified, and represented as on his dying bed. The scene is laid at a solitary palace, (the time midnight) which, tho' before beautiful and joyous, is now become sad and gloomy, as being the abode and receptacle of Death. Its owner, an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able majestic youth, who had lately lost a beloved consort, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless with a noble philosophical fortitude and humanity enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him in a friendly manner, and by employing Physicians, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to restore him to health, altho' an enemy; convinced of the excellence and propriety of that divine precept, <hi>If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink.</hi> He nevertheless, as if by a spirit of prophecy, informs this (fictitiously) wicked being of the certainty of his doom, and represents to him in a pathetic manner the vanity of his expectations, either of a reception into the abodes of the just, or continuing longer to make havock of mankind upon earth. The patient finding his end approaching, composes his epitaph, and orders it to be engraved on his tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, hinting to us thereby, that even Death and Distress have vanity; and would be remembered with honour after he is no more, altho' his whole life has been spent in deeds of devastation and murder. He dies at last in the utmost agonies of despair, after agreeing with an avaricious Undertaker to intomb his bones. This reflects upon the inhumanity of those men, who, not to mention an enemy, would scarcely cover a departed friend with a little dust, without certainty of reward for so doing. The circumstances of his funeral are then recited, and the visionary and fabulous part of the poem disappears. It conclude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <l>For this destruction threatens from the skies;</l>
               <l>See hostile navies to our ruin rise;</l>
               <l>Our fleets inglorious shun the force of Spain,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>DEAR Sir, I am so anxious to hear of your health,</l>
               <l>I beg you would send me a letter by stealth:</l>
               <l>I hope a few months will quite alter the case,</l>
               <l>When the wars are concluded we'll meet and embrace.</l>

               <l>For I'm led to believe from our brilliant success,</l>
               <l>And what is as clear, your amazing distress,</l>
               <l>That the cause of rebellion has met with a check</l>
               <l>That will bring all its patrons to hang by the neck.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Cornwallis has manag'd so well in the South</l>
               <l>That those rebels want victuals to put in their mouth,</l>
               <l>And Arnold has stript them, we hear, to the buffâ€”</l>
               <l>Has burnt their tobacco, and left themâ€”the snuff.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Dear Thomas, I wish you would move from that town</l>
               <l>Where meet all the rebels of fame and renown;</l>
               <l>When our armies victorious shall clear that damn'd nest</l>
               <l>You may chance, though a Tory, to swing with the rest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But againâ€”on reflectionâ€”I beg you would stayâ€”</l>
               <l>You may serve us yet better than if mov'd awayâ€”</l>
               <l>Give advice to Sir Harry of all that is passing,</l>
               <l>What vessels are building, what cargoes amassing;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Inform to a day when those vessels will sail</l>
               <l>That our cruisers may capture them all without failâ€”</l>
               <l>By proceedings like these your peace shall be made,</l>
               <l>The rebellious shall swing, but be you ne'er afraid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I cannot conceive how you do to subsistâ€”</l>
               <l>The rebels are starving, except those who 'list,</l>
               <l>And as you reside in the land of Gomorrah,</l>
               <l>You must fare as the rest do, I think, to your sorrow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Poor souls! if ye knew what a doom is decreed,</l>
               <l>(I mean not for you but for rebels indeed)</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The rebels must surely conclude they're undone,</l>

               <hi>October,</hi> 1781.</head>
            <l>FROM clouds of smoke, and flames that round me glow,</l>
            <l>To you, dear Clinton, I disclose my woe:</l>
            <l>Here cannons flash, bombs glance, and bullets fly;</l>
            <l>Not Satan's self endures such misery.</l>
            <l>Was I foredoom'd, like Korah, to expire,</l>

            <l>With these blue flames can mortal man contendâ€”</l>

            <l>Beneath his sword yon' threat'ning hosts should groan,</l>
            <l>The earth should quake with thunders all his own.</l>

            <l>HAS heaven in secret for some crime decreed</l>

            <l>Forget our failings, and our faults excuse.</l>

               <l>That as matters are changing we soon may change too;</l>

               <l>In which, though there be not too plentiful carving,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Or <hi>enter the navy,</hi> and get for your pay</l>

            <lg>
               <l>If these do not suit you, then take your new plan,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Make your peace with the rebels</hi> (that is, if you can)</l>

            <l>Be-rebel'd, be-devil'd, and told them their own,</l>

            <l>So evacuation I'll mention the first:</l>
            <l>If Carleton should sail for our dear native shore</l>
            <l>(As Clinton, Cornwallis, and Howe did before)</l>
            <l>And take off the soldiers that serve for our guard,</l>
            <l>(A step that the Tories would think rather hard)</l>
            <l>Yet still I surmise, for aught I can see,</l>
            <l>No Congress or <hi>Senates</hi> would meddle with me.</l>
            <l>FOR what have I done, when we come to consider<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </l>
            <l>But sold my commodities to the best bidder?</l>
            <l>If I offer'd to lie for the sake of a post,</l>
            <l>Was I to be blam'd if the king offer'd most?</l>
            <l>The King's Royal Printer!â€”Five hundred a year!</l>
            <l>Between you and me 'twas a handsome affair:</l>
            <l>Who would not for <hi>that</hi> give matters a stretch</l>
            <l>And lie back and forward, and carry and fetch,</l>
            <l>May have some pretensions to <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>fame:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But what are they both but the sound of a name,</l>
            <l>Mere words to deceive us, as I have sound long since,</l>
            <l>Live on them a week, and you'll find they're but nonsense.</l>
            <l>THE late news from Charleston my mind has perplext.</l>
            <l>If that is abandon'd, I know what goes next:</l>
            <l>This city of York is a place of great note,</l>
            <l>And that we should hold it I now give my vote;</l>
            <l>But what are our votes against Shelburne's decrees?</l>
            <l>These people at helm steer us just where they please,</l>
            <l>So often they've had us all hands on the brink,</l>
            <l>They'll steer us at last to the devil, I think:</l>
            <l>And though in the danger themselves have a share,</l>
            <l>It will do us small good that they also go there.</l>

               <pb n="312" facs="unknown:019658_0318_0FAC9C81E15B2F40"/>IT is true that the Tories, their children and wives</l>

            <l>And gain to themselves an immortal renown</l>
            <l>By ALL turning soldiers, and keeping the town:</l>
            <l>Whoe'er was the Tory that struck out the plan,</l>

            <l>In truth we should be in a very fine box,</l>

            <l>ON the faith of a Printer, things look very blackâ€”</l>

            <l>Shall we quit our young princes and full blooded peers,</l>
            <l>And bow down to Viscounts and French Chevaliers?</l>
            <l>Perhaps you will say, "As the very last shift</l>

            <l>GOOD folks, do your willâ€”but I vow and I swear,</l>

            <l>(From accounts that I've had) there is not such another;</l>
            <l>It neither belongs to this world or the other:</l>
            <l>A savour they think it to send us there <hi>gratis</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To sing like the Jews at the river Euphrates,</l>
            <l>And, after surmounting the rage of the billows,</l>

               <pb n="313" facs="unknown:019658_0319_0FAC9C82A1DC0F70"/>Hang ourselves up at last with our harps on the willows:</l>
            <l>Ere I sail for that shore may I take my last napâ€”</l>
            <l>Why, it gives me the palsy to look on its map!</l>
            <l>And he that goes there (though I mean to be civil)</l>
            <l>May fairly be said to have gone to the Devil.</l>
            <l>SHALL I push for Old England, and whine at the throne?</l>
            <l>Alas, they have JEMMIES enough of their own!</l>
            <l>Besides, such a name I have got from my trade,</l>
            <l>They would think I was lying, whatever I said;</l>
            <l>Thus scheme as I will, or contrive as I may,</l>
            <l>Continual difficulties rise in the way:</l>
            <l>In short, if they let me remain in this realm,</l>
            <l>What is it to Jemmy who stands at the helm?</l>
            <l>I'll petition the rebels (if York is forsaken)</l>
            <l>For a place in their Zion which ne'er shall be shaken;</l>
            <l>I am sure they'll be clever: it seems their whole study:</l>
            <l>They hung not young ASGILL for old captain HUDDY,</l>
            <l>And it must be a truth that admits no denying,</l>
            <l>If they spare us for MURDER they'll spare us for LYING.</l>

            <l>Seven years now, and more, we have try'd every plan,</l>

                  <l>TO the <hi>Senate</hi> of York, with all due submission,</l>
                  <l>Of honest HUGH GAINE the humble <hi>Petition;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>An <hi>Account of his Life</hi> he will also prefix,</l>
                  <l>And some trifles that happened in seventy-six;</l>

               <l>AND, first, he informs, in his representation,</l>
               <l>That he once was a printer of some reputation,</l>
               <l>And dwelt in the street call'd Hanover Square,</l>
               <l>(You'll know where it is if you ever was there)</l>
               <l>Next door to the drug shop of doctor Brownejohn,</l>
               <l>(Who now to the dog-house of Pluto is gone)</l>
               <l>But what do I talkâ€”who e'er came to town,</l>
               <l>And knew not HUGH GAINE at the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>NOW, if I were ever so given to lie,</l>
               <l>My dear native country I would n't deny;</l>
               <l>(I know you love Teagues) and I shall not conceal</l>
               <l>That I came from the kingdom where Phelim O'Neale</l>
               <l>And other brave worthies ate butter and cheese,</l>
               <l>And walk'd in the clover fields up to their knees:</l>
               <l>Full early in youth, without basket or burden,</l>
               <l>With a staff in my hand I pass'd over Jordan,</l>
               <l>(I remember my comrade was doctor Magraw,</l>
               <l>And many strange things on the waters we saw,</l>
               <l>Sharks, dolphins, and sea-dogs, bonettas, and whales,</l>
               <l>And birds at the tropic with quills in their tails)</l>
               <l>And came to your city and government seat,</l>
               <l>And found it was true you had something to eat;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="318" facs="unknown:019658_0324_0FAC9C86616EAB88"/>When thus I wrote homeâ€”"The country is good,</l>
               <l>"They have plenty of victuals and plenty of wood:</l>
               <l>"The people are kind, and, whate'er they may think,</l>
               <l>"I shall make it appear I can swim where they'll sink;</l>
               <l>"And yet they're so brisk, and so full of good cheer,</l>
               <l>"By my soul I suspect they have always new year,</l>
               <l>"And therefore conceive <hi>it is good to be here:</hi>"</l>
               <l>SO said, and so actedâ€”I put up a press,</l>
               <l>And printed away with amazing success;</l>
               <l>Neglected my person, and look'd like a fright,</l>
               <l>Was bother'd all day, and was busy all night,</l>
               <l>Saw money come in as the papers went out,</l>
               <l>While Parker and Weyman <note n="*" place="bottom">New-York Printers.</note> were driving about,</l>
               <l>And cursing, and swearing, and chewing their cuds,</l>
               <l>And wishing Hugh Gaine and his press in the suds,</l>

               <l>For he swore I had found the philosopher's stone,</l>
               <l>And call'd me a rogue and a son of a bitch,</l>
               <l>Because I knew better than him to get rich.</l>
               <l>TO malice like that 'twas invain to replyâ€”</l>
               <l>You had known by his looks he was telling a lie.</l>
               <l>THUS life ran away, so smooth and sereneâ€”</l>
               <l>Ah! these were the happiest days I had seen!</l>
               <l>But the saying of Jacob I know to be true,</l>

               <l>WELL, as I predicted that matters would beâ€”</l>
               <l>To the stamp-act succeeded a tax upon <hi>Tea:</hi>

               <l>To gain a mere trifle, a shilling or so,</l>

               <l>That, at least in the judgment of half our wise men,</l>
               <l>ALECTO herself made the nib to his pen.</l>
               <l>AT this time arose a certain king SEARS,</l>

               <l>And scarcely found spirits to <hi>weather the storm</hi>;</l>

               <l>And stuffing my <hi>papers</hi> with something like treason,</l>
               <l>And meeting misfortunes and endless disasters,</l>
               <l>And forc'd to submit to a hundred <hi>new masters,</hi>

               <l>Return'd to the city, and hung up my boots.</l>
               <l>AS matters have gone, it was plainly a blunder,</l>
               <l>But <hi>then</hi> I expected the Whigs must knock under,</l>
               <l>And I always adhere to the sword that is longest,</l>
               <l>And stick to the party that's like to be strongest:</l>

               <l>Your ploughs at a stand, and your ships run ashoreâ€”</l>
               <l>When this was apparent, (and need I say more?)</l>
               <l>I <hi>handled</hi> my cane, and I <hi>look'd</hi> at my hat,</l>
               <l>And cry'dâ€”" Gâ€”d have mercy on armies like that!"</l>

               <l>At length I resolv'd (as was surely my duty)</l>

               <l>His gown of itself was amazingly big,</l>
               <l>Besides, he had on his canonical wig,</l>

               <l>Look'd pleasant and saidâ€”<hi>What, Hugh, are you here!</hi>

               <l>LONG life and low spirits were never my choice,</l>
               <l>As long as I live I intend to rejoice;</l>
               <l>When life is worn out, and no wine's to be had</l>
               <l>'Tis time enough then to be serious and sad.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Tis time enough then to reflect and repent</l>
               <l>When our liquor is gone, and our money is spent,</l>
               <l>But I cannot endure what is practis'd by some</l>
               <l>This anticipating of evils to come:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A debt must be paid, I am sorry to say,</l>
               <l>Alike, in their turns, by the grave and the gay,</l>
               <l>And due to a despot that none can deceive</l>
               <l>Who grants us no respite and signs no reprieve.</l>

               <l>Thrice happy is he that from care can retreat,</l>
               <l>And its plagues and vexations put under his feet;</l>
               <l>Blow the storm as it may, he is always in trim,</l>
               <l>And the sun's in the zenith forever to him.</l>

               <l>Yet, toss'd as I am in the stormy expanse,</l>

               <l>BY the side of the sea, in a cottage obscure,</l>
               <l>There liv'd an old fellow nam'd Charlot Boncoeur,</l>
               <l>Who was free to his neighbour and good to the poor,</l>
               <l>Catching fish was his trade,</l>

               <l>One day as he went to the brink of the lake,</l>
               <l>Persuading the fishes their dinner to take,</l>
               <l>(The last he intended they ever should make)</l>
               <l>While his hooks he employ'd to their sorrow and woe,</l>
               <l>A grunting he heard in the waters below,</l>

               <l>We'll suppose that the water was perfectly clear)</l>
               <l>He saw on the bed of the liquid profound</l>

               <l>However, convinc'd, from what he had heard,</l>

               <l>So in less than a week (to his praise be it said)</l>

            <l>SWIFT to the dust descends each honour'd name</l>
            <l>That rais'd their country to these heights of fame,</l>
            <l>Sages that plann'd, and chiefs that led the way</l>
            <l>To freedom's templeâ€”all too soon decay;</l>
            <l>Alike submit to one unalter'd doom,</l>
            <l>Their glories closing in perpetual gloom,</l>
            <l>Like the dim splendours of the evening, fade,</l>
            <l>While night advances to complete the shade.</l>
            <l>REED! 'tis for thee we shed th' unpurchas'd tear,</l>
            <l>Bend o'er thy tomb, and plant our laurels here,</l>
            <l>Thy own brave deeds the noblest pile transcend,</l>
            <l>And virtue, patriot virtue, mourns her friend,</l>
            <l>Gone to those realms where worth may claim regard,</l>
            <l>And gone where virtue meets her best reward.</l>
            <l>NO single art engag'd his manly mind,</l>
            <l>In every scene his active genius shin'd,</l>
            <l>Nature in him, in honour to our age,</l>
            <l>At once compos'd the soldier and the sage;â€”</l>
            <l>Firm to his purpose, vigilant, and bold,</l>
            <l>Detesting traitors, and despising gold,</l>
            <l>He scorn'd all bribes from Britain's hostile throneâ€”</l>
            <l>For all his country's wrongs were <hi>thrice</hi> his own.</l>
            <l>REED, rest in peace, for time's impartial page</l>
            <l>Shall blast the wrongs of this ungrateful age:</l>
            <l>Long in these climes thy name shall flourish fair,</l>
            <l>The statesman's pattern, and the poet's care;</l>

            <l>And still new tributes from new ages gain,</l>
            <l>Fair to the eye that injur'd honour riseâ€”</l>

            <head>THE FIVE AGES.</head>
            <head type="sub">1785.</head>
            <l>THE reign of old Saturn is highly renown'd</l>
            <l>For many fine things that no longer are found,</l>
            <l>Trees always in blossom, men free from all pains,</l>
            <l>And shepherds as mild as the sheep on their plains.</l>
            <l>In the midland Equator, dispensing his sway,</l>
            <l>The Sun, they pretended, pursu'd his bright way,</l>
            <l>Not rambled, unsteady, to regions remote,</l>
            <l>To talk, once a-year, with the <hi>crab</hi> and the <hi>goat.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>From a motion like this, have the sages explain'd,</l>
            <l>How summer for ever her empire maintain'd;</l>
            <l>While the turf of the fields by the plough was unbroke,</l>
            <l>And a house for the shepherd, the shade of the oak.</l>
            <l>YET some say there never was seen on this stage</l>
            <l>What poets affirm of that innocent <hi>age,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When the brutal creation from bondage was free,</l>
            <l>And men were exactly what mankind should be.</l>
            <l>But why should they labour to prove it a dream?â€”</l>
            <l>The poets of old were in love with the theme,</l>
            <l>And, leaving to others mere truth to repeat,</l>
            <l>In the regions of fancy they found it complete.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="374" facs="unknown:019658_0380_0FAEE0E6E16E70F0"/>THREE ages have been on this globe, they pretend;</l>
            <l>And the fourth, some have thought, is to be without end;</l>
            <l>The first was of Goldâ€”But a fifth, <hi>we</hi> will say,</l>
            <l>Has already begun, and is now on its way.</l>
            <l>Since the days of Arcadia, if ever there shin'd</l>
            <l>A ray of the first on the heads of mankind,</l>
            <l>Let critics disputeâ€”but with us it is clear,</l>
            <l>That the aera of PAPER was realiz'd <hi>here.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>FOUR ages, however, at least have been told,</l>
            <l>The first is compar'd to the purest of <hi>Gold</hi>â€”</l>
            <l>But, as bad luck would have it, its circles were few,</l>
            <l>And the next was of <hi>Silver</hi>â€”if Ovid says true.</l>
            <l>But this, like the former, did rapidly passâ€”</l>
            <l>While that which came after was nothing but <hi>Brass</hi>â€”</l>
            <l>An age of mere tinkersâ€”and when it was lost,</l>
            <l>Old <hi>Iron</hi> succeededâ€”we know to our cost.</l>
            <l>AND hence you may fairly infer, if you please,</l>
            <l>That we're nothing but blacksmiths of various degrees,</l>
            <l>Since each has a weapon, of one sort or other,</l>
            <l>To stir up the coals, and to shake at his brother.</l>
            <l>Should the Author of nature reverse his decree,</l>
            <l>And bring back the age we're so anxious to see,</l>
            <l>Agreement, alas!â€”you would look for invain,</l>
            <l>The <hi>stuff</hi> might be chang'd, but the <hi>staff</hi> would remain.</l>
            <l>The lawyer would still find a client to fleece,</l>
            <l>The doctor, a patient to pack off in peace,</l>
            <l>The parson, some hundreds of hearers prepar'd</l>
            <l>To measure his grace by the length of his beard.</l>
            <l>Old Momus would still have some cattle to lead,</l>
            <l>Who would hug hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> opinions, and swallow his creedâ€”</l>
            <l>So it's best, I believe, that things are as they areâ€”</l>
            <l>If <hi>Iron's</hi> the meanestâ€”we've nothing to fear.</l>

               <l>WE Tories, who lately were frighten'd away,</l>
               <l>When you march'd into York all in battle array,</l>
               <l>Dear whigs, in our exile have somewhat to say.</l>

               <l>The Indians themselves, whom no treaties can bind,</l>
               <l>We have reason to think are perversely inclin'dâ€”</l>

            <l>If some, through misfortunes, are slack in the purse,</l>
            <l>It is not so bad but it might have been worse.â€”</l>
            <l>Great things, the year past, were reveal'd to our eyes:</l>

            <l>We Hawkers are men, and have children and wives</l>
            <l>To comfort our hearts, and to solace our lives:</l>

               <l>So multisarious were our woes:</l>

               <l>Bad news we brought you every day,</l>
               <l>Your seamen slain, your ships on shore,</l>
               <l>The army fretting for their payâ€”</l>
               <l>'Twas well they had not fretted more!</l>
               <l>'Twas wrong indeed to wear our shoes,</l>

               <l>The folks that guard the <hi>English</hi> throne</l>
               <l>Have giv'n us ample room to range,</l>

               <l>To western lakes they stretch our bounds,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But pray read on another year,</l>
               <l>Remain the humble Newsman's friend;</l>
               <l>And he'll engage to let you hear</l>
               <l>What <hi>Europe's</hi> princes next intend.â€”</l>

               <l>Wellâ€”if they fight, then fight they must,</l>
               <l>They are a strange, contentious breed;</l>
               <l>One good effect will be, I trust,</l>

            <l>THE head, whose toiling concave teems</l>
            <l>With millions of unfinish'd schemes,</l>
            <l>Plans that in shapeless embrio ly,</l>
            <l>Or projects form'd, the Lord knows why,</l>
            <l>Had better far those whims resign,</l>
            <l>And aid this humble theme of mine;</l>
            <l>Contrive some means to crush the power</l>

            <l>THE American world, as our histories say,</l>
            <l>Secluded from Europe long centuries lay,</l>
            <l>But peopled by beings whom white men detest,</l>
            <l>The sons of the Tartars that came from the west.</l>
            <l>These Indians, 'tis certain, were here long before ye all,</l>
            <l>And dwelt in their wigwams from time immemorial;</l>
            <l>In a mere state of nature, untutor'd, untaught,</l>
            <l>They did as they pleas'd, and they spoke as they thoughtâ€”</l>
            <l>No priests they had then for the <hi>cure</hi> of their souls,</l>
            <l>No lawyers, recorders, nor keepers of rolls;</l>
            <l>No learned physicians vile <hi>nostrums</hi> conceal'dâ€”</l>
            <l>Their druggist was natureâ€”her shop was the field.</l>
            <l>In the midst of their forests how happy and blest,</l>
            <l>In the skin of a bear or a buffalo drest!</l>
            <l>No care to perplex, and no luxury seen</l>
            <l>But the feast, and the song, and the dance on the green.</l>
            <l>Some bow'd to the moon, and some worshipp'd the sun,</l>
            <l>And the king and the captain were center'd in one;</l>
            <l>In a cabin they met on their councils of state,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>age</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> alone might debate:</l>
            <l>With quibbles they never essay'd to beguile,</l>
            <l>And nature had taught them the orator's stile;</l>
            <l>No pomp they affected, nor quaintly refin'd</l>
            <l>The nervous idea that glanc'd on the mind.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="399" facs="unknown:019658_0405_0FAC9BE8E0CF3F08"/>When hunting or battle invited to arms,</l>
            <l>The women they left to take care of their farmsâ€”</l>
            <l>The toils of the summer did winter repay,</l>
            <l>While snug in their cabins they snor'd it away.</l>
            <l>If death came among them his dues to demand,</l>
            <l>They still had some prospect of comfort at handâ€”</l>
            <l>The dead man they sent to the regions of bliss,</l>
            <l>With his bottle and dog, and his fair maids to kiss.</l>
            <l>THUS happy they dwelt in a rural domain,</l>
            <l>Uninstructed in commerce, unpractis'd in gain,</l>
            <l>Till, taught by the loadstone to traverse the seas,</l>
            <l>Columbus came over, that bold Genoese.</l>
            <l>From records authentic, the date we can shew,</l>
            <l>One thousand four hundred and ninety and two</l>
            <l>Years, borne by the seasons, had vanish'd away,</l>
            <l>Since the <hi>babe</hi> in the manger at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> lay.</l>
            <l>What an aera was this, above all that had pass'd,</l>
            <l>To yield such a treasure, discover'd at lastâ€”</l>
            <l>A new world, in value exceeding the old,</l>
            <l>Such mountains of silver, such torrents of gold!</l>
            <l>Yet the schemes of Columbus, however well plann'd</l>
            <l>Were scarcely sufficient to find the main land;</l>
            <l>On the <hi>islands</hi> alone with the natives he spoke,</l>
            <l>Except when he enter'd the great <hi>Oronoque:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In this he resembled old Moses, the Jew,</l>
            <l>Who, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,</l>
            <l>When at length the <hi>reward</hi> was no longer deny'd</l>
            <l>From the top of Mount Pisgah he saw <hi>it</hi> and dy'd.</l>
            <l>These islands and worlds in the wat'ry expanse,</l>
            <l>Like most mighty things, were the offspring of chance,</l>
            <l>Since, steering for Asia, Columbus, they say,</l>
            <l>Was astonish'd to find such a world in his way!</l>

            <l>Such a region of wonders intruding between!</l>

            <l>Some sail'd with a view to dominion and riches,</l>
            <l>Some to pray without book, and a few to hang witches.</l>
            <l>Some came, on the Indians to shed a new light,</l>

            <l>THESE exiles were cast in a whimsical mould,</l>

            <l>Disclaim'd all pretences to jesting and laughter,</l>
            <l>And sigh'd their lives through, to be happy hereafter.</l>

            <l>With rigour excessive they strengthen'd their reign,</l>
            <l>Their laws were conceiv'd in the ill-natur'd strain,</l>
            <l>With mystical meanings the saint was perplext,</l>
            <l>And the flesh and the devil were slain by a text.</l>
            <l>The body was scourg'd for the good of the soul,</l>
            <l>All folly discourag'd by peevish controul,</l>
            <l>A knot on the head was the sign of no grace,</l>

            <l>And the <hi>fire</hi> was sufficient that flash'd from above.</l>
            <l>'Twas a crime to assert that the moon was opaque,</l>

            <l>And those they caught rambling, on bus'ness or pleasure,</l>

            <l>Some hundreds to Britain ran murmuring homeâ€”</l>

            <l>When they found they had miss'd what they look'd for at first,</l>

            <l>Ah, sweet recollection of juvenile dreams</l>

            <l>How often the bard, and the peasant shall mourn</l>

            <l>Not a hill, but some fortress disfigures it round!</l>
            <l>And ramparts are rais'd where the cottage was found!</l>
            <l>The plains and the vallies with ruin are spread,</l>

            <l>When all a man sail'd by, or saw, was his own.</l>
