            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

purpoſe to obſerve, that when he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to Peter the care of his flock, as the moſt important and acceptable evidence of his ſincere affection to his perſon, he varies the phraſe; in one place, ſaying, <hi>feed my ſheep,</hi> and in the other, <hi>feed my lambs.</hi> Perhaps it might be intended in part to intimate, that the care of a goſpel-miniſter, who would in the moſt agreeable manner approve his love to his maſter, ſhould extend itſelf to the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as to thoſe of a maturer age, and more conſiderable ſtanding in the church.

               <p>I very readily allow, that no human en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, either of miniſters or parents, can ever be effectual to bring one ſoul to the ſaving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST, without the co-operating and transforming influences of the Bleſſed Spirit: Yet you well know, and I hope you ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this does not in the leaſt weaken our obligation to the moſt diligent uſe of proper means. The great GOD hath ſtated rules of operation in the world of grace, as well as of nature; and though he is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to them, it is arrogant, and may be deſtructive, to expect that he ſhould devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from them in favour of us or our's.</p>

of any human ſupplies. Such a plea would only add impiety to cruelty, and greatly aggravate the crime it attempted to palliate. As abſurd would it be for us, to flatter ourſelves with a hope that our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be taught of GOD, and regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated and ſanctified by the influences of his grace, if we neglect that prudent and religious care in their education, which it is my buſineſs this day to deſcribe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, and which Solomon urges in the words of my text: <hi>Train up a child in the way in which he ſhould go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not offer you many critical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on ſo plain and intelligible a paſſage. You will eaſily obſerve, that it conſiſts of an important advice, addreſſed to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and governors of children. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go;</hi> and alſo of a weighty reaſon by which it is inforced, <hi>and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi>

               <p>The general ſenſe is undoubtedly retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our tranſlation, as it commonly is: but here, as in many other places, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the original energy and beauty is loſt.</p>

               <p>It is added, that a child ſhould be train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up <hi>in the way in which he ſhould go;</hi> which ſeems to be more exactly rendered by others, at the entrance or from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his way, to expreſs the early care which ought to be taken to prevent the prevalency of irregular habits, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, from the firſt dawning of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to direct it aright, and to infuſe into the tender unpractiſed mind, the important maxim of wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>

               <p>I ſhall endeavour to illuſtrate and inforce this important advice in the following me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which appears to me the moſt natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and for that reaſon the moſt eligible.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I ſhall more particularly mark out the way in which children are to be trained up.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Offer ſome plain and ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to awaken you to this pious and neceſſary care.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Direct to the manner in which the attempt is to be made, and the precautions which are to be uſed in order to render it effectual. And then,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I will conclude the whole with a more particular application, ſuited to your different characters, relations, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of life.</p>
               <p>I am very ſenſible, that it is a very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as well as important ſubject, which is now before me; I have therefore thought myſelf obliged more attentively to weigh what has occurred to my own meditations, more diligently to conſult the ſentiments of others, and above all, more earneſtly to ſeek thoſe divine influences, without which I know, I am unequal to the eaſieſt taſk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:025410_0010_0FCCE365DBA69148"/>
but in dependance on which, I chearfully attempt one of the moſt difficult. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the whole I humbly offer to your candid examination; not pretending at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time to dictate in an authoritative man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and leaſt of all on ſuch an occaſion as this; but rather ſpeaking as to wiſe men, who are themſelves to judge what I ſay.— May the divine aſſiſtance and bleſſing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us in all!</p>
               <p>Firſt, I am to deſcribe the way in which children are to be trained up.</p>
               <p>Our tranſlation, as I have told you, though not very literal, is agreeable to the ſenſe of the original, <hi>The way in which the child ſhould go.</hi> And undoubtedly this is no other, than the good old way; the way of ſerious practical religion: The way which GOD has in his word marked out for us; the way which all the children of God have trodden in every ſucceeding age; the way, the only way, in which we and our's can find reſt to our ſouls.</p>
               <p>But it is not proper to leave the matter thus generally explained. I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more particularly obſerve—that it is the way of piety towards GOD—and of fairly in our Lord JESUS CHRIST;—the way of obedience to parents, and of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence to all—the way of diligence, and of integrity; the way of humility, and of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025410_0011_0FCCE36751E22BB8"/>
ſelf-denial. I am perſuaded, that each of theſe particulars will deſerve your ſerious attention and regard.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Children ſhould undoubtedly be trained up in the way of piety and devotion towards GOD.</p>
               <p>This, as you well know, is the ſum and the foundation of every thing truly good. <hi>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wiſdom.</hi> The Pſalmiſt therefore invites children to him, with the promiſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them in it; <hi>Come, ye children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</hi> And it is certain, ſome right notions of the ſupreme Being muſt be implanted in the minds of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, before there can be a reaſonable foundation for teaching them thoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which peculiarly relate to CHRIST under the character of the Mediator; for he who comes unto GOD (by him) muſt believe that he is, and that he is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them who diligently ſeek him.</p>
               <p>The proof of the Being of GOD, and ſome of thoſe attributes of the divine nature in which we are moſt concerned, depends on ſuch eaſy principles, that I cannot but think, the weakeſt mind might enter into it. A child will eaſily apprehend, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:025410_0012_0FCCE369DFB493C0"/>
every houſe is built by ſome man, and there can be no work without an author; ſo <hi>he that built all things is GOD.</hi> And from this obvious idea of GOD, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all, we may naturally repreſent him as very great and very good, that they may be taught at once to reverence and love him.</p>
               <p>It is of great importance, that children early imbibe an awe of GOD, and an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble veneration for his perfections and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He ought therefore to be repreſented to them as the great LORD OF ALL; and when we take occaſion to mention to them other inviſible agents, whether Angels or devils, we ſhould, as Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> has moſt judiciouſly obſerved, always repreſent them as entirely under the government and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of GOD, that no ſentiments of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of good ſpirits, or terror of the bad, may diſtract their tender minds, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe on thoſe regards which are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable prerogative of the GREAT SUPREME.</p>
               <p>There ſhould be a peculiar caution, that when we teach theſe infant tongues to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that great and terrible name, THE LORD OUR GOD, they may not learn to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> it in vain; but may uſe it with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſolemnity, as remembering that we and they are <hi>but duſt and aſhes before him.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:025410_0013_0FCCE36B1DD3D570"/>
When I hear the little creatures ſpeaking of "the great GOD, the bleſſed GOD, the glorious GOD," as I ſometimes do, it gives me a ſenſible pleaſure, and I conſider it as a probable proof of great wiſdom and piety, in thoſe who have the charge of their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Yet great care ſhould be taken not to confine our diſcourſes to theſe awful views, leaſt the dread of GOD ſhould ſo fall upon them, as that his excellencies ſhould make them afraid to approach him. We ſhould deſcribe him, as not only the greateſt, but the beſt of beings. We ſhould teach them to know him by the moſt encouraging name of <hi>the LORD, the LORD GOD, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, and forgiving iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſin.</hi> We ſhould repreſent him as the univerſal, kind, indulgent parent, who loves his creatures, and by all proper methods provides for their happineſs. And we ſhould particularly repreſent his goodneſs to them; with what more than parental tenderneſs, he watched round their cradles; with what compaſſion he heard their feeble cries, before their infant thoughts could form themſelves into pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for them, is no more than he puts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts; and all our power to help them, no more than he lodges in our hands.</p>
               <p>We ſhould alſo ſolemnly remind them, that in a very little while their ſpirits are to return to this GOD; that as he is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with them, and knows every thing they do, or ſpeak, or think, ſo he will bring every work into judgment, and make them for ever happy or miſerable, as they on the whole are found obedient or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious. And here the moſt lively and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic deſcriptions, which the ſcriptures give us, of heaven and of hell, ſhould be laid before them, and urged on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p>When ſuch a foundation is laid, in the belief of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being and providence of GOD, and of a future ſtate both of rewards and puniſhments, children ſhould be inſtructed in the duty they owe to GOD, and ſhould be particularly taught to pray to him and to praiſe him. It would be beſt of all, if from a deep ſenſe of his perfections, and their own neceſſities, they could be engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to breath out their ſouls before him in words of their own, were they ever ſo weak and broken. Yet you will readily allow, that till this can be expected, it may be very proper to teach them ſome form of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025410_0015_0FCCE36E6FA6AB60"/>
prayer and thankſgiving, conſiſting of ſuch plain ſcriptures, or other familiar expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as may beſt ſuit their circumſtances and underſtandings. If the Lord's Prayer be taught them, as a form, I hope you will conſider how comprehenſive the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are; how faſt the ideas riſe and vary; and conſequently how neceſſary it is, that it be frequently and largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them; leſt the repetition of it degenerate into a mere ceremony, as I fear it does among many, who are perhaps moſt zealous for its uſe.</p>
               <p>But what I have ſaid, on this head, of piety and devotion, muſt be conſidered in an inſeparable connection with what I am to add under the next.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Children muſt be trained up in the way of faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>You know, my friends, and I hope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you know it to the daily joy of your ſouls, that CHRIST is the way, the truth, and the life; and that it is by him we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence to a GOD, who might otherwiſe appear as a conſuming fire. It is therefore of great importance to lead children betimes into the knowledge of CHRIST, which is, no doubt, a conſiderable part of that nurture
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025410_0016_0FCCE36FA161D278"/>
and admonition of the Lord, which the Apoſtle recommends, and was perhaps what he principally intended by thoſe words.</p>
               <p>We ſhould therefore teach them betimes, that the firſt parents of the human race, moſt ungratefully rebelled againſt GOD, and ſubjected themſelves and all their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring to his wrath and curſe. The awful conſequences of this ſhould be opened at large, and we ſhould labour to convince them, that they have made themſelves lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the divine diſpleaſure (that dreadful thing!) by their own perſonal guilt; and thus by the knowledge of the law ſhould we make way for the goſpel, the joyful news of deliverance by CHRIST.</p>
               <p>In unfolding this, great care ought to be taken that we do not fill their minds with an averſion to one Sacred Perſon, while we endeavour to attract their regards to another. The FATHER is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as ſevere, and almoſt inexorable; hardly prevailed upon by the interceſſion of his compaſſionate SON to entertain thoughts of mercy and forgiveneſs. Far from that, we ſhould ſpeak of him as the overflowing fountain of goodneſs, whoſe eye pitied us in our helpleſs diſtreſs, whoſe almighty arm was ſtretched out for our reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, whoſe eternal counſels of wiſdom and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025410_0017_0FCCE3712D7E4168"/>
love formed that important ſcheme to which we owe all our hopes. I have often had occaſion to ſhew you at large, that this is the ſcripture doctrine; our children ſhould be early taught it, and taught what that ſcheme was, ſo far as their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings can receive it, and our's can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it. We ſhould often repeat it to them, that GOD is ſo holy, and yet ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that rather than he would on the one hand deſtroy man, or on the other leave ſin unpuniſhed, he made his own ſon a ſacrifice for it, appointing him to be humbled, that we might be exalted, to die, that we might live.</p>
               <p>We ſhould alſo repreſent to them (with holy wonder and joy) how readily the Lord Jeſus conſented to procure our deliverance in ſo expenſive a way. How chearfully he ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come! I delight to do thy will, O my GOD!</hi> To enhance the value of this amazing love, we ſhould endeavour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our weak capacities, to teach them who this compaſſionate Redeemer is; to repreſent ſomething of his glories as the eternal SON of GOD, and the great Lord of angels and men. We ſhould inſtruct them in his amazing condeſcenſion in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide theſe glories, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a little, weak, helpleſs child, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards an afflicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſorrowful man. We
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025410_0018_0FCCE37352A210B8"/>
ſhould lead them into the knowledge of thoſe circumſtances of the hiſtory of Jeſus, which may have the greateſt tendency to ſtrike their minds, and to impreſs them with an early ſenſe of gratitude and love to him. We ſhould tell them, how poor he made himſelf, that he might enrich us; how diligently he went about doing good; how willingly he preached the goſpel to the loweſt of the people. And we ſhould eſpecially tell them how kind he was to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, and how he chid his diſciples when they would have hindered them from being brought to him: It is expreſsly ſaid, JESUS <hi>was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid, ſuffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of GOD.</hi> A tender circumſtance! which perhaps was recorded (in part at leaſt) for this very reaſon, that children in ſucceeding ages might be impreſſed and affected with it.</p>
               <p>Through theſe ſcenes of his life we ſhould lead them on to his death: We ſhould ſhew how eaſily he could have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf (of which he gave ſo ſenſible an evidence, in ſtriking down by one word, thoſe who came to apprehend him;) and yet how patiently he ſubmitted to the moſt cruel injuries, to be ſcourged and ſpit upon, to be crowned with thorns, and to bear the croſs. We ſhould ſhew them, how
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025410_0019_0FCCE37416825C10"/>
this innocent, holy, divine perſon was <hi>brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter;</hi> and while they were piercing him with nails, inſtead of loading them with curſes, he prayed for them, ſaying, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,</hi> And when their little hearts are awed and melted with ſo ſtrange a ſtory, we ſhould tell them, it was thus he groaned, and bled, and died for us, and often remind them of their own concern in what was then tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.</p>
               <p>We ſhould lead on their thoughts to the glorious views of Chriſt's reſurrection and aſcenſion; and tell them with what adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſs he ſtill remembers his people in the midſt of his exaltation; pleading the cauſe of ſinful creatures, and employing his intereſt in the court of heaven, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure life and glory for all who believe in him, and love him.</p>
               <p>We ſhould then go on to inſtruct them in thoſe particulars of obedience, by which the ſincerity of our faith and our love is to be approved; at the ſame time reminding them of their own weakneſs, and telling them how GOD helps us, by ſending his holy SPIRIT to dwell in our hearts, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us for every good word and work. An important leſſon, without attending to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025410_0020_0FCCE375AB39A4B0"/>
which our inſtruction will be vain, and their hearing will likewiſe be vain!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Children ſhould be trained up in the way of obedience to their parents.</p>
               <p>This is a command which GOD recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from Mount Sinai, by annexing to it a particular promiſe of long life; a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which young perſons greatly deſire. The Apoſtle therefore obſerves, that it is <hi>the firſt commandment with promiſe,</hi> i. e. a command eminently remarkable for the manner in which the promiſe is adjoined. And it is certainly a wiſe conſtitution of Providence, that gives ſo much to parental authority, eſpecially while children are in their younger years, their minds being then incapable of judging and acting for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in matters of importance. Children ſhould therefore be early taught and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by ſcripture, that GOD has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them into the hands of their parents; and conſequently that reverence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their parents, is a part of the duty they owe to GOD, and diſobedience to them, is rebellion againſt him. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſhould by no means indulge their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a direct and reſolute oppoſition to their will in matters of greater or ſmaller moment; remembering, that a child left
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025410_0021_0FCCE3781E6D4A98"/>
to himſelf, brings his parents to ſhame, and himſelf to ruin; and with regard to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as well as affection, <hi>it is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Children ſhould be trained up in the way of benevolence and kindneſs to all.</p>
               <p>The great Apoſtle tells us that <hi>love is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> and that all thoſe branches of it, which relate to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are comprehended in that one word, <hi>love.</hi> This love therefore we ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to teach them; and we ſhall find, that in many inſtances it will be a law to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and guide them right in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions, the obligations to which may depend on principles of equity, which lie far beyond the reach of their feeble under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. There is hardly an inſtruction relating to our duty more happily adapted to the capacity of children, than that golden law (ſo important to all of the matureſt age) <hi>Whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo unto them.</hi> This rule we ſhould teach them, and by this ſhould examine their actions. From their cradles we ſhould often inculcate it upon them, that a great deal of religion conſiſts in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good; that <hi>the wiſdom from above is full of mercy and good fruits;</hi> and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025410_0022_0FCCE37960053C30"/>
chriſtian <hi>ſhould do good unto all as he has opportunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſuch inſtructions may be welcome to them, we ſhould endeavour, by all pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent methods, to ſoften their hearts to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of humanity and tenderneſs, and guard againſt every thing that would have a contrary tendency. We ſhould remove from them as much as poſſible, all kinds of cruel and bloody ſpectacles, and ſhould carefully diſcourage any thing barbarous in their treatment of brute creatures; by no means allowing them to ſport themſelves in the death or pain of domeſtic animals, but rather teaching them to treat the poor creatures kindly, and take care of them; the contrary to which is a moſt deteſtable ſign of a ſavage and malignant diſpoſition. The merciful <hi>man regardeth the life of his beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhould likewiſe take care to teach them the odiouſneſs and folly of a ſelfiſh temper, and encourage them in a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to impart to others, what is agreeable and entertaining to themſelves: Eſpecially we ſhould endeavour to form them to ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of compaſſion for the poor. We ſhould ſhew them where GOD has ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that conſidereth the poor, the LORD will remember him in the day of trouble. He that hath pity upon the poor,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025410_0023_0FCCE37AE24289D0"/>
lendeth to the LORD and that which he hath given, will he pay him again.</hi> And we ſhould ſhew them by our own practices, that we verily believe theſe promiſes to be true, and important. It might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſometimes to make our children the meſſengers, by which we ſend ſome ſmall ſupply to the indigent and diſtreſſed; and if they diſcover a diſpoſition to give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the little ſtock we allow them to call their own, we ſhould joyfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it, and ſhould take care that they never loſe by their charity, but that in a prudent manner we abundantly repay it. It is hardly to be imagined that children thus brought up ſhould, in the advance of life, prove injurious and oppreſſive; they will rather be the ornaments of religion, and bleſſings to the world, and probably will be in the number of the laſt whom Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence will ſuffer to want.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Children ſhould be trained up in the way of diligence.</p>
               <p>This ſhould undoubtedly be our care, if we have any regard to the welfare either of their bodies or their ſouls. In whatever ſtation of life they may at length be fixed, it is certain there is little proſpect of their acquitting themſelves with uſefulneſs, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025410_0024_0FCCE37D427DD528"/>
and advantage, without a cloſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute application; whereas the wiſeſt of princes and of men has ſaid, <hi>Seeſt thou a man diligent in his buſineſs? he ſhall ſtand before kings, he ſhall not ſtand before mean men.</hi> And it is evident that a diligent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of buſineſs keeps one out of the way of a thouſand temptations, which idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeems to invite, leading a man into numberleſs inſtances of vice and folly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has nothing elſe to do.</p>
               <p>A prudent and religious parent will therefore be concerned, that his children may not early contract ſo pernicious a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, nor enter upon life, like perſons who have no buſineſs in it, but to crowd the ſtage, and ſtand in the way of thoſe who are better employed.—Inſtead of ſuffering them to ſaunter about from place to place (as abundance of young people do, to no imaginable purpoſe of uſefulneſs, or even of entertainment) he would quickly aſſign them ſome employment for their time: An employment ſo moderated, and ſo diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as not to overwhelm and fatigue their tender ſpirits; yet ſufficient to keep them wakeful and active. Nor is this ſo difficult as ſo many imagine; for children are a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy kind of creatures, naturally fond of learning new things, and trying and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they can do. So that, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,

were perfect inactivity to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them as a penance but for one hour, they would be heartily weary of it, and would be glad to ſeek their refuge from it, in almoſt any buſineſs you would think fit to employ them about.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhould they be diſciplined in their infant years, ſhould early be taught the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of time, and early accuſtomed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, till they grow fit for ſome calling in life; in which they ſhould at length be placed with this important maxim deeply engraven upon their minds, "That full employ in whatever ſervice they are fixed, is a thing by no means to be dreaded, but on the contrary, greatly to be deſired."</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this head with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of a very remarkable law amongſt the Athenians, which ordained, "That thoſe who had been brought up to no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment by their parents, ſhould not be obliged to keep them, if they came to want in their old age; which all other (legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate) children were."</p>
               <p n="6">6. Children ſhould be trained up in the way of integrity.</p>
               <p>Simplicity and godly ſincerity is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very amiable, but an eſſential part of the chriſtian character; and we are every
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025410_0026_0FCCE380F13B8400"/>
one of us indiſpenſibly obliged to prove ourſelves <hi>Iſraelites indeed, in whom there is no</hi> allowed <hi>guile.</hi> And this is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which will peculiarly require our regard in the education of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of all young perſons under our care.</p>
               <p>It is very melancholy to obſerve, how ſoon the artifices and deceits of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture begin to diſcover themſelves. In this reſpect we are tranſgreſſors from the womb, and go aſtray almoſt as ſoon as we are born, ſpeaking lies. Great care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be taken to form the minds of children to a love for truth and candor, and a ſenſe of the meanneſs as well as the guilt of a lie. We ſhould be cautious that we do not expoſe them to any temptations of this kind, either by unreaſonable ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, on account of little faults, or by haſty ſurprizes, when enquiring into any matter of fact, which it may ſeem their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to diſguiſe by a falſehood: And when we find them guilty of a known and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate lie, we ſhould expreſs our horror of it, not only by a preſent reproof or correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by ſuch a conduct towards them for ſome time afterwards, as may plainly ſhew them how greatly we are amazed, grieved, and diſpleaſed. When ſo ſolemn a buſineſs is made of the firſt faults of this
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025410_0027_0FCCE38340B5BF58"/>
kind, it may be a mean of preventing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more.</p>
               <p>I will further add, that we ought not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus ſeverely to animadvert upon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect lie, but likewiſe, in a proper degree, to diſcourage all kinds of equivocations and double meanings, and thoſe little tricks and artifices, by which they may endeavour to impoſe on each other, or on thoſe who are older than themſelves. We ſhould often inculcate upon them that excellent ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>He that walketh uprightly walketh ſurely; but he that perverteth his way,</hi> (that twiſts and diſtorts it with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of artifice and deceit) <hi>ſhall</hi> (at length) <hi>be known.</hi> Be ſhewing them every day, how eaſy, how pleaſant, how hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable, and how advantageous it is to maintain a fair, open, honeſt temper; and on the other hand, what folly there is in cunning and diſhoneſty in all its forms; and how certain it is, that by ſtudying and practiſing it, they take the readieſt way to make themſelves obnoxious and uſeleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous and odious. Above all, ſhould we remind them, that the righteous LORD loved righteouſneſs, and his favourable countenance beholds the upright; but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lips are ſuch an abomination to him, that he expreſsly declares, <hi>All liars ſhall
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025410_0028_0FCCE385554FFA78"/>
have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Children ſhould be trained up in the way of humility.</p>
               <p>This is a grace which our Lord particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly invites us to learn of him, and moſt frequently recommends to us; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without it, ſo humbling a ſcheme as he came to introduce, would never meet with a welcome reception. And with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the preſent life, it is a moſt lovely ornament, which engages univerſal eſteem and affection; ſo that before honour is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: On the whole we find, <hi>He that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelf is abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf is exalted,</hi> both by GOD and man.</p>
               <p>A regard therefore to the eaſe, honour and happineſs of our children, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to an early endeavour of checking that pride, which was the firſt ſin, and the ruin of our natures; and diffuſes itſelf ſo wide, and ſinks ſo deep, into all who draw their original from degenerate Adam. We ſhould teach them to expreſs humility and modeſty in their converſe with all.</p>
               <p>They ſhould be taught to treat their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors with peculiar reſpect, and ſhould at proper ſeaſons be accuſtomed to ſilence and reſerve before them. Hence they will learn
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025410_0029_0FCCE386F8761230"/>
in ſome degree the government of the tongue; a branch of wiſdom, which, in the advance of life, will be of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the quiet of others, and to their own comfort and reputation.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhould they be allowed to aſſume airs of inſolence towards their equals; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taught to yield, to oblige, and to give up their right for the ſake of peace. To this purpoſe I cannot but think it deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they ſhould be generally accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to treat each other with thoſe forms of civility and complaiſance, which are uſual among well-bred people in their rank of life. I know theſe things are mere trifles in themſelves, yet they are the out-guards of humanity and friendſhip, and effectually prevent many a rude attack, which, taking its riſe from ſome little circumſtances, may nevertheleſs be attended with fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. I thought it proper to mention this here, becauſe (as <hi>Scougal</hi> very juſtly and elegantly expreſſes it) "Theſe modes are the ſhadows of humility, and ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew our regard for others, and the low thoughts we have of ourſelves."</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add farther, that it is great imprudence and unkindneſs to children, to indulge them in a haughty and imperious behaviour towards thoſe who are moſt their inferiors. They ſhould be made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025410_0030_0FCCE3896B32BF10"/>
that the ſervants of the family are not <hi>their</hi> ſervants, nor to be under <hi>their</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and controul. I the rather inſiſt upon this, becauſe I have generally obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that where young people have been permitted to tyrannize over perſons in the loweſt circumſtances of life, the humour has ſhamefully grown upon them, till it has diffuſed inſolence and arrogance through their behaviour to all about them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Children ſhould be trained up in the way of ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p>As without ſomething of this temper we can never follow CHRIST, or expect to be owned by him as his diſciples; ſo neither indeed can we paſs comfortably through the world. For whatever unexperienced youth may dream, a great many diſtaſteful and mortifying circumſtances will occur in life, which will unhinge our minds almoſt every hour, if we cannot manage, and in many inſtances deny our appetites, our paſſions, and our humours. We ſhould therefore endeavour to teach our children this important leſſon betimes; and if we ſucceed in our care, we ſhall leave them abundantly richer and happier, in this rule and poſſeſſion of their own ſpirits, than the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025410_0031_0FCCE38AAA59BC60"/>
moſt plentiful eſtates, or the moſt unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power over others could make them.</p>
               <p>When a rational creature becomes the ſlave of appetite, he ſinks beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the human nature, as well as the ſanctity of the chriſtian profeſſion. It is therefore obſervable that when the Apoſtle mentions the three grand branches of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical religion, he puts ſobriety in the front; perhaps to intimate, that where that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, the other cannot be ſuitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. <q>The Grace of God, <hi>(i. e. the goſpel)</hi> teaches us to live ſoberly, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and godly.</q> Children therefore, as well as young men, ſhould be exhorted to be ſoberminded:—And they ſhould be taught it by early ſelf-denial. It is certain, that if their own appetite and taſte were to determine the kind and quantity of their food, many of them would quickly deſtroy their conſtitutions, and perpaps their lives; ſince they have often the greateſt deſire for thoſe things which are the moſt improper. —And it ſeems juſtly obſerved by a very wiſe man, (who was himſelf a melancholy inſtance of it) <q>That the fondneſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their children, in letting them eat and drink what they will, lays a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for moſt of thoſe calamities in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, which proceed from bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition.</q> Nay, I will add, that it is
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025410_0032_0FCCE38C131521C0"/>
the part of wiſdom and love, not only to deny what would be unwholeſome, but to guard againſt indulging them in too great a nicety either of food or dreſs, people of ſenſe cannot but ſee, if they would pleaſe to conſider it, that to know how to fare plainly, and ſometimes a little hardly, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a man with eaſe and pleaſure through many circumſtances of life, which to luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and delicacy would be almoſt intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The government of the paſſions is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other branch of ſelf-denial, to which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould early be habituated; and ſo much the rather becauſe, in an age when reaſon is ſo weak, the paſſions are apt to appear with peculiar force and violence. A prudent care ſhould therefore be taken to repreſs the exorbitances of them.—For which purpoſe, it is of great importance, that they never be ſuffered to carry any point, by obſtinacy, noiſe and clamour, which is indeed to beſtow a reward on a fault which deſerves a ſevere reprimand. Nay, I will venture to add, that though it be very inhuman to take pleaſure in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them uneaſy by needleſs mortifications, yet when they are eagerly and intemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous of a trifle, they ought, for that very reaſon, ſometimes to be denied it, to teach them more moderation for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025410_0033_0FCCE38D91995F00"/>
And if by ſuch methods, they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually learn to conquer their little humours and fancies, they learn no inconſiderable branch of true fortitude and wiſdom. I cannot expreſs this better, than in the words of Mr. Locke, in his excellent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on the ſubject before us; <q>He that has found out the way to keep a child's ſpirit eaſy, active and free, and yet at the ſame time to reſtrain him from many things which he has a mind to, and draw him to things uneaſy to him, has got the true ſecret of education.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſometimes been ſurpriſed to ſee, how far a ſenſe of honour and praiſe has carried ſome children of a generous temper in a long and reſolute courſe of ſelf denial. But undoubtedly, the nobleſt principle of all is a ſenſe of religion. Happy would it indeed be, if they were led to ſee, that there is but very little in this kind of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and indulgences; that the world itſelf is but a poor empty trifle; and that the great thing a rational creature ſhould be concerned about, is to pleaſe GOD, and get well to heaven. May divine grace teach us this important leſſon for ourſelves, that we may tranſmit it with the greater advantage to our children! AMEN.</p>

               <p>IT is certainly a very pleaſing reflection to every faithful miniſter of the goſpel, that the cauſe, in which he is engaged, is the moſt benevolent, as well as the moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſubſerving the glory of GOD, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the happineſs of mankind. It muſt be a great ſatisfaction to a man of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and humanity, to think that it is not his buſineſs to dazzle and confound his hearers with the artifices of ſpeech, to give the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of truth to falſhood, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to trifles, but to teach them to weigh things in an impartial balance, and by the words of truth and ſoberneſs, to lead them into the paths of wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>

Attend ſeriouſly to theſe remarks, and then judge whether prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will not oblige you to purſue it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The religious education of children is a very rational method of engaging them to walk in the way in which they ſhould go.</p>
               <p>There is the moſt evident advantage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our early attempts of this kind, that we ſhall find the mind more open and diſengaged, not tainted with all thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles, nor enſlaved to thoſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular habits, which they would probably imbibe and contract in the advance of age.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025410_0040_0FCCE39A6B7DD1D0"/>
Though the paper on which we would write the knowledge of GOD be not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fair, it is clear of many a foul inſcription and deep blot, with which it would ſoon be covered. Though the garden, in which we would plant the fruits of holineſs, be not free from weeds, yet many of them are but (as it were) in the inviſible ſeed, and the reſt are not grown up to that luxuriant ſize, which we muſt expect, if due culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be omitted or delayed.</p>
               <p>It is a farther advantage which deſerves to be mentioned here, that infancy and childhood is the moſt impreſſible age; and as principles are then moſt eaſily admitted, ſo they are moſt firmly retained. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, thoſe judicious obſervers of human nature, as well as many modern writers, are full of this remark in their diſcourſes on education, and illuſtrate it by a great many beautiful alluſions which are well known.</p>
               <p>The new veſſel takes a laſting tincture from the liquor which is firſt poured in: The ſoft clay is eaſily faſhioned into what form you pleaſe: The young plant may be bent with a gentle hand; and the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters engraved on the tender bark, grow deeper and larger on the advancing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> theſe golden opportunities; and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025410_0041_0FCCE39CF297FB08"/>
as it is certain they will either be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or perverted; and that if they are not preſſed into the ſervice of religion, they will be employed as dangerous artillery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, "With all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtances we cannot infuſe grace into the hearts of our children; and after all our precautions, corrupt nature will prevent us and fix a wrong bias on the mind, before we can attempt to direct it aright." A mournful, but too evident truth! which, far from denying or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, I would often declare and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; and the rather now, as it greatly confirms my argument. Are the influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a degenerate nature unavoidably ſo ſtrong, and will you ſuffer them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by theſe additional advantages? Do you apprehend, that, running with the footmen, you ſhall be in danger of fainting; and do you for that very reaſon chuſe to contend with the horſemen? You cannot, ſure, in the face of ſo much reaſon and ſcripture, urge this as an excuſe againſt making any attempts at all of this kind; and how then is it an apology for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of thoſe, which are, (other things being equal) the moſt rational and eaſy? But the trifling plea is more evidently ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, by obſerving,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:025410_0042_0FCCE39EC6E7FD78"/>2. The religious education of children is a method which GOD has appointed; and this greatly increaſes the probability of its ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>I aſſuredly know (and may GOD more deeply engrave it in our hearts!) that with regard to your labours as well as our's, <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but GOD that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> But conſider, I beſeech you, how that increaſe is to be hoped for: Is it in the omiſſion, or in the uſe of preſcribed means? I urge it on your conſciences, my friends, that religious education is an ordinance of GOD, which, therefore, you may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope he will honour with a bleſſing. And you might as juſtly expect, that your ſouls ſhould flouriſh in an unneceſſary ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the table and houſe of the LORD, or an habitual neglect of reading and prayer; as that your children ſhould grow up for GOD, while you fail in your endeavours to engage them in his ſervice. I repeat it again, religious education is an ordinance of GOD. And is it a work of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and difficulty to prove the aſſertion? Which of you does not know, that chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an parents are ſolemnly charged to <hi>bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the LORD;</hi> and that even under the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025410_0043_0FCCE39F9AE354D0"/>
Moſaic oeconomy, GOD urged it on his people in a very affecting manner? Surely you muſt have obſerved, how ſtrictly GOD charges it upon the Jews to take all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to this purpoſe, occaſional as well as ſtated. <hi>Theſe words,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart; and thou ſhalt teach them diligently to thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>thou ſhalt teach them to thy ſons, and thy ſons ſons.</hi> Plainly recommending a care of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, as well as immediate deſcendants of grand-children, as well as children. Thus when GOD <hi>eſtabliſhed a teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Iſrael, he commanded the fathers, that they ſhould make them known unto their children; that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come might know them, even the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that ſhould be born, that they ſhould ariſe and declare them to their children;</hi> that ſo religion might be tranſmitted to every riſing age. You cannot be ignorant of ſuch paſſages as theſe, which need no comment to explain them, and conſequently you cannot but know, that the religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of children is a divine inſtitution, as well as in itſelf a moſt rational attempt: After which you will not wonder to hear,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:025410_0044_0FCCE3A1131D66F0"/>3. That it has in fact been attended with very happy ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge that the great GOD does not confine himſelf to work by this way; and that he ſometimes diſplays his ſovereignty in viſibly turning out of it. We acknowledge, that he ſometimes leaves thoſe who have been, as it were, born and brought up in his family, to forſake it in a very ſcandalous manner; while he ſeems to go into the territories of ſatan; into ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, carnal, prophane families, and takes from thence perſons, whom he erects as trophies of free, ſurpriſing, and (as Mr. Howe juſtly expreſſes it) "unaccountable grace." But you well know, that theſe are more rare and uncommon caſes: And though ſome of you, my friends, are (and I hope never will forget it) happy inſtances of the ſingular divine goodneſs; yet moſt of you, as I apprehend, were trained up in the knowledge of GOD, and are living mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the ſucceſs which has attended the care of parents, or maſters in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The greater part of thoſe, who have of late been admitted to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, have, to my certain knowledge, mentioned it with thankfulneſs; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice to think, how many of the riſing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration among us (if even a child may be
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025410_0045_0FCCE69C0AF490C0"/>
known by his doings) are like to increaſe the number, and give us an encouraging hope that they will at length be ſet as olive plants around the LORD'S table, as well as your's. I perſuade myſelf it is ſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and think I may pronounce it with ſome confidence, that the families of GOD'S children are generally ſpeaking the nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his church. Solomon, no doubt, had obſerved, that a good education had generally been ſucceſsful, or we could by no means account for the remark in the text; and a very accurate writer of our own age and nation has carried it ſo far as to ſay, "That of all the men we meet with, nine parts in the ten are what they are, good or bad, uſeful or not, according to their education."</p>
               <p>I hope you are by this time convinced, that, humanly ſpeaking, there is great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that religious education may be the effectual means of promoting ſerious piety in the riſing age; which was the ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by which I was to recommend it: An argument, which may be greatly ſtrengthened, by obſerving,</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the ſucceſs, which we may ſo reaſonably expect, is a matter of very high importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:025410_0046_0FCCE69D60B2F0F0"/>It is of evident importance, to the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of GOD, and the ſupport of religion— to the preſent and future happineſs of our children—and to your own comfort both in life and death. Weighty and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive thoughts! which I ſhall briefly touch, and to which I beg you will renew your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The honour of GOD, and intereſt of a Redeemer, is greatly concerned in the behaviour of your children; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in your care of their education, which is like to have ſo great an influence upon it.</p>
               <p>We live in a dying world. Our fathers, where are they? Sleeping in the duſt, as we muſt ſhortly be. We are ſure, that in a little, a very little while, theſe places muſt know us no more: And when we are mouldering in the houſe of ſilence, who muſt fill our places in the houſe of GOD? Who muſt riſe up in our ſtead for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of religion among thoſe who ſucceed us? From whom can it be expected, but from our children? Yet how can we expect it from theſe, in the neglect of a method, which comes recommended by ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtances? "Yes," you will perhaps be ready to ſay, "GOD will
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025410_0048_0FCCE6A062354F18"/>
take care of his own cauſe, and almighty grace will do what we have not attempted, becauſe we knew that we could not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it." Almighty grace can indeed do it; and almighty power can of theſe ſtones, on which we tread, raiſe up children to Abraham. But ſhew me your warrant from the word of GOD for expecting it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the one caſe, or in the other. You will poſſibly anſwer, "He has promiſed to be ever with his church, and that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it; but that one generation ſhall ariſe and declare his might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> works unto another, and that the kingdom of his ſon ſhall continue as long as the ſun and moon endure." Bleſſed be his name for theſe encouraging promiſes, which ſhall, no doubt, be accompliſhed. But where has he engaged, that this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall always continue among us? Such paſſages as theſe will no more prove, that the goſpel ſhall never be removed from Great-Britain, than they would once have proved, that it ſhould never be taken away from Pergamos or Thyatira, or any other of the Aſian churches, which have ſo many ages ago been given up to deſolation.</p>
               <p>Now let me intreat you for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to dwell upon that thought; what if the goſpel ſhould be loſt from among your deſcendants! what if in the age of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025410_0047_0FCCE69EF7191A40"/>
theſe little ones, or the next who ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to their's, the houſe of the LORD ſhould be forſaken, and his table abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? What if the miniſtry ſhould be grown into diſuſe, or the ſervants of CHRIST in it ſhould have nothing to do, but to bear a fruitleſs teſtimony againſt an unbelieving generation, till (when their hearts are broken with ſo ſad an office) the goſpel here die with them, and religion be buried in their graves? Is it a thought eaſily to be ſupported by a true Iſraelite, that the ark of the LORD ſhould thus be loſt, and GOD ſhould write upon us Ichabod, the ſad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of a departed glory!</p>
               <p>It would ſurely be peculiarly melancholy, that religion ſhould die in the hands of thoſe who were the children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And were not your's ſo? In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, my friends, permit me to ſay, that I am a witneſs among ſome of you. When you have offered your children to baptiſm, you have delivered them into my hands, with an expreſs declaration of your ſincere deſire, that they might be devoted to GOD; and have received them again with a ſolemn charge and promiſe to bring them up for him, if their lives ſhould be continued. And as for thoſe of you, who do not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe this inſtitution, I doubt not, but many of you are equally faithful in dedicating
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025410_0049_0FCCE6A2DFD8CD30"/>
your infant offspring to GOD. Is it not then reaſonable to expect from both, that they ſhould be brought up as a ſeed to ſerve him? And from whom may we hope it, if not from you? If you have experienced the power of divine grace upon your own ſouls, and have ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed that the LORD is gracious, methinks it ſhould awaken a holy zeal to ſpread the ſweet ſavour of his name and word wherever you come: You ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to the utmoſt for the advancement of his goſpel among all your acquaintance, and even among ſtrangers; how much more in your own families, among thoſe whom you have from him, among thoſe whom you have ſo ſolemnly given back to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The character of your children, and conſequently your care in their education, is of the moſt evident importance, to their preſent and future happineſs.</p>
               <p>I need not employ a great deal of time in proving the truth of the aſſertion.

Vain, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prepoſterous care! which, to uſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain ſimile, is but like employing your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in trimming and adorning its clothes, while the child itſelf were fallen into the fire, and would be in danger of being deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed, if not immediately plucked out. Haſten to do it with an earneſtneſs anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the extremity of the caſe, and ſo much the rather, as the danger is in part owing to you.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay, how far your perſonal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in conduct may have been a ſnare and a temptation, to your children; nor can I pretend to determine it. But I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this, that they have derived from you a corrupt and degenerate nature. Through your veins the original infection, which tainted the firſt authors of our race, has flowed down to them. And is not this an affecting thought? and ought it not to quicken you to attempt their relief?</p>
               <p>Dr. Tillotſon ſets this in a very moving light: "When a man has by treaſon taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his blood and forfeited his eſtate, with what grief and regret does he look on his children, and think of the injury he has
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025410_0052_0FCCE6A8D8B0D0E8"/>
done to them by his fault: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd how ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous is he before he dies to petition the king for favour to his children! How earneſtly does he charge his friends to be careful of them, and kind to them!" We are thoſe traitors. Our children have derived from us a tainted blood, a forfeited Inheritance. How tenderly ſhould we pity them! How ſolicitouſly ſhould we exert ourſelves to prevent their ruin! Mr. Flavel expreſſes the thought ſtill more pathetically. "Should I bring the plague into my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and live to ſee all my poor children lie dying by the walls of my houſe; if I had not the heart of a tyger, ſuch a ſight would melt my very ſoul." And ſurely, I may add, were there a ſovereign antidote at hand, perhaps an antidote I had myſelf uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould I not direct them to it, and urge them to try it, I ſhould be ſtill more ſavage and criminal. The application <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s eaſy: The LORD deeply impreſs it on your ſouls, that your dear children may not die eternally of the malignant plague they have taken from you!</p>
               <p>This is one conſideration, which ſhould certainly add a great deal of weight to the argument I am now upon. I will conclude the head with the mention of another: I mean, the peculiar advantages which you their parents have for addreſſing yourſelves

to them. You, who have known them from their infancy, are beſt acquainted with their temper, and manner of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; you, who are daily with them, may watch the moſt tender moments, the moſt favourable opportunities of pleading with them; your melting affection for them, will ſuggeſt the moſt endearing ſentiments and words on ſuch occaſions: Their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to you, and love for you, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably diſpoſe them to attend with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pleaſure to what you may ſay; or your authority over them, your power of correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a ſenſe of their dependance upon you in life, may prevent much of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and contempt, which from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe tempers, others might expect, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they were not ſupported by your concurrence, in their attempts to inſtruct and reform your children.</p>
               <p>On the whole then, ſince your obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and your encouragements to attempt the work are ſo peculiar, I may reaſonably hope you will allow its due weight to this ſecond conſideration, that the character and conduct of your children, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently your care in their education, is of the higheſt importance to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future happineſs.

You will not only be ſecure of their dutiful and grateful behaviour to you, but will have the pleaſure of ſeeing them grow up in their different ſtations, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of uſefulneſs in the church, and in the world. Should Providence ſpare you to the advance of age, they will be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and honour to your declining years.

And at length, when GOD gives you a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from a world, which the folly and wickedneſs of your children has ſo long imbittered, how painful will the ſeparation be; when you have the proſpect of ſeeing them but once more, and that at the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of GOD, where the beſt you can expect (in their preſent circumſtance) is to riſe up in judgment againſt them, and to bear an

I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that if you knew the weight with which theſe things will ſit upon your mind, in the immediate views of the eternal world, you would not ſuffer every trifling difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or little care, to deter you from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of thoſe duties, which are ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent theſe galling reflections.</p>
               <p>To conclude: Let me intreat you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to weigh the united force of thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which I have now been urging to excite your diligence in this momentuous care of training up your children in the way in which they ſhould go. Conſider how pleaſant the attempt is: Conſider how fair a probability there is that it may proſper, as it is in itſelf a very rational method, as it is a method GOD has appointed, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which he has crowned with ſingular ſucceſs: Conſider how important that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

               <p>Thirdly, To offer ſome advice for your aſſiſtance in this attempt, of leading chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into, and conducting them in this way.</p>
               <p>Theſe will relate—partly to the manner in which the attempt is to be made—and partly to the precautions neceſſary for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it effectual: Which are, as you ſee, matters of diſtinct conſideration, though comprehended under the general head of directions.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As to the manner in which the attempt is to be made.</p>
               <p>And here it is evident, it ſhould be done plainly, ſeriouſly, tenderly and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</p>

                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:025410_0061_0FCCE6B79F126C08"/>1. Children are to be inſtructed plainly: In the plaineſt things, and by the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt words.</p>
               <p>They are to be taught the plaineſt things in religion in the firſt place. And it is a pleaſing reflection on this occaſion, that according to the abundant goodneſs and condeſcenſion of the great GOD, thoſe things which are the moſt neceſſary are the plaineſt. Juſt as in the world of nature, thoſe kinds of food, which are moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and nouriſhing, are alſo the moſt common. We ſhould ſhew our grateful ſenſe of the divine goodneſs in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by our care to imitate it; and ſhould ſee to it, that when the neceſſities of our children require bread, we do not give them a ſtone, or chaff; as we ſhould do, if we were to diſtract their feeble minds with a variety of human ſchemes, and doubtful diſputations. The more abſtruſe and myſterious truths of the goſpel are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to be unfolded, as they are exhibited in the oracles of GOD, and to be taught in the language of the ſpirit; according to the excellent advice of the great Dr. Owen, "making ſcripture phraſeology our rule and pattern in the declaration of ſpiritual things. But we muſt not begin here. We muſt feed them with milk while they
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025410_0062_0FCCE6B92237D788"/>
are babes, and reſerve the ſtrong meat for a maturer age. Take the moſt obvious and vital truths of chriſtianity. Tell them, that they are creatures, and ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; that by ſin they have diſpleaſed a holy GOD; and that they muſt be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſanctified, and accepted in CHRIST, or muſt periſh for ever. Shew them the difference between ſin and holineſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſtate of nature and of grace. Shew them, that they are haſtening on to death and judgment, and ſo muſt enter on heaven or hell, and dwell for ever in the one or the other. Such kind of leſſons will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably turn to the beſt account, both to them and you. I know it is a very eaſy thing to inflame the warm, ignorant minds of children with an eager zeal for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing forms, or diſtinguiſhing phraſes; and to make them violent in the intereſt of a party, before they know any thing of common chriſtianity. But if we thus ſow the wind, we ſhall probably reap the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; venting ourſelves, and transfuſing into them, a wrath of man, which never works, but often greatly obſtructs the righteouſneſs of GOD. Bleſſed be GOD, this is not the fault of you, my friends, of this congregation. I would mention it with great thankfulneſs, as both your happineſs and mine, that ſo far as I can judge, it is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025410_0063_0FCD26C495B5C128"/>
the ſincere milk of the word that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Let it be your care to draw it out for the nouriſhment of your children's ſouls, as their underſtandings and capacities will permit them to take it in.</p>
               <p>And while you are teaching them the plaineſt things, endeavour to do it in the plaineſt words. It is the gracious method which GOD uſes with us, who ſpeaks to us of heavenly things in language, not fully expreſſive of the ſublimity and grandeur of the ſubject, but rather ſuited to our feeble apprehenſions. Thus our LORD taught his diſciples, as they were able to bear it; and uſed eaſy and familiar ſimilitudes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the moſt obvious occurrences in life, to illuſtrate matters of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. A moſt inſtructive example! Such condeſcenſion ſhould we uſe, in training up thoſe committed to our care, and ſhould examine whether we take their underſtandings along with us, as we go on: Otherwiſe we are ſpeaking in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue; and as the Apoſtle expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it, are barbarians unto them, be our language ever ſo grateful, elegant or pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to add, for the concluſion of this head, that though it is to be taken for granted, that children in their earlieſt infancy are to be engaged to what is good,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025410_0064_0FCD26C615F402A8"/>
and to be reſtrained from evil, chiefly by a view to rewards and puniſhments, more immediate or remote, or by ſome natural workings of a benevolent affection, which are by all means to be cheriſhed and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; yet, as they may grow up to greater ripeneſs of underſtanding, ſomething far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be attempted. It muſt then be our care, to ſet before them in the ſtrongeſt light, the natural beauties of holineſs, and deformities of ſin; and likewiſe to propoſe, in the eaſieſt and moſt familiar way, the evidences of the truth of chriſtianity, that they may be fortified againſt thoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to infidelity, with which the preſent age does ſo unhappily abound. The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidences of it are by no means to be ſlighted, ſuch as the credibility of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hiſtory, the accompliſhment of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the unity of deſign carried on by ſo many different perſons in diſtant ages and countries, its amazing and even miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous propagations in the world; all which, with many other conſiderations to the ſame purpoſe, are very judiciouſly handled in a variety of excellent writings of our own age: of which I know not any more ſuited to your uſe, than Mr. Bennet's diſcourſes on the inſpiration of ſcripture, which I therefore recommend to your attentive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal; and with them Dr. <hi>Watts'</hi> ſermons
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025410_0065_0FCD26C877B513F0"/>
on the inward witneſs to the truth of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, from its efficacious tendency to promote holineſs: This appears to me the nobleſt evidence of all, and will to thoſe who have actually experienced it, be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of the ſoul both ſure and ſtead faſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Children ſhould be inſtructed in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerious manner.</p>
               <p>There is an unhappy proneneſs in our degenerate natures to trifle with the things of GOD; and the giddineſs of childhood is peculiarly ſubject to it. Great care ſhould therefore be taken, that we do not encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſuch an humour, nor teach them by our levity or indolence in the manner of our inſtruction, to take the awful name of GOD in vain, while they are ſpeaking of him, or to him. For this purpoſe we muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with our own hearts, to work them to a deep and ſerious ſenſe of the truth and importance of what we ſay: This will give us an unaffected ſolemnity in ſpeaking, which will probably command the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and impreſs the hearts of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Endeavour to preſerve on your own ſpirit, an habitual awe of the great and bleſſed GOD, the LORD of heaven and earth: that when you ſpeak of him to thoſe little creatures, they may evidently ſee the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025410_0066_0FCD26C9CE3AC2E0"/>
indications of the humbleſt veneration and reverence, and ſo may learn to fear him from their youth. When you ſpeak of CHRIST, let your ſouls be bowing to him as the ſon of GOD, through whom alone you and your's can obtain pardon and life; and let them be overflowing with love to him, for his unutterable and inconceivable grace. And when you remind them of death, judgment and eternity, conſider yourſelves and them as dying creatures: Think in how few months, or weeks, or days, your lips may be ſilent in the duſt, or they may be for ever removed beyond the reach of your inſtructions; and plead with them in as earneſt and importunate a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if the ſalvation of their immortal ſouls depended on the effect of the preſent addreſs.

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025410_0067_0FCD26CB4BF412E8"/>
happineſs. Study therefore to addreſs them in the moſt endearing language, as well as with the ſofteſt and ſweeteſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Endeavour, according to the practice of Solomon, to find out acceptable words. And if tears ſhould ariſe while you are ſpeaking do not ſuppreſs them. There is a language in them, which may perhaps affect beyond words. A weeping parent is both an awful and a melting ſight.</p>
               <p>Endeavour therefore to look upon your children in ſuch a view, as may be moſt likely to awaken theſe tender ſentiments. Conſider them as creatures, whom you (as inſtruments) have brought into being, tainted with innate corruption, ſurrounded with ſnares, and on the whole, in ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger, that if not ſnatched as brands out of the burning, they muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh for ever. And that your hearts may be further mollified, and that you may be formed to the moſt gentle and moving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of addreſs, let me intreat you to ſtudy the ſcripture in this view, and to obſerve the condeſcending and endearing forms in which the bleſſed GOD ſpeaks to us there. Obſerve them for yourſelves, and point them out to your children. Tell them, how kindly he has demanded, how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he has encouraged their ſervices; while he ſays, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025410_0068_0FCD26CEAA5CC9A0"/>
the days of thy youth;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall find me.</hi> Tell them that the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath invited them to come to him; for he has ſaid, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt: Him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out: And whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.</hi> Such ſcriptures as theſe ſhould be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to them, and ſhould be early incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated on their memory, with an attempt, as far as poſſible, to let them into the ſpirit and force of them.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be improper ſometimes to ſet before them, how much you have done, how much you are ready to do for them; how many anxious thoughts you entertain, how many ſervent prayers you offer on their account. Thus Lemuel's mother ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him, <hi>What, my ſon? and what, the ſon of my womb? and what, the ſon of my vows?</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid, <q>My dear child, for whom I have borne ſo much, for whom I have prayed ſo earneſtly; in what words ſhall I addreſs thee, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what my heart feels on thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? How ſhall I ſpeak my affectionate overflowing concern for thy happineſs both for time and eternity?</q> So Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pleads, <hi>My ſon, if thine heart be wiſe,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025410_0069_0FCD26D0D5F2DDB0"/>
my heart ſhall rejoice, even mine:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, "Think how much is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that argument, that a parent's happineſs is in a great meaſure to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by thy character and conduct." And the apoſtle Paul lays open his heart to the Gallatians in thoſe prophetic words, <hi>My lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children of whom I travail in birth again, until</hi> CHRIST <hi>be formed in you.</hi> Yet theſe were comparatively, ſtrangers to him. And ſhould not you, my friends, feel, ſhould not you expreſs an equal tenderneſs for thoſe who are indeed parts of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? But further,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Children ſhould be inſtructed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</p>
               <p>You know, when the huſbandman has committed the ſeed to the ground, he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expects the fruits of his labours. So muſt miniſters do, when inſtructing their people: So muſt parents do, when inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their children. You muſt not imagine, my friends, that a plentiful harveſt will ſpring up in a day. The growth of nature is ſlow, and by inſenſible degrees: Nor are you to wonder, if advances in knowledge and grace be ſtill flower. Be upon your guard therefore againſt fretfulneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. Your children will forget what
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025410_0070_0FCD26D2124EB4E0"/>
you have once taught them; repeat it a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time; and if they forget it the ſecond time, repeat it the third. It is thus the great GOD deals with you; and you have daily reaſon to rejoice that he does. He knows the frailty and weakneſs of your minds, and therefore acts by a rule, which ſeems to be laid down with a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the very point I am urging: <hi>Whom ſhall he teach knowledge, and whom ſhall he make to underſtand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breaſts? For precept muſt be upon precept, precept upon precept, and line upon line, line upon line; here a little and there a little:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, "GOD has treated you like little children, who muſt have the ſame ſhort eaſy leſſon repeated again and again." And is it not indeed thus with regard to you? Does not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and condeſcenſion of your heavenly Father ſend to you his miniſters, Sabbath after Sabbath, frequently inculcating the ſame things, that what you have forgot may be brought to mind again? Thus ſhould you do by thoſe committed to your care.</p>
               <p>Be teaching them every Sabbath: That is remarkably a good day for the purpoſe. Then you have leiſure for it; then you have particular advantage to purſue the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025410_0071_0FCD26D39256CF18"/>
work; then you are furniſhed with ſome new matter by what you have heard in public; and I would hope your ſpirits are then quickened by it, ſo that you can ſpeak out of the abundance of your heart; and you may, by diſcourſing with them on what has been addreſſed to you, receive the impreſſion on your own ſouls.</p>
               <p>I add, be teaching them every day, by occaſional diſcourſes, when you have not an opportunity of doing it by ſtated addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Drop a word for GOD every day, and often in a day. You will probably find your account in it, and your children theirs. A ſudden glance of thought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD in the midſt of the world, is often a great refreſhment to the chriſtian; and a ſudden turn to ſomething ſerious and ſpiritual in converſation, is frequently very edifying to others. It ſtrikes the memory and the heart, and is, perhaps, as a nail fixed in a ſure place, when many a ſolemn admonition, and many an elaborate ſermon is loſt. It is with pleaſure that I frequently hear good chriſtians ſpeaking of ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional hints, which have been dropped by ſaints of the former generation: Thoſe tranſient paſſages, which the pious parents might forget in a few moments, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have diſtinctly remembered for many future years, and repeated for their own
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025410_0072_0FCD26D51CDAD358"/>
edification, and I might add for mine. Let this therefore be an encouragement to you; and in this reſpect, in the morning ſow this precious ſeed, and in the evening withhold not your hand, ſince you know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall proſper, or whether both ſhall be alike good.</p>
               <p>Once more, let me intreat you to repeat your pious inſtructions and admonitions, even though your children ſhould grow up to years of maturity, without appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to profit by them. Say not, that you can teach them no more than they already know; or, that you can try no new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which you have not already attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You ſee, that in our aſſemblies, GOD often brings back ſouls to himſelf by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting home on the conſcience truths, which, with regard to the ſpeculative part of them, they know as well as their teachers; and adds a divine efficacy to thoſe inſtitutions, which, for a long ſucceſſion of years, they had attended in vain. Be not therefore weary in well-doing; but let patience, in this inſtance, have its perfect work.</p>
               <p>Thus let your children be inſtructed plainly, ſeriouſly, tenderly, and patiently; I wave ſome other particulars, which I might have added to theſe, concerning the manner of inſtructing them, becauſe I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend they will more properly fall under
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025410_0073_0FCD26D6A278EF98"/>
the ſecond branch of theſe directions: Where I am further to adviſe you,</p>
               <p n="2">II. As to the precautions you muſt uſe, if you deſire that theſe attempts in the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious education of your children may be attended with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Here I would particularly adviſe, that a prudent care be taken to keep up your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, and at the ſame time to engage their affections to you; that you be ſolicitous to keep them out of the way of temptation; that you confirm your admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions by a ſuitable example; that you cheerfully accept of proper aſſiſtances in this important attempt; and that you humbly and conſtantly look up to GOD for his bleſſing on all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we deſire to ſucceed in our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for the religious education of our children, we muſt take care to keep up our authority over them.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, we muſt avoid, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is groſsly vicious and criminal (which will more properly be mentioned under a following head) but alſo thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle levities and follies which might make us appear contemptible to them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025410_0074_0FCD26D80CD09BF0"/>
liberties we may take with thoſe who are our equals in age and ſtation, a more exact decorum is to be preſerved before our children. Thus we are to reverence them, if we deſire they ſhould reverence us; for, as Dr. Tillotſon very juſtly obſerves, "There is a certain freedom of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is only proper among equals in age and quality, which if we uſe before our ſuperiors, we ſeem to deſpiſe them; and if we do it before our inferiors, we teach them to deſpiſe us."</p>
               <p>I will not inſiſt on this hint, which your own prudence muſt accommodate to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances; but ſhall here intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the mention of correction, which in ſome caſes may be abſolutely neceſſary to the ſupport of parental authority, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where admonitions and counſels are ſlighted.</p>
               <p>You know, that the ſcriptures expreſsly require it on proper occaſions; and Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in particular, enlarges on the head. and ſuggeſts ſome important thoughts with regard to it. Fooliſhneſs (ſays he) is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction ſhall drive it far from him. Nay, he ſpeaks of it as a matter in which life is concerned, even the life of the ſoul: Withhold not correction from a child; for if thou beat him with the rod, he ſhall not
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025410_0075_0FCD26DBB55E00A8"/>
die: Thou ſhalt beat him with the rod, and ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell. And is it kindneſs, or cruelty, in a parent, to ſpare the fleſh to the hazard of the ſoul? Parents are therefore exhorted to an early care in this reſpect, leſt vicious habits growing inveterate ſhould render the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt vain or hurtful; and they are cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned againſt that fooliſh tenderneſs, which would lead them to regard the tears of a child, rather than his trueſt and higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. <hi>Correct thy ſon while there is hope, and let not thy ſoul ſpare for his crying: He that ſpareth the rod, hateth his ſon; but he that loveth him, chaſteneth him betimes.</hi> Nor can we imagine a more lively commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on the words than the melancholy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Eli, who, though he was a very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſaint in a degenerate age, yet erred here, and by a fatal indulgence brought ruin, as well as infamy, on himſelf and his family. He reproved the abominable wickedneſs of his ſons; but did not make uſe of thoſe ſevere methods, which in ſuch a caſe the authority of a parent might have warranted, and the office of a judge did undoubtedly require. Obſerve the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which GOD pronounced againſt him for it, and which he executed upon him in a very awful manner. The LORD ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025410_0076_0FCD26DD4C546EE0"/>
at which both the ears of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle: In that day I will perform againſt Eli all things which I have ſpoken concerning his houſe; when I begin, I will alſo make an end. For I have told him that I will judge his houſe for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth; becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not: And therefore I have ſworn unto the houſe of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's houſe ſhall not be purged with ſacrifice nor offering for ever. Take heed, I entreat you, as you love your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as you love yourſelves, that it may not be ſaid of you, that your's have made themſelves vile, and you have neglected to reſtrain them. Let mothers, in particular take heed, that they do not, as it were, ſmother their children in their embraces; as a French author ſmartly expreſſes it. And let me remind you all particularly to be cautious, that the arms of one parent, be not a refuge to the children from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the other. Both ſhould appear to act in concert, or the authority of the one will be deſpiſed, and probably the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of the other abuſed, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection of both endangered.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay, that I enlarge on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with pleaſure; but how could I have anſwered for the omiſſion of what is ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025410_0077_0FCCE2F34A826248"/>
and ſo pathetically inculcated in the ſacred writings? It is indeed probable, that the rugged and ſervile temper of the generality of the Jewiſh nation, migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſevere diſcipline peculiarly neceſſary for their children; yet I fear, there are few of our families, where every thing of this kind can ſafely be neglected. But after all, I would by no means drive matters to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; and therefore cannot perſuade myſelf to diſmiſs the head without a caution or two. Take heed, that your corrections be not too frequent, or too ſevere—and that they be not given in an unbecoming manner.</p>
               <p>If your corrections be too frequent, it will probably ſpoil much of the ſucceſs. Your children, like iron, will harden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der repeated ſtrokes; and that ingenious ſhame will be gradually worn off, which adds the greateſt ſting to what they ſuffer from a parent's hand. And there will be this farther inconvenience attending it, that there will not be a due difference made, between great and ſmall faults. The laws of Draco the Athenian, were juſtly rejected, becauſe they puniſhed all crimes alike, and made the ſtealing of an apple capital, as well as the murder of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen. You, on the contrary, ſhould let your children ſee, that you know how to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025410_0078_0FCD26E056BD80B0"/>
diſtinguiſh between indiſcretion and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; and ſhould yourſelves appear moſt diſpleaſed, where you have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve GOD is ſo.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhould your corrections at any time be too ſevere. It is prettily ſaid by Dr. Tillotſon on this occaſion, "That whips are not the cords of a man:" They ſhould be uſed in a family, only (as the ſword in the republic) as the laſt remedy when all others have been tried in vain; and then ſhould be ſo uſed, as that we may appear to imitate the compaſſion of our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</p>
               <p>Which leads me to add, that we ſhould be greatly cautious, that correction be not inflicted in an unbecoming manner: and it always is ſo, when it is given in a paſſion. A parent's correcting his child ſhould be regarded as an act of domeſtic juſtice, which therefore ſhould be adminiſtered with a due ſolemnity and decorum; and to behave otherwiſe on the occaſion, is almoſt as great an indecency, as for a judge to paſs ſentence in a rage. It is injurious to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it tends to ſpoil our own temper; for peeviſhneſs and paſſion will grow upon us, by being indulged towards thoſe who dare not oppoſe them: And it is on many accounts injurious to our children. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025410_0079_0FCD26E2DFD08418"/>
intimates, that correction and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be joined, when he ſays, <hi>The rod and reproof give wiſdom.</hi> But what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m is there for the ſtill voice of wiſdom to be heard in a ſtorm of fury? If your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſee, that you act calmly and mildly; if they read parental tenderneſs in your heart, through an awful frown on your brow; if they perceive that correction is your ſtrange work, a violence which you offer to yourſelves from a principle of duty to GOD and affection to them; they muſt be obdurate indeed, if they do not receive it with reverence and love; for this is both a venerable and an amiable character. But if once they imagine, that you chaſtiſe them merely to vent your paſſion, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify your reſentment, they will ſecretly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe, and perhaps hate you for it: In that inſtance at leaſt, they will look upon you as their enemies, and may, by a continued courſe of ſuch ſeverities, contract ſuch an averſion, not only to you, but to all that you recommend to them. Thus you may loſe your authority and your influence, by the very method you take to ſupport it, and may turn a wholeſome, though bitter medicine, into poiſon. But I hope and truſt, that your humanity and your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will concur to prevent ſo fatal an abuſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:025410_0080_0FCD26E40AAC1DE0"/>2. If you deſire ſucceſs in your attempts for the education of your children, you muſt be careful to ſecure their affection to you.</p>
               <p>Our LORD obſerves, that if any man love him, he will keep his word; and the aſſertion is applicable to the preſent caſe: The more your children love you, the more will they regard your i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ructions and admonitions. GOD has indeed made it their duty to love you, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible laws of gratitude require it: yet ſince ſo many children are evidently wanting in filial affection, it is certain that all this may not ſecure it in your's, unleſs you add a tender obliging behaviour to all the other benefits you have conferred upon them. I obſerved under a former head, that you ſhould addreſs them in an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate manner when diſcourſing on reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſubjects; but now I add, that you ſhould carry the temper through life, and be daily endeavouring to render yourſelves amiable to them. The Apoſtle cautions parents that they ſhould not provoke their children to wrath, if they would bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the LORD: On the contrary, you ſhould put on the kindeſt looks, you ſhould uſe the moſt endearing and condeſcending lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025410_0081_0FCCE2F4980D93D8"/>
you ſhould overlook many little failings, and expreſs a high complacency in what is really regular and laudable in their behaviour. And though you muſt ſometimes over rule their deſires, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently eager, yet far from delighting ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to croſs them, you ſhould rather ſtudy their inclinations, that you may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them with unexpected favours. Thus will they learn quietly to refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to your care, and will more eaſily ſubmit to mortification and denial, when it is not made neceſſary by clamourous and impetuous demands. On the whole, you ſhould endeavour to behave ſo, as that your children may love your company, and of choice be much in it; which will preſerve them from innumerable ſnares, and may furniſh you with many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of forming their temper and behaviour by imperceptible degrees, to what may be decent, amiable and excellent.</p>
               <p>If you manage theſe things with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you need not fear, that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions, as I have now recommended, will impair your authority; far from that, they will rather eſtabliſh it. The ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your parental character may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the midſt of theſe indulgences; and when it is thus attempered, it is moſt likely to produce that mixture of reverence
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025410_0082_0FCD26E587065318"/>
and love, by which the obedience of a child is to be diſtinguiſhed from that of a ſlave.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt be ſolicitous to keep your children out of the way of temptation, if you would ſee the ſucceſs of your care in their education.</p>
               <p>If you are not on your guard here, you will probably throw down what you have built, and build up that which you have been endeavouring to deſtroy. An early care muſt be taken to keep them from the occaſions, and the very appearances of evil. We would not venture their infant ſteps on the brink of a precipice on which grown perſons, who know how to adjuſt the poiſe of their bodies, may walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extreme danger. More hazardous might it be, to allow them to trifle with temptations, and boldly to venture to the utmoſt limits of that which is lawful. An early tenderneſs of conſcience may be a great preſervative; and the exceſs of ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (though no exceſs be deſirable,) may prove much ſafer than an exceſs of liberty.</p>
               <p>Bad company is undoubtedly one of the moſt formidable and pernicious entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By forming friendſhips with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a vicious character, many a hopeful youth has learnt their ways, and found a
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025410_0083_0FCD26E9FA6FB780"/>
fatal ſnare to his ſoul. You ſhould be very watchful to prevent their contracting ſuch dangerous friendſhips; and where you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any thing of that kind, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by all gentle and endearing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, to draw them off from them; but if they ſtill perſiſt, you muſt reſolve to cut the knot you cannot untie, and let your children know, they muſt either renounce their aſſociates, or their parents. One re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſtep of this kind might have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ruin of multitudes, who have fallen a ſacrifice to the importunities of wicked companions, and the weak indulgence of imprudent parents, who have contented themſelves with blaming, what they ought ſtrenuouſly to have redreſſed.</p>
               <p>All bad company is, in this reſpect, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable; but that is moſt evidently ſo, which is to be found at home. Great care ought therefore to be taken, that you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none into your families, who may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch the tender minds of your children, by pernicious opinions, or by vicious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. This is a caution which ſhould be particularly remembered, in the caſe of ſervants. Take heed you do not bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your families ſuch as may diffuſe infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the ſouls of your dear off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. It is a thouſand times better to put up with ſome inconveniences and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025410_0084_0FCD26EB886CE7F8"/>
when you have reaſon to believe a ſervant fears GOD, and will from a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conſcience be faithful in watching over your children, and in ſeconding your religious care in their education; than to prefer ſuch, as while they are, perhaps, managing your temporal affairs ſomething better, may pervert your children to the ſervice of the devil. I fear, ſome parents little think, how much ſecret miſchief theſe baſe creatures are doing. And it is very poſſible, that if ſome of you recollect what you may have obſerved among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of your childhood, you may find inſtances of this nature, which riper years have ſince given you opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. See to it therefore, that you be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently on your guard here.</p>
               <p>Again: If you ſend your children to places of education, be greatly cautious in your choice of them. Dearly will you purchaſe the greateſt advantages for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the expenſe of thoſe of a religious nature. And I will turn out of my way to add, that ſchool-maſters and tutors will have a dreadful account to give, if they are not faithfully and tenderly ſolicitous for the ſouls of thoſe committed to their care. The LORD pardon our many defects here, and quicken us to greater diligence and zeal!—But to return:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:025410_0085_0FCD26EE043AAC10"/>Give me leave only to add, that it is of the higheſt importance, if you would not have all your labour in the education of your children loſt, that you ſhould be greatly cautious with regard to their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world. Apprenticeſhips and marriages, into irreligious families, have been the known ſources of innumerable evils. They, who have expoſed the ſouls of their children to apparent danger, for the ſake of ſome ſecular advantages, have often lived to ſee them drawn aſide to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices ruinous to their temporal, as well as their eternal intereſts. Thus their own iniquity has remarkably corrected them: And I heartily pray that the GOD of this world may never be permitted thus to blind your eyes; but that you, my friends, may learn, from the calamities of other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that wholeſome leſſon, which, if you neglect it, others may perhaps here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after learn from the ruin of yours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. See to it, that you confirm your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions by a ſuitable example, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire on the whole that they ſhould prove uſeful to your children.</p>
               <p>A conſciouſneſs of the irregularity of our own be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>viour, in any remarkable inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may fall under their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025410_0086_0FCD26EF9994D7E8"/>
will probably abate much of that force and authority with which we might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe addreſs them. When we know they may juſtly retort upon us, at leaſt in their minds, thoſe words of the apoſtle, thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thyſelf? Surely a ſenſe of guilt and of ſhame muſt either entirely ſilence us, or at leaſt impair that freedom and confidence, with which we might otherwiſe have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted or rebuked.</p>
               <p>Or had we ſo much compoſure and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as to put on all the forms of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and virtue, could we expect regard, when our actions contradicted our diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or hope they ſhould reverence inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which their teachers themſelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to deſpiſe? It is in the general true, that there is a ſilent, but powerful oratory in example, beyond the force of the moſt elegant and expreſſive words; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of parents has often a particular weight with their children; which ſeems to be alluded to in that exhortation of St. Paul, <hi>Be ye followers</hi> (or imitators) <hi>of God, as dear children.</hi> So that on the whole, as a very celebrated writer well expreſſes it, "To give children good inſtruction, and a bad example, is but beckoning to them with the hand to ſhew them the way to heaven, while we take them by the hand
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025410_0087_0FCD26F0D1BDDEC0"/>
and lead them in the way to hell." We ſhould therefore moſt heartily concur in David's reſolution, as ever we hope our families ſhould be religious and happy: <hi>I will behave myſelf wiſely in a perfect way; I will walk within my houſe with a perfect heart.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. Cheerfully accept of all proper aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the education of your children, if you deſire it may ſucceed well.</p>
               <p>It will be your wiſdom to accept of the aſſiſtance, which may be offered, either from books or friends. Books may in this reſpect be very uſeful to you; the book of GOD above all; both to furniſh you with materials for this great work, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you in the manner of performing it. Other writings may be ſubſervient to this purpoſe. Wiſe and pious treatiſes on the ſubject of education may be read with great pleaſure and advantage; and you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſingular aſſiſtance from thoſe cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms, and prayers, and ſongs for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with which moſt of your families are now furniſhed, through the condeſcenſion of one valuable friend in writing them, and the generoſity of another in beſtowing them upon us. I hope you will expreſs your thankfulneſs to both, by a diligent care to
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:025410_0088_0FCD26F24927C7D0"/>
uſe them; and I perſuade myſelf, that you and yours may abundantly find your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in them; for while the language is ſo plain and eaſy, that even an infant may underſtand it, you will often find not only a propriety, but a ſtrength and ſublimity in the ſentiments, which may be improving to perſons of advanced capacities. There is much of that milk, by which ſtrong men may be entertained and nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>I add, that in this important work, you ſhould gladly embrace the aſſiſtance of pious and prudent friends. I can by no means approve that Lacedemonian law, which gave every citizen a power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his neighbour's children, and made it infamous for the parent to complain of it: Yet we muſt all allow, that conſidering the great importance of education, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the happineſs of families and the public, will require a mutual watchfulneſs over each other in this reſpect: Nor is there any imaginable reaſon to exclude this from the number of thoſe heads on which we are to admoniſh one another, and to conſider each other to provoke unto good works.</p>
               <p>Nothing ſeems more evident than this; and one would ſuppoſe, that perſons, who are acquainted with human nature, ſhould ſuſpect, that ſelf-love might work under
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025410_0089_0FCD26F58C651C68"/>
this form, and that they might be a little blinded by a partial affection to their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. Such a reflection might engage them at leaſt patiently, or rather thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to hear the ſentiments, and receive the admonitions of their friends on this head. But inſtead of this, there is in many people a kind of parental pride, (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion) which ſeldom fails to exert itſelf on ſuch an occaſion. They are ſo confident in their own way, and do ſo majeſterially deſpiſe the opinion of others, that one would almoſt imagine, they took it for granted, that with every child nature had given to the parent a certain ſtock of infallible wiſdom for the management of it; or that, if they thought otherwiſe, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe their children ſhould be ruined by their own conduct, than ſaved by any foreign advice. If this arrogance only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the parents ridiculous, one ſhould not need to be greatly concerned about it; eſpecially as their high complacency in themſelves would make them eaſy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others might think or ſay of them: But when we conſider the unhappy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences it may produce, with regard to the temper and conduct of the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will appear a very ſerious evil, well worthy a particular mention, and a particular care to guard againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:025410_0090_0FCD26F6CDDC08E0"/>As for the aſſiſtance of miniſters in this work of education, I perſuade myſelf you will be ſo wiſe as thankfully to embrace it, both in public and private; and let me urge you to improve it to the utmoſt. Accuſtom your children to an early con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and ſeriouſneſs in attending divine ordinances, and be often yourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, and give us leave ſometimes to inquire how they advance in acquaintance with religion, and in love to it. And more particularly let them attend to our catechetical lectures, which are peculiarly intended for their ſervice.</p>
               <p>I bleſs GOD, I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will not at large inſiſt on the advantages which may attend it. You eaſily ſee, that it will be an engagement to the children to learn thoſe excellent ſummaries of divine truth, when their progreſs in them i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

manner may much improve their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in the doctrines and duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And I will add, you who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents may, by attending on theſe occaſions, poſſibly learn ſomething as to the way of opening and explaining things, which you may ſucceſsfully practiſe at home. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of all, we may hope, that, by the divine bleſſing, ſome good impreſſions may be made on the minds of children. And when they find a miniſter willing to take pains to inſtruct them; when they hear him ſeriouſly and tenderly pleading with them, and pleading with GOD for them, it may much engage their affections to him, and ſo promote his uſefulneſs among them, in other ordinances, and in future years. And give me leave to ſay upon this head, that as no wiſe and good miniſter will think it beneath him, to deſire the affection of the children of his congregation; ſo it is the duty of parents to cheriſh in their offspring, ſentiments of reſpect and love to all the faithful miniſters of CHRIST, and eſpecially towards thoſe who ſtatedly labour among them. Whatever miſtakes you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in our conduct, or whatever defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies in our public miniſtrations, you ſhould ſtudy to conceal them from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your children; leſt they ſhould grow up in contempt of thoſe, whoſe ſervices
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025410_0092_0FCD26FA16BD7110"/>
might otherwiſe be highly advantageous to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Be earneſt in prayer to GOD for his bleſſing on your attempts in the education of your children, if you deſire to ſee them ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>This I would leave with you as my laſt advice? and though I have had frequent occaſion to hint at it before, I would now more particularly urge it on your attentive regard. GOD is the author of every good and every perfect gift; it is He who has formed the mind and the tongue, and who teaches man knowledge and addreſs. On him therefore muſt you fix your depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to teach you ſo to conceive of divine things, and ſo to expreſs your conceptions of them, as may be moſt ſuited to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, the diſpoſitions, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of your children; and to him you muſt look to teach them to profit by all, by his almighty grace to open their ear unto diſcipline, and to bow their heart unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>A heathen poet could teach the Romans, in a form of public and ſolemn devotion, to look up to heaven for influences from thence, to form their youth to the love and practice of virtue. Surely you, my friends,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025410_0093_0FCD26FB46E0D958"/>
are under much greater obligations to do it, and that in a chriſtian manner; earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreating the GOD of grace, to ſend down on your riſing offspring the effuſions of that bleſſed ſpirit, which was purchaſed by the blood of CHRIST, and is depoſited in his compaſſionate hand. If you have taſted that the LORD is gracious, you are daily living on thoſe ſupplies; let it be your conſtant errand at the throne of grace, to plead for your children there. Wreſtle with GOD in ſecret, for the life of their ſouls, and for thoſe regenerating influences on which it depends; and in thoſe family devotions, which I hope you dare not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, let the little ones, from their earlieſt infancy, have a ſhare in your remembrance. You may humbly hope, that He, by whoſe encouragement and command you pray, will not ſuffer theſe ſupplications to be like water ſpilt upon the ground: and, in the nature of things, it may tend to make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious impreſſions on the minds of your children, to hear their own caſe mentioned in prayer, and may diſpoſe them with greater regard, to attend on what you ſay to them, when they find you ſo frequently, ſo ſolemnly, and ſo tenderly pleading with GOD for them.</p>
               <p>Doubt not that every faithful miniſter of CHRIST will moſt heartily concur with
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025410_0094_0FCD26FDAFAB9148"/>
you, in ſo great and neceſſary a requeſt. May GOD return to our united addreſſes an anſwer of peace!

               <p>IN treating on this ſubject of education, I have all along endeavoured, according to my uſual manner, to make my diſcourſes as practical as I could. While I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing and recommending the way, and offering my advices, with regard to the manner of conducting children into it, moſt of what I ſaid under thoſe generals was an application to you. I have therefore left myſelf the leſs to do here; yet I was not willing to conclude my diſcourſes on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which it is probable I ſhall never ſo largely reſume, without</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:025410_0096_0FCD270223418B10"/>Fourthly, a particular addreſs to my hearers, according to your different rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and characters in life.</p>
               <p>This I promiſed as my fourth and laſt general, and I enter on it without farther preface; humbly begging, that GOD, who has ſo intimate an acceſs to all our hearts, would enable me to ſpeak in the moſt awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and edifying manner; and that he would by his bleſſed ſpirit, apply it to your conſciences, that it may be as a nail faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſure place; that hearing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things for yourſelves, you may hear and know them for your good.</p>
               <p>I would here particularly addreſs myſelf —firſt to parents, then to children—and in the laſt place, to thoſe young perſons who are grown up to years of maturity, but not yet fixed in families of their own.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Let me addreſs my diſcourſe to thoſe of you who are parents; whether you have been negligent of the duties I have now been urging, or through grace have been careful in the diſcharge of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To thoſe who have been groſsly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent in this important care.</p>
               <p>I have here one advantage not common to every ſubject; I mean, that the guilty
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025410_0097_0FCD270387D48FF8"/>
will immediately know themſelves. When we apply ourſelves in general to uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinners, ignorance of the nature of true religion, a neglect of converſing with your own ſouls, or the inſinuating preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of ſelf-love, may diſguiſe the true ſtate of the caſe, and teach people to ſpeak peace to themſelves, under the moſt awful denunciations of wrath and vengeance. But here, one would imagine, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of a few moments might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to determine the caſe; becauſe the queſtion relates to paſt fact, and that not merely to one particular action, but to a long train and ſucceſſion of labours and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
               <p>Now let your conſciences witneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am guilty of a breach of charity, when I take it for granted, that there are ſome among you who have been, and are, very negligent of the duty I have now been enforcing? You have probably contented yourſelves with teaching your children to read, and ſetting them to learn, like par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, a prayer, and, perhaps too, a cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm and a creed. But I appeal to your conſciences. Have you from the very day of their birth to this time, ever ſpent one hour in ſeriouſly inſtructing them in the knowledge of GOD, and endeavouring to form them to his fear and ſervice; in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025410_0098_0FCD27053A6E1588"/>
before them the miſery of their natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al condition, and urging them to apply to CHRIST for life and ſalvation; in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the ſolemnities of death, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the eternal world, and urging an immediate and diligent preparation for them? Where is the time, where the place, that can witneſs, that you have been pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out your ſouls before GOD on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and wreſtling with him for their lives, as knowing they muſt periſh for ever, without the righteouſneſs of his SON, and the grace of his SPIRIT? Where, or when, have you thus prayed with them, or for them? What ſermon have you heard, what ſcripture have you read, with this thought, "This will I carry to my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and communicate to them as the food of their ſouls?" I fear there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of you who have been ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that you have hardly ever ſeriouſly thought of it as a thing to be done.</p>
               <p>And I would aſk, Why have you not thought of it, and why have you not done it? Are theſe creatures that you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced like the other animals of your houſes or your field, mere animated ſyſtems of fleſh and blood, made to take a turn in life for a few days and months, and then to ſink into everlaſting forgetfulneſs? Or are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>y rational and immortal creatures, that
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025410_0099_0FCD271A6EF6B098"/>
muſt exiſt for ever in heaven, or in hell? This is not a matter of doubt with you; and yet you behave, as if the very contrary to what you believe were evident, certain truth. In ſhort, it is the moſt barbarous part you act, and more like that of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my than a parent.</p>
               <p>It is not that you are inſenſible of the workings of parental tenderneſs. No, far from that: it may perhaps ſometimes riſe to a weak and criminal dotage: yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it again, you are acting an hoſtile and barbarous part. You are greatly ſolicitous for their temporal happineſs. For this you labour and watch; for this you deny your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many an enjoyment, and ſubject yourſelves to many an uneaſy circumſtance: But, alas! Sirs, where is the real friendſhip of all this, while the precious ſoul is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected? Your children are born with a corrupted nature, perverted by ſinful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ignorant of GOD, in a ſtate of growing enmity to him, and, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of all, expoſed to his wrath and curſe, and in the way to everlaſting ruin. In the mean time it is your great care, that they may paſs through this precarious, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary life, in eaſe and pleaſure, perhaps in abundance and grandeur; that is, in ſuch circumſtances, as will probably lull them into a forgetfulneſs of their danger,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025410_0100_0FCCE2FBC41BB648"/>
until there be no more hope. How cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el a kindneſs!</p>
               <p>It brings to my mind the account which an ancient writer gives of the old Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians, which I can never recollect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great emotion. He is ſpeaking of that diabolical cuſtom which ſo long prevailed among them, of offering their children to a deteſtable idol, which was formed in ſuch a manner that an infant put into his hands, which were ſtretched out to receive it, would immediately fall into a gulf of fire. He adds a circumſtance, which one cannot mention without horror; that the mothers, who with their own hands preſented the little innocents, thought it an unfortunate omen that the victim ſhould be offered weeping; and therefore uſed a great many fond artifices to divert it, that ſoothed by the kiſſes and careſſes of a parent, it might ſmile in the dreadful moment in which it was to be given up to the idol. Pardon me, my friends; ſuch is your parental care and love; ſuch your concern for the preſent eaſe and proſperity of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, while their ſouls are neglected: A fond ſolicitude, that they may paſs ſmiling into the hands of the deſtroyer!</p>
               <p>You know, with what juſt ſeverity GOD reckoned with the Iſraelites for their abom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inable wickedneſs, in taking his ſons and
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:025410_0101_0FCCE3009E6BAC88"/>
his daughters (for ſo he calls the children of his profeſſing people) and ſacrificing them to be devoured: And can you ſuppoſe, he will take no notice of the unnatural neglect of your's? Not to endeavour to ſave, is to deſtroy; and is it a little guilt, when an immortal ſoul is in queſtion? You probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember thoſe terrible words in Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; (may they be deeply inſcribed on the hearts of all whom they concern!) <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the houſe of Iſrael, therefore hear thou the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me? and if thou ſpeakeſt not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to ſave his life, the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> If ever you read this paſſage with attention, you must own it is exceedingly awful, and muſt be ready to ſay, "The LORD be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to miniſters! they have a ſolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to give." Indeed they have; and we thank you, if you ever beſtow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate thought and prayer upon us. But permit me to remind you, and though it be our caſe, it is not our's alone; you have likewiſe your ſhare in it. Your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are much more immediately commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your care, than you and they are committed to our's; and, by a parity of reaſon, if they periſh in their iniquities,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:025410_0102_0FCD27068C293C48"/>
while you neglect to give them warning, their blood will be required at your hand.</p>
               <p>And when GOD comes to make inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that blood, how will you be able to endure it? That awful day will open up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on you, and the tribunal of GOD, in all its terrors, will ſtand unveiled before you. Give me leave to direct your eyes to it in this diſtant proſpect, while there is yet room to mitigate thoſe terrors. If you go on in this cruel negligence of the ſouls of your children, how will you dare to meet them at that judgment-ſeat? How will you be able to anſwer the great FATHER of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when expoſtulating with you on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his offspring, as well as your's, who have been betrayed and ruined by your neglect? "Inhumane creatures," (may HE juſtly ſay) "to whom ſhould I have committed the care of them, rather than to you? Did they not, by my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, derive their being from you? Did I not implant in your hearts the natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affections of parents towards them? And to increaſe the obligation, did they not paſs through the tender ſcenes of infancy and childhood in your arms, and under your eye? If you had no compaſſion for their periſhing ſouls, if you would exert no efforts for their deliverance and ſalvation. from whom could thoſe compaſſions, thoſe
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025410_0103_0FCD270965FE3240"/>
efforts have been expected? But wherein did they appear? Behold the book of my remembrance, the records of thy life, thrown open before thee: Where is the memorial of one hour ſpent in holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or in fervent prayer with them, or for them? Can I approve, can I acquit you on ſuch a review? Or ſhall I not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſit for theſe things, and ſhall not my ſoul be avenged for ſuch a conduct as this?"</p>
               <p>And your children—will they be ſilent on the occaſion? Did Adam, in the diſtreſs and amazement of his ſoul, when in the preſence of his Judge, accuſe Eve his wife, ſo lately taken from his ſide, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his protection, and ſtill, no doubt, appearing lovely in the midſt of ſorrow? and will your children in that terrible day ſpare you? You may rather expect, they will labour to the utmoſt to aggravate a crime which coſts them ſo dear, that ſo they may, if poſſible, alleviate their own guilt, or if not, indulge their revenge. "O GOD," (may they perhaps then cry out in the moſt piercing accents of indignation and deſpair) "thou art righteous in the ſentence thou paſſeſt upon us, and we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die for our own iniquity. We have deſtroyed ourſelves. But wilt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that our ruin is in part chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025410_0104_0FCD270C5E3D3218"/>
here? Had theſe our parents been faithful to thee, and to us, it had perhaps been prevented. Had our infancy been formed by religious inſtruction, we might not have grown up to wickedneſs; we might not, in the advance of life, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed thy word, and trampled on thy ſon; but might this day have been owned by thee as thy children, and have riſen to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of light and glory, which we now behold at this unapproachable diſtance. Oh! curſed be the father who begat us; curſed the wombs that bare us; curſed the paps that gave us ſuck! Remember us, O LORD, whilſt thou art judging them; and let us have this one wretched comfort, in the midſt of all our agonies, that it is not with impunity that they have betrayed our ſouls!"</p>
               <p>This is indeed ſhocking and diabolical language; and for that very reaſon, it is ſo much the more probable on ſo dreadful an occaſion. And give me leave to aſk you one queſtion, my friends, and I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the head. If your children were thus crying out againſt you in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſouls, could you attempt to ſilence them, by reminding them of the care which you took of temporal affairs, or of the riches and grandeur in which you left them on earth? Nay, could you have
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025410_0105_0FCD270D5B7F46B0"/>
the heart ſo much as to mention ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle? And if you could not, then, in the name of GOD, Sirs, how do you ſatisfy yourſelves to confine all your thoughts and labours to that, which, by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, will neither ſecure your children from everlaſting deſtruction, nor give them one moment's relief in the review, when they are falling into it?</p>
               <p>I will make no apology for the plainneſs, and earneſtneſs, which I have uſed. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſts are at ſtake, and the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of ſcripture ſupports me in what I ſay. I had rather you ſhould be alarmed with hearing theſe things from me now, than tormented with hearing them in another manner from your children, and from GOD at laſt. If you pleaſe to take proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for preventing the danger, I have told you the way at large: If you do not, I hope I may ſay, "I am in this reſpect clear from your blood, and the blood of your's, who may periſh by your means: Look you to it."</p>
               <p>But it is high time that I proceed in my addreſs, and apply myſelf,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To thoſe parents, who have been careful to diſcharge the duty, we have ſo copiouſly deſcribed and inforced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:025410_0106_0FCD270ED7A61F78"/>I cannot ſuppoſe, that any of us would pretend to maintain, that in this, or any other branch of duty, we have acted up to the utmoſt extent and perfection of our rule. I hope an humble ſenſe of the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies of all the beſt of our ſervices, is frequently leading us to the believing views of a better righteouſneſs than our own, in which alone we can dare to appear before a holy GOD, and anſwer the demands of his perfect law. Nevertheleſs, it is ſurely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable to rejoice in the teſtimony of our conſcience, with regard to the regularity of our own behaviour, ſo far as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to reaſon and ſcripture; and it is an important duty, thankfully to own thoſe influences of ſanctifying and ſtrengthening grace, by which we are what we are.</p>
               <p>It is with great pleaſure I recollect the reaſon I have to believe, that many of you, chriſtians, who hear me this day, are in the main, conſcientiouſly practiſing theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and that ſome of you were doing it long before I was capable of exhorting and directing you. Acknowledge the ſingular goodneſs of GOD, by which you have been excited to them, and furniſhed for them.</p>
               <p>More eſpecially have you reaſon to adore it, if through grace you can ſay, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the preſent ſucceſs, what you may certainly ſay, as to the future recompence.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025410_0107_0FCD271084970898"/>
that your labour in the LORD is not in vain. Let GOD have the glory of his own work. I perſuade myſelf, you underſtand the goſpel too well, to aſcribe it to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your own conduct, to the ſtrength of your reaſoning, or to the warmth and tenderneſs of your addreſs. Whatever of theſe advantages you have poſſeſſed, were derived from GOD; and your very care for your offspring is, (as the apoſtle expreſſes it in a like caſe) the earneſt care which GOD has put into your hearts. But it was not this care, or theſe advantages alone, that produced ſo happy an effect. In vain had your doctrine from day to day dropped as the rain, and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as the dew, in the moſt gentle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating manner; in vain had the precious ſeed of the word been ſown with unwearied diligence, and watered with tears too; had not GOD commanded the operations of his bleſſed ſpirit to come down, as a more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacions rain, as more fruitful ſhowers to water their hearts. Oh! be not inſenſible of the favour. Your own ſouls might to this very day, have been a barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a land of drought, an habitation of devils; and behold, not only they, but your families too, are like a field, like a garden, which the LORD has bleſſed. GOD might have cut you off many years ago, for

your neglect of his covenant, or your breaches of it; and behold, he is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, not only with you, but your ſeed after you, for an everlaſting covenant. Methinks your hearts ſhould overflow with gratitude and holy joy, while you dwell on ſuch reflections as theſe. This ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dd a reliſh to all the pleaſure you find in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with your children: This ſhould quicken you to a farther diligence in culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating thoſe graces, which you have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to ſee already implanted: This ſhould reconcile you to all the afflictions, with which Providence may exerciſe, either you or them: This ſhould ſupport you in the view of a ſeparation, either by your own death, or theirs; ſince you have ſo comfortable a hope, that if they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved they will go to a heavenly Father, and that if they are left behind you, they will be ſafe and happy under his care, until you meet in a better world, where you will be for ever to each other a mutual glory and joy.</p>
               <p>But I cannot congratulate you on this occaſion, without the danger of adding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to the afflicted parents, whoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, alas! are far different from your's. I fear, my friends, that there are ſome among you, who look round you, and look forwards, with far different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects;

ſome who are, with bleeding hearts, borrowing the complaint, which we who are miniſters of the goſpel, ſo frequently breathe forth, <hi>We have laboured in vain, and ſpent our ſtrength for naught.</hi>" "Oh!" (may you perhaps add) "that it were only in vain! thoſe dear children, which we early devoted to GOD in baptiſm, which we endeavoured to educate in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of the LORD, the children of our hopes, the children of our prayers, are unfruitful unto all our cultivation, or, it may be, viſibly turned aſide from the good ways in which they were trained up; as if they had known them only to reject and affront them: So that, we have reaſon to fear, that all we have done, as it is an aggravation of their guilt, will be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aggravation of their ruin."</p>
               <p>It is indeed a very pitiable caſe. We owe you our compaſſions, and we owe you our prayers; but permit us to intermix our conſolations and our admonitions. You have at leaſt delivered your own ſouls; and as you participate in the ſorrows of faithful miniſters, you may ſhare in their comforts too; and ſay with them, though the objects of our compaſſionate care be not gathered, yet ſhall we be glorified, for our work is with the LORD, and our reward with our GOD. Go on therefore in the

midſt of all your diſcouragements, and, in this reſpect, be not weary in well-doing. Take heed of ſuch a deſpair, as would cut the ſinews of future endeavours. If your child were labouring under any bodily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, you would be very unwilling that the phyſicians ſhould quite give him over, and try no farther medicines: You would follow them, and ſay, "can nothing more be done? Is there not the leaſt glimmering of hope?" Alas! my friends, a child given up by a pious parent, is, to a believing eye, a much more melancholy ſight, than a parent given over by the phyſicians. Excuſe me then, if I follow you with the queſtion, "Can nothing more be done? Is there not the leaſt glimmering of hope?" Who told you, that the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is ſealed, while you are ſure it is not executed. Is the danger extreme? Let your efforts be ſo much the more zealous, your admonitions ſo much the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſerious, your prayers ſo much the more earneſt and importunate. And on the whole (to allude to the words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, on a much lower occaſion) Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to you, that the child may live? And the ſad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions which you now entertain, may only ſerve to increaſe the joy with which
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025410_0111_0FCD27188C3146E0"/>
you ſhall then ſay, This my ſon was dead, and is alive again, he was loſt and is found.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I would addreſs myſelf to children: To you, the dear lambs of the flock, whom I look upon as no contemptible part of my charge. I have been ſpeaking for you a great while, and now give me leave to ſpeak to you; and pray do you endeavour, for a few minutes, to mind every word that I ſay.</p>
               <p>You ſee, it is your parents' duty to bring you up for GOD. The great GOD of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth has been pleaſed to give his expreſs command, that you ſhould be train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the way in which you ſhould go, even in the nurture and admonition of the LORD. It is the wonderful goodneſs of GOD to give ſuch a charge; and methinks you ſhould be affected with it, and ſhould be inquiring what you ſhould do in return.</p>
               <p>Now there are three things, which I would aſk of every one of you, in return for this gracious notice which the great GOD has taken of you children; and I am ſure, if you love your own ſouls, you will not deny me any of them.—Be willing to learn the things of GOD; pray for them who teach you; and ſee to it, you do not learn them in vain. Liſten diligently, that
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025410_0112_0FCCE2F9D4A9BBE0"/>
you may underſtand and remember each of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be willing to learn the things of GOD.</p>
               <p>The things of GOD are very delightful, and they are very uſeful: and, whatever you may think of it, your life depends on your acquaintance with them, So CHRIST, himſelf ſays, this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true GOD, and JESUS CHRIST, whom thou haſt ſent (John xvii. 3.) Therefore, you children, ſhould not think much of the labour of learning theſe things. Oh! far from that, you ſhould be every day upon your knees, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging GOD that you may be taught to know him, and to know CHRIST. GOD has done a great deal more for you, than he has for many others. You might have been born in a place, where you never would have ſeen a Bible in all your lives; where you would never have heard the name of CHRIST, where you might never have been inſtructed in the nature of duty and ſin, nor have been told of the world beyond the grave; and ſo would probably have fallen into Hell, before you had known there was ſuch a place. And the great GOD has ordered matters ſo, that you are born under the light of the goſpel, and
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025410_0113_0FCD271B98C33008"/>
have ſuch plain and ſuch excellent inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that you may know more of divine things in your infancy, than the wiſe men among the heathen did, when they were old and grey-headed, and had ſpent all their lives in ſtudy. And will you be ſo ungrateful, as not to be willing to learn, when ſuch proviſion is made for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? GOD forbid! Shall GOD give you his word, and your parents, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters employ their time, and their pains, to teach you the meaning of it, and will you refuſe to attend to it? That were fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and wicked indeed. I hope much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things of you. That is my firſt advice: Be willing to learn. I add,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pray for thoſe who are to teach you.</p>
               <p>I would hope, you little creatures, dare not live without prayer. I hope GOD, who ſees in ſecret, ſees many of you o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now let me intreat you, that at ſuch times you would pray for thoſe who inſtruct you in divine things; pray that GOD would bleſs them for it, and pray that he would help them in it. In praying thus for us, you do indeed pray for yourſelves. There is a gracious promiſe to the people of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025410_0114_0FCD271DC2ABB740"/>
GOD: <hi>And they ſhall be all taught of GOD:</hi> (John vi. 45.) Pray, that it may be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Pray, that GOD would teach us to teach you; elſe we ſhall attempt it to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little purpoſe. Pray for your parents, and pray for your miniſters.</p>
               <p>Pray for your parents: That GOD would help them to inſtruct you in ſuch a manner as they have now been directed: That they may do it plainly, ſo that you may be able to underſtand what they ſay; and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that you may be brought to an holy awe of GOD; and tenderly, that you may be engaged to love GOD and his word, and CHRIST and his ways; and pray, that your parents may be ſtirred up to do it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to give you <hi>line upon line, and precept upon precept,</hi> that you may be put in mind of what you are ſo ready to forget.</p>
               <p>And let me deſire you, my dear charge, when you pray for your parents, to pray for your miniſters too. I declare it again in the moſt public manner, it is my earneſt deſire that children would pray for me. And I verily believe, every faithful miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of CHRIST would join with me in ſuch a requeſt. We do not, we dare not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the prayer of one of theſe little ones. Far from that, I am perſuaded it would greatly revive and encourage us, and we ſhould hope GOD had ſome ſingular mercy
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:025410_0115_0FCD271EB0E03500"/>
in ſtore for us, and his people, if we were ſure the children of the congregation were every day, praying for a bleſſing on our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed that you do not learn in vain.</p>
               <p>The great truths which you are taught from the word of GOD, are not intended merely to fill your heads with notions, but to make your hearts and lives more holy. You know the way to your father's houſe every ſtep of it, but that would never carry you home, if you would not go in it. No more will it ſignify to know the way to heaven, unleſs we walk in it. <hi>If you know theſe things,</hi> ſays the Lord JESUS CHRIST himſelf, <hi>happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> And I may add, that if ye do them not, it had been happier for you, if you had never known them. Dear children, conſider it; it is but a little while, and you muſt die: And when thoſe active bodies of yours are become cold, mouldering clay, the great GOD of heaven and earth will call your ſouls to his judgment-ſeat. As ſure as you are now in this houſe, you will ſhortly, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhortly, be ſtanding before his awful throne. Then he will examine, to what purpoſe you have heard ſo many religious
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025410_0116_0FCD27200CEE64F0"/>
inſtructions, ſo many good leſſons. Then he will examine, whether you have feared, loved and ſerved him, and received the Lord JESUS into your hearts, as your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and your King; whether you have choſen ſin or holineſs for your way, earth or heaven for your portion. And if it be found, that you have lived without thought, and without prayer, without any regard to the eye of GOD always upon you, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e word of GOD always before you, it will be a moſt lamentable caſe. You will have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to wiſh, you had never heard of theſe things at all; for he has ſaid, <hi>The ſervant that knew his</hi> LORD'S <hi>will, and did it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Even while I am ſpeaking to you, death is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; perhaps his ſcythe may cut you down, while you are but coming up as flowers. I ſpeak to you thus plainly and earneſtly, becauſe I do not know but you may be in eternity before another LORD'S day. Oh! pray earneſtly, that GOD would give you his grace to fit you for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that all of you may be ſo bleſſed, that you may be made wiſe to ſalvation by it. The LORD grant that it may!</p>
               <p>And I have one thing to tell you for your encouragement, and then I have done with you for this time. How young ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, and how broken ſoever your
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025410_0117_0FCD272338C54B70"/>
prayers may be, the great and glorious LORD of angels and men, will be willing to hear what you ſay. You may be ſure to be welcome to the throne of grace. The Lord JESUS CHRIST, when he was upon earth, was very angry with thoſe who would have hindered little children from coming to him: He ſaid, <hi>Suffer little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of GOD.</hi> And CHRIST is as compaſſionate now, as ever he was. Go to him as you may humbly hope, he will, as it were, take you up in his arms and bleſs you. He has ſaid it, and I hope you will never forget it; <hi>I love them that love me, and they that ſeek me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall find me.</hi> Oh! that I were but as ſure, that every child in this aſſembly would go and aſk a bleſſing from CHRIST, as I am that our dear LORD is willing to beſtow it! But to draw to a concluſion,</p>
               <p n="3">III. I ſhall addreſs myſelf to thoſe young perſons who are grown up to years of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, under the advantages of a religious education, and are not yet fixed in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of their own.</p>
               <p>I hope, that many of you have been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the value of thoſe opportunities you have enjoyed, and by divine grace

What can I ſay, that you have not often heard, and often deſpiſed? One is almoſt tempted, in ſuch a circumſtance, to turn reaſonings and expoſtulations into upbraidings; and even to adopt thoſe too paſſionate words of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>"Hear now, ye rebels, you that have grown up in the knowledge, and yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of divine things; you that have diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the hopes, and ſlighted the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your pious parents, and ſo have broken their ſpirits, and, it may be, their hearts too, and have brought down their hoary hairs with ſorrow to the grave. One way or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other you have perhaps ſilenced them. But is it a ſmall thing to you, that you have thus wearied men, and will you attempt to weary your GOD alſo? Can you dare to hope, that
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:025410_0119_0FCD272611740480"/>
you ſhall at laſt carry thoſe proud thoughtleſs heads triumphant over all the terrors of his word?"</hi> You imagine it a very happy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that you have got looſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>m thoſe mortifying leſſons, and uneaſy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, you were once under. But real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when one ſeriouſly conſiders whither theſe liberties lead you, and where they will probably end, a juſt reſentment of your ingratitude is almoſt diſarmed, and indignation is converted into pity.</p>
               <p>Alas! Sinners, the way of all tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors is hard; but your's is peculiarly ſo. You, to whom I am now addreſſing, are in the morning of your days, and it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the impreſſions of a good education are yet entirely effaced. What future years may do, I know not; but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I perſuade myſelf, you have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently your reflections, and your convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; convictions which have force enough to torment you, though not to reform you; to plant thorns in the paths of ſin, though not to reduce you to thoſe of duty. But if you feel nothing of this remorſe and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuch a dead calm is then more dreadful than the fierceſt ſtorm and tumult of thought: A ſad indication, that your courſe in wickedneſs has been exceeding ſwift; indeed ſo ſwift, that it is probable it may not be long. Oh that it might imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

               <p>At leaſt be engaged to pauſe in it for a few moments, and let reaſon and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be permitted to ſpeak. How is it that you make yourſelves, I will not ſay entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but tolerably eaſy? Is it by the diſbelief of chriſtianity? Do you ſecretly ſuſpect, that the goſpel is but a cunningly-deviſed fable? Yet even that ſupicion is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Let me rather aſk, "Are you ſo confident it is ſo, that you will venture to ſtake even the life of your ſouls upon its falſhood?" If you were come to ſuch a confidence, yet it is amazing to me, how, even on the principles of natural religion alone, perſons in your circumſtances can make themſelves eaſy. Can any of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines of the preſent age, who believe a GOD, imagine that he is altogether ſuch an one as themſelves? Can they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo far as to hope, that they, in the ways of negligence, profaneneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, are like to meet with a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable treatment from him, than thoſe pious parents whoſe principles they deride? or that this looſe and irregular courſe will end better, than that life of prayer and ſelf-denial, of faith and love, of ſpirituality and heavenly-mindedneſs, which they diſcerned
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025410_0121_0FCD2729CFADC758"/>
in them? Few are ſo abandoned, even of common ſenſe, as to think this!</p>
               <p>But theſe are more diſtant concerns. I bleſs GOD, this kind of infidelity is not in faſhion here. You aſſent to the goſpel as true, and therefore muſt know, that GOD, who obſerves and records your conduct now, will bring you into judgment for it another day. And if you go on thus, how will you ſtand in that judgment? What will you plead? On what will you repoſe the confidence of your ſouls, that will not prove a broken reed, which will go up into your hand, and pierce you deep, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſtreſs you lay upon it? While you behave like a generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, think not to ſay within yourſelves, <hi>We have Abraham for our father.</hi> Think not to plead a relation to the religious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, whoſe GOD and whoſe ways you have forſaken. Think not to plead an early de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to him in the baptiſmal covenant, which you have broken, deſpiſed, and in fact renounced. Think not to plead that external profeſſion, which you have ſo ſhamefully contradicted, and even by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, diſhonoured. You will ſee the weakneſs of ſuch pleas as theſe, and will not dare to trifle with that awful tribunal, ſo far as to mention them there. And when you are yourſelves thus ſilent and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025410_0122_0FCD272D8025CBC8"/>
confounded, who will appear as an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in your favour? Your parents were often preſenting their ſupplications and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions for you before the throne of grace, but there will be no room to preſent them before the throne of juſtice: Nor will they have any inclination to do it. All the ſprings of natural fondneſs will be dried up; they will no longer regard you as their children, when they ſee you in the accurſed number of the enemies of their GOD.</p>
               <p>And when you are thus diſowned by your parents, and diſowned by GOD, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will you cauſe your ſhame and your terror to go? You, who have had ſo many privileges, and ſo many opportunities, perhaps I may add, ſo many fond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous hopes too, how will you bear to ſee multitudes coming from carnal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane families, to ſhare with your parents in the inheritance of glory, from which you are excluded? You, who were the children of the kingdom; whoſe remorſe therefore muſt be the more cutting: whoſe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therefore muſt be the more weighty! Obſerve in how ſtrong and lively a view, our LORD has repreſented this awful thought, in words, which, though imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately addreſſed to the unbelieving Jews, are remarkably applicable to you: <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025410_0123_0FCD272E49CE6810"/>
ye ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob</hi> (your pious anceſtors) <hi>in the kingdom of GOD, and you yourſelves thruſt out: And many ſhall come from the North, and the South, and the Eaſt, and the Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with them in the kingdom of GOD; but the children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But through the divine forbearance you are not yet ſhut out. There is ſtill hope even for you, if you will now return to the GOD of your fathers, from whom, by theſe aggravated tranſgreſſions, you have ſo deeply revolted. Let me once more then tenderly intreat you, and ſolemnly charge you, by the conſolation of the living, and by the memory of the pious dead, by your preſent comforts, by your future hopes, by the nearly approaching ſolemnities of death and judgment, by the mercies of GOD, and by the blood of a Redeemer, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and ſhew yourſelves men; that you ſet yourſelves, as it were, attentively to read over the characters inſcribed on your memories and underſtandings in the courſe of a religious education; that you hearken to the voice of conſcience repeating thoſe admonitions, and to the voice of the bleſſed GOD, as ſpeaking in his word to confirm them; and finally, that you apply to him in a moſt importunate manner, for thoſe
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025410_0124_0FCD272FC8F4C538"/>
victorious influences of his ſpirit, which are able to mollify and to transform theſe hearts of ſtone, and to raiſe even you from ſo low a depth of degeneracy and danger, to the character and happineſs of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine children of Abraham. GOD forbid, that I ſhould ſin againſt your ſouls, and my own, in ceaſing to pray that it may be ſo! And now,</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall conclude all with an addreſs to thoſe young perſons who have been, through grace, engaged to a becoming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the religious education they have enjoyed.</p>
               <p>I have the pleaſure of being well aſſured, that there are many ſuch among you: Many who are now the joy of miniſters and parents, and the hope of the church for ſucceeding years. Let me intreat you, my dear brethren and friends, that you daily acknowledge the divine goodneſs, in fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring you with ſuch advantages; and, what is ſtill more valuable, in giving you a heart to prize and improve them.</p>
               <p>Think how different your circumſtances might have been. Providence might have caſt your lot in ſome diſtant age or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the true GOD had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, where your early ſteps had been
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:025410_0125_0FCD2732DB9CD518"/>
guided to the groves and temples of deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idols, and you might poſſibly have been taught to conſecrate luſt or murder by the name of devotion. Or you might have been educated in popiſh darkneſs, where the ſcripture would have been to you as a ſealed book, and you would have ſeen chriſtianity polluted with idolatrous rites, on ſome accounts more inexcuſable than thoſe of the heathen, and adulterated with the moſt abſurd and pernicious errors. There the miſtaken piety of your parents might have proved a dangerous ſnare, whilſt it had infuſed a blind, and perhaps a cruel zeal, and a proud, furious oppoſition to all the methods of better information.</p>
               <p>Nay, even here, in a proteſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is it not too evident, there are many families in which, had you been born and educated, you had ſate as in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death, though in the land of light and the valley of viſion? Your infant-tongue had been formed to the language of hell, and exerciſed in curſes and oaths, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in prayer. You had early been taught to deride every appearance of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous godlineſs; and all the irregular propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of nature had been ſtrengthened by examples of wickedneſs, which might have been ſufficient to corrupt innocence itſelf. When you conſider the wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="unknown:025410_0126_0FCD273447109800"/>
theſe circumſtances and your own, ſurely whatever your portion of worldly poſſeſſions may be, you have reaſon to lift up your heads to heaven with wonder and gratitude, and to ſay, <hi>The lines are fallen to us in pleaſant places, yea, we have a goodly heritage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is this all: There are many around you, who have ſhared in ſuch advantages as theſe, and have ſinfully abuſed them, to the diſhonour of GOD, to the grief of their parents, and to their own danger, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their ruin. And why are not you in that wretched number, or who maketh thee to differ from them? Why are not your hearts barred againſt the entrance of a Redeemer, but becauſe the LORD has op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened them? Why were not all the good inſtructions which have been given to you, like ſeed ſown upon a rock: but becauſe GOD gave the increaſe. Adore the riches of this diſtinguiſhing grace.</p>
               <p>And let me earneſtly exhort you, that you be careful ſtill farther to improve it. Give me leave to ſay, that theſe fair open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of early ſeriouſneſs, do naturally raiſe a very high expectation of eminent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in religion. Let it be your humble and diligent care, that theſe expectations be anſwered: That your goodneſs may not be like the morning cloud, or the early dew,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025410_0127_0FCD2735C7E16908"/>
which ſoon goeth away; but rather like the dawning light, which ſhines brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</p>
               <p>Whilſt Providence continues theſe holy parents, to whom you have been ſo highly indebted, let it be your conſtant care, by all the moſt cheerful returns of duty and gratitude, to expreſs your regard to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your ſenſe of ſo great an obligation. And I will add, let it be your care, to hand down to future ages thoſe important advantages you have received from them.</p>
               <p>One generation paſſeth away, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other generation cometh. It is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that in a few years, numbers of you will be conducted into new relations; and we pleaſe ourſelves with the hope, that you will carry religion and happineſs into riſing families. Let not thoſe hopes be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. When GOD fixes you in houſes of your own, let it be your firſt concern to erect there ſuch domeſtic altars, as thoſe at which you have worſhipped with ſuch holy pleaſure, and ſenſible tokens of divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. Let the ſacred treaſure of divine knowledge which has been depoſited with you, be faithfully delivered down to your deſcendants; that they, in their turn, may ariſe with the ſame pious zeal, to tranſmit it to another generation, that ſhall be born of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:025410_0128_0FCD2738E573A580"/>And may divine grace, that inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpring of the moſt valuable bleſſings, ſweetly flow on to add efficacy to all, that real vital religion may be the glory and joy of every ſucceeding age; until this earth (which is but a place of education for the children of GOD, during their minority) ſhall paſs away to make room for a far nob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſcene and ſtate of exiſtence; where pious parents and their religious offspring ſhall for ever enjoy the moſt delightful ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, inhabiting the palace of our heavenly Father, and ſurrounding the throne of our glorified Redeemer! AMEN.</p>

            <p>"IN this country where opinions are every where freely circulated upon all ſubjects, and where there is a great diverſity of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſpecting religion; it is of the utmoſt conſequence to the cauſe of truth, to promote a taſte for reading the works of judicious and practical writers upon the important doctrines of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>"Many books, remarkable for their evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical principles, and experimental method of treating religious ſubjects, have been publiſhed by the learned and pious reformers of their church, and their ſucceſſors in the miniſtry, which, although ſome of them are obſolete in the language, and not very faſhionable in the arrangement of the ſeveral parts, contain thoſe peculiar doctrines of grace, thoſe ſcriptural truths, which have been frequently bleſſed with a divine influence.</p>
            <p>"We are happy to find, that the demand for theſe ſeems to increaſe of late, in various and diſtant parts of this country; and that, by the laudable exertions of ſome of the printers in America, who have publiſhed a great variety of practical works, and ſeveral editions of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this demand is likely to be ſupplied with convenience to the people, and on as reaſonable terms as they can be imported from Europe. We, therefore, take the liberty to recommend the following books, publiſhed in this country, to the eſteem and peruſal of our countrymen, both on patriotic and religious principles; and hope they will prove of eminent uſefulneſs to
