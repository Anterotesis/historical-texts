            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

In ſpeaking to theſe words I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p>FIRST. What we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Word, or Goſpel, which is evidently intended by it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>FOURTHLY. That it worketh effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually on all ſuch Believers.</p>
            <p>LASTLY. To improve the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">Iſt. I AM to ſhew what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Word or Goſpel. Our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR gives us a clear deſcription of it, <hi>John</hi> iii. 16; where he tells <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> that GOD <hi>ſo loved the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi> It is implied here, that fallen man was in a periſhing condition: That GOD gave his Son for us, that we might not periſh, but be ſaved eternally; and alſo that he purchaſed ſalvation for us by his death. The Scripture tells us, that CHRIST by his ſuffering became the Author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation. It is aſſerted alſo, that this was owing to the great love of GOD. <hi>For GOD</hi> ſo <hi>loved the world, &amp;c.</hi> With ſo great a love, that men nor angels cannot conceive: Only GOD, in his infinite mind, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018428_0004_0FA76BE122AF6500"/>
the full meaning of the little word <hi>ſo</hi> in this place: And laſtly, that Believers only are benefited by this ſalvation; this bleſſedneſs only cometh by faith. If a man ſhould do good works a thouſand years to obtain ſalvation, he would miſs of it; but whoever believes the Goſpel, and wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the death of CHRIST to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the favour of GOD ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be juſtified and ſaved. For GOD can be juſt in juſtifying and ſaving ſuch: They having, in their Surety, anſwered the demands of the law both penal and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive.</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly. I AM to ſhew, that the Goſpel is the very Word of GOD, <hi>as in truth it is the Word of GOD</hi>: The Scripture again and again calls it the Word of GOD, and it is called the Word of CHRIST who is GOD; and the Miniſters ſent by him to preach have all along declared, that it was the Word of GOD which they preached; and ſuch Miniſters know it is the Word of GOD by the effects of it. A miracle has been wrought in their ſouls by the name of JESUS; believing in him they were made new creatures, haters of ſin and lovers of GOD; they have alſo that joy and peace in believing, which they know GOD alone is
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018428_0005_0FA76BE1F126C380"/>
the Author of; knowing therefore that the Goſpel is of GOD, they preach it with boldneſs, and authority, and not as the Scribes.</p>
            <p n="3">IIIdly. I AM to ſhew, that when any one truly believes, he always receives the Goſpel as the Word of GOD; as we may know by the effects of faith, that the Goſpel is the Word of GOD, of which I have been ſpeaking, ſo we may know that the Goſpel is divine, previous to our truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in CHRIST for ſalvation. Sometimes when men have no uncommon ſenſe of the worth of their ſouls, but are thinking of CHRIST and ſalvation, the Goſpel comes to them in power, in much aſſurance, and in the HOLY GHOST; by the Spirit of GOD they are inſured, not that <hi>they</hi> ſhall be ſaved by CHRIST, but that there is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in CHRIST for the chief of ſinners under Heaven; nor can they deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubt of this any more then they can doubt whether they have ſouls in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſuch is the demonſtration of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">IVthly. THIS faith is ſaid to work effectually,; that which is immediately wrought on the ſoul is truſting in JESUS
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018428_0006_0FA76BE2B62DA8D0"/>
CHRIST, at the ſame time believing that there is ſalvation in JESUS CHRIST for the chief of ſinners; and that GOD himſelf is the Author of the good news! a truſt in JESUS CHRIST for ſalvation, and thereby ſet to their ſeals that GOD is true: And as there is no believing that the Goſpel is the Word of GOD without truſting in CHRIST, the ſcripture-name for Believers is that of Truſter.</p>
            <p>IN him ſhall the <hi>Gentiles</hi> truſt: And this is their Old Teſtament and their New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament name. <hi>Paul</hi> delights in calling them Truſters: Which word was deſigned by GOD to teach us this leſſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the Goſpel comes to the ſoul and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with a <hi>Thus ſaith the LORD,</hi> we always truſt in CHRIST immediately and are juſtified, and heirs of eternal life. This is the Goſpel of GOD. What then ſhall we think of their goſpel who teach, that men are juſtified by faith and works toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? This is another goſpel very little akin to the Goſpel of GOD, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that men are juſtified by faith only; and that ſaith and juſtification are ſo near together, that there can be no room for any good works to be between them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe that attain to what they call
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018428_0007_0FA76BE355BD1428"/>
the believing part of juſtification, if they really do believe they are juſtified by GOD before they attempt to do any thing of the doing part of it. According to their divinity, let us ſuppoſe a man to have attained the believing part of juſtification, and alſo for ſometime to have been engaged in doing the doing part; this man runs well; he is more than half juſtified already. Let us alſo ſuppoſe him not to be weary in well-doing, but that he is up and doing, and is reſolved to keep doing the doing part, 'till he is quite juſtified: The queſtion is, How long this poor man muſt keep doing hard juſtifying work; (for only they who are juſtified can do them with pleaſure;) I ſay how long muſt he keep doing hard juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying works 'till he is compleatly juſtified? The moſt learned man upon earth will not think himſelf caſuiſt enough to anſwer this queſtion. It is impoſſible that thoſe who hold juſtification by works, <hi>and know how to think,</hi> ſhould think much of their own doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, without thinking ſometimes what is called <hi>reductio ad abſurdum</hi>; or their being reduced to downright abſurdity. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has for many years thought it his duty to magnify CHRIST with his tongue and pen, by diſputing againſt juſtification by works; and now in his old age he has attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018428_0008_0FA76BE41B67AFA0"/>
it with a <hi>New Argument</hi> with brevity, and he hopes not ineffectually. For the men of this device muſt make it appear, that faith and juſtification are not ſo near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the Scripture places them, otherwiſe their beloved divinity <hi>muſt die the death.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſave the life of it but doing that which is <hi>impoſſible.</hi> It will be as hard to make a world, as to prove by Scripture, that there is any doing good juſtifying works between faith and juſtification. The Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of CHRIST, ſays, <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified, Acts</hi> xiii. 39: By which he could not mean, that they would be juſtified ſoon after by their good juſtifying works tacked to faith; <hi>Paul</hi> abominated ſuch ſtuff. He writes in the preſent tenſe or time, meaning, that all are juſtified when they are believers; or that as ſoon as they believe, they are that very moment juſtified perſons. Common ſenſe and conſcience will own the words can bear no other meaning; the mouth of the LORD ſpake theſe words to us by <hi>Paul.</hi> Therefore, juſtification by works which is the great <hi>Diana of Chriſtendom,</hi> is. killed by the words <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake in the name of the LORD, <hi>if the Scripture can kill it.—Love</hi> is alſo wrought in the ſoul at the ſame time. We do not love firſt and then believe: It is not conſiſtent with Scripture nor with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant doctrine. The Author recollects
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018428_0009_0FA76BE5C630B398"/>
with pleaſure, that in his younger years he drew his pen againſt it more than once. We believe and then love GOD, and then we love CHRIST who is GOD; we love him for all his perfections. Some love him becauſe they hope he died for them, and they ſhall be ſaved by him: Theſe are haters of CHRIST; and we love him alſo with a ſuperlative love. If we do not love him above all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, we are not true lovers; and with a practical love.</p>
            <p>THIS is the love of GOD that we keep his commandments; we keep them by his grace not to be juſtified by them, for we ſee we are juſtified by CHRIST. We are conſtrained to keep them by his love, and we keep all his commandments. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have reſpect to all his commandments.</hi> They are very careful to obſerve the New Commandment of Brotherly Love: For we are taught of GOD to love one another; and they love all the Saints. Some high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors care but little for thoſe that fear GOD and keep his commandments: They can be bitter as if under the influence of the ſtar cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wormwood; though at the ſame time they can careſs all thoſe who are of their party; of their ſide, and follow with them. One may have enough and enough of ſuch Brotherly Love without any Chriſtianity at
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018428_0010_0FA76BE6506E5068"/>
all. It is religion to get rid of ſuch religion as this: And this is an aſſociating love; the ſheep of CHRIST, like literal ſheep, love to be together. All ſhyneſs is contrary to that great commandment, <hi>Love the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> He that is ſhy of his brother, hath done him ſome harm, ſpoke evil of him, or hath an evil frame of heart towards him; if we have done them no harm, nor allow our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſpeak evil of them; but have that love for them which the Apoſtle calls the fruit of the Spirit, we ſhall find it <hi>impoſſible</hi> for us to be ſhy of the members of CHRIST; and ſhall pity the ſhy ones who are ſick of a bad diſtemper. This love is alſo a love of ſervice; we ſhall ſerve the Brethren ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and temporally to the utmoſt of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with pleaſure and delight: We ſhall ſerve CHRIST and keep his commandments couragiouſly.</p>
            <p>PAUL and his Fellow-laborers were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned from ſerving CHRIST by preaching the Goſpel, by the trial of cruel mockings and other perſecutions which were made their lot; and ſo it has been and will be with all other Miniſters and private Chriſtians, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, when called to ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for CHRIST; they are divinely hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and will endure hardneſs as good ſoldiers, rejoicing that they are accounted worthy to

ſuffer for his name ſake. A certain Biſhop has informed the world, that Chriſtians now-a-days are not perſecuted for their religion: That the world is now ſo reconciled to it, they love them the better for it; and that this is the reaſon that men have ſo little of the comforts of the HOLY GHOST to what the firſt Chriſtians had, becauſe they will never be perſecuted. A blind Guide! And the faith of theſe Chriſtians will work effectually; they will not draw back unto perdition, becauſe their faith is the operation of GOD. CHRIST dwelleth in their hearts by faith, and they ſhall receive the end of their faith, the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſouls. When they die they enter into life, and at the ſecond coming of CHRIST they ſhall be raiſed to glory, honor and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: As we all know by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall recite no paſſages in proof of it.— But it is time to improve the ſubject; and</p>
            <p n="1">(1ſt.) WE learn from what has been ſaid, that the Goſpel is properly ſtiled glad tidings of good things, the ſound of the Goſpel is the joyfulleſt ſound that ever was heard by the children of men; it proclaims that when a ſinful world was periſhing GOD ſaved us by the death of his dear Son, and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him ſhall obtain eternal ſalvation: And not only the good news, but the Author
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018428_0012_0FA76BE7D690D330"/>
of it, makes the Goſpel worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation: For man is not the author of it but GOD himſelf: It is the faithful ſaying of GOD, with whom it is impoſſible to lie. We are told by him, that if the worſt men and women out of Hell want nothing but the death of CHRIST to recommend them to the divine favor, they ſhall as certainly be ſaved as there is a GOD in Heaven. May this glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed GOD be preached to every creature under Heaven! May the Preachers of this great ſalvation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt much on the amazing love of GOD to enemies, which cauſed it! Shewing, that we were in ſo low an eſtate, that were it not for the death of CHRIST we muſt have periſhed forever. Some will think the laſt expreſſion is a ſtrong one. It is a ſtrong one, and was intended for a <hi>ſtrong</hi> one: Though the whole tribe of <hi>Socinians, Arians, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> will be againſt it: And ſome, who are thought or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, will ſometimes be ſo modiſh as to ſpeak lightly of it. Let us <hi>weigh it in the balance.</hi> The Scripture knows but of two ways of juſtification, by the works of the law and by CHRIST's dying for us. If there had been a law which could have given life, then righteouſneſs ſhould have come by the law: But <hi>by the deeds of the law could no fleſh living be juſtified</hi>; therefore, GOD who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

us, ſent his Son JESUS CHRIST, who was GOD as well as man, and whoſe blood is in Scripture called the blood of GOD, with his conſent to die a ſacrifice and curſe for our ſins: He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us; and by him all that believe are juſtified. But the queſtion may be aſked, Whether CHRIST's death was ſo neceſſary, that if he had not died we <hi>muſt</hi> have periſhed? I anſwer yes. He himſelf tells us ſo in what he ſays to <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> in the third chapter of <hi>John</hi>; where he ſays, <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>:—And afterwards, that <hi>GOD ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son that they ſhould not periſh</hi>;—which is as much as if CHRIST had ſaid, man <hi>muſt</hi> have periſhed, <hi>muſt</hi> have periſhed, if I had not died for his juſtification. Our opponents will not ſay we are not juſtified by the death of CHRIST, but cannot ſee his death was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſo neceſſary that if he had not died man muſt have periſhed. This is a hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; too ſtrong meat; they cannot bear there ſhould be a <hi>muſt</hi> in the caſe.</p>
            <p>THE truth is, theſe men believe that though none could be juſtified by their works, and though CHRIST had never died for our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018428_0014_0FA76BE94E485B58"/>
juſtification, that GOD could and would have juſtified and made us happy ſome other way. What other way? He had power to love, juſtify and make us happy without ſhewing any reſentment againſt ſin. Be aſtoniſhed Oh ye Heavens at this! Had any Preachers in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time employed all their wit and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their mind, to prove it was not <hi>neceſſary</hi> CHRIST ſhould die for our ſins, they would hardly have eſcaped his anathema maranatha. GOD did juſtify us by the death of his Son; nor could he juſtify us in a <hi>Chriſtleſs Way.</hi> Omnipotence itſelf could not give a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; there is no beauty of holineſs in <hi>that Way:</hi> Therefore, an infinitely holy GOD could not be the Author of it. If we only ſuppoſe it as exiſting, this will prove it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could exiſt. Let us ſuppoſe GOD had juſtified man in ſuch a Chriſtleſs Way; could he have glorified his holineſs thereby? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt ſay no; but <hi>quite the reverſe.</hi> Then the Angels could not have cried one to another holy, holy, holy is the LORD. Then the innumerable company of Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect, could not have magnified him in their ſongs, as a GOD of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. We read, <hi>There was ſilence in Heaven for the ſpace of half an hour</hi>; but there muſt have been an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſilence in Heaven, as to ſuch praiſes and hallelujahs, had not GOD redeemed us by the death of his dear Son.</p>

It hath been matter of much wonder, grief and juſt indignation, that learned men, Divines as well as others, ſhould employ their mental powers to prove there was no neceſſity of CHRIST's ſhedding his blood for the remiſſion of our ſins: By which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diſputing, inſtead of magnifying CHRIST with <hi>Paul,</hi> they diminiſh him, rob him of his glory and make ſport for the worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he hath in the whole world.</p>
            <p>LORD JESUS what wilt thou do for thy great Name! Send forth thy light and thy truth; deſtroy this Monſter every where under the whole Heavens!—I ſhall finiſh with only ſaying, what I can ſay with a good conſcience, that I am perſuaded there is not one man upon earth who knows that he is juſtified by his blood, but will ſay to his honor, that the blood of CHRIST could not be diſpenſed with, and were it not for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood he himſelf could not be juſtified: And conſequently, that whatever proſelites may be made to the <hi>polite Divinity,</hi> there will never be ſo much as one out of the many

thouſands of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who know that they are juſtified by GOD, and that the blood of JESUS CHRIST his Son cleanſeth them from all ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) WE learn the dignity of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who are employed to preach the Goſpel, which is the Word of GOD himſelf. GOD ſpeaks by them: They are GOD's mouth to the people. We read of an Angel's flying through the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel. The higheſt Angel in Heaven would think it a great honor to be employed in preaching the Goſpel of GOD; but GOD would not ſpeak to us by Angels, whoſe terror would make us afraid, but by men ſubject to like paſſions with ourſelves. And what an honor is it to them that JESUS CHRIST was the firſt Preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who was ſent by his Father to preach! As he ſent them, they are employed the ſame way in which CHRIST was employed while he was in the world, which was made by him. Every one of his Miniſters thinks this a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honor to him than if CHRIST had made him Emperor over the whole world. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they are dignified with the office and title of Ambaſſadors, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 20; <hi>For we are Ambaſſadors for</hi> CHRIST. Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates ſend Ambaſſadors to Rebels and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to let them know there is an act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity in their ſavor, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018428_0017_0FA76BEC58BADF20"/>
to their allegiance and be happy in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of their Sovereign. JESUS CHRIST was the firſt Ambaſſador: GOD who ſent him to make atonement for our ſins by his death, ſent him alſo to be his Ambaſſador, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim free remiſſion of ſins by the ſacrifice of himſelf, and whoſoever ſhould believe in him ſhould be reconciled unto GOD and eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed. After he aſcended to Heaven, he made his Apoſtles and all his Miniſters Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to proclaim the good news of pardon, peace and reconciliation by the blood of the croſs; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, he and the other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors have beſought ſinners as though GOD himſelf beſought them, and prayed them as in CHRIST's ſtead to be reconciled to GOD, who had made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of GOD in him. When men do believe that Ambaſſadors do beſeech them in GOD's ſtead, and pray them in CHRIST's ſtead to be reconciled to GOD, they are in a moment reconciled and are real Saints. May JESUS CHRIST be with his Ambaſſadors, and make them more faithful and ſucceſsful than ever; that thouſands and thouſands may be reconciled to GOD, love GOD and be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in his favor!</p>
            <p n="3">(3dly and laſtly.) LET us all be exhorted not to be contented with being <hi>almoſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:018428_0018_0FA76BEE08A0F048"/>
thinking ourſelves ſomething while we are nothing at all; men and their faith may periſh together. May we have that faith of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> of which I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they believed the Goſpel was <hi>not the word of men, but the word of</hi> GOD <hi>himſelf, as in truth it was, which worketh effectually in all Believers,</hi> producing thoſe bleſſed effects both inwardly and outwardly, which will end in eternal ſalvation. Our Savior ſays, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul.</hi> Solemn words! Implying, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man has a ſoul to ſave or to loſe; and that is the one thing needful, that our ſouls are ſaved. Once people believed this to be true: People's concern about the world and the things of it was of a ſecondary nature; their main care was that they might <hi>lay up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, and lay hold on eternal life!</hi> But how great is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; never did men deſpiſe their own ſouls and neglect the great ſalvation more than they do at this day! Religion never was at ſo low an ebb ſince <hi>America</hi> was <hi>America</hi>; eſpecially in theſe parts! It has been ſaid that men have no more ſouls to ſave than the beaſts that periſh. Some manifeſt their Atheiſm like them in Scripture, of whom we read, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no GOD.</hi> They have done abominable works; they are forever doing the works of darkneſs;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018428_0019_0FA76BEE7B793070"/>
the works of the fleſh, and the works of the Devil; committing all iniquity with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Others manifeſt the ſame by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and blaſphemous ſpeeches, curſing and damning: Their common talk is the language of Hell. Sometime ago a number of theſe wretches, having their tongues ſet on fire of Hell, a ſerious woman reproving them, they juſtified themſelves by ſaying there was no Hell, nor any Devil, but an Heaven, and that they knew they ſhould all go to Heaven and be happy forever. See how the Devil's children love the doctrine of Univerſal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation! See how they are encouraged by it to continue in ſin! This ſweet doctrine can operate <hi>no other way.</hi> The Devil laughs at thoſe Miniſters who think they ſhall be able to prevail with wicked and carnal men <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly and godly in the world,</hi> by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, and that Heaven will be the everlaſting home of all thoſe who, while on earth, were Devils incarnate. No man can force himſelf to believe that the Apoſtles carried on the work of the LORD, by preaching <hi>this Goſpel,</hi> any more than he can force himſelf to believe that two and two make an hundred. How have the ways of <hi>Zion</hi> mourned for the fewneſs of thoſe that walk in them! And how have the children of <hi>Zion</hi> ſighed and cried for the abominations
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018428_0020_0FA76BF1BA369E50"/>
among us! It is the mind of many ſerious and godly people, that Deiſm and Atheiſm with all their curſed effects have been very much owing to certain <hi>ſtrange Doctrines</hi> which have been preached among us with too great acceptance. I ſhall therefore ſpend ſome time in ſpeaking of theſe doctrines, and warning againſt them.</p>
            <p>THE principal is the Doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi>; or at the ſecond coming of CHRIST all fleſh ſhall be ſaved eternally. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only one of the many paſſages that I might mention, which ſpeaks of the end and deſign of his coming at the laſt day, <hi>viz. Acts</hi> xvii. 31. Where it is ſaid, that GOD <hi>hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs by that Man whom he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> There we are told, that GOD hath ordained CHRIST to be the Judge of the world, who is well qualified as being GOD and man; and that he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to every man according to his deeds: Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh to every ſoul of man that doeth evil; but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, honor and peace to them that do well. And that GOD hath appointed the <hi>very day</hi> in which the world ſhall be judged, which will be a bleſſed day to the righteous; but a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018428_0021_0FA76BF2A2FF2EC8"/>
day to the wicked: And that we may be as certain of all this, as we are that GOD raiſed his Son from the dead. The Univerſaliſts do not profeſs themſelves to be Deiſts, but Believers of the Scripture: And yet they do not believe that the judgment ſhall be ſet and the books opened, and that men ſhall then be judged according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil, any more than if they were Deiſts and Infidels. That <hi>bleſſed day</hi> in which GOD's people and the Devil's people are to be eternally happy, is ſuppoſed to be very near at hand. It hath been aſſerted, that their writers for thirty years together have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that we might be almoſt continually looking for CHRIST as coming in the clouds of Heaven, which muſt be matter of ſweet conſolation even to thoſe who have grown old and grey-headed in the ſervice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; giving them hopes that they might enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a longer ſeaſon, even until the coming of CHRIST, and then, though they knew themſelves to be the children of the Devil, they ſhould certainly appear with him in glory. This is part of that hope which their Teachers ſet before them. But what if our LORD delays his coming, and wicked men are doomed to Tophet? It has been ſtrongly aſſerted, that the puniſhment of Hell does not conſiſt ſo much in torment as in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018428_0022_0FA76BF3047094D8"/>
ſuffering much darkneſs and ignorance: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this ſuffering cannot laſt longer than the ſecond coming of CHRIST, which moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines think cannot be far off: And then their afflictions and ſufferings which have been but for a moment, in ſcripture-ſtile, will not be worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed. What glory? They ſhall be raiſed with bodies faſhioned like unto the glorious body of JESUS CHRIST, they ſhall be preſented before the throne of glory with exceeding joy: They ſhall ſee GOD as he ſees them, and know GOD as he knows them. They ſhall know the heighth, length, depth and breadth of his love: And they and all the heavenly hoſt being filled with love to GOD and love to one another, ſhall ſing praiſes and hallelujahs to him that ſitteth upon the throne and unto the LAMB. Nor will there be any interruption or period to their bliſs; it will be commenſurate with the days of eternity.</p>
            <p>THIS muſt be reviving to the ſons of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, who bleſs themſelves in their heart, and ſay they ſhall have peace, though they walk in the imagination of their heart, and in the ſight of their eyes: For though ſuch harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men have no firm belief of a future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, this doctrine muſt comfort them, that the puniſhment in Hell is infinitely ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018428_0023_0FA76BF3BB82D148"/>
in duration, than the happineſs of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly world, which will follow and is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. They will not think it worth while to be much concerned about a puniſhment which will be more than a hundred thouſand mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion times leſs than a moment. The ſons of darkneſs no doubt do comfort themſelves, and will comfort themſelves and one another with ſuch conſolations as theſe. And who can ſay they are not ſtrong conſolations, if the dear, dear doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi> is true, which they hear preached with ſo much pleaſure and delight. Not that Preachers are to be faulted if people take pleaſure in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them preach: It is part of our office, we are helpers of their joy; we ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort others with the conſolations wherewith we ourſelves are comforted of GOD. The Preachers of Univerſal Salvation are great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters; every individual is a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a ſon of conſolation: They preach no terror: They never addreſs their hearers as <hi>Paul</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Corinthians; We muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of CHRIST, that every one may receive the things done in the boay, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad: Knowing therefore the terror of the LORD we perſuade men.</hi> If any one of their Teachers ſhould preach in <hi>ſuch a ſtrain,</hi> how greatly would it be reſented! He would indeed be guilty of joining with <hi>Paul</hi> in overturning
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018428_0024_0FA76BF4A9DD9338"/>
the doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi>; and would undoubtedly be excommunicated for that zeal and love to the ſouls of men, which were conſpicuous in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>: They are never in their element, but when they are preaching comfort; in this they have an advantage above other Miniſters, though not <hi>an honorable one.</hi> Other Miniſters are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: They can only ſay, <hi>Bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are all thoſe people whoſe GOD is the LORD</hi>: But theſe men can ſay, Bleſſed and happy are all thoſe people whoſe GOD is the LORD; and at the ſame time bleſſed are all thoſe people whoſe God is the Devil. For they all hold, the <hi>whole human race</hi> are intitled to that Salvation which is by CHRIST, which cannot be loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it is ſuppoſed it may be loſt, they are like the fooliſh woman who pulled down the houſe which ſhe built with her own hands. The worſt of men have that title to ſalvation, which is of more worth than the whole world; they have that good part that can never be taken from them. If a man has a vaſt eſtate which is firm by law, how is he loved, eſteemed and regarded as a rich man? That man therefore that has ſuch a good part in CHRIST which can never be taken away, muſt be looked upon even in this world as <hi>rich towards GOD</hi> and happy. Their durable riches are in reverſion; they are to be put in poſſeſſion of them at the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018428_0025_0FA76BF55D9E8118"/>
of CHRIST. All bliſs, glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be their portion; there will be no interruption or period to the heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it will be commenſurate with the days of eternity.</p>
            <p>IT may be ſaid, you have aſſerted the eternity of their happineſs before, but have not proved it; It is abſolutely certain that it is without any period? Indeed it is, You that are acquainted with your bibles know that beſides its being called everlaſting life, it is ſtiled an incorruptible; that is, an eternal inheritance, everlaſting conſolations, eternal redemption, &amp;c. Its being called (<hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 3.) ſo great ſalvation implies as much; for if it had not been an eternal ſalvation, it would have been infinitely leſs: It would have been a <hi>little Salvation.</hi> To which we may add, the teſtimony of all Chriſtians, who declare with joy, that thoſe who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by CHRIST ſhall be with GOD, and eternally happy in his love. After they have been with GOD in glory as many thouſands of ages as there are ſpires of graſs on the ground, they will be no nearer the period to their bliſs than when they were at firſt admitted to it. And after they have enjoyed it as many thouſands of ages more as there are drops of water in the ocean, they have approached no nearer to a period. The ſame may be ſaid with regard to their
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018428_0026_0FA76C61C8326B50"/>
enjoying this felicity as many thouſands of ages as there are ſands on the ſea ſhore. Oh eternity! eternity! eternity! One cannot think of their happineſs without calling them bleſſed. Bleſſed, eternally bleſſed are the people in ſuch a caſe! And yet theſe eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed ones while they lived on earth, (who can believe it?) had no other GOD but the Devil. This is the Creed of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaliſts.</hi> But it is contrary to the Word which aſſures us that GOD is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity: That the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of GOD; and that no unholy perſons ſhall ever dwell with him. Such blaſphemous contempt of the truth and holineſs of GOD ought to be ſhocking to all Chriſtians. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians who would not oppoſe the truth and holineſs of GOD, ſo much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to hold <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi> for the <hi>whole World</hi>: The Author is one of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their Religion is alſo contrary to the very light of nature, which teaches, that none are happy after death but thoſe who have lived virtuous and moral lives. Theſe <hi>blind men</hi> are <hi>blinder</hi> than the <hi>blind Heathens</hi>! The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> could never preach any other doctrine but this, that they and they only who have their fruit unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall have their end eternal life. If any of theſe <hi>Univerſaliſts</hi> had lived in <hi>Paul</hi>'s day, and declared that thouſands and millions
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018428_0027_0FA76C621B4D4200"/>
will live with GOD in Heaven, who lived without GOD in the world, and ſerved the Devil to their lateſt breath, <hi>Paul</hi> would have curſed their Religion <hi>heartily</hi> in the <hi>name of the LORD.</hi> I believe my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will join in ſaying that <hi>Paul</hi> would have curſed that Religion <hi>with a curſe.</hi> Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſome of the <hi>Univerſaliſts</hi> may be of the ſame mind, and yet not think it worth while to alter their Religion for ſo ſmall a matter as <hi>Paul</hi>'s being againſt them. It appears by what has been ſaid now as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that theſe men muſt ſhine and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for comforting thoſe <hi>who are caſt down.</hi> The truth is, they are qualified by <hi>their own divinity,</hi> not by GOD's <hi>divinity,</hi> to out-comfort all the Miniſters upon the face of the earth. The Scripture teaches us to diſtinguiſh between Comforters and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters. GOD, ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 1. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people.</hi> He would have them comforted by knowing that their iniquities are pardoned, and that they ſhall be happy forever.</p>
            <p>WE read of ſome who comfort others by propheſying <hi>ſmooth things,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> xxx. 10,) but not right things. Such are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters I am ſpeaking of. Oh what ſmooth, pallatable and fleſh and blood doctrine do they preach, that their people may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rejoicing! Do they never bid them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with fear and trembling? I ſay no:
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018428_0028_0FA76C6418884600"/>
This would be to murder their own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. How do they quiet them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that text, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 1. <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it?</hi> By telling them they need not fear miſſing the heavenly reſt. That it is impoſſible any one ſhould come ſhort of it; for then the goſpel of <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi> would not be true. All the people of GOD therefore, and all the Devil's people ſhall as certainly enjoy that reſt forever, as if they were in preſent poſſeſſion of it. Our Savior ſpeaks of it in <hi>Matt.</hi> xvi. as a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing for a man to <hi>loſe his own ſoul.</hi> How will they pacify them as to this? By telling them that learned and critical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines may put ſuch a meaning to CHRIST's words as may be conſiſtent with <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Salvation.</hi> What miſerable ſtreights and ſhifts are theſe men put to to keep their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved doctrine alive? There are no ſigns of life in it: It is <hi>dead, dead, dead.</hi> And as to being prepared for the day of judgment, which has been the concern of ſerious people from the beginning, theſe merry Teachers can tell their merry Diſciples, that all the world, even the worſt of the Devil's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are prepared for what is called the judgment of the <hi>great day,</hi> and will be able to ſtand before the Son of Man, who comes not to condemn them, but to make them
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018428_0029_0FA76C64441B1DF0"/>
bleſſed and happy forever. So that the day of the wrath of GOD and the revelation of his righteous judgment, will be a time of refreſhing to all the children of wrath; and none are more ſure that they are living in this world and ſerving the Devil, than they are ſure that when CHRIST comes they ſhall appear with him in glory. Such ſweet cordials do theſe ſons of conſolation admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to all the Devil's children in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe! Satan would not deſire to have them comforted more; and wonders how Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Miniſters can comfort them <hi>ſo much</hi>: But they comfort them by propheſying <hi>ſmooth things</hi> and not <hi>right things,</hi> and are therefore miſerable comforters. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet deſcribes them as ſewing pillows under all arm-holes; and weak and wicked people being much comforted by them are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being comforted <hi>into Hell.</hi> None are in danger but thoſe who <hi>deſpiſe their own ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE finiſhed what I had to ſay of the doctrine that all fleſh ſhall be happy forever at the ſecond coming of CHRIST, which has cauſed much grief and ſorrow of heart to many ſerious and godly perſons, and no wonder, for they love CHRIST and want that all men ſhould honor him from the riſing of the ſun to the going down of the ſame. They cannot bear that any ſhould
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018428_0030_0FA76C6812830768"/>
diſhonor him by preaching a goſpel in his name contrary to truth and his divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; they love the ſouls of men. They have ſome of that ſpirit of CHRIST, that infinite Lover of ſouls, which cauſes them to long for their ſalvation. Their hearts deſire and prayer to GOD is, that Miniſters by preaching may ſave their own ſouls and the ſouls of them that hear them.</p>
            <p>THERE is another doctrine that has grieved their hearts, called <hi>Origin</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine,</hi> akin to the former; which is this, that at the ſecond coming of CHRIST the ſaints ſhall obtain eternal ſalvation; but the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, ſuffering the wrath of GOD and the torments of Hell until they are purified and fit for Heaven. I have ſaid there is a likeneſs between them; let us conſider wherein they are alike, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ. They all preach and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one and the ſame goſpel; they all hold that CHRIST being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by ſuffering, is become the Author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him, and to all them who do not obey him. This goſpel does not ſound well; the ſound is better then the ſenſe, for the ſenſe is a moſt horrible contradiction to the truth of GOD.</p>
            <p>THEY agree likewiſe in holding the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018428_0031_0FA76C69CBBAC308"/>
abſolute, infallible and eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> of the <hi>whole human race.</hi> But while others hold that <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi> will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the ſecond appearance of CHRIST, <hi>Origen</hi>'s people declare, that at the laſt day the wicked ſhall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, and ſuffer the wrath of GOD and the vengeance of Hell-fire for hundreds of years; and that for ſuffering theſe torments ſo long and ſo well, and eſpecially for the true holineſs which they attain to by Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire. Horrible abſurdity! They are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Heaven, although but little indebted to CHRIST, and are happy forever. This is PURGATORY! This is PURGATORY! and I may add with the Prophet, this is WICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EDNESS. It is founded on the inſufficiency of CHRIST's ſacrifice and man's merit. <hi>Origen</hi> intended it as an engine to beat down juſtification by faith only, through grace, without the deeds of the law. This is the Goſpel of GOD! And this is the Goſpel of us Proteſtants which ought to be dear to us as our own lives. Formerly it had been dearer to ſome than their own lives. When any people by hearing the word preached, or by any other means believe in Purgatory, they hope that if their lives ſhould not be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Goſpel they ſhall go to Heaven by the way of Purgatory. This is the common hope of thoſe who are called after <hi>Origin</hi>'s name: They ſeem to have a ſure hope that if
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018428_0032_0FA76C6ADDFFE2C8"/>
they turn their backs upon godlineſs, and ſerve ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan till death, they ſhall be eternally happy; and they rejoice in this hope: it is owing to the ſame antinomian boldneſs that they have decided, that all that have ever lived, or ſhall live wicked lives in this world, ſhall infallibly obtain ſalvation, with eternal glory, by the idol called PURGATORY. I have called it an idol. God's word don't own it: to honour <hi>that</hi> would be to diſhonour <hi>him.</hi> And now God, in his providence, ſuffers that antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian idol to come amongſt us proteſtants <note n="‡" place="bottom">The learned Theophilus Gale aſſures us, that when Origen preached purgatory in Alexandria, which he learned in Plato's ſchool (not by reading his bible) he was looked on as the moſt eminent man for promoting papiſim and antichriſtianiſm. A proteſtant therefore as a proteſtant, cannot wiſh ſucceſs to thoſe who are preaching up Origen's purgatory among us.</note> (no man as a proteſtant, can wiſh it god ſpeed) we ſhould be on our guard againſt it, for though that <hi>idol</hi> can never ſave one ſoul, many judge it hath already ſlain <hi>its thouſands</hi>; for nothing is more eaſy than for a man to looſe his own ſoul, by way of Purgatory. God ſays, other foundation can no man lay, than that which is LAID, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The death of Chriſt is our only hope towards God, if any therefore add Purgation to it, as the manner of ſome is, Chriſt ſhall profit them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for it will be falſe doctrine as long as the world ſtands, to aſſert that a chriſtian man is one who makes Jeſus Chriſt his hope and purgatory too. Let wiſe and ſerious men weigh this in the ballance, and ſpeak their minds. The friends of purgatory ſhould tell us, if they are able, whence it is that the ſame wrath of the Almighty which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018428_0033_0FA76C6B09CF1FA8"/>
evil angels, ſhould ſoften the wicked men in hell, make them real ſaints, and lovers of an holy God. But they are not able, they have not one word to ſay. The doctrine which teaches that men learn to be lovers of God, by being damned in hell with the devil and his angels, is <hi>monſtrous!</hi> By the way, is it not ſtrange that learned divines and others who are afraid of all myſtery in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould ſwallow <hi>Origen's monſter!</hi> There is no monſter in religion more hedious than this. Let us take a view ot it, how came any of us to love God, we love him in God's way, not in Origen's way. He loved us firſt, and ſent his ſon to be a propitiation for us. We believed the love and kindneſs of God and our Saviour, and returned love for love. So God tells us by his prophet Hoſea, that he draws us with the cords of a man, and with the bands of love. Here is nothing but love, love, love. This divinity is from Heaven; that which teaches that we love God by being damned with devils is from beneath. We may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay it is an abomination to the Lord. Origen, <note n="†" place="bottom">Above fourteen hundred years ago Origen turned hell into a purgatory, and ever ſince he and all his followers have been furniſhed with a purgatory, as well as the heathens; for heathens always had a purgatory. The Latin poets tell us the heathens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved no other hell but a purgatory; and Origen's chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved no other hell but a purgatory.</note> the creator of Purgatory, created it: his Purgatory could not exiſt without it, therefore the hearty friends of purgatory are hearty friends to that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which the ſoul of God hates.</p>
            <p>One would think that the taſting of the ſecond death and the pains of hell, inſtead of creating love to God would cauſe the haters of God to hate him
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018428_0034_0FA76C6BC9F5D9B8"/>
more. The ſcriptures call all wicked men haters of God, they hate him for his holineſs, and for his preparing a hell for the workers of iniquity; how much more then will they hate him when they open their eyes in hell, being in torments, and feel that God is a conſuming fire?—they will have no reſt day nor night, but the ſmoke of their torment will aſcend continually. Enmity muſt therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, by falling into the hands of the living God, and by knowing what it is to dwell with devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire. Add to this, that we are again and again told, in the book of the Revelations, what effects God's wrath and torments will have upon the wicked, viz. they will gnaw their tongues for pain, look upwards to Heaven, but will not <hi>repent</hi> of their <hi>wickedneſs.</hi> It is a maxim in philoſophy, that the <hi>ſame cauſes</hi> will for ever produce the <hi>ſame effects.</hi> This therefore alone would be ſufficient to kill purgatory ſtone dead, if it were not <hi>already dead.</hi> Origen's divinity is ſometimes contrary to ſcripture, reaſon and common ſenſe. This is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable not only to his purgatory, &amp;c. but to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of worſhipping all the angels of heaven, and praying to departed ſaints, which duties we may ſuppoſe the blind, zealous man, practiſed every day. His prayer to the angels, and his prayer to St. Job, which are not without blaſphemy, will be preſented to the reader in a blank page at the end. Origen's wild notions in religion make up the creed of his moſt ſerious followers, though they do not come to them with a thus <hi>ſayeth</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>; they come to them with a thus <hi>ſayeth Origen.</hi> It is ſtrange to think with what deep contempt and indignation the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniſts treat their brethren, who hold that all fleſh ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt when he comes again, not
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018428_0035_0FA94657AA3B9988"/>
ſhewing any reſpects to the holy ordinance of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory learned by Origen from the writings of an <hi>heathen philoſopher.</hi> They repreſent them as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God, and as teaching people to turn his grace into wantonneſs, which is the way to fill the world with ſin and wickedneſs. The author has nothing to ſay for them; their religion borders on atheiſm; the partition between is <hi>but thin.</hi> Nor have they much to ſay for themſelves; but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is bound in conſcience to ſay what follows, viz. that an underſtanding man who reads his bible may know aſſuredly, that Univerſal Salvation is an heinous contradiction to the truth of God by many ſcriptures; the author will mention but one. We all know that when Chriſt commanded his apoſtles to preach ſalvation by faith, they were to finiſh with theſe dreadful words, He that believeth not ſhall be damned. By which words he let Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus know, that he meant, he that believeth not ſhall periſh. Our late preachers are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Jeſus Chriſt. He whoſe word was the word of God, declares once and again, that they that do not believe on him ſhall periſh (going to purgatory is not periſhing) Chriſt's antagoniſts ſay, that no unbelievers ſhall periſh, no not ſo much as one. Theſe contradictors will ſay that they have the mind of Chriſt, and they really preach <hi>that</hi> preaching, that Chriſt bids them preach. Their goſpel is not according to <hi>godlineſs.</hi> It is directly againſt godlineſs, and tends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote all manner of ungodlineſs, as natural as the ſparks fly upwards. The worthy parſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before mentioned, look on univerſal Salvation, Origen's way or <hi>any way,</hi> to be only <hi>religious trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:018428_0036_0FA76C6C842EA9D8"/>
and <hi>antichriſtian ſtuff,</hi> calculated to ſtupify conſcience, harden men's hearts, to corrupt their morals, and to make them worſe and worſe. They know to their grief that ſuch divinity hath produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch effects, and are perſuaded that it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch effects wherever it is, and wherever it may be permitted to ſpread and be encouraged. From what hath been ſaid againſt theſe tenets, the word of exhortation to us all is, to beware that we be not carried away with them, if we are acquainted with our bibles we ſhall know they are contrary to the current of ſcripture. May we be kept from all theſe and all other errors, and be ſound in the faith. May our faith be that which is from God, which brings men to God, and makes them happy in God forever. Such was the faith of the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, who received the goſpel as the word of God, which always worketh effectually; we ſhould be jealous over our ſelves, leſt our faith ſhould be only the effect of cuſtom and education; if God's word is received by us as his word, we ſhall find it eaſy to truſt in Chriſt, though our ſins are more in number than the hairs of our heads, and inſtead of trying and trying to love Chriſt, our hearts will be drawn out to love him, and to live to him as real ſaints do, and we ſhall be happy in this world, and in the world to come moſt bleſſed forever. Bleſſed be God if we have been made partakers of this precious faith. Paul, and his fellow labourers, thanked God continually for beſtowing it on the Theſſalonians, and if we have clear evidence that our faith is the ſame, we ſhall thank God for it every day and hour of our lives. May the lives we live in the fleſh be by the faith of the Son of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018428_0037_0FA76C6D458613E8"/>
God, who loved us and gave himſelf for us. May we be every day conſtrained by faith and love, to live to Chriſt, againſt all oppoſition from earth and hell, whereby we ſhall anſwer the end of Chriſt's giving himſelf a ranſom for us; for he did not die merely to deliver us from hell, and the wrath to come— then he would have been the miniſter of ſin; but he died to redeem us from all iniquity, and that we might not live any longer to our ſelves, but to him who died for our ſin, and roſe again for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All believers have been taught this religion of God. Paul ſays <hi>we</hi> live to the Lord, and yet how ſmall a part of our time do we live to him! only that part when we have reſpect to all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: when we keep them by his grace, and aim at his honour and glory. We have all reaſon to bluſh before our divine Maſter. May we reſolve, depending upon his ſtrength, that we will live to him more than ever, as long as he ſhall hold our ſouls in life. And to animate us, let us conſider that this is a reaſonable life, an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, a joyful and a bleſſed life. 1ſt. It is a reaſonable life: come now let us reaſon together ſaith the Lord; and the religion of Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be a reaſonable ſervice, Rom. xii. 1 verſe. Nothing can be more reaſonable than that we ſhould live to Chriſt, who died for our ſalvation. When wicked men gratify their luſts, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their own conſciences, for being what the ſcripture calls wicked and unreaſonable men, 2 Theſſa. iii. 2. but when we live to Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience applauds for yielding a reaſonable ſervice. Nor can we ever repent of that reaſonable ſervice, whatever dangers, difficulties and perſecutions may
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018428_0038_0FA76C6ECAA19E60"/>
be the conſequence. Nay, if we are called to ſeal his truth with our blood, it muſt be pleaſing to us to think that we die for his ſake, who loved us with a love <hi>ſtronger than death.</hi> 2d. It is an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable life, this is the conſequence of its being a reaſonable life. The ſcripture calls it the life of God. It is in ſome ſort ſuch a life as they live in heaven. Whereas they who are governed by their luſts are fellow commoners with the beaſts that periſh. Horace calls them hogs; and Cicero calls them horſes. The ſcripture which gives to every one his juſt character, ſtyles them brutiſh men, Pſal. xlix. 10 as if they were a ſort of <hi>quadrupeds,</hi> and accordingly, Antiochus who took upon himſelf the name of Epiphanes, illuſtrious as if he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhined all the kings upon earth, is, by God, called a vile perſon, Dan. xi. 21. And the people of God look upon all ſuch ſelfiſh, ſenſual men, as vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, though raiſed to the top of the world. The ſame ſcripture allows the ſaints to be honourable: they are the only right honourable ones upon earth. What honourable names are given to them by God? ſome of which, are kings and prieſts unto God. He alſo honours them internally. He ſays to them well done good and faithful ſervants. They have the applauſes of God and their own conſciences, and are conſent with the honour which comes from God alone. Mr. <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> ſays, that after he was a true believer, and conſequently was no ſtranger to internal honours, he never thought the honours of this world worth minding. Such men are high born: they are born from above; they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with high life; they look down upon crowns, ſcepters and diadems, with contempt, as
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018428_0039_0FA9465852156CD0"/>
little things which can give but ſmall ſatisfaction to believers, who are all men of great ſouls.</p>
            <p>Grandeur of ſoul for ever brings contempt of ſublunary things. God delights to honour them, who, like their Saviour, ſeek not honour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he cauſes them to be eſteemed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ones of the earth: who regard them much becauſe they do not live like the men of the world, to themſelves; but unto the Lord, honouring him and themſelves too at the ſame time. Nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great men who have no religion regard them much. They ſee in them a more excellent ſpirit than the ſpirit that is in the world: they ſee in them that tenderneſs of conſcience, and that nice ſenſe of honour which they can find in no <hi>other men</hi>; and they honour them with many honours. 3d. This is a joyful and a bleſſed life. The ſcriptures ſpeak much of the joy of believers; they rejoice greatly, they are ready to pity thoſe that go to the world for their joy: for it ſeems to them comparatively, that nothing deſerves the name of joy, but joy in the Holy Ghoſt. I need not ſpend time in quoting the paſſages, to ſet forth the exceeding great joys of the firſt believers. Thoſe who read their bibles can eaſily quote many of them and would not be helped by my quotations. An impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant queſtion naturally ariſes here, viz. whether we chriſtians in theſe days have joys and comforts equal to thoſe of the firſt chriſtians. It will take ſome time to anſwer it; I hope it will not be time loſt. Thoſe believers who have aſſurance of their juſtification, which was common in thoſe early days, rejoice and triumph in Chriſt as they did; but alas! how few are there, who can adopt Paul's
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018428_0040_0FA76C70B6811830"/>
triumphant language in behalf of believers: It is God who juſtifies, it is Chriſt that died, &amp;c. &amp;c. Rom. viii. Moſt ſerious chriſtians will own that their religion has not made them happy, yet they at beſt go on between hope and fear, and muſt be in bondage through fear of death. Nay, ſome that have rejoiced greatly and for a long time, ſink into the horrible pit, and into the miry clay. They go mourning without the ſun, and refuſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. We do not learn from the apoſtolick writings, that any conſciencious chriſtians were fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with horrors of conſcience and fears of hell. To the benefit of the firſt chriſtians a ſort of divinity, which exiſted afterward, had no exiſtence then, viz. That great diſtreſſes and humiliations are neceſſary to faith, and that men muſt be ſo greatly humbled as to acquieſce in ſome ſenſe, in thinking of their own damnation. As there was no ſuch divinity then, it is reaſonable to think there was no ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and diſtreſſes among the chriſtians; had it been otherwiſe the firſt enemies of Chriſt would have availed themſelves of it. They would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it aloud, that chriſtianity was enemical to the peace and quiet of mankind; that its votaries were a gloomy ſort of mortals, and that it would not be ſtrange if ſome of the moſt ſerious chriſtians ſhould pine away with grief, and <hi>die with their new religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The ſilence of the apologiſts is proof enough, that from the beginning it was not ſo. The firſt chriſtians magnified Chriſt by their conſciencious and joyful lives. What is the reaſon then, that many now a-days, hang down their heads like bulruſhes, and by their ſorrowful countenances and ſighings frighten away others from the joyful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018428_0041_0FA76C712D17C320"/>
of Chriſt? they get under the law and keep under the law, with regard to the great ſcripture doctrine of juſtification by faith without works. When they believe this, as Paul and other chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians did, there could be no diſtreſs and horrors of darkneſs among thoſe who name the name of Chriſt. Chriſtians have a ſenſe of the worth of their ſouls, and ſometimes a great ſenſe, but they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith. They do not ſeem to be holy and humble enough yet to employ the Mediator, this is a common ſource of trouble to ſerious perſons, ſometimes of long continuance; and thoſe who endeavour to heal them oftentimes make them more melancholly and ſelf righteous than ever. The truth is, they keep away from the Mediator, who is the <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iſrael.</hi> How then can they be <hi>comforted!</hi> There is but one way, and that is by believing the goſpel to be <hi>true.</hi> It will be ſaid, Is this enough to cure all diſtreſſed, melancholly, deſponding chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians through chriſtendom? only to believe that the goſpel is true, the true word of God? Moſt certainly Paul tells the Theſſalonians, that they who had received the goſpel as the word of God were true believers. The ſame Paul declares over and over, that all believers are truſters in Chriſt. If men could believe the goſpel to be the true and faithful word of God without truſting in Chriſt, he could have had no ground for theſe ſinonomies; but it is impoſſible in the nature of the thing to believe that the goſpel came down from heaven, without truſting in Chriſt. If I dare not truſt in Chriſt becauſe I am ſo great a ſinner, I do not believe the goſpel is from God. When I
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018428_0042_0FA76C71E3BAC250"/>
am convinced in my ſoul and conſcience that God himſelf is the author of the good news, all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in hell cannot ſtop me from truſting in Chriſt one moment longer. This was Paul's own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, when he believed God himſelf was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the news, that the chief of ſinners were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to ſalvation. He truſted in Chriſt that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without ſtaying to <hi>ſee himſelf better.</hi> There is not that man living upon the face of God's earth, who knows that he hath truſted in Chriſt, and when he began to truſt in him, but will own that he truſted in him not as a ſaint, nor as a piece of a ſaint, but as a ſinner. We have proved that all that have received the goſpel as the word of God, are <hi>truſters in Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and we know the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are full of expreſſions of the joy, peace and comfort of thoſe who truſt in him. Sometimes they are ſaid to be filled with joy, and their joy is ſaid to be unſpeakable and glorious. But peace, reſt and comfort are every where ſaid to be the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe who truſt that through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they themſelves ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The point therefore is ſettled, that all dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, diſtreſſed, and deſponding chriſtians muſt be comforted, when they are taught of God to believe, that the goſpel is his very word. Doubts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes muſt all flee away like darkneſs before the ſun. For then they will ſee that the worſt men and women out of hell, if they want nothing but the death of Chriſt to recommend them, will be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God; they themſelves want nothing but the death of Chriſt. This is making the Lord Jeſus Chriſt their truſt, before, they were afraid to truſt him, it may be for years together; but now the

number and greatneſs of their ſins do not keep them away. Nay, if beſides all their other guilt they have been murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, ſuch complicated wickedneſs could not diſcourage them from making Chriſt their truſt. For they would know this to be the word of God, That where ſin hath <hi>abounded, grace hath abounded</hi> much more: and that ſin is not <hi>ſo mighty</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as the blood of Chriſt is mighty to juſtify and ſave. They would be ſprinkled from an evil and condemning conſcience, and would ſerve Chriſt with gladneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>Oh Chriſt! thou great Light of the world, ſhine forth. Let the goſpel come in much aſſurance, and in the holy ghoſt; that being received as the word of God and of Chriſt. Thouſands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of poor and diſtreſſed ſouls may be brought out of darkneſs into marvelous light; and, like the firſt chriſtians, glorify thee by their conſciencious, and joyful lives. I have now anſwered the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more largely then I intended at firſt: though I hope not unprofitably, for I have not only ſhewn that the firſt chriſtians were vaſtly ſuperior to us in peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why we are ſo little acquainted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God, but have alſo ſhewn what will be the certain and infallible cure. I hope my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion will not diſcourage any, and make them contended, though the conſolations of God are but ſmall. May it have no worſe effect upon an of us but this, to make us determine that by the grace of Chriſt we will not let him go till we drink deeper of the cup of conſolation; if we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

us. May we obſerve that injunction, that they which believe ſhould be careful to maintain good works: and may we fill up our time with evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal duties. The comforts of our holy religion are to be found only in the practice of the duties of it. Thoſe whom the ſcripture ſpeaks of as ſo much filled with the joys of the Holy Ghoſt did not live to Chriſt now and then as we are prone to do; but daily, hourly and habitually. If we can adopt their language and ſay, that for us to live is Chriſt, and that we want to live in the world, that he may be magnified by us in our mortal bodies. We ſhall have thoſe joys alſo that will make us <hi>bleſſed.</hi> Where is the <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> which ye ſpake of? That great philoſopher Seneca, wrote much on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a bleſſed life: other learned philoſophers did the ſame; but all their learning was no better than learned ignorance, for they knew nothing of the bleſſedneſs that cometh by faith. A believer is reconciled to God by the death of his Son: he has the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt. He ſhouts for joy—God makes him exceeding glad with the light of his countenance. God is his God, not only to worſhip and ſerve, but to enjoy and make him happy in this howling wilderneſs. He knows that when he is abſent from the body he ſhall be preſent with the Lord, which is far better. By dying he goes to God, to God his exceeding joy; and, with all the heavenly hoſt, ſhall be in his immediate preſence, where is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy, and at his right hand, where are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for ever more. This is the bleſſedneſs which cometh by faith, which Seneca and the other phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers could have no idea of: are we acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with it? Bleſſed be God for it, the more we are acquainted with it, the more we ſhall glorify him. God is glorified by the way in which we attain to it, and by the bleſſedneſs itſelf. He is glorified in the way by which it is attained: it is by faith, by ſtrong faith, and faith, eſpecially ſtrong faith, is for the glory of God. Strong love accompanies ſuch faith. We ſhall be conſtrained to yield that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act obedience to the commands of God which no man can yield, who keeps them to be juſtified by them. Our Saviour ſays, when we bring forth much fruit, our heavenly Father is glorified by us; and ſpeaking of himſelf ſays, I am glorified in them. Chriſt will manifeſt himſelf to them, and God will ſhine into their ſouls, and cauſe them to know that his loving kindneſs is better than life. And this bleſſedneſs will be for the glory of God, and the honour of Chriſt's divine religion. When men are full of worldly joy they cannot hide it—when men are filled with joy in the Holy Ghoſt, it cannot be concealed from their acquaintance. Humility will not conceal it: the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, will comfort the humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite. Humility is the ſpiritual vacuum; the more any are emptied of themſelves, the more will they be filled with the joys of heaven. Others therefore beholding them, and ſeeing that they live in all good conſcience, and go on their way to heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, may be convinced that God is with them of a truth, and glorify God with them in the day of their viſitation, whereby they will be partakers with them in their joys while in this world, and in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joys of the kingdom of Heaven, which God of his infinite mercy grant may be the portion of us all for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake.</p>
