            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Wiſh, that another Senſe may now have the like Operation; That the <hi>Ear</hi> may alſo <hi>affect the Heart</hi>; That when the <hi>Heart-affecting</hi> Objects your <hi>Eyes</hi> may find in the World about you, do ſtrike upon your <hi>Ears</hi> in our Enumeration of them, the <hi>Hearers</hi> may be <hi>Heartily affected</hi> with it. <hi>My Hearers,</hi> You muſt ſhut your <hi>Eyes,</hi> and ſtop your <hi>Ears,</hi> &amp; ſtupiſy all your <hi>Affections,</hi> if you take not an <hi>Affectionate Notice</hi> of the Things, which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001507_0003_0fb3802092548528"/>
I am going to ſet before you. Among the reſt, I intend a very <hi>Particular Notice</hi> of ſome Obſervable Things which ſeem to be Evident <hi>Judgments</hi> quickly overtaking ſuch as have been given up to more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Wickedneſs, both here, and in ſome other Places.</p>
            <p>It was an Ancient Obſervation; Eccl. VIII. 11. <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an Evil Work is not Executed ſpeedily, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men, is fully ſet in them to do Evil.</hi> But ſince we have ſeen more than once the Wrath of God <hi>Executed Speedily,</hi> and ſo Dreadfully upon ſome <hi>Evil Workers,</hi> it may be Hoped, the <hi>Hearts</hi> of men will be <hi>Affected</hi> with it, and the <hi>Hearts</hi> of ſome, not ſo <hi>fully ſet in them to do Evil,</hi> as they uſe to be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Poet,</hi> who made the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> that afford our Text unto us, had at this time a moſt <hi>Heart-affecting ſight</hi> before his Eyes. The whole BOOK of <hi>Lamentations</hi> is written, to tell you what it was. And the Clauſe that next follows the Text, more particularly does tell you,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001507_0003_0fb3802092548528"/>
It was, <hi>Becauſe of all the Daughters of my City.</hi> The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had made fearful Ravages upon the <hi>Country Towns,</hi> which were the <hi>Daughters</hi> of the Capital City. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the <hi>Mother of them all. Jeruſalem</hi> was alſo expecting the ſame Lamentable Fate, with her <hi>Daughters.</hi> Yea, She had already Drunk very deep of the Cup; ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been once Taken, and Plundred, &amp; Spoiled, &amp; miſerably Circumſtanced. Now, ſays he, <hi>Mine Eye affecteth mine Heart</hi>! O Servant of God, what was in thine <hi>Eye</hi>? He had in his <hi>Eye,</hi> whole Towns laid in Aſhes, by a Barbarous Enemy, a <hi>Bitter &amp; Haſty Nation</hi>; tho' far leſs Barbarous &amp; Bloody than One at this Day running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muck among the Nations! He had in his <hi>Eye,</hi> multitudes of his Brethren, led away <hi>Captives</hi> by Cruel <hi>Babylonians</hi>; Multitudes Maſſacred and Murdered, and made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Fury of a Terrible <hi>Tyrant.</hi> He had in his <hi>Eye,</hi> the Effects of raging <hi>Famine</hi> &amp; <hi>Sickneſs</hi>; All Order overturned; Univerſal Confuſion raging every where; the Symptoms of a Total Deſolation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. It muſt be an <hi>Heart of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> that would not be <hi>affected</hi> with the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001507_0004_0fb380221b5f2fd8"/>
Report, which an <hi>Eye</hi> beholding ſuch <hi>Spectacles</hi> muſt give unto it.</p>
            <p>But the DOCTRINE which I am now to give you is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When we have Heart-affecting Spectacles before our Eyes, we ſhould be Heartily affected with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eye</hi> ſhould <hi>affect</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> when we ſee with our <hi>Eye,</hi> what ſhould not be ſeen without an <hi>affected Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. <hi>Wonder not</hi> at it, That the World is filled with <hi>Heart affecting Spectacles</hi>; yea, with <hi>Miſerable Spectacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>Heart affecting Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> is the <hi>Worſt</hi> of them all; that is, The SIN, the SIN of the world: this tis that has brought in the reſt. The Sum of the <hi>Heart-affecting Spectacles</hi> in the world, is that; Lam. V. 16. <hi>We unto us, that we have Sinned.</hi> Firſt, we ſee <hi>Sin</hi> breaking in upon the World; a <hi>Flood</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> by our Fall from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> breaking in, and carrying all before it. O Spectacle full of Horror! O Hard <hi>Heart,</hi> O Baſe <hi>Heart,</hi> that is not Affected with it! The Death which we ſee to be the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001507_0004_0fb380221b5f2fd8"/>
               <hi>Wages of Sin</hi>; the Evil which we ſee <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of Sinners</hi>; the Wrath of God which we ſee Overtaking and Overwhelming the <hi>Children of Diſobedience</hi>; This 'tis, that makes every Corner of the world, full of Heart-affecting Spectacles. I am ſure, the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the World ſo accounted of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>How</hi> ſhould our <hi>Hearts</hi> be <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> with ſuch <hi>Heart-affecting Spectacles</hi>?</p>
            <p>Not with <hi>Wonder,</hi> or <hi>Murmur,</hi> I have told you. But I anſwer; <hi>Variouſly.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Various Nature</hi> of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>When our <hi>Eye</hi> ſhows us a Miſerable Spectacle, it muſt affect our <hi>Heart</hi> with <hi>Commiſeration.</hi> We ſhould heartily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate the Miſerable; our Heart ſhould be touched with a <hi>Compaſſion</hi> for them. So we read, Job XXX. 25. <hi>Did not I weep for him that was in Trouble? Was not my Soul grieved for the Poor</hi>?</p>
            <p>If there be Sin joyned with Miſery in the Spectacle, there muſt be <hi>Anger,</hi> there muſt be <hi>Anguiſh,</hi> joyned with the <hi>Compaſſion.</hi> We muſt be <hi>angry &amp; not ſin</hi>; we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be <hi>angry at ſin.</hi> Our <hi>Heart</hi> muſt be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001507_0005_0fb3802391199fe0"/>
Affected with a juſt Indignation at every Sin. So we read, 2 Pet. II. 7, 8. <hi>Juſt</hi> Lot <hi>was Vexed with the filthy Converſation of the Wicked; That Righteous man dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in Seeing and Hearing, Vexed his Righteous Soul from day to day, with their unlawful Deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this all the <hi>affection</hi> that is now called for. When we ſee Sin committed, we ſhould be moved with Fear. Sin does Expoſe men to the Judgments of God. When we ſee Sin, we ſhould Fear, leſt the Judgments of God befal the Sinner; yea, and thoſe that are about him alſo. Thus we read; Pſal. CXIX. 118, 120. <hi>Thou haſt trodden down all them that Err from thy Statutes; My Fleſh trembles for fear of thee, &amp; I am afraid of thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, methinks we may ſee occaſions for Thankfulneſs, even in every Miſerable Spectacle. We ſhould have our Hearts Affected with a Thankful Admiration at the Diſtinguiſhing Favours of God unto our ſelves. <q>Lord, Why am not I ſuch a Spectacle? Why is not this my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs? Tis what I have deſerved, as much as any in the world.</q> In the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001507_0005_0fb3802391199fe0"/>
midſt of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> we have thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments; Lam. III. 22. <hi>It is of the Lords Mercies that we are not Conſumed: becauſe His Compaſſions fail not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proper <hi>affections</hi> on ſuch <hi>Spectacles</hi> are not yet all fully <hi>to the Life</hi> Expreſſed. Something muſt be produced <hi>in the Life.</hi> Our Affections muſt produce Affectionate Reſolutions to Do all the <hi>Good</hi> that we can. We are affectionately to Deviſe Good, for the Relief of the Heart-affecting Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Or, the Spectacles are to mind us of ſome <hi>Good</hi> that we muſt Reſolve to do for our Selves, or Others. We muſt be provoked unto ſome Holy and Uſeful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions.

We read, <hi>He was Grieved.</hi> We read, <hi>He Sigh'd.</hi> We read, <hi>He Wept.</hi> We read, <hi>He was moved with Compaſſion.</hi> His Holy Soul was full of Agony. Oh, How He laid to Heart, the Evil which He ſaw that the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had brought upon the World! His Heart broke, and bled upon it! When He ſaw any Good, He Cried out, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven &amp; Earth</hi>! And for the Good He did! He went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſtill doing of Good. Yea, the Sun in the Firmament, it never did the Good, that was done by this Brighter Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>¶ I am now ready to ſet before your <hi>Eyes,</hi> O Congregation of the Lord, a Number of <hi>Heart-affecting Spectacles.</hi> They are <hi>Made</hi> already.

A Soul Wounded in all its Faculties. Blind, unable to ſee Truth; Lame, Unable to do Right. A Soul, full of Enmity to GOD, and all Goodneſs. A Soul, Depraved with moſt Vicious Inclinations. A Soul, Enſlaved unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and the Powers of Darkneſs. A Soul, Born under the Guilt of Original ſin, and by the Guilt of That; and, Oh! what an Enormous Heap of Actual ſin! bound over to ſuffer the ſtrange Puniſhment, which the Juſtice of God aſſigns to the Workers of Iniquity.

Our late King, often ſpoke it unto the Clerk of his Cloſet; That <hi>he found the Engliſh Nation a very wicked Nation.</hi> Great <hi>Britain,</hi> is a very Polluted Iſland; a Land full of Bloody Crimes. There goes up a Cry from that Land, in the Ears of the <hi>Lord of Sabaoth</hi>; Such a Cry that we may ſtand amazed at the Patience of Heaven, that it is <hi>Reprieved</hi> from fearful Deſolations; we may tremble to ſee the Predictions of our Famous <hi>Hooker</hi> making ſuch Approaches towards a dreadful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment.

            <p>There is a Faithful, and Worthy Man, Dr. <hi>John Edwards</hi>; who has lately obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Publick, with a Printed Sermon, on the Heinouſneſs of the Sins of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> That Servant of God, with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage well becoming ſuch an one, hath E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated horrendous Inſtances, wherein the Land hath grievouſly Sinned.

The Glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed God, we may ſee, tis very Little, very Little, Hearkened to. We may ſee, the Spirit of this World, Eating out, Eating up, the Spirit and Power of Godlineſs.

The ſight of <hi>Sin,</hi> wherever we ſee it, ſhould always broach our <hi>Sorrow.</hi> Oh! Let the Sinfulneſs of the World, and particularly, peculiarly, our part of the World, which lies moſt nearly before our Eyes, let it <hi>affect</hi> us at that rate; Pſal. CXIX. 136, 158. <hi>Rivers of Waters run down mine Eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law. I beheld the Tranſgreſſors &amp; was Grieved, becauſe they kept not thy Word.</hi> No doubt, Here are ſome, that in their Travels have had a ſight of <hi>Bedlam.</hi> If they were in a Sober Mind when they ſaw it, it Grieved them to ſee ſuch a Collection of <hi>Madmen</hi>; the ſight is a Grievous One! Sirs, The Sinful World, is little better than an Entire <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>; Tis full of Mad-men; All Sinners are Mad-men! With what Affliction, if we have any Love to Mankind, with what Affliction, muſt we ſay of the Fooliſh and Hurtful Things that we ſee done every Day; <hi>Poor Creatures, They know not what they do!</hi> Oh!

            <p>But then, I muſt add, That <hi>Abhorrence</hi> is another <hi>affection,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>Spectacle.</hi> Our Affection muſt be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, for the Sins that we ſee in other People. When others <hi>make void the Law</hi> of our God, Therefore, <hi>Therefore,</hi> Let us <hi>Love it above Gold, yea, above fine Gold; and Hate every Falſe way.</hi> When we ſee Ill Things, Vile Things, done by other men, it ſhould ſo Affect us, as to make us Avoid thoſe Things, and be able to ſay with him; Neh. V. 15. <hi>But ſo did not I, becauſe of the Fear of GOD.</hi> I have known ſome, who have Lived with <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Maſters,</hi> which took very Bad Courſes.

            <p>Such Sights we have had among us. But, How ſhould our <hi>Hearts</hi> be affected with them?

When <hi>Corah</hi> was fearfully Swallow'd up with an Earthquake, we read; Numb.

            <p>I now look on it, as a ſeaſonable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a Duty, to take ſome Notice of ſome Aſtoniſhing <hi>Spectacles,</hi> in the Iudgments of God upon ſome, whom <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> ſeems to have had an uncommon Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of.</p>
            <p>There is a Report of ſome things Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001507_0016_0fb3825ccafbd038"/>
in ſome Late Judgments of God. It is likely, there may be various Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of many Circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that matter. I will not therefore depend upon every thing that may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. But I ſuppoſe, no body doubts, There has been a very High Degree of Profaneneſs diſcovered by ſome Unhappy Men; and that God preſently ſingled out ſome of them, in a manner that much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened the Neighbourhood. But whether <hi>that</hi> matter have ſo much in it, as has been ſaid, or no, yet you may Remember, that a little while ago in this Town, A Poor Woman, was very much Diſcontented with her own Condition; but ſhe had Recourſe unto the Bottel of Rum, to quiet &amp; allay her Diſcontent. In that, ſhe drowned her Soul; But with the <hi>Rum</hi> there entred <hi>Satan</hi> into her; <hi>Satan</hi> took a ſtrange Poſſeſſion of her; She imagined ſhe muſt go where <hi>Satan</hi> would carry her. Tho' ſhe were carefully ſhut up, ſuch was the Efficacy of Satan, that he help'd her out of a Window, it was thought into the River; but with Circumſtances that fill the Neighbourhood with Conſternation. Her Carcaſe was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

found, where it could ſcarce have been imagined!</p>
            <p>Several ſuch things have occurred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; The Judgments of God, making a <hi>Quick Diſpatch</hi> of Sinners, that have grown Outragious in the Efforts of their Impiety.</p>
            <p>I think, Our <hi>Heart</hi> ſhould be <hi>affected</hi> at this rate, on ſuch Occaſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt; We ought to <hi>Bawail</hi> the ſcarce conceiveable <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> yea, <hi>Deviliſm,</hi> that Mankind may ſink into. When we ſee men Defying their Maker; Deriding all that is Venerable and Reaſonable; Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſquing Religion and Eternity; Not only moved by the Inſtigation of <hi>Devils,</hi> but even Turned into <hi>Devils;</hi> How can we do any other than Mourn, that ever any part of Mankind ſhould fall into ſuch a Depravation! Alas, That any of <hi>our Race</hi> ever ſhould be ſo prodigiouſly Depraved! <q>
                  <hi>How art thou fallen from Heaven,</hi> O Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! Thy <hi>Throne</hi> might have been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted among the <hi>Stars of God.</hi> Thou art brought down <hi>to Hell,</hi> to the ſides of <hi>the Pit. Hell from beneath</hi> is moved for thee; The Devils there come to meet thee;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001507_0017_0fb3825d8f7f9720"/>
They Triumph over thee; and their Hoarſe Notes upon thee are, <hi>Thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like one of us</hi>!</q> When the Man of God ſaw a <hi>Spectacle</hi> of Profanity, very ſhort of what we have ſeen, he rent his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he pull'd off his Hair; He ſat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed; he fell down on his Knees; he Cried out, Ezr. IX. 6. <hi>O my God, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, &amp; I bluſh to lift up my Face to thee, my God.</hi> Bleſſed <hi>Ezra</hi>! What wouldeſt thou have done, if thou hadſt been in our <hi>Horrible Times</hi>!</p>
            <p>Secondly; I am afraid, I am afraid, that the <hi>Language of Fiends</hi> paſſes too much Unpuniſhed. Yea, that moſt Helliſh and Roaring <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> are too patiently heard among us. It is to be fear'd, we are too Chargeable with that Error; Jer. V. 28. <hi>They overpaſs the deeds of the Wicked</hi>; Their nefarious Deeds are paſſed over, without any due Puniſhment inflicted on them. The <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> &amp; <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming,</hi> that is grown to Faſhionable with ſome <hi>Satanic</hi> People, will never be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, if it be not Puniſhed. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> cannot <hi>Puniſh</hi> it, if he be not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> of it. Be ſure, We all juſtly Expect,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001507_0017_0fb3825d8f7f9720"/>
That in his <hi>own Preſence,</hi> he will never En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. But men think it hardly <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> or <hi>Charitable</hi> to be <hi>Informers</hi> againſt theſe Offendors. That is to ſay; If a Mortal Man or Woman in Authourity ſhall be Reviled, or have their Authority De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, <hi>Information</hi> ought to be given. But if the Great GOD be Affronted, Abuſed, Vilified, and His Authority Spit upon, this muſt not be worthy of an <hi>Information</hi>! Ah, <hi>Zeal</hi> of Piety, When wilt thou return to the <hi>Earth,</hi> which thou haſt ſo much <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken!</hi> There are <hi>Two Parties,</hi> into which the World is divided; <hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, Sirs; You caſt off <hi>Charity</hi> too! The very <hi>Charity</hi> pretended for! Did you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the Delinquent; And on the Rebuke did he promiſe <hi>Amendment</hi>? In ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencies, <hi>this may go a Good way.</hi> But if it has not been ſo, the beſt <hi>Charity</hi> you can ſhow him, is to procure him that Gentle Puniſhment, which the <hi>Laws</hi> have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him. Tis <hi>Charity,</hi> to have him thus Admoniſhed, and Check'd, &amp; Stop'd, in his Fatal Career. God Sanctifies the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001507_0018_0fb3825f0f420180"/>
Strokes given by the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</hi> He is the <hi>Miniſter of God for Good,</hi> even unto <hi>Them,</hi> when he is a <hi>Terror to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-doers.</hi> If you let him go on without Controul, you Murder him; you ſee him running on to Perdition, &amp; you do nothing to hinder him. Where's your <hi>Charity</hi>?</p>
            <p>And, Methinks, <hi>Charity</hi> to the <hi>Publick</hi> ſhould prevail a little with you. If you knew of a man, that were going to <hi>Fire</hi> the Town, or to bring the <hi>Plague</hi> into the Town, would you give no <hi>Information</hi> of it? Verily, Theſe Criminals are doing ſo. They do what they can, and it is a Great Deal that they do, to bring down <hi>Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> from the Incenſed Wrath of Heaven upon the Town. The Deſolations are haſtened, by their being left Un-chaſtiſed. <hi>Chaſtiſements</hi> on them, are ſome of the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which would avert and keep off the impending Wrath of Heaven. Man, Loth to be called, An <hi>Ill Neighbour</hi>; Alas, Thou art a very <hi>Bad Neighbour.</hi> All the Neighbourhood is like to fare the worſe for thy Puſillanimity.</p>
            <p>If all other <hi>Charity wax Cold,</hi> as I doubt it may; Yet, My Friend, A Little <hi>Charity
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001507_0018_0fb3825f0f420180"/>
for thy ſelf</hi> may move a little. By bearing due Teſtimony againſt ſuch Criminals, a, <hi>Liberavi Animam,</hi> is obtained; thou <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt thy own Soul,</hi> from a ſhare in the Guilt of their Tranſgreſſions. It is an Eaſy and a Common Thing, for men to make the Sins of other men their own, by this; <hi>They hear them &amp; bewray them not.</hi> Becauſe they do not what they may, to have them fairly brought to Light, and Cenſured, they Contract a Guilty <hi>Fellowſhip in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of Darkneſs.</hi> It is to be Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, very many, very many among us, have lying upon us, the <hi>Sins of Other Men,</hi> deeply to be Repented of.</p>
            <p>I have one Propoſal more to make; but one that I am not my ſelf the Author of. There are beyond-Sea, many <hi>Societies for the Reformation of Manners.</hi> They have Informed againſt many Thouſands of <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> Wretches; and procured a Legal Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion upon them. They Publiſh many Diſcourſes and Perſwaſives, to Encourage men in that Action of Informing. And one of their Encouragements is; <hi>A Charity to the Poor.</hi> Very much of the <hi>Fines</hi> on

            </p>
            <p>One thing is.

juſtly thrown into a conſternation at the ſad proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of immediately periſhing in the Waters.</p>
                           <p>After we had ſpent ſome time in earneſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our ſelves to the Divine Mercy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, we cut our Main and Fore-maſt by the board, which Providentially falling to the Rock, I deſired ſome of the Men to try, if by the help of the Maſts they could recover the Shoar; and let us know their ſafety by their Calls to us: Two or Three of them did ſo; but the fierceneſs of the <hi>Wind,</hi> and the roaring of the <hi>Sea,</hi> perfectly drown'd their Voices, that we concluded 'em loſt: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Ship bilging, the Decks and Beams open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all things ſwimming out of the hould, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged us to make the ſame attempt they had done before us, which thro' the wonderful goodneſs of God, we did with ſucceſs; tho' much torn and bruiſed by the violence of the Sea againſt the Rock. When we had joyfully met thoſe that left us, we ſought for ſhelter to the Leeward of the Iſland, but found it ſo ſmall, inconſiderable and ſcraggy a Rock that it would afford us <hi>none</hi>; nor indeed room enough to walk, to ſecure us from the Injuries of the Wet and Cold.</p>
                           <p>When the Day appeared, it preſented us with a diſmal Spectacle, a doleful little Spot in the Sea, of about an Hundred yards ſquare, with only ſome ruins of our laſt Nights Shipwrack caſt up, or daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it; and a Miſerable number of us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Food or Shelter; ſaving ſome ſmall pieces of <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> we pick'd from among the Sea-weed, and ſome old Canvas we ſpread on the Craggs of the Rock to ſtow under at Night: part of our yards came a ſhoar, with our Cables and ſome Junk

conger'd about them, and our Anchor ſo Weighed by 'em, that a ſend of the Sea would ſhew it above Water; and ſome part of the Stern, with ſeveral pieces of Plank and Timber.</p>
                           <p>The next Morning, (13<hi>th</hi>) One <hi>Martin Downs</hi> our Cook dyed; and the beſt burial we could give him was to lay him where the Sea would carry him away: The reſt of our Men were generally ſo ill and bruiſed, that but 4 or 5 of us were able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing for our ſafety. This day finding ſome more Plank and Canvas ſent us a ſhoar, we built a ſort of a Tent, where we hous'd our ſelves from the Wind and Weather.</p>
                           <p>The 14<hi>th.</hi> after having Sang a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and been at <hi>Prayers,</hi> (which devotion we obſerved every Morning &amp; Evening,) we attempted to get Fire, by rubbing the dryeſt Sticks of Firr we could get together; which proving ineffectual, we made a ſort of a Drill, whoſe motion was more violent, but our Wood was ſo water-ſoaken, that we laboured in vain: and were extreamly pinch'd with the Cold for want of it, inſomuch that our Feet ſwell'd, and many of them were nip'd with the Froſt: This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening therefore I cut off my Boots, and deſired the Men to get their Shoes off, but ſo froſt-bitten and bliſter'd were ſome of their Legs, that in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off their Stockings, they fley'd off skin and all; and ſome of the Nails of their Feet: which we wrap'd up as warm as we could in O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>um &amp; Canvas. This Day the Sea flowing high came into our Tent, and carry'd away part of it; that we were neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to remove it to the higheſt Craggs of the Rock.</p>
                           <p>From about this time, (for I can't remember ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the Day of every occurrence) as often as the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001507_0027_0fb3827292dc9918"/>
Weather would permit, we hoiſted a Staff &amp; white <hi>Flag</hi> upon our Tent, in hopes that ſome Veſſel paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by might diſcover it. And now the Mercy of God ſent us a ſhoar three ſmall Cheeſes, which at the deſire of the Company, I dealt forth daily to every man an equal allowance of.</p>
                           <p>We began now to build a flat bottom'd float of the Plank &amp; Timber, laying three Plank's width for the bottom, and two up ſide, with ſome Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas like a waſt cloth upon that, to keep the Sea out the better; but ſo few hands were able to work, and our Carpenter rarely affording his aſſiſtance, becauſe of his illneſs, it was about the 20<hi>th.</hi> ere we had finiſhed it; and the 21<hi>ſt.</hi> proving moderate Weather, it was agreed that my Mate, with 4 or 5 of the Men with me, ſhould endeavour to recover the Main, and ſend a Veſſel for the reſt.</p>
                           <p>Accordingly, with much ado, we got it down to the Water ſide, having firſt Commended our ſelves and our enterprize to the bleſſing of God by earneſt Prayer; about Noon we lanched the float, being neceſſitated to wade deep into the Water to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it; but the rowling Surff ſoon threw us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſhoar, and over-ſet us; and it was a great Mercy that we eſcaped drowning, ſo feeble were we and unable to help our ſelves: The Boat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtove againſt the Rock, and tho' our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was daſh'd, and our hopes baulkt, and the loſs of our Ax &amp; Hammer, with the Boat, was great, yet we could not but ſee the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God in the midſt of <hi>Judgment,</hi> for in the afternoon, the Wind ſprang up and blew hard, that had we been at Sea in that <hi>imitation of a Boat,</hi> in all probability we had periſhed; and thoſe we were to have left behind
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001507_0028_0fb38274d08d9c20"/>
would have fared no better becauſe unable to help themſelves: Thus our <hi>Diſappointment</hi> (thro' the goodneſs of God) proved our <hi>Safety.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We were now brought into very Miſerable &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy circumſtances; the men extream Weak, their Feet frozen, with deep Ulcers in their Legs; the very ſmell of them offenſive to thoſe of us that could go into the Air, and nothing to dreſs them with but a piece of linnen that was hove up; our ſmall ſtock of Cheeſe ſpent, and nothing left us to ſupport Nature but a few <hi>Muſſels,</hi> ſcarce, and hard to get, and the <hi>Sea-weed</hi> that grew upon the Rock; we had now the black proſpect of <hi>Starving,</hi> while our Limbs periſhed by piece meals; and we were under the afflicting apprehenſions leſt the <hi>Spring Tide,</hi> at the approaching Full Moon, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with a high Wind and quite over-flow us; beſides the aggravating Affliction that all the Veſſels we ſaw paſs at a diſtance, took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Signal; That we were ready to lye down in deſpair, and the moſt of us not ſo much as hop'd for deliverance: Tho' I endeavoured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them and my ſelf to put our Truſt in God, and patiently <hi>Wait for his Salvation</hi>; and I look'd upon it as a great favour, in this Diſtreſs, that the Mate ſtruck down a <hi>Sea Gull,</hi> which we got and thankfully fed upon.</p>
                           <p>The laſt method of ſafety we could engage in was to make a <hi>Raft</hi> that would carry Two Men; but the labour of clearing the Fore yard, of which it was chiefly to be made, from the Cable &amp; Junk, was ſo great, and our <hi>Hands</hi> ſo few &amp; weak, that it was about the 24<hi>th.</hi> ere we had finiſhed it; which proving a moderate Day, with a fine Sea-brieze, we

got it down to the Water, and after having made our Supplications to Heaven for Succeſs, two of the men, who were more eſpecially deſirous of ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, were launched upon it, about two in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; but the ſwell rowling high over ſet it, as it had done our Boat; and tho' one of the men (an Engliſh man that could not ſwim) refuſed a ſecond attempt, yet the other (a <hi>Swede,</hi> whoſe Feet were ſo frozen that he was forced to crawl upon his hands &amp; knees to the Water-ſide) continued reſolute to attempt the ſhoar, tho' he ſhould go alone; another of our men encouraged by his reſolution undertook to bear him company: after they had put off from us, they deſired me to go to Prayer for them &amp; watch what became of them; I did ſo; and by that time the evening came on, I tho't they might be half way a-ſhoar; &amp; the Wind blowing hard about 9 or 10 at night, at <hi>S.

                           <p>About the latter end of this Month, the <hi>Carpenter,</hi> who had been ill ever ſince his coming a-ſhoar, and now having his Feet frozen, an exceſſive pain in his

back, and ſuch a ſtiffneſs in his Neck, that he could not ſtir his head, and almoſt choaked with Phlegm, to our apprehenſion drew near his End; towards evening we raiſied his head, and I Prayed over him; he ſhew'd himſelf <hi>Senſible,</hi> but was <hi>Speechleſs</hi>; about Midnight I enquired of them that lay next him, who told me, he was dead.</p>
                           <p>The next Day preſented me with the moſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy view of the effects of <hi>Hunger</hi>; for our ſtarving Company, who had now been for ſeveral Days without any ſuſtenance, but Sea weed and 2 or 3 <hi>Muſſels</hi> a day, deſiring of me that they might have <hi>his Body</hi> to ſupport their Lives with: This, of all I had met with, was the moſt ſhocking to me; to ſee us drove to ſuch neceſſity as to eat what ſeemed to contrary to Nature: I begg'd of God that He would find out ſome way for our ſupport, without feeding upon our <hi>Dead Companion</hi>; but all other means failing, and the Men inceſſantly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon me for it, I was forced to give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and their own feebleneſs neceſſitated me, upon their requeſt, to prepare it for them the beſt manner I could, that they might not all periſh with hunger. I gave them ſome of it that Night; and the next day ſuffered them to Eat what they would of it; but finding ſome very ravenous, I was forced to keep watch over it, and let them have only their daily Portion; leaſt, ere we obtain'd our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, this ſhould be ſpent, and we be obliged to feed upon the <hi>Living.</hi>

                           <p>It having pleaſed God, in Mercy to us, to put it into the hearts of ſome People, where the Raft was caſt a ſhoar, to come upon the ſearch; the ſight of a Veſſel on the Morning of the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>January</hi>
                              <pb n="57" facs="unknown:001507_0029_0fb382764f75bbb0"/>
half way from the ſhoar, ſtanding directly for us, made our hearts leap within us: When they came within Call, I deſired them to vere a Buoy to me, and I would faſten my ſelf to the End of the Rope, and they ſhould hale me on board; (for the ſwell would not ſuffer them to venture to the Rock) but expecting ſmoother Water, they hovered about the Iſland till Noon; when I told them we were periſhing for want of <hi>Fire,</hi> which we had been without all this cold ſeaſon; at length one of the Men came a-ſhoar in his ſmall Canoo, and gave us the refreſhment of a <hi>Fire</hi>; I thought to have gone on board with him, but the rowling Surff over-ſet the Canoo, and I was glad to tarry to dry my ſelf; and the Man, after waiting for a favourable ſnatch, till near Sun ſet, was forced to go without me, the Canoo not being able to carry us both in ſuch a ſwell.</p>
                           <p>It was an uncomfortable ſight to ſee the Shallop ſtand away for the ſhoar without us: but that Night proving ſtormy Weather, our Good Friends loſt their <hi>Veſſel,</hi> tho' they Saved their <hi>Lives</hi>; but had <hi>we</hi> been with them, our feebleneſs would hardly have ſuffered us to have eſcaped: So that ſtill the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God is to be ſeen in our <hi>Diſappointment.</hi>
                           </p>

Tho' we were ſatisfyed the People a-ſhoar knew of our miſerable Condition, yet our fleſh now failing, and no drink all this while but the brackiſh Water in the Crags of the Rock, and our Tent rendred uncomfortable by the blinding Smoak, and the Weather ſuch as

we knew none could come to our aſſiſtance while it laſted, made our hearts to fail within us; and the <hi>near proſpect</hi> we had had of deliverance, gave us but ſo much the more uneaſineſs at the <hi>delayes</hi> of it.</p>
                           <p>But it pleaſed God that in the Night the Wind abated, and by Sun riſe the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> we had a Shallop come for us, with Captain <hi>Long,</hi> and Captain <hi>Furbur,</hi> who were very brisk in getting us on board, and kind in their treatment of us. That Night about 8 a clock we arrived at <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> where we were very civilly received, and the kind People there made a Collection for the relief of my men: and tho' my Boy neglecting to pull off his Shoes, as I ordered, had his Feet ſo ſwoln and black that I never expected he would have the uſe of them again, was forced the next day to have half of one of his Feet taken off, yet thro' the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Mercy of God, he and all the Men are in a likely way of recovery: My own Health and Stength by the diſtinguiſhing Goodneſs of God, having been continued to me the whole of our Twenty four Dayes Miſery, beyond Expectation.</p>
