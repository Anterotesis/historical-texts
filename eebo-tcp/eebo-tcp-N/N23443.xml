            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE AND CONFESSION OF THOMAS POWERS, A NEGRO.</head>
            <p>I THOMAS POWERS, was born in Wallingford, in Connecticut, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 15th, 1796. My father's name is Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Powers; and my mother before marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was Prudy Waterman. I was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and youngeſt Son of my father, with whom I lived, till I was two years old. He then put me out to live with Mr. Moſes Tharp, of Norwich, (Conn.) where I reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one year, and then returned to my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who, being a very pious man, endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſtruct me in my ſeveral duties, to God, to my parents, and to all mankind;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031037_0005_0FEA62384AB52E30"/>
as far as my young and tender mind was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving any virtuous impreſſions. But I was naturally too much inclined to vice, to profit by his precepts or example; for I was very apt to pilſer and tell lies, if I thought there was any occaſion.</p>
            <p>When I was nine years old, I was put out to live with Iſaac Johnſon, of Lebanon, (Conn) where I lived two years, and very early began the practice of villainy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery. It was here I began my career in the gratification of that corrupt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs paſſion, which has now brought me to the threſhold of eternity, before my years were half numbered.</p>
            <p>Being one Sunday at home from meeting, with nobody but a young Negro woman, who lived in the houſe, ſhe, enticing me to her bed, where ſhe was ſitting, ſoon taught me the practice of that awful ſin, which now coſts me my life; for which together with diſobedience to my maſter, and many other villaneous tricks which I uſed to play upon him, he often corrected me, but to ſo little purpoſe that he diſmiſſed me from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Then I returned once more to my father, where I lived a few months, till he, not lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my behaviour, bound me out to Mr. Oliver Hyde, of Norwich, (Conn.) D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with him, who was a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031037_0006_0FEA623A8A075260"/>
kind maſter, I was taught to read and write a tolerable good hand; but being nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally vicious I improved my talents, (or rather miſimproved them) to very bad pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. I uſed to make a point of pilfering whenever I could; for when I ſaw an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, the devil, or ſome other evil ſpirit, always gave me a ſtrong inclination. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was becauſe I was naturally inclined to be light-fingered; for I never heſitated to touch any thing that came in my way. Here too I played my pranks, with the young black girls about the ſtreets; and indulged myſelf as freely as I could without diſcovery.</p>
            <p>In the year 1789, I broke open a ſtore in Norwich, (Conn.) owned by Mr.— took a few articles of goods and fifteen dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in Caſh. In the next place, knowing my preſent maſter, Oliver Lathrop, to have on hand a large ſum of money, I ſuppoſed that I might take about twenty dollars and neither of us fare the worſe. I, however, ſoon repented of this bargain; for being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, I was forced to return the money, and take a few ſtripes on my back; but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I had received my juſt deſerts I might poſſibly have eſcaped the fate, which now awaits me.</p>
            <p>In the year 1793 I moved with my maſter from Norwich, in Connecticut, to Lebanon, in New Hampſhire, where I ſoon run the length of my chain, and compleated my vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031037_0007_0FEA623C0EA51988"/>
committing a number of crimes, which black as I am, I ſhould bluſh to repeat.</p>
            <p>Before I removed from Norwich, (Conn.) I attempted to raviſh a young girl, who was viſiting in the neighborhood. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I took an old ſword, and went into the woods where I ſuppoſed ſhe would return in the evening, and concealed myſelf in the buſhes, where I waited till 12 o'clock; but as providence ordered it, ſhe did not go home that night, and ſo eſcaped the ſnare I had laid for her.</p>
            <p>On the 7th day of Dec. 1795, being at work with Mr. Gordon Lathrop, I agreed to meet him in the evening, at Thomas Rowels, to wreſtle. Accordingly a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſun down I ſat out, without any evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. I overtook a young woman, whom I knew to be — I paſſed on by her, a pretty good jog, till after a little querying with myſelf, and finding nothing to oppoſe, but rather the devil to aſſiſt me, I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make an attempt on her virgin chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.—So I way Laid her, and as ſhe came up, ſeized her with one hand, and her horſe's bridle with t'other, ſhe aſk'd me what I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—I told her to diſmount and I would tell her. At the ſame time taking her from her horſe, I threw her on the ground, and in ſpite of her cries and entreaties, ſucceeded in my helliſh deſign. Then left her, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031037_0008_0FEA52A764BED470"/>
went to the place propoſed, where I found my antagoniſt; but the evening being far ſpent, I returned to my maſter's houſe and ſat down, as uſual, to play chequers with the children.</p>
            <p>It was not long before I heard people round the houſe, and was afterwards infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they were after me; but ſeeing me ſo lively at play, ſays the <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> "It can't be Tom"—ſo they went away. I ſoon went to bed; but in about two hours, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked from ſleep by a number of people who entered my room, and called me their "pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner."</p>
            <p>I was confined, till next day, when I had my trial before <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> Hough, who ſentenced me to priſon; accordingly I was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſecured in Haverhill jail, on the 10th day of Dec. As we were paſſing by the place, where the crime was committed, I was queſtioned concerning the fact; but, I, like a hardened villain, as I was, denied ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſyllable of the truth, and had but little ſenſe of my ſituation, till the key of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was turned upon me, when my feelings were ſuch as no pen or tongue, can deſcribe. On the fifth of April, after 4 months con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, with the help of two of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions we broke goal after three hours hard work. We went to the river, ſtole a boat, ran three miles down, and ſent her adrift.

            <p>From thence, we went to Capt. Frye Bailey's in Newbury, where we ſtole a horſe, and went fifteen miles to Ryegate.

I, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, miſſed my road and came back to Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton where I enquired for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lake Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and as I was going quite the other way, I was ſuſpected of being a rogue, and I confeſs they had ſome grounds for their ſuſpicion, as one of them was acquainted with me. I was, of conſequence, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately returned to my old lodgings in Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erhill. Here I was now hand-cuffed, and my arms pinioned; and put into the upper loft of the Priſon: but on Sunday, the 4th day after my laſt commitment, I ſawed of my pinions acroſs the grates of the priſon; and with the help of a knife, got a piece of board, with which I pryed off the grate. I then went to work to cut up my blanket, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtrips, and tying them together from the grate, I deſcended from the upper loft. As I paſſed by the grate of the lower room, I
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031037_0010_0FEA6242F9609940"/>
called to the priſoners below telling them, of my liberty but deſired them to ſay nothing till I had got off; but Holmes ſwore he would ſtop me, if in his power, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately raiſed the Jailor.—I ran as faſt as I could, after being almoſt ſpent with fatigue, in getting my liberty, and deſcending from the upper loft, with hand-cuffs on; and while they were looking for me in the moſt obſcure places, near the Goal, ſuppoſing me to be there concealed; but I made my eſcape into the river road, and at break of day, I found myſelf at Capt. John Mann's in Or-ford. I then thought it prudent, to avoid diſcovery, to go back into the woods, where I lay till night.</p>
            <p>I then proceeded on to Lyme, and broke into a blackſmith ſhop, to rid myſelf of my Hand cuff's which in my travels, I found rather uncomfortable companions, and I ſuſpected, in caſe of being ſeen and noticed, they would prove but a poor recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. However I could not ſucceed; ſo I went on to Gould's Tavern, and took a horſe, which I rode about three miles; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to get him any farther, I attempted to drown him to get my revenge; but could not eaſily ſucceed, and I left him to ſhirk. I then proceeded on to a ſmith's ſhop on College Plain, where I made another fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs attempt to get my hands at liberty.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031037_0011_0FEA6244834D7968"/>
When I got into the edge of Lebanon, it was day light; ſo I wandered about in the woods till evening, when I went to Mr. Quimbe's ſhop in Lebanon and ſawed, and twiſted my hand-cuffs about two hours, and gave out being quite overcome for want of food. I then went to my maſter's houſe, looked in at the window, but guilt being my companion, I dared not enter. I then retired ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the houſe and ſawed my cuffs acroſs a rock, till by the help of a file, I liberated my hands, and went to Mr. T. Rowel's, whom I ſuppoſed to be a friend; But he, like moſt friends, in adverſity, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me, and turned my enemy. For upon ſeeing how cold and hungry I was, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pity me, and told me to go to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain barn, and he would bring me ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; but inſtead of victuals, he muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all the force he could to take me. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing however, aware of his treachery, when day light appeared, I fled to the woods, and lay there, where I ſuffered extremely with the cold. Upon ſeeing them come into the woods I lay down under a log, and as they paſſed along one of them trod on me, but did not perceive me. I then thought beſt to ſhift my courſe, and taking a croſs lot, one of them ſaw me, as I aſcended a little riſe of ground, and nailed me. I pointed to a barn at ſome diſtance, and ſaid, "he has juſt

gone by the barn.—" which turned the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the whole that way; he then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to be one of their party, as it was between day light and dark.</p>
            <p>This gave me a little breath again, and I thought of trying to get ſome refreſhment by milk, from a cow of my maſter's, as I had not eat or drank for nigh 4 days, but could not find her, where I expected. I however found ſome raw potatoes and eat of them freely. At laſt I took up a reſolution to uſe my hand-cuff bolt, for my defence, and to go into the houſe; which I did, but ſound none but children round the tea-table, who where exceedingly frightened, and run away, all but a boy, who told me to take what I wanted, if I was hungry. I ſeized half a cheeſe, and half a loaf of bread, which was on the table, and ran off. I ſoon met a Mr. Colburn, who knew me, and told me to go with him, and nobody ſhould hurt me adding that I ſhould have any refreſhment I wanted. I followed him home, and no ſooner had we got there, than he ſent to inform my purſuers. I ſtept to the door, and ſaw them coming over the hill—I ſtarted to run and Colburn ſtruck at me, but I eſcaped and ran till I fainted and fell. His dog followed me, however, and barked till they came up and took me, as their priſoner.</p>
            <p>The time of my trial was now come on, and and inſtead of carrying me to Haverhill, I was carried to Plymouth, where I immediately had my trial before the Hon. Superior Court, and was ſentenced, very juſtly, to death. At firſt, upon hearing my ſentance, it had no impreſſion on my mind—for my heart was hardened beyond
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031037_0013_0FEA624AAAFFD3E8"/>
deſcription. After a little reflection, however, I fainted, and could not ſpeak for ſome time.—At length I came to myſelf, and deſired to ſee the young Lady, whom I had injured. This ſhe refuſed, but ſaid ſhe, would receive any meſſage I wiſhed to ſend to her. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and wrote a confeſſion of my crime, and of the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my puniſhment. I begged pardon, moſt ſincerely for the injury, I had done her. She ſent me for anſwer, that ſhe could forgive me, and hoped that God would do the ſame. I was then conducted to priſon and bound with irons. During my reſidence here under ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of death, I have not been wholly inſenſible of my pitiable ſituation; as my maſter as well as the divines who have attended me, have ever endeavored to impreſs me with a ſenſe of a ſtate of future happineſs or miſery to which I was deſtined; but the ſecret hope of making my eſcape, and, the jollity of countenance that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in moſt of my ſpectators; did in ſome meaſure baniſh the idea of death from my mind. The ninth of June, a number of Doctors made application to me for my BODY, for DISSECTION, after my execution; to which I readily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſmall ſum of ten dollars, thinking it might afford me a comfortable ſubſiſtance while here, and my BONES be of ſervice to mankind after the ſeperation of ſoul and body, which muſt ſhortly take place, and at which time may I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneſs of all mankind, and of my God, before whom I muſt appear through the merits of a Redeemer.</p>
