            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE next moſt important article of inquiry involved in the reſolutions of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the twenty-third of January laſt; and in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which have been made reſpecting the conduct of this department, relates to the loans negotiated under the acts of the fourth and twelfth of Auguſt, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety.</p>
            <p>The papers which have been tranſmitted to the Houſe by order of the Preſident, diſcloſe the following particulars—</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the immediate ſuperintendance of the buſineſs of the loans was confided to the department of the treaſury, being naturally connected with it. This truſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the original inſtructions for regulating the execution of it, which have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, was of courſe ſubject to ſuch directions from time to time, as the Preſident ſhould think fit to give, or as occaſions ſhould require—A conſiderable latitude of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, nevertheleſs, from the very nature of the caſe, attended it; ſo as juſtly to leave on the head of this department, a complete reſponſibility in all inſtances, where ſpecial exceptions do not appear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the firſt loan which was obtained, was undertaken and completed by the agency of Wilhem and Jan Willink, and Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorſt and Hubbard, who both under the former and preſent government, have been and are the bankers of the United States at Amſterdam.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That with the ſingle exception of the firſt loan, William Short, Eſq. then charge des affaires at the court of France, now reſident miniſter at the Hague, was conſtituted the ſole agent of this department, for carrying into effect the powers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided to it; with this qualification only, that if any negociation with a Prince or State, to whom any part of the debt to be diſcharged by the loans was due, ſhould be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite—the ſame was to be carried on through the perſon, who in capacity of miniſter, charge des affaires, or otherwiſe, then was or thereafter might be charged, with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the affairs of the United States, with ſuch Prince or State.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all payments, which have been made out of the proceeds of the loans, have been made by the immediate and ſpecial order of Mr. Short, except thoſe, upon the bills of the Treaſurer for the monies drawn to this country, and thoſe to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lenders in Holland; which were made in courſe by our bankers, at the periods they reſpectively became due.—This conſequently embraces all the payments to France; the very laſt of which, though agreed for by Mr. Morris, in conſequence of his having been employed for a ſpecial purpoſe by Mr. Short, was not, and could not, be completed, but by the ſame <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> direction of Mr. Short.</p>
            <p>It moreover appears, from the ſame papers, and more fully from the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at large, now before the Senate, that except in the particular inſtance which has been juſt ſtated, with regard to Mr. Morris, there has been no other agency in the whole buſineſs, than that of Mr. Short, and of the bankers at Amſterdam and Antwerp, whom he neceſſarily employed as inſtruments in the negociation with the money lenders, and in the receipt and diſburſement of the monies borrowed.—Theſe as already mentioned, were at Amſterdam, the two houſes of Wilhem and Jan Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>link, and of Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorſt and Hubbard; at Antwerp a Mr. G. De Wolf, was the banker.</p>
            <p>It may not be without its uſes to add, that the monies proceeding from the loans, have conſtantly remained in the hands of the reſpective bankers, till they have been paid over to the creditors; namely, the French treaſury, or their bankers, the money lenders or their repreſentatives, the holders of the bills drawn from this country by the Treaſurer. Neither Mr. Short nor Mr. Morris, has ever had poſſeſſion of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle guilder. The latter indeed has never even had power over <hi>one,</hi> excepting merely a ſum of 105,000 guilders, by letters of mine dated the 13th September laſt, placed at his diſpoſal for paying <hi>at Paris,</hi> according to ſtipulation, the intereſt on the debt due to foreign officers. The fact is, and it is ſo demonſtrated by the correſpondence already referred to, that I never wrote a line to Mr. Morris on the ſubject of the loans or their proceeds, but in reference to the caſe, juſt mentioned of the intereſt payable to foreign officers; in reſpect to which local ſituation governed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:026347_0003_0FCFB64DAA830E80"/>
One more circumſtance only is neceſſary to be noticed in this place, with a view to the elucidation intended: It is this—that the laſt payment, though originating prior to the change in the political poſition of France of the 10th of Auguſt laſt, not having been conſummated 'till the 6th of September following, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll of courſe under the diſpoſition of thoſe then in poſſeſſion of the power of the nation.</p>
            <p>It could not but have been unexpected to me, that exception ſhould be taken to the report lately made by me on the ſubject of foreign loans, for the omiſſion of details which I did not at the time, and do not yet, conceive, to have been called for, by the terms of the reſolutions upon which it was founded. The requeſt addreſſed to the Preſident, by thoſe reſolutions, was, that he would cauſe to be laid before the Houſe, a particular account of the <hi>ſums borrowed under his authority</hi> by the United States, the <hi>terms</hi> on which each loan was obtained, the <hi>applications,</hi> which had been made <hi>of the monies,</hi> agreeably to appropriations, the <hi>balances,</hi> if any, which remained unapplied, ſpecifying alſo at what <hi>times intereſt commenced</hi> on the ſeveral ſums obtained, and at what <hi>times it was ſtopped</hi> by the ſeveral payments made. It was not natural to imagine that theſe expreſſions were deſigned to comprehend a ſpecification of the <hi>preciſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> under which the loans were negotiated, of the <hi>names</hi> of the <hi>perſons,</hi> by whom they were negotiated, of the particular <hi>place</hi> or <hi>places,</hi> where the balance unexpended of the ſums that had been drawn for to the United States, were <hi>depoſited.</hi> Still leſs natural was it for me to anticipate ſurmiſes, which could give to ſuch particulars the ſhadow of importance. But as animadverſions have attended the omiſſion of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, I ought to regard it as an admonition to me, to be more full and preciſe in my preſent communication; a motive which co-operates with my deſire, to throw all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible light upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>The firſt general circumſtance, which requires to be noticed and explained, after the particulars that have been communicated is this—That all the loans which have been hitherto obtained, have been made under the authority of both acts, without particular reference to either.</p>
            <p>The idea originally entertained, was to conduct them on a different plan, founding each loan upon one or the other of the acts; as will be ſeen by my letter of the 28th of Auguſt, 1790, to our bankers at Amſterdam; at the ſame time, that it will appear, from the ſame letter, that the ſeparation did not appear to me a matter of conſequence, and that I anticipated the poſſibility of a difficulty in adhering to it in the particular caſe. That difficulty, proved in the opinion of the bankers, to be of ſufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to render the arrangement contemplated, under the circumſtances of the caſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſeable; as they inform me in their anſwer to the abovementioned letter.</p>
            <p>But prior to the receipt of that anſwer, further enquiry and reflection had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to abandon my original idea—as likely to produce embarraſſment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, both in the negotiation of the loans, and in the application of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. It was accordingly concluded to let the loans proceed indiſcriminately, upon both acts.</p>
            <p>Theſe loans were to have reference to two purpoſes—firſt, the reimburſement of the foreign debt; ſecond, the purchaſe of the domeſtic debt at its market price.</p>
            <p>There were weighty reaſons for carrying on both theſe operations concurrently. The arrears to France had been a conſiderable time accumulating. It was in every ſenſe proper that a reimburſement of them ſhould begin without delay, and deſireable for obvious reaſons, that it ſhould go on without any very conſiderable chaſms or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſions. This manner of proceeding could not but have the faireſt chance of being the moſt ſatisfactory and convenient to France; unleſs indeed the buſineſs were to have proceeded upon the principle of an entire poſtponement of the domeſtic object, to that of the reimburſement.</p>
            <p>But very cogent reaſons rendered this courſe not the moſt eligible—The early com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of purchaſes of the debt, was a matter of real and great importance.</p>
            <p>It was important in two relations; as it regarded the advantages to the government, from redeeming a portion of the debt at low prices; and ſtill more, as it regarded the ſavings to the country from raiſing the price of ſtock on foreign purchaſers; the beneficial influence upon the credit of the nation abroad and at home, to be expected from a quick appreciation of the public obligations; the benefit to the public credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in general, and to the moſt meritorious claſſes of them in particular, which would reſult from the ſame cauſe; all which objects were ſuggeſted from the treaſury, as motives to the proviſion reſpecting purchaſes, and are evidently contemplated in the preamble of the act, which makes that proviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:026347_0004_0FCFB64FD9DA4170"/>
Excluſive of the other advantages, which have been cited, and which are of a nature truly precious and important, that of preventing foreigners from acquiring the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of our citizens at a great undervalue is too obvious not to be eſtimated, as it ought to be, at firſt ſight. It cannot require argument to ſhew how great an evil it was, that foreigners ſhould be able to acquire with nine or ten, that for which the country would ultimately have to pay them twenty, with full intereſt in the interval; nor how much it merited the attention of the government to prevent or leſſen ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an evil.</p>
            <p>But the influence which the purchaſes by the government may have had upon this event may not be equally obvious. It is however not difficult to be traced. Price naturally keeps pac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with competition and demand; whatever increaſes the latter, neceſſarily tends to an augmentation of the former. Merely then as another purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, by adding to the competition and demand, the purchaſes of the government, were calculated to influence a riſe of price. But they had an effect more than proportioned to their real extent. Imagination has much to do in all ſuch queſtions, and in ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing ſo much as in what relates to public funds. Experience proves, that it is here exerted with uncommon effort. The appearance of the government as a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer has not failed to excite the expectation of a greater demand than was real, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the extent of the reſources to be employed, might be very great, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; which by ſtimulating the zeal of thoſe who wanted to buy, leſt the price ſhould riſe ſuddenly and conſiderably upon them, and by encouraging thoſe who wanted to ſell, under the hope of a better price, to hold back the commodity, has in both ways generally contributed to give a ſpring to the market. Prices once raiſed, when founded on intrinſic value, tend to maintain themſelves; becauſe thoſe who have given them, are for the moſt part intereſted in keeping them up. And every new impulſe, which they receive, ſerves to carry them rapidly to their juſt level.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have been moſt attentive to the operation of the public purchaſes, will have the leaſt doubt that they had a material agency, in accelerating the appreciation of the public ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck.</p>
            <p>An enquiry naturally ariſes here—Were the monies which were drawn from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope on account of the foreign loans, the inſtrument of the purchaſes, to which theſe beneficial effects are aſcribed?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that theſe purchaſes are to be attributed to the inſtrumentality of that fund—that had it not been for this reſource, they could not have been made at the early periods, when moſt of them were made. The courſe of the tranſaction will be fully and with more propriety explained in another place.</p>
            <p>An attention to both objects—to the reimburſements to France, and to the purchaſes of the debt, rendered expedient a ſubdiviſion even of the firſt loan. Conſiderations of the moment ſeconded thoſe of a general nature, to induce an immediate payment to that country—The loan had been undertaken without previous authority from hence, with a view to ſuch payment. This was known and a correſpondent expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation excited. The immediate ſituation of the French finances, rendered a payment at the particular juncture more than ordinarily intereſting. In ſuch a ſtate of things, there could be no heſitation, about applying a large part of the loan to that object. Another part of it was of neceſſity applied to the payment of the ſums, that were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling due on the Dutch loans. And it is preſumed, that the reaſons which have been aſſigned, will appear to have been ſufficiently powerful to have dictated the drawing of a part of it to the United States.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, a million and a half of the three millions borrowed, were appropriated to France, ſomething more than 800,000 guilders were drawn for here, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the loan was left to be diſburſed in Holland.</p>
            <p>It ſhall not be concealed, though I am aware that the acknowledgment may be a ſubject of criticiſm, that the conduct which was purſued, both with regard to this and to the ſucceeding loan, was in ſome degree, influenced by a collateral conſideration. The government had but juſt adopted a plan for the reſtoration of public credit. The periodical payment of intereſt was to commence on the 1ſt of April 1791. A conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the revenue out of which the monies were to ariſe was only to begin to accrue on the firſt of January preceding. This revenue was liable to credits of four, ſix, and twelve months.</p>

How far its eventual product would anſwer expectation—how far the punctuality of payments could be relied upon, were points unaſcertained, and which required to their aſcertainment much more experience than had been obtained. In ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was not only natural, but neceſſary for an adminiſtrator of the finances to doubt—and doubting it was his duty to call to the aid of the public credit, every auxiliary, which it was in his power to command—He was bound to reflect, that a failure in any ſtipulated payment would be fatal to the dawning credit of the country—to the reputation of the government, juſt begining to riſe. That a wound inflicted upon either, at ſo early a ſtage, under all the circumſtances of oppoſition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which had exiſted in the community, would have been deeply felt, and might either not have admitted of a cure at all—or not till after a length of time, and a ſeries of miſchiefs—that it could not but be an important ſervice rendered to the country, to ward off ſo great a misfortune, by the temporary uſe of any extraordinary reſource, which might be at hand, till time was given for more effectual proviſion.</p>
            <p>If in the courſe of ſuch reflections, a doubt had occurred, about the ſtrict regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of what was contemplated, as a poſſible reſort, a mind ſufficiently alive to the public intereſt, and ſufficiently firm in the purſuit of it, would have diſmiſſed that doubt, as an obſtacle, ſuggeſted by a puſillanimous caution, to the exerciſe of thoſe higher motives, which ought ever to govern a man, inveſted with a great public truſt. It would have occurred, that there was reaſonable ground to rely, that the neceſſity of the caſe, and the magnitude of the occaſion, would inſure a juſtification, and that if the contrary ſhould happen, there remained ſtill the conſolation of having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed perſonal intereſt and tranquility, no matter to what extent, to an important public intereſt, and of having avoided the humiliation, which would have been juſtly due to an oppoſite, and to a feeble conduct.</p>
            <p>The diſpoſition which was reſolved upon with regard to the firſt loan, involved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily a deciſion of the point, that the loans might be placed on the joint founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both acts. That loan having been undertaken, as already mentioned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out previous authority, and conſequently without a particular eye to either act, it was probable, that it would be found too late to make an apportionment of one part of the ſum borrowed to one act, of another part to the other act. In that caſe, the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive application of the fund to the different objects was to be relinquiſhed or the poſſibility was to be admitted, of the loan being left to ſtand upon the authority of both acts. The ſame diſpoſition of the firſt loan, will alſo illuſtrate the convenience and expediency of the plan which was finally adopted, that is, of placing the loans on the baſis of both acts.</p>
            <p>The idea of a concurrent execution of both the objects to which the loans were deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined, could not conveniently have been purſued, upon the plan of a ſeparation of the loans; which to be effectual, would include the ſtrict application of the proceeds of each to the purpoſes of the particular act, upon which it was founded.</p>
            <p>Amſterdam was naturally looked to, as the great ſcene of the intended loans. There, as every where elſe, there is but a certain quantity of money floating in the market from time to time, beyond the neceſſary demands of trade and induſtry, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for employment in loans. This quantity of courſe varies at different periods, from a variety of cauſes. Of the quantity at any time afloat, but a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be commanded by any one borrowing power; owing to the competition of other borrowers, who have each their connections through their bankers, with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſets of undertakers and money lenders. Nor it is always that conſiderable loans can be had at any rate. There are certain ſeaſons only, when they are practicable.</p>
            <p>To have brought two loans upon the market at one time, as an opportunity of borrowing offered, which muſt have been the caſe in order to make concurrent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for both the objects in queſtion, if the principle of a ſeparation of the loans had been adopted, would have been to exhibit to the money lenders a very unuſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. With men known to be much influenced by precedent and habit, ſuch an appearance could not have failed to prove a ſource of ſpeculation and conjecture; and might have led to a confuſed idea that the wants of the United States were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive; a ſuppoſition, by no means calculated to promote their credit. It would moreover have been a departure from that ſimplicity of procedure, which where num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are concerned is always of moment to a right conception of the buſineſs to be accompliſhed, and ought not to be abandoned, but for reaſons of real utility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

To have inſtituted the loans ſucceſſively, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounding each, upon one or the other of the acts, would have had a tendency to occaſion longer intervals between the payments to France, than was deſireable. The intervention of a loan for the purpoſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes, would have created of courſe a very conſiderable chaſm. It may be objected that ſuch chaſms did happen on the plan which was purſued. This is true in two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but the moſt material of the two proceeded from caſualties foreign to the plan itſelf; which are detailed in the correſpondence more than once alluded to.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible too that a ſeparation of the loans might have rendered it leſs eaſy to take advantage of a ſtate of the market, favourable to their extenſion at a particular juncture. The loan to be brought on the market might relate to the purchaſe of the debt. The moment might be favourable to a more conſiderable loan, than was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits preſcribed for that object, and the opportunity might ſlip before a ſecond could be inſtituted. In this buſineſs moments are often of importance, and are to be embraced with promptitude and dexterity.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that in different ways the negociotion of the loans might have been embarraſſad by their ſeparation.</p>
            <p>But the moſt obvious, if not the moſt ſerious of the inconveniencies which would have attended it, reſpects the application of the ſums borrowed. This could not then have been moulded, as the intereſt or policy of the government might dictate. A loan for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the debt might have been made under proſpects, promiſing a ready and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial inveſtment of it; but before the inveſtment was made, a change of the market might render it ineligible—involving the alternative, either of a diſadvantageous inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of leaving perhaps a large ſum of money a long time unemployed. Such a ſtate of things might have produced to the banks an advantage, and to the government a loſs, of magnitude, ſufficient to give colour to a ſurmiſe, that the public intereſt had been ſacrificed to the profit of thoſe inſtitutions. The contrary courſe has eſſentially avoided that evil; which in this and in other inſtances, would have been incident in a far greater degree, to the modes of proceeding, contraſted with thoſe that have been purſued, than has in reality attended them.</p>
            <p>Or political conſiderations might have rendered it adviſeable to transfer the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the fund from one object to the other.</p>
            <p>Of this the caſe of St. Domingo preſents an example. It might have happened on the plan of ſeparate loans, that there was no fund in hand but for the purchaſe of the debt. Then on the principle of that plan, there would have been no fund in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the executive, applicable to the other object, which would have embarraſſed the performance of a duty towards a friendly power, and in a way which included the poſitive advantage to the country of paying directly a part of its foreign debt, in its own productions.</p>
            <p>Such were the embarraſſments avoided, and ſuch the conveniences ſecured, by the plan of making the loans indiſcriminately, upon the authority of both acts.</p>
            <p>In the oppoſite plan, I can diſcern no counterbalancing advantage not convenience.</p>
            <p>Conſequently, if both are equally legal, there can be no doubt which of them ought to have been preferred.</p>
            <p>If there be any want of legality in the plan which has been purſued, I was not at the time, and am not yet ſenſible of it.</p>
            <p>I know of no rule which renders it illegal in an agent, having from the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal two authorities to borrow money, whether for one or different purpoſes, to unite the loans he may make, upon the foundation of both authorities: Provided the terms of them be conſonant with both or either of his commiſſions. If the purpoſes are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, it will be incumbent upon him, to take care that the application of the monies borrowed makes the proper ſeparation; and doing this he will have fulfilled his truſt. To teſt this poſition it ſeems only neceſſary to aſk, whether the principal in ſuch caſe would not be fully bound to the lenders?</p>
            <p>In reflecting originally upon the regularity of the proceeding meditated, there was but one ſource of heſitation; the difference in the funds upon which the loans were to reſt. But the following reaſoning ſatisfied the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ruple: The pledging of particular funds is for the ſecurity of the lenders. If they are willing to wave the ſpecial ſecurity, by lending on the general credit of the government, or to diſpenſe with the preference of one fund to another, where two are pledged, by lending indiſcriminately on the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of both, the one or the other circumſtance muſt be alike indifferent to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

purpoſes, and if any thing remains unexecuted, it will be in enlargement, not in abridgement of the public rights. It is however preſumed, that the practical conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the preſent caſe will be, that the two funds pledged will conſtitute an aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, for the joint ſecurity of the monies borrowed upon both acts.</p>
            <p>The ſecond general circumſtance reſpecting the foreign loans, negotiated under the acts of the 4th and 12th of Auguſt, which requires attention, relates to the terms on which they have been obtained. Theſe, it appears have been repreſented, as neither honorable nor advantageous.</p>
            <p>The following facts, witneſſed by the correſpondence before the Senate, more than once referred to, and well known to all who have had opportunities of information, demonſtrate, that the terms of thoſe loans, have been both honorable and advantageous.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is not one of them, which originated under the acts, that was not effected upon conditions equally favorable with thoſe attending the loans of the cotemporary borrowing powers of the moſt tried reſources and beſt eſtabliſhed credit, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable than were obtainable by ſome powers of great reſpectability.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The United States took a lead in the market, in regard to the ſubſequent reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of intereſt; having had either earlier or more complete ſucceſs than any other borrowing power.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From a rate of five per cent. intereſt, and four and a half per cent. charges, which marked the level of the market when they begun their loans, they in the courſe of a ſingle year, brought down the terms to four per cent. intereſt, and five per cent. charges; that is from an intereſt on the nett ſum received (including an indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for charges) of 5.5012, ſomething more than five and a half per cent. to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt on the like ſum of 4.4951, ſomething leſs than 4½ per cent.</p>
            <p>When this ſtate of things is applied to a government, only in the third year of its exiſtence, and to a country which had ſo recently emerged from a total derangement of its finances, it would ſeem impoſſible to deny that the iſſue is not only honorable, but flattering; unleſs indeed it can be denied, that a ſound and vigorous ſtate of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is honorable to a nation.</p>
            <p>I forbear a compariſon between the loans of the preſent, and of the former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this country, becauſe an immenſe diſparity of circumſtances would render it an improper one—further than to take notice of a very great error which has been upon ſome occaſions advanced. It has been alledged, to diſparage the management, under the preſent, that the loans of the former government, in a ſituation comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very diſadvantageous, have been effected upon equal terms; and in proof of this an appeal has been made to the loan of 2,000,000 of guilders at four per cent. which is that of the 9th March, 1784.</p>
            <p>Nothing can manifeſt more clearly than this, the very precipitate and ſuperficial views, with which ſuggeſtions on important public ſubjects, are ſometimes made. The laſt four per cent. loan obtained under the exiſting laws, including charges, is a real four and a half per cent. loan, or more exactly a 4.4951 per cent. loan. The four per cent. loan of March 1784, is a real 6.6468 per cent. loan. The difference which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds 2 per cent. ariſes principally from extra premiums and gratifications which were allowed upon this loan, and which are unknown to the other.</p>
            <p>Much praiſe is no doubt due to the exertions which effected the loans under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer government. A ſuperiority of merit, ſhall readily be conceded to them, from the circumſtances under which they were made, and their ſignal utility in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. But it is not neceſſary to their eulogium to affirm, that they were made upon equal terms with thoſe lately obtained, or to deny the goodneſs of the terms of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Truth will not juſtify the one or the other.</p>
            <p>The facts which have been ſtated prove, that the terms of the loans are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous as well as honorable. They are comparatively advantageous, becauſe they are as moderate as other powers in the beſt credit have allowed; and they are abſolutely advantageous, becauſe the higheſt <hi>real</hi> not <hi>nominal</hi> rate of intereſt, which has been given does not exceed 5.5012, a fraction more than 5½ per cent. while the loweſt <hi>real</hi> rate is 4.4951, a fraction leſs than 4½ per cent.</p>
            <p>If the queſtion whether advantageous or not be teſted by the purpoſes for which the loans have been made, the concluſion is equally in their favour—The payments on account of the foreign debt were an indiſpenſable obligation. Unleſs it can be ſhewn that they might have been derived from another and more advantageous ſource, it will follow that it was the intereſt of the government to avail itſelf of the reſource which has been employed, becauſe it was its duty to diſcharge its obligations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026347_0008_0FCFB65749EACD98"/>
It is ſometimes urged, that foreign loans for whatever purpoſe are pernicious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſerve to drain the country of its ſpecie for the payment of intereſt, and for the final reimburſement of principal—that it would be preferable for that reaſon to procure loans at home, even at a higher rate of intereſt.</p>
            <p>To this, ſeveral anſwers may be given, ſome of a ſpecial, others of a general nature.</p>
            <p>In reference to the reimburſement of the foreign debt, it may be obſerved, that as a debt had already been incurred abroad, upon which intereſt was payable, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of new loans there for the reimburſement of that debt, would leave us, as to the demand for the exportation of our ſpecie, juſt where we originally ſtood.</p>
            <p>Moreover if the money could have been borrowed at home, for that reimburſement, the remittance of it would have been ruinous to the country. The mere neceſſity of remitting could not alone have increaſed the foreign demand for our commodities; ſo as to deduce from an extra exportation of them, the requiſite means of payment; and if our ſpecie was to perform the office, the country would ſpeedily have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted to a degree inconſiſtent with the ſupport of its commerce and induſtry. The quantity of coin in the United States has never been conſiderable enough for ſuch an operation.</p>
            <p>But this very ſtate of things would have rendered the procuring of the money from domeſtic reſources impracticable. Theſe it may be ſafely affirmed are too limited for extenſive loans, of any conſiderable degree of permanency.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place—The expedient of domeſtic loans, would not prevent the evil, which is deſired to be prevented. Foreigners would either in the firſt inſtance, bring their monies to ſubſcribe them to the loans, or, they would afterwards, purchaſe the ſtock ariſing from them; and in either caſe they would equally draw away the money of the country on account of their intereſt and principal. The only conſequence of giving a diſproportionate rate of intereſt for domeſtic loans would be, that our ſpecie would be carried away ſo much the faſter.</p>
            <p>Experience having ſhewn, that nations ſometimes pay more regard to their external than to their internal credit, this conſideration co-operates with reaſons of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to induce monied men abroad, to be content with a lower rate of intereſt, ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to be paid in their own country, than if the place of payment be in another country; making even a greater difference, than is an equivalent for the expence and riſk of obtaining remittances.</p>
            <p>The clear inference from theſe obſervations, is that with regard to the reimburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the foreign debt, no other expedient than that of foreign loans was practicable or eligible.</p>
            <p>The utility of that part of the loans, which has reference to the purchaſe of the debt; has already been explained in certain views. So far as their agency has been hitherto concerned in that operation, it is a ſufficient demonſtration of the advantage of the meaſure to ſtate, that the ſum inveſted in purchaſes up to the period of the laſt report to Congreſs has redeemed what is equal to an annuity of 6.15 per cent. inclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>g alſo the advantage of ſinking a capital more than 50 per cent. greater than the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>um expended.</p>
            <p>A valuable profit will ariſe from the inveſtment of the ſums on hand, either in a payment to the bank or in the purchaſe of ſtock. The liberation of an annuity of ſix per cent. can be ſecured—while upon a great part of the fund which is to effect it no more than 4½ per cent. is payable, and leſs than 5½ upon the other part. The mean of theſe rates being 5 per cent. an annual ſaving of one per cent. may be effected, which upon 2,000,000 of dollars, intereſt at 5 per cent. is equal to a capital or groſs ſum of 400,000 dollars; an item certainly of no inconſiderable conſequence.</p>
            <p>Againſt the advantages, which are claimed in favour of the loans, it is natural to place the loſs of intereſt incident to the delays, which have attended their application to the purpoſes, for which they were obtained. This leads to an examination of the caſes of delay, their cauſes, the circumſtances if any, which counterbalance them.</p>
            <p>There are three inſtances of material delay—one reſpecting the firſt loan, another the ſecond loan, and a third, a part of the two laſt loans.</p>
            <p>The firſt loan, it will be ſeen, was not applied till a conſiderable time after its commencement. It has been already intimated that it was undertaken without previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous authority from this country. The motives to the meaſure are detailed in a letter from our bankers of the 25th of January, 1790, a copy of which accompanies the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026347_0009_0FCFB658F7683828"/>
communications herewith made by order of the Preſident. A regard to thoſe motives led to an acceptance of the loan. Nor could it have been deemed an unfortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that ſuch an auxiliary to the operations of the treaſury had been previouſly prepared.</p>
            <p>The laws authorizing the loans, paſſed the 4th and 12th of Auguſt. As early as the 28th of that month, the acceptance above-mentioned was communicated, and the application of 1,500,000 florins, in a payment to France directed. So far no time was loſt, more than could not have been avoided.</p>
            <p>But the bills for the ſum to be brought here were not drawn till ſome months after. This proceeded from an unwillingneſs to riſk the public credit, by drawing before there was a certainty of funds to anſwer the drafts. It was not impoſſible, that the great delay which had attended the paſſing of the law for borrowing, might have led the bankers to come to ſome arrangement with the money lenders, for ſurrendering the monies paid in, and terminating the loan. Independent of this ſource of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, they had expreſſed themſelves, in their letter communicating the ſtep they had taken, to this effect. "To ſpare the United States all poſſible advance of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, while the money ſhall remain unappropriated, we ſhall iſſue the recipiſſes at the option of the buyers to take them <hi>ſo late as they pleaſe,</hi> on the expectation the three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions would be placed in a few months." This, though it announced an expectation that the monies would be paid in, in a few months, did not render the event certain. And as the bankers appeared from that precaution, to have adverted to the idea of ſaving the United States an advance of intereſt, it was ſuppoſeable that they might have found means ſtill further to procraſtinate the payments, or a conſiderable part of them, till they had received a confirmation of the loan. This policy would have been the more natural, as they riſked the loſs of intereſt themſelves, if the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not have been finally ratified.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch circumſtances I thought it moſt prudent to defer the drafts, 'till advice was received of the actual progreſs of the loans. There was no room to heſitate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the loſs of a ſmall ſum in intereſt, and the danger of committing the public credit by a premature operation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond caſe of delay relates to the ſecond loan. It was occaſioned by a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to ſuſpend the orders for its application, till information was received, of its having been contracted for.</p>
            <p>One motive to this determination has been already intimated; namely, the yet untried and immature ſtate of our fiſcal arrangements. The general reaſoning on this head, was ſtrengthened by an occurrence altogether unlooked for, which diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed itſelf on the 23d of August 1790, eleven days after the riſing of Congreſs; an occurrence which they had not contemplated in their pecuniary diſpoſitions. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the commencement of an Indian war; which was announced in a letter from governor St. Clair, dated on the above-mentioned day; the progreſſive extent and conſequences of which could of courſe not be foreſeen. Under ſuch circumſtances, I judged it for the public intereſt and ſafety to hold the reſource, which the proſpect of a loan preſented, under the power of the treaſury, till advice ſhould be received of the actual inſtitution of the loan; with intention then to diſpoſe of it as ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear adviſeable, under a better matured view of our pecuniary ſituation and proſpects.</p>
            <p>Hence the delay which attended the application of the ſecond loan; the firſt in fact that originated ſubſequent to the laws for borrowing. But after advice had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of its having been ſet on foot, no time was loſt in converting it with due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch to its proper uſes. There was only, not an anticipation of its application. As early as May 24th, 1791. I wrote a letter to Mr. Short (a copy of which is in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the houſe) empowering him to apply the proceeds of all future loans, as they ſhould accrue, in payments to France; except as to ſuch ſums as therein were, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhould be <hi>previouſly</hi> and <hi>ſpecially</hi> reſerved. This arrangement was calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to obviate the inconvenience of leaving the proceeds of the loans, for any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time unemployed. At the period of making it, and not ſooner, the public proſpects appeared to me ſufficiently unfolded, to render a general and permanent diſpoſition free from hazard. This inſtruction preceded in due ſeaſon all the loans ſubſequent to that of March 1791.</p>
            <p>Whatever delay, therefore may have attended ſucceeding inveſtments for paying the French debt, is not attributable to this department: And I think it will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026347_0010_0FCFB65A552AD2C0"/>
that any has been incurred, in reſpect to the ſums which were deſtined for the public ſervice here. In judging of this point it will be proper to obſerve, that a latitude of ſix months, for making their payments, has been reſerved to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lenders, though with liberty to make them earlier. It was however neceſſary for the treaſury to regulate it's bills according to the poſſible delay, leſt they ſhould not meet adequate funds. The general policy adopted was to let them fall upon the rear of each loan; this giving a freer courſe for early payments to France, and beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliating a certainty of funds for anſwering the bills, with as little double intereſt as poſſible.</p>
            <p>It will appear, that notwithſtanding the arrangement which was made, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time intervened between the two laſt payments to France, while there were funds in hand waiting for employment. It may be expected, that the cauſes of this procraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination, though as I have ſaid not imputable to this department, ſhould be unfolded to the Houſe. Particular circumſtances however induce me to confine myſelf to ſtating generally, that the delay proceeded, in the firſt place, from an expectation given to Mr. Short and kept up from time to time by the French miniſter of marine, that a plan would be adopted, to which a decree of the National Aſſembly was requiſite, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting a large ſum into ſupplies for St. Domingo—which Mr. Short concluded juſtly muſt come out of the foreign fund, and conſequently ſuſpended its application in Europe—In the ſecond place, from a deſire to ſettle, previouſly to further payments, a definitive rule, by which the monies paid, ſhould be liquidated and credited to the United States.</p>
            <p>Both the one and the other appears to have been procraſtinated from period to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, by the diſordered ſtate of French affairs, and to have finally iſſued contrary to expectation. It would be an unneceſſary commitment of my opinion to declare, how far the delay appears to me to have been juſtified by the cauſes—But being led by the occaſion to take notice of it, I think it improper to ſend it abroad, liable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to miſconſtruction, without obſerving, that the inducements appear to me, to have been weighty—that the delays naturally grew out of the circumſtances, and that I am entirely perſuaded of the goodneſs of the motives which governed. The correſpondence before the Senate, contains the particulars of the tranſaction.</p>
            <p>Having pointed out the inſtances of material delay which happened, and the cauſes of them, it remains to ſtate what circumſtances there are to counterbalance the loſs on that account.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances are of two kinds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gain by exchange in the ſale of the bills drawn by the treaſury and upon the higher rate of intereſt on the credits which were given for thoſe bills, than was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on the fund upon which they were drawn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gain by exchange on the payments to France.</p>
            <p>According to my calculation, founded on the beſt information extant, the real par of the metals between the United States and Amſterdam, makes a current guilder equal to 35 89/100 ninetieths of a dollar. The loweſt rate which has been obtained for the bills has been 36 4/1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ninetieths, with an allowance of ſixty days credit without intereſt. Making a deduction for the intereſt the bills were ſtill ſold above the true par. In ſome inſtances they have been ſold as high as 40 cents and 7 mills per guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with intereſt for the whole term of the credit given.</p>
            <p>The rate of intereſt for the credits allowed upon the bills was 6 per cent. the mean intereſt paid upon the fund 5 per cent. producing conſequently a gain of one per cent.</p>
            <p>With regard to the payments to France, if the current rate of exchange between Paris and Amſterdam at the moment of each remittance or payment were to govern, a large profit would reſult to the United States. But certain equitable conſiderations will produce deductions, which will greatly leſſen this advantage; yet making a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral allowance for them, there is ground to calculate that a ſaving may be made in this particular, more than ſufficient to indemnify for the loſs of intereſt.</p>
            <p>Hence any poſitive advantage which will have been otherwiſe gained, will probably be undiminiſhed by that circumſtance.</p>
            <p>I proceed in the next place, to ſtate the views which prevailed reſpecting the ſums that have been from time to time drawn for; the purpoſes they have hitherto anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the further advantages to be expected from the meaſure.</p>
            <p>The direct object of all the ſums drawn for prior to July 1792, was the purchaſe of the debt. A collateral conſideration which operated in the firſt ſtages of drawing, has alſo been mentioned. It has likewiſe been ſtated, that the early purchaſes of the debt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026347_0011_0FCFB65C1BE53C40"/>
are to be aſcribed to the inſtrumentality of the fund derived from the loans. This idea ſhall now be explained.</p>
            <p>Two miſtakes appear to have influenced the impreſſions which have been entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in relation, directly or indirectly to this ſubject. Firſt, it ſeems to have been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long forgotten, that a conſiderable part of the duties is always outſtanding, on account of the credits which are given; whence the aſſertion, that the ſinking fund has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually overflowed from domeſtic reſources. Second, it ſeems to have been taken for granted that the proceeds of the loans have remained apart, diſtinct from the maſs of the money in the treaſury; while in truth the courſe of the buſineſs has been to turn them over to the Treaſurer by warrants as they have been received, ſo as to form a part of the aggregate, from time to time appearing in his hands and in his accounts. The banks have been the agents employed for ſelling the bills. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times warrants on account have iſſued upon them, for the ſums accruing from the ſales, at other times the warrants have been deferred till the whole proceeds of any parcel have been received and the accounts of the banks ſettled at the treaſury; as the ſtate of the treaſury has happened to render the one or the other moſt convenient.</p>
            <p>The banks of North America and New-York, were the agents for the ſale of all the bills, which were ſold prior to April 1792, amounting to 1,006,526 dollars and 36 cents. Of this ſum 361,391 dollars and 34 cents, were paſſed over to the Treaſurer in 1791—327,136 dollars and 22 cents in March 1792, and 140,000 dollars in June following—the reſidue having remained as heretofore ſtated, in depoſit with the bank of North America upon a ſpecial conſideration. This is excluſive of certain bills furniſhed for the uſe of the department of State, amounting to 78,766 dollars and 67 cents.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the bills which have been ſold beginning in April 1792, were ſold by the bank of the United States, and its branches at New-York and Baltimore. The accounts of the ſales had juſt been made out for ſettlement, when the preſent enquiry began, but warrants had not yet iſſued for placing the proceeds in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. It will be remarked that from the terms of credit allowed, they only began to be receivable in October laſt; the 26th day of which month the firſt return made by the bank, ſhews a ſum of 127,225 dollars and 53 cents received; and that the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection had not been completed when the accounts of ſales were rendered.</p>
            <p>There are different views of the ſubject which will enable the Houſe to perceive that the poſſeſſion of the fund in queſtion was neceſſary to enable the treaſury to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the means of making all the purchaſes which were made prior to July, 1792.</p>
            <p>It is true, that there was a ſurplus of revenue to the end of the year 1790, equal to 1,374,656 dollars and 40 cents, which was appropriated to purchaſes of the debt; and from the credits then given upon the duties, this ſurplus would naturally come into the treaſury in the courſe of the year 1791.</p>
            <p>But the legiſlature foreſeeing that the revenue of 1791, from the ſame cauſe, could not actually be in the treaſury, within that year, to face the appropriations upon it, (which it is to be obſerved were nearly commenſurate with the fund) inſerted a clauſe in the law, appropriating the ſurplus of 1790, to the purchaſe of the debt, which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized a reſervation of ſo much of that ſurplus as might be neceſſary to make the payments of intereſt during 1791; in caſe of a deficiency in the receipts into the treaſury, on account of the current revenue of the year.</p>
            <p>It will appear to the Houſe, upon a recurrence to the Treaſurer's quarterly account, ending the 30th of September, 1791, that the balance of caſh then on hand was 662,233 dollars and 99 cents.</p>
            <p>At that time there had been paid into the treaſury, upon warrants, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of the bills drawn upon the foreign fund 361,391 dollars and 34 cents. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the balance of caſh, had it not been for that auxiliary, would have been only 300,842 dollars and 65 cents; conſidering the whole balance in the treaſury as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting an equal ſum of the proceeds of the bills.</p>
            <p>Even in a time of complete peace, in a country where a ſmall extent of monied capital forbids a reliance upon large pecuniary aids to be ſuddenly obtained—a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent adminiſtrator of the finances could not feel entirely at eaſe, with a leſs ſum at all times in the certain command of the treaſury, than 500,000 dollars, for meeting current demands and extra exigencies, which in the affairs of a nation are every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be expected. But with a war actually on hand, and a poſſibility of its exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a more ſerious length, he would be inexcuſable, in leaving himſelf with a leſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026347_0012_0FCFB65E335D23B0"/>
ſum at command; unleſs from an impracticability of doing otherwiſe. It would be always his duty to combine two conſiderations—the chance of extra calls for money, and a poſſibility of ſome failure in the receipts which were expected. Derangements of various kinds may happen in the commercial circle, capable of interrupting for a time the punctual courſe of payments to the treaſury. It is neceſſary to a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be prepared for ſuch caſualties.</p>
            <p>But during the year 1791, there was a circumſtance, which operated as an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reaſon for keeping a reſpectable ſum always on hand. The loans of the domeſtic debt were going on till the laſt of September of that year; while at the ſame time, the intereſt was in a courſe of payment—It was therefore always uncertain what ſum would be payable at the end of a quarter; this depending on the eagerneſs or backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the public creditors in bringing forward their ſubſcriptions, or their claims as non-ſubſcribers. The omiſſions, at the end of a preceding quarter, might be expected to fall upon a ſubſequent one—and it was neceſſary to be prepared for that poſſibility; of courſe to keep in hand a large fund for contingent demands. This neceſſity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the termination of the period for receiving ſubſcriptions; becauſe the treaſury was to be prepared on the ſuppoſition, that the whole of the domeſtic debt would then be in a ſtate to receive intereſt either as <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> or <hi>unſubſcribed.</hi> But this did not in fact happen—A part of the ſums which were preſented were crouded into the laſt days of the quarter and were too late for a dividend. A conſiderable ſum remained ultimately in a form, which according to the terms of the proviſion did not intitle it to intereſt, either as <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> or as <hi>unſubſcribed</hi> debt.</p>
            <p>Hence the caſh in the treaſury on the 1ſt of October 1791, was by a conſiderable ſum greater than was to have been counted upon or than might have happened.</p>
            <p>The concluſion which reſults from the foregoing obſervations is this—that the purchaſes which preceded the 1ſt of October 1791, and which amounted to 699,984 dollars and 23 cents in ſpecie could not have been hazarded, but for the aid of the ſums which had actually accrued from the proceeds of the bills and the expectation of thoſe which were to accrue from the yet uncollected proceeds of others.</p>
            <p>Had it not been for this aid, the treaſury would have been left more bare, than was conſiſtent with the ſecurity of public credit and the certain execution of the public ſervice.</p>
            <p>There is however a later period in the ſtate of the treaſury, which will more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely illuſtrate the idea intended to be eſtabliſhed. This is the 2d of July, 1792.</p>
            <p>On that day, the balance of caſh in the treaſury, comprehending the depoſits in all the banks, and including a ſum of 200,000 dollars, received on loan of the bank of the United States, together with a ſum of 220,900 dollars in bills drawn upon domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic funds, the proceeds of which had not been received, was 623,133 dollars and 61 cents.</p>
            <p>Prior to this period a further ſum of 545,902 dollars and 89 cents ariſing from the ſales of foreign bills had been placed in the treaſury, by warrants, making with the former ſums placed there from the ſame ſource, 907,294 dollars and 23 cents.</p>
            <p>Had it not been for this auxiliary, and that of the loan from the bank, the treaſury would then have been in arrear 484,160 dollars and 62 cents. It therefore neceſſarily follows, that for the purchaſes to that period, which amounted in ſpecie to 942,672 dollars and 54 cents, at leaſt 484,160 dollars and 62 cents muſt have come from the foreign fund.</p>
            <p>But when it is conſidered, for the reaſons which have been ſtated, and which will hereafter be fortified by others, tending as I conceive, to give them concluſive force, that the ſum in the treaſury at the period in queſtion was barely what ought to have been there for ſafety, and for a due ſupply to current demands—it will follow that the whole or nearly the whole of the purchaſes which were made previous to July 1792, were made by the means or inſtrumentality of the foreign fund.</p>
            <p>A ſimilar view, extended to the ſubſequent quarter, will exhibit this point in a ſtill clearer light. The balance then in the treaſury, including a further loan from the bank of 100,000 dollars, was only 420,914 dollars and 51 cents.</p>
            <p>What then it may be aſked became of the ſurplus of revenue to the end of 1790? what was the office performed by that fund during the period in queſtion?</p>
            <p>The anſwer is, that it ſerved exactly the purpoſe which was anticipated by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. It came in aid of the current receipt for ſatisfying the current expenditure
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026347_0013_0FCFB65FEF4E1F68"/>
of 1791, with particular reference to the intereſt of the debt. This will eaſily be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended when it is recollected that the appropriations made during 1791, upon the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of that year, and ſome ſmall ſurpluſſes of antecedent appropriations, amounted to three million ſix hundred and thirty-ſeven thouſand and fifty-eight dollars and thirty-four cents; that the revenues themſelves amounted to no more than three million five hundred and fifty-three thouſand, one hundred and ninety-five dollars and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen cents; and that at the end of 1791, there were outſtanding in bonds for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on imports, beſides the chief part of the proceeds of the duties on ſpirits diſtilled within the United States, then alſo uncollected, 1,828,269 dollars and 28 cents.</p>
            <p>On this point likewiſe, of the ſurplus of revenue to the end of 1790, it is preſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a miſapprehenſion has been entertained. It ſeems to have been ſuppoſed, that that ſurplus, as well as the proceeds of the foreign fund, have been kept ſeparate and diſtinct from the common maſs of the monies appearing from time to time to be in the treaſury. It has been already obſerved, that this was not the caſe with regard to the foreign fund. It is now proper to add, that it has not been the caſe, either, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſurplus in queſtion. That ſurplus, as received by the collectors of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, has regularly paſſed into the treaſury, and appears in the quarterly accounts of the treaſurer for the periods to which they relate.</p>
            <p>It is the courſe of the treaſury, reſulting from the conſtitution of the department, for all monies from whatever ſource, to be brought into it, to conſtitute an aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; ſubject to the diſpoſitions preſcribed by law. The monies to be employed in the ſinking fund, have conſequently only been ſeparated, as they have been called for, <hi>for actual inveſtment.</hi> The only exception to this, relates to that part of the ſinking fund, which is created by the intereſt of the debt purchaſed. This has been included in the quarterly dividends, and covered by the warrants, in favour of the caſhiers of the banks for paying thoſe dividends, after which, they have paſſed into a diſtinct account, in the books of the bank opened with Samuel Meredith, as agent to the commiſſioners of the ſinking fund.</p>
            <p>To the foregoing repreſentation, it may ſeem an objection that the purchaſes to the end of 1791, appear to have been carried to the account of the ſurplus at the end of 1790.</p>
            <p>The ultimate form which it has been judged convenient to give to the tranſaction in the accounts of the treaſury, cannot change what was truly the courſe of facts. The proceeds of the above-mentioned ſurplus and of the foreign loans formed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fund for purchaſes. In the accounts of the treaſury, the thing was ſuſceptible of various modifications at pleaſure. The two parts of the fund might have been united in one account, or divided into diſtinct accounts. Being ſeparated, monies iſſued for purchaſes might have been legally carried to either of them.</p>
            <p>It was judged moſt adviſeable, in the forms of the treaſury, to place the purchaſes to the end of 1791, to the account of the domeſtic fund, becauſe it was calculated to give greater latitude and energy to the ſinking fund. Had not this courſe been purſued, the buſineſs would have taken the following ſhape—the foreign fund to the extent of the purchaſes, would have been exhauſted—the whole, or the greater part of the ſurplus of 1790, would have continued wrapt up in the expenditure of 1791, not liable to be liberated, till the <hi>receipts</hi> into the treaſury ſhould yield a correſpondent ſurplus beyond the <hi>actual diſburſements</hi>—which could not have been the caſe, while the war with the Indians continues to call for extraordinary expenditures.</p>
            <p>From the form into which the thing has been thrown, the foreign fund has been ſet free to be applied to further purchaſes; and a neceſſity produced of anticipating the outſtanding duties, by temporary loans for the current ſervice.</p>
            <p>I truſt there can be no doubt, that the courſe purſued was regular, and within the diſcretion of the department. I hope alſo, that it will appear to the houſe to have been the moſt eligible. The expediency of giving the earlieſt and greateſt poſſible extent and activity to whatever concerns the ſinking fund, will, it is preſumed, unite all opinions.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid hitherto reſpecting the employment of the foreign funds is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable only to that part of it which was drawn for prior to April 1792; the reſidue ſtanding in a different ſituation and requiring a ſeparate examination.</p>
            <p>From the ſtatement which has been given, it may be perceived that the fund in queſtion has neither been idle nor uſeleſs. A confirmation of this will be found in the following details.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:026347_0014_0FCF8F14B04F7268"/>
The whole ſum ſucceſſively received on account of Amſterdam bills up to the 17th of Auguſt 1791, was 361,391 dollars and 34 cents. The amount of the monies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in purchaſes prior to that day was 350,000 dollars, chiefly by anticipation of thoſe receipts.</p>
            <p>The whole ſum ſucceſſively received on account of Amſterdam bills from Auguſt 17, 1791, to March 1, 1792, was 408,722 dollars and 69 cents. The amount of the monies inveſted in purchaſes between thoſe periods, was 349,984 dollars and 23 cents, chiefly in the month of September, and by anticipation of thoſe receipts.</p>
            <p>The whole ſum ſucceſſively received on account of Amſterdam bills, ſubſequent to the 1ſt of March, and prior to July, 1792, was 235,412 dollars and 33 cents. The amount of the monies inveſted in purchaſes between thoſe periods, was 242,688 dollars and 31 cents.</p>
            <p>It was ſtated in my firſt letter, that 177,998 dollars and 80 cents, of the proceeds of the foreign bills were left in depoſit with the bank of North America; and in a note upon ſtatement B accompanying that letter, the occaſion of it was ſhewn to be an advance without intereſt, made by that bank, for the uſe of the department of war; which could not yet be covered in conſequence of a doubt ſtill remaining, whether the fund appropriated for ſatisfying that object, was adequate to it, the ſufficiency of that fund depending in part on certain unexpended reſidues of antecedent appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which it was expected would not be finally neceſſary for ſatisfying the purpoſes of thoſe appropriations.</p>
            <p>It is to be remarked that the delay of the employment of this part of the proceeds of the foreign fund, has been compenſated by a ſaving of intereſt on the ſum advanced by the bank, which otherwiſe muſt have been procured upon a loan with an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of intereſt, probably at the time of the advance, at a rate of 6 per cent. ſo that even in this particular, the fund, though temporarily ſuſpended from its deſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has not been idle or unproductive. I reſerve for another place ſome additional obſervations and ſtatements, which will be calculated to ſhew, that opportunities of inveſting the monies at any time on hand applicable to purchaſes of the debt, were not ſuffered to paſs unimproved, and that as much in this reſpect was done as the ſtate of the treaſury and the ſtate of the market would permit.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that a diſtinct examination would be proper with regard to the bills which have been drawn upon the foreign fund, ſubſequent to March, 1792. I proceed now to this examination.</p>
            <p>The expediency of what has been, in this reſpect, done, ſeems to have been called in queſtion, under a ſuggeſtion that an application of the fund to purchaſes had ceaſed to be advantageous.</p>
            <p>The drawing of theſe bills has been at different periods influenced by various conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. A leading motive was always the purchaſe of the debt. And a correct view of the ſubject will, I doubt not, ſatisfy the Houſe, that the meaſure was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by an adequate proſpect of advantage.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved that all theſe drafts were predicated upon the two four per cent. loans; being as already ſtated real 4½ per cent loans.</p>
            <p>There was good ground to preſume, that opportunities would be found of inveſting the monies drawn for in purchaſes which would yield at leaſt 5 per cent. with a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doing ſtill better. The difference of ½ per cent. was alone an object of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; but it would be coupled with the further benefit of reducing a principal ſum materially exceeding the ſum inveſted. When the three per cents are purchaſed at 12s. in the pound, there is not only a redemption of an annuity of 5 per cent. but a ſinking of a capital of 20s. for 12. And though this might not be material, if the market rate of intereſt ſhould never fall below 5, becauſe in that caſe the three per cents might always be purchaſed at the ſame rate; yet if it ſhould at any time happen, that intereſt fell below five, it would be a gain to the government to have purchaſed at 5, in exact proportion to the difference between 5 and the then market rate. Add to this, that the price of 3 per cents have generally a value in the market more than proportioned to the income they produce, which ariſes from the capacity of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to appreciate even to par. Theſe obſervations are alſo for the moſt part applicable to the deferred, with this circumſtance in addition, that when intereſt begins to be payable on that ſpecies of ſtock, the money inveſted and which in the mean time would have produced five, would then begin to produce to the government 6 per cent. with the advantage of having anticipated the redemption of a ſpecies of ſtock of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026347_0015_0FCFB66437D993B0"/>
right only gradually redeemable. Combining theſe conſiderations, it appears to be clearly and even eminently for the intereſt of the government to purchaſe within the limit ſuggeſted, with a fund which does not coſt more than 4½ per cent.</p>
            <p>That this was the view of the ſubject which governed, is deducible not only from the circumſtances of the fact, but from my letter of the 2d of April, 1792, to Mr. Short, announcing my intention to draw, in which I aſſign as the ground of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, "that I conſidered it for the intereſt of the United States to proſecute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes of the public debt with monies borrowed on the terms of the laſt loan," mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loan of the 1ſt of January 1792, at 4 per cent.</p>
            <p>If the event be taken as a criterion, the anticipation will be more than juſtified, the preſent juncture offering an opportunity for purchaſes peculiarly advantageous.</p>
            <p>But without inſiſting on a ſtate of things occaſioned by extraordinary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was morally certain, that the common courſe of events would render the operation a beneficial one. And it would not argue peculiar foreſight, if a calculation was even made on the effect, which the ſituation and probable progreſs of affairs in Europe might produce upon our market. A pretty general war there, by extending the demand for money would naturally divert from our ſtocks a portion of what might otherwiſe be employed upon them and affect injuriouſly their prices. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a familiar fact, that during the winter in this country, there is always a ſcarcity of money in the towns; a circumſtance calculated to damp the prices of ſtock.</p>
            <p>A conſideration, which collaterally influenced the drawing of the latter bills was the ſituation of the French colony of St. Domingo.</p>
            <p>This not only produced an early application for a conſiderable advance, which was promiſed; but it was to be foreſeen, that ſtill further aids would be indiſpenſable.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſundry letters from Mr. Short, the firſt dated at Paris, the 28th December 1791, announced the daily probability of an arrangement, requiring an advance here of 800,000 dollars for the uſe of that colony. A ſum of 4,000,000 of livres has in fact been ſucceſſively ſtipulated for that object, the greateſt part of which has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually furniſhed.</p>
            <p>It is known, that theſe ſupplies could proceed from no other ſource than the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign fund.</p>
            <p>The payment to the foreign officers of near 200,000 dollars, by which an intereſt of 6 per cent. would be releaſed, was another object for which proviſion was to be made out of the ſame fund.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral purpoſes conſpired with the object of purchaſing the debt to induce the latitude of drawing, which took place.</p>
            <p>But there was ſtill a further inducement which came in aid of the others. The time for reimburſing the firſt inſtalment of the two millions of dollars due to the bank was approaching, when by poſitive ſtipulation, the government would have to pay two hundred thouſand dollars, for which there was no domeſtic fund, that could be ſpared from the current exigencies. I thought it incumbent upon this department to have an eye to placing within the reach of the legiſlature the means of fulfilling this engagement; the object of which bore a ſtrict analogy to that for which the two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions authorized by the act making proviſion for the reduction of the public debt were to be borrowed.</p>
            <p>I did not even ſcruple to take into the calculation, that if from the extent of the draughts upon the foreign fund, there ſhould happen to be found on hand a larger ſum than was neceſſary for, or could be advantageouſly employed towards, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral purpoſes which were the immediate and direct objects of the operation, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus would facilitate to the government a meaſure manifeſtly and unequivocally bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial—an additional payment to the bank, on account of a debt, upon which an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual intereſt of 6 per cent. was payable; a meaſure by which a certain ſaving of one per cent. to the extent of the payment that might be made would be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>The poſſibility of this application of the fund afforded a perfect aſſurance, that the public intereſt could in no event fail to be promoted.</p>
            <p>I felt myſelf the more at liberty to do it, becauſe it did not interfere with a complete fulfilment of the public engagements in regard to the foreign debt. It could be done conſiſtently with a full reimburſement of all arrears and inſtalments which had accrued on account of that debt.</p>

               </gap> motives that have regulated the conduct of this department; in relation to thoſe parts of the proceeds of the foreign loans which have been transferred to the United States, except as to the laſt ſum of one million two hundred and thirty ſeven thouſand five hundred florins, directed to be drawn for on the 30th of November laſt; in regard to which, circumſtances of a ſpecial nature co-operated, as is explained in a note up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the copy of my letter of the 26th of that month, to Mr. Short, forming a part of the communication herewith made by order of the Preſident of the United States.</p>
            <p>The Houſe will perceive, that the variety of matter comprized in this letter has not been collected and digeſted into its preſent form, without much labour and an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable expence of time. I truſt they will be ſenſible, that no delay has been unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily incurred. It is certain that I have made every exertion in my power, at the hazard of my health, to comply with the requiſitions of the Houſe as early as poſſible. And it has even been done with more expedition than was deſireable to ſecure the perfect accuracy of the communication.</p>
            <p>Yet I have ſtill to regret that ſome part of the ſubject muſt remain to be preſented in a ſubſequent letter. To leſſen however the inconvenience of this further delay, I ſhall tranſmit with the preſent letter, the ſtatements required by the firſt and ſecond of the reſolutions of the 23d of January, which will be found in the ſchedules here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with marked No. I to V; thoſe required by the laſt of the reſolutions having been already forwarded.</p>
            <p>There remain, however, ſome particulars to complete the information contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated by thoſe reſolutions, that muſt be reſerved for another communication. This I may venture to aſſure the Houſe will not be deferred beyond the preſent, or at leaſt the firſt day of the enſuing week.</p>
