            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CAUTIONARY HINTS.</head>
            <p>BY the treaty of peace, and the ceſſions of the ſeveral ſtates in the union, the United States poſſeſs an extent of territory out of the juriſdiction of any ſtate, and hitherto unſettled, equal to, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more than, the territory of all the ſtates in the union together. The conſtitution of the United States provides, that Congreſs ſhall have power to diſpoſe of, and make all needful rules and regulations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting that territory: and it appears from a late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a committee in Congreſs, that it is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, as ſoon as a peace is concluded with the Indians, to make ſale of thoſe lands, or a part of them, for the purpoſe of diſcharging the national debt.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt, that the ceſſions of the ſeveral ſtates were made with a view to this great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor that the leſſening and final diſcharge of the national debt is of the firſt importance to our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal happineſs. It may, however, be well worthy of conſideration, whether it ought to be effected, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this mode, at once, or by degrees, ſince it is poſſible, that a precipitate endeavour to remove the burthen from our ſhoulders, may entail a heavier grievance upon the nation.</p>
            <p>It appears from ſome late documents, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the United States is at preſent ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to leave a ſurplus of 600,000 dollar for the laſt year, even after defraying the burthens of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028459_0003_0FD90C2D0447FE38"/>
Indian war, the building of frigates, and other arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed veſſels, &amp;c. and the expence attending the late call of the militia to ſuppreſs the inſurrection in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania; the eſtimates for the Indian war, frigates and fortifications, amounted the laſt year to the ſum of 4,917,227 dollars.—The expence of the call of militia I have ſeen no eſtimate of, but I preſume it can fall very little, if at all, ſhort of a million of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.—From the fair proſpect which we are given to hope, there is now before us, of peace, both at home and abroad. there is reaſon to hope, that if we ſhall not be wholly liberated from theſe burthens, they will be greatly diminiſhed in the courſe of the preſent and enſuing years. I am not enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with official details and eſtimates to fix the ſum, which will be annually ſaved to the United States, if this hope prove not abortive; but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing 1,500,000 dollars ſufficient to defray the expence of a peace eſtabliſhment, (and I ſhould hope it was more than doubly ſufficient,) there would remain a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of 4,417,227 dollars, which added to the 600,000 dollars ſurplus, now ſaid to exiſt, would conſtitute a fund of 5,000,000 of dollars for the redemption of the national debt, amounting to about 80,000,000 of dollars, which would redeem the debt in <hi>ſixteen years,</hi> were the whole funded at 6 per cent. But as one third of the original debt carries no intereſt, and the intereſt thereon, which has been funded, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries an intereſt of 3 per cent. only, five millions of dollars in ſpecie would at the preſent price of 3 per cents. and deferred 6 per cents. in the market, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes 8,333,333 dollars, conſequently, if one half the national debt, or 40,000,000 conſiſt in theſe kinds of ſtock, that proportion would be redeemed in leſs than five years, from this fund, if applied to the purchaſe of this deſcription of the debt, before the time arrives when the deferred 6 per cents. bear an intereſt. At the end of five years we may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, that the revenue, without a ſingle additional duty or tax, would, from the bare increaſe of commerce, and of exciſed ſpirits made in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028459_0004_0FD90C30D6EBD028"/>
States, produce at the leaſt one million of dollars more, in aid of the ſinking fund. But without this additional aid, the moſt common arithmetician may ſee, that the remaining 40,000,000 would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in <hi>eight</hi> years time, making in all <hi>thirteen</hi> years for the complete redemption of the whole debt. But upon the ground I have taken, it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in much leſs time, as will appear,

            <p>Thus it will appear that in <hi>leſs</hi> than <hi>eleven</hi> years by the proper application of the <hi>preſent</hi> funds of the United States if they be really as productive as they have been ſtated to be, we may, unleſs plunged into new expences by new wars, which heaven forbid! pay off the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent debt of the United States, without the ſmalleſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional burthen to the people; and without recourſe to the ſale of the territory belonging to the United States; which may be regarded as a precious mine of national wealth, which it would be highly imprudent to alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028459_0005_0FD90C3303115EB0"/>
or even to open, whilſt the ordinary revenue of the States is commenſurate to the demands againſt them. Let it not be ſuppoſed, that, like a miſer, I would recommend this treaſure to be perpetually lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; it is the improvident waſte, and not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſe of it, that I propoſe to guard againſt. For the Weſtern Territory is to be conſidered, not only as a fund of actual <hi>wealth,</hi> to the United States, but of <hi>population,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to the Union. Yet an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident uſe of it, may produce the very reverſe of theſe advantages, by ſubſtituting <hi>poverty</hi> for <hi>wealth;</hi> a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated</hi> country for one <hi>populous;</hi> and <hi>weakneſs</hi> for <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Weſtern Territory is to be regarded as a national ſtock of wealth; it may be compared to bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or coin depoſited in the vaults of a bank, which, although it produces no <hi>preſent</hi> profit, <hi>ſecures the credit of the inſtitution, and is ready to anſwer any emergency:</hi> with this advantage in favour of the <hi>lands,</hi> that their value muſt encreaſe with population, whereas the money in bank not circulated, gains no intereſt. And with this diſadvantage alſo, reſpecting the <hi>lands,</hi> that <hi>when ſold, both principal and intereſt are gone forever;</hi> whereas the bullion may again return to the bank; but the price of the lands can never be veſted in any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with equal advantage. If then Congreſs, inſtead of applying the <hi>annual revenue</hi> of the United States to the redemption of the national debt, ſhould ſell the lands at <hi>a low value,</hi> would not this be a moſt improvident ſacrifice of a <hi>principal</hi> which could <hi>never be renewed,</hi> by any application of the <hi>annual revenue,</hi> which of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſufficient to anſwer the requiſite purpoſe? For we are well appriſed, that the ſale of lands at preſent when the market hath been glutted from the land of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the ſeveral ſtates, muſt neceſſarily be for a very inconſiderable price, compared with their actual value, and that price which in the courſe of a very few years they will unqueſtionably command; prudence then would dictate that they be not offered for ſale at the moment they are at the loweſt ebb of depreciation. Let us ſuppoſe the whole ſold at once; to the full amount
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028459_0006_0FD90C36E3AE6E10"/>
of the debt, at the price given by thoſe who purchaſed ſeveral millions of the late Congreſs, which I think was a dollar per acre.—80,000,000, of acres! more than all Virginia, Kentucky, and the deſart between them! probably more than Great Britain contains! more than one third of France, the nurſe of 26,000,000 of people! and for what ſhall this immenſe terrritory be given? For a debt which the <hi>preſent revenues</hi> of the United States can diſcharge in leſs than <hi>eleven years;</hi> and for ten times the amount of which the <hi>ſame</hi> territory could not be repurchaſed at the end of that period. What a horrid waſte of national wealth doth this ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſent to our view!</p>
            <p>Again, if the lands be ſold, <hi>as heretofore,</hi> in very large tracts, <hi>only,</hi> it will either depreciate, or retard the ſale of the remainder, or produce ſtill worſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. For if it be ſold in large tracts to <hi>ſpeculators, who mean to ſell again,</hi> they muſt have an <hi>abatement</hi> in the price, that they may be able to make <hi>their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> upon the ſpeculation.—Hence a double ſource of depreciation; for by this means the quantity at mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket will be ſo much encreaſed, that the diſpoſal of the remainder in the hands of government, muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the completion of the ſpeculator's ſchemes, by which he may be encouraged, and enabled to make a new ſpeculation. The purchaſers from the late Congreſs are ſaid to have completed their ſales, and are probably ready for a <hi>new ſpeculation</hi> Thoſe who purchaſed from them, paid a very conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, perhaps <hi>double</hi> or <hi>treble</hi> the <hi>real value,</hi> of the firſt purchaſe. <hi>Hence</hi> another evil. The induſtrious farmer who wiſhes to ſettle, and to cultivate the lands, <hi>cannot obtain them at prime coſt;</hi> being unable to accompliſh the purchaſe of a larger tract than he means to occupy: <hi>poor men</hi> are therefore wholly <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the market,</hi> which is only open to the <hi>rich who buy to ſell again</hi>—or for <hi>other</hi> purpoſes that will be hereafter mentioned. If it be ſaid that <hi>poor men</hi> may unite themſelves in companies, and thus make large purchaſes, which they may divide among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the anſwer is, that the <hi>rich</hi> can always out-bid

them, and will find it their intereſt to do ſo; and this will moſt aſſuredly produce the effect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A precipitate ſale of the weſtern lands will tend to depopulate the <hi>preſent ſtates</hi> in the union, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>weaken,</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For when we recollect what has already happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſettlement of Kentucky, and the territory both ſouth, and north-weſt of the Ohio, under all the diſadvantages, that have attended ſuch ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we muſt immediately ſee, that ſuch a meaſure would operate as a <hi>drain</hi> from the Atlantic ſtates, where there is yet a very large portion of lands, uncultivated, which would in all probability be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, if there were not other lands, <hi>reputed</hi> of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior quality, to be had <hi>cheaper,</hi> which ſerve as a temptation to the huſbandman to quit his preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment: this will have the further effect of <hi>depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating the value of lands in thoſe ſtates;</hi> a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which the <hi>land holders</hi> therein, may conſider as not unworthy of their attention. Nor can it be denied, that inſtead of <hi>promoting</hi> and <hi>encreaſing population,</hi> it would only promote a ſtill more <hi>diſperſed location,</hi> than already prevails among us: a circumſtance not very deſirable in a country, where there is more than four times the quantity of land neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent number of inhabitants. The improvements of agriculture, and the increaſe of population do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go hand in hand, with the extent of location. On the contrary, in a country not overſtocked with inhabitants, the improvements of agriculture increaſe with population, and then in their turn contribute not a little to the advancement of commerce, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the comforts of life, and the increaſe of population,
<q>"Nam ſine Cerere et Baccho fugit Venus."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is one thing therefore to encourage population and agriculture, and another to ſettle an uninhabited country, at the expence of another, not yet ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028459_0008_0FD90C3F484AE108"/>
populous. For experience proves, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, that population, agriculture, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce miniſter to each other. If this be true, the ſale of the weſtern lands, may be attended with very ſerious and pernicious conſequences, to the preſent ſtates in the union, <hi>in their preſent ſtate of population,</hi> without any chance of retribution: for it is obvious, that the application of that labour to the ſettlement of a <hi>remote</hi> territory, which might have been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly employed in one more contigious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, muſt weaken the latter, without producing equal returns from the former; the productions of the tranſmontani territory, whenever they have a a ſuperfluity, will find a vent thro' the mouth of the Miſſiſippi or the St. Lawrence, and their ſupplies will be derived from foreign countries thro' the ſame chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, to the prejudice of the commerce of the preſent ſtates in the union. The remonſtrances of Kentucky may ſhew that this is the hope and expectation, of the whole people weſt of the Allegheny. The queſtion then is, whether the Atlantic ſtates would do wiſely to purſue a meaſure, not only tending to depreciate their own lands, but deſtructive to their population, and ruinous to their commerce. Were theſe diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages balanced againſt the payment of the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al debt, from the preſent funds of the United States, I am inclined to believe they would greatly prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. For, the national debt, as we have ſeen, may in a few years be diſcharged, without any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional burthens on the people: and no good citizen will complain of the preſent, if they be continued for <hi>that purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have ſaid reſpecting the diminution of the commerce of the Atlantic ſtates, will equally ſhew the diminution of revenue, ariſing from commerce, in the ſame proportion; and this too without any retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, nor ſhall we gain much from the exciſe, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the revenue ariſing from commerce, if we may judge from the product of the exciſe in thoſe parts of the ſtates which are thinly inhabited: and ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028459_0009_0FD90C402884AE40"/>
Congreſs have recourſe to <hi>direct</hi> taxes, as the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them depends altogether upon the cenſus, the inhabitants of the Weſtern Territory would pay no <hi>more</hi> than if they had remained in their former ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Atlantic ſtates; but from the difficulties of collection they may pay <hi>leſs:</hi> a circumſtance not much in favor of the meaſure.</p>
            <p>If, from what I have ſaid, it appears that the ſale of the weſtern lands is not a meaſure of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> for the redemption of the public debt; if it appear that ſuch a meaſure at <hi>this time,</hi> would be attended with an immenſe waſte of the <hi>national ſtock of wealth:</hi> if it would tend to depopulate and weaken the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtates: to leſſen the value of lands therein; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the improvement of agriculture; to divert com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce from her preſent advantageous channels; and to leſſen the revenue ariſing therefrom; there is yet another point of view in which the ſubject may be placed, that may render the expediency of <hi>enticing</hi> the inhabitants of the Atlantic ſtates, (which firſt <hi>wholly</hi> compoſed, and now <hi>principally</hi> compoſe the union) to migrate from thence, and <hi>found new ſtates, in a different part of the continent,</hi> ſtill more queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For, if the ſpirit of migration, already too high in moſt of the ſtates, be encouraged by the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering proſpect of purchaſing valuable lands at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-rate, it is obvious that as <hi>their</hi> numbers increaſe in the <hi>newly formed ſtates,</hi> the numbers in the <hi>preſent ſtates</hi> will <hi>diminiſh;</hi> hence, as repreſentation and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation are inſeparably connected by the conſtitution of the United States, the repreſentation of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtates</hi> in Congreſs will <hi>decline,</hi> in proportion as that of the <hi>new ſtates encreaſes.</hi> The conſequence is obvious.—Let thoſe who are acquainted with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid population of Kentucky, her almoſt inſtantaneous change from a deſart diſtrict of Virginia to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the federal union, with a repreſentation equal to the ſtate of Georgia, teſtify that this is not a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs concluſion. But I ſhall be told that European emigrants will ſettle this country, without draining
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028459_0010_0FD90C41AD678900"/>
the preſent ſtates of their inhabitants. If this be true, it calls for an additional caution: a rapid popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by people equally ſtrangers to the language, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, laws, and policy of this country, and to the habits of the people, and of each other, cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps inveterate prejudices on every ſubject, and bound together by no common tie but that of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, would probably realize in this weſtern he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere the confuſions which ſimilar cauſes are ſaid to have produced at Babel. Could an union of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with ſuch a variegated people be deſirable, or capable of being maintained? I think not. If America is to be the aſylum of the fugitives from Europe, there is land in abundance <hi>in the ſeveral ſtates,</hi> for their accommodation; and by being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among the people of theſe ſtates in ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they may acquire an earlier acquaintance with the principles of our government, laws, manners, and language than could poſſibly be affected in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ſettlement. One or two generations would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us one people, or if ſome veſtiges of difference ſhould ſtill remain, they would have nothing formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their aſpect.</p>
            <p>There remains another light in which this meaſure may be viewed, that in this enlightened age, when a belief in giants, hobgoblins, chimaeras, and other mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of a diſtempered brain is completely exploded, I am almoſt afraid to mention, leſt I ſhould be ſuppoſed to have paid a viſit lately to the cave of <hi>Monteſinos,</hi> and to have returned from thence as completely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered in my intellects, as the famous knight of <hi>La Mancha</hi> himſelf: But proteſting moſt ſolemnly that I have not viſited any ſuch place, nor, willingly,
<q>
                  <l>"Ate of that inſane root,</l>
                  <l>"That takes the reaſon priſoner."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhortly obſerve, that the foundations of the modern ariſtocratic families in the various parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, were laid in the <hi>immenſe grants</hi> of <hi>lands,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028459_0011_0FD90C46174D8BB0"/>
made by princes to their favorites and adherents; which being parcelled out among a dependant tenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have in proceſs of time become baronies, duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and principalities. If the territory of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States be granted, in like manner, to a few rich, and ambitious men, diſpoſed to aggrandize themſelves and their poſterity, the ſeeds of an ariſtocracy will be ſown, which it will require nothing but time, to bring to a moſt vigorous maturity. If, for example, a fortunate ſpeculator in the funds of the United States ſhould chooſe to realize his wealth, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of half a million, or a million of acres of land, (and there are thoſe, I am told, who can eaſily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh ſuch a purchaſe,) this property, tranſmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired for a century or two to his poſterity, would probably exhibit in the deſcendant of a <hi>ſcript-monger,</hi> or a <hi>change-alley-broker,</hi> the poſſeſſor of an eſtate, equal to that of a Britiſh peer, or a German prince; with as numerous a train of <hi>tenants</hi> and <hi>dependants,</hi> at once the <hi>ſymbols</hi> and <hi>tools</hi> of his political influence and conſequence. I claim no merit for this fancy-piece, if it be called one; I confeſs that I am indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>three</hi> perſons in the ſtate of New-York both for the features, and the coloring. There, I am told, that <hi>three</hi> men, ſolely from conſiderations of <hi>dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> can influence <hi>as many thouſands.</hi>—I may be told in triumph, that New-York poſſeſſes one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratic conſtitutions of any ſtate in the Union! Long may it preſerve it, in ſpite of that latent <hi>poiſon</hi> which threatens to convulſe, if not deſtroy it! The only <hi>antidote</hi> will be found in the diviſion and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of thoſe manors, or <hi>landgravates,</hi> which now confer upon their owners an influence, ſo incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a true republican government; and this can probably be effected in no other mode, than ſuch as has already been adopted in ſeveral of the ſtates, viz. the <hi>abolition</hi> of <hi>eſtates tail;</hi> of the <hi>preference</hi> to the <hi>male ſtock;</hi> and of the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>primogeniture:</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhing,</hi> in <hi>lieu thereof,</hi> an <hi>equal partition</hi> of <hi>eſtates</hi> among <hi>all the children,</hi> or neareſt relations of perſons
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028459_0012_0FD90C49E80B09A0"/>
inteſtate.—And if Congreſs have power to eſtabliſh their regulations in the weſtern territory of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, (of which I ſee not much reaſon to doubt,) they ought to conſtitute a part of the <hi>fundamental laws</hi> of that country, whenever it ſhall be ſettled. Without ſome ſuch precaution, I could prophecy;— but, like Caſſandra, I ſhould be diſregarded.</p>
            <p>Quitting then this unpleaſant anticipation, I ſhall add a few words more on the neceſſity of ſelling the weſtern lands, if Congreſs proceed to adopt the report of their committee for continuing the preſent duties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the year 1800, or 1802. In this caſe it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the ſtatement in the firſt part of this eſſay, that <hi>one half</hi> of the national debt may be paid <hi>before</hi> the end of the latter period: conſequently the reaſons againſt ſelling the lands at <hi>preſent</hi> are greatly ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened thereby: and at the end of that period, there can be ſtill leſs <hi>neceſſity</hi> to throw away the lands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem a debt which the <hi>exiſting funds</hi> would redeem in leſs than ſix years. In <hi>twenty years time, perhaps,</hi> the encreaſing population of the United States may have ſo far ſettled the lands within the limits of the ſeveral States, as to make it expedient to open the land office of the United States, under certain reſtrictions and limitations. For, I repeat, that there is a wide diſtinction between <hi>population</hi> and <hi>location.</hi> In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, and perhaps in the other eaſtern ſtates, this diſtinction appears to have been well underſtood, and wiſely attended to: lands were not ſuffered to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly taken up, in every quarter of the country, according to the caprice of the land-monger. They were laid off into ſmall townſhips, and a ſecond town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was never diſpoſed of, until the former was ſettled. Hence <hi>location</hi> and <hi>population</hi> went hand in hand there: very different was the conduct of Virginia in her grants of lands. The conſequence is obvious— Connecticut is a well peopled ſtate, where property is divided into ſmall portions, yet is amply ſufficient for the ſupport of its inhabitants: its agriculture is highly improved, and the conveniencies of life are plentifully diſtributed throughout the ſtate, in nearly equal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028459_0013_0FD90C4ED85F45E8"/>
Virginia on the contrary, appears to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe deſart, in which the traveller here and there meets with ſome veſtiges of population, which he looſes ſight of again for miles together. Had the ſame plan been purſued there that was in Connecticut, the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſtate would probably, for many years to come, have been limited by the Allegheny mountains; nor would ſhe have reſigned forty or fifty thouſand of her inhabitants to a newly erected ſtate, becauſe her territory was too extenſive, even to ſupport a ſafe communication between its ſeveral parts.—Congreſs, it is hoped, whenever they ſell the lands, will embrace the example of Connecticut: the Weſtern Territory will in that caſe become a real ſource of wealth and ſtrength to the United States. The following regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will contribute to this end, if duly attended to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the lands be divided, as in Connecticut, into ſmall townſhips, not exceeding five thouſand, or at the utmoſt limits, ten thouſand acres. Let them be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into lots not exceeding two hundred acres.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be required that each lot ſhall be ſettled, and improved within a limited time, or become forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the United States.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let the townſhips be numbered according to their proximity to the United States now ſettled: let not a ſecond townſhip be ſold, until the former is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let not more than one hundred townſhips, or one million of acres be ſold in any one year.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the lands in the ſeveral townſhips be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and the lots claſſed according to their value. Let their valuation be publiſhed for ſix months at leaſt before the ſale: let them be ſold ſeparately in lots, at public auction, to the higheſt bidder, but not under the valuation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let no grant be made until the terms of ſale, and of ſettlement and improvement have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:028459_0014_0FD90C516A6DA608"/>If in addition to theſe regulations, the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal laws of the <hi>new ſtates</hi> ſhall ſubject lands to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts; aboliſh intails, the right of priomgeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the preference to males; and eſtabliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents in parcenary; the evils to be apprehended from the ſale of the Weſtern Territory may be avoided; otherwiſe they will be realized.</p>
