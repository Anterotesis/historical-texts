            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this chapter, from whence my text is taken, we find the Apoſtle Paul labouring with the Romans to preſs on them the great duties of Brotherly Love.</p>
            <p>By an entire ſubmiſſion and conformity to the will of God, whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe we might be made partakers of the divine nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through luſt—That being all members of the body of Chriſt with the Church, we ought to apply the gifts we have received to the advantage of our brethren, thoſe of us eſpecially who are called to any office in the church, by diſcharging it with zeal and integrity and benevolence, which is the moſt important duty, and comprehends all the reſt, and particularly the following—which the apoſtle here ſets down—which are to love one another ſincerely, to be ready to all good offices—to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021931_0003_0FB607335F9F98A8"/>
in the good or evil that befals our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to comfort and aſſiſt thoſe that are in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to live together in a ſpirit of humility, peace and unity. Benevolence does yet further oblige chriſtians to love and bleſs thoſe who hate them and injure them, to endeavour to have peace with all men, to abſtain from revenge, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them good for evil; theſe are the moſt eſſential duties of the religion we profeſs; and we deſerve the name of chriſtians no further than we ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe them to the glory of God and the good of our own ſouls and bodies, and the good of all mankind.</p>
            <p>But firſt, my Brethren, let us learn to pray to God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that we may know ourſelves; for without this we can never be fit for the ſociety of man, we muſt learn to guide ourſelves before we can guide others, and when we have done this we ſhall underſtand the apoſtle, Romans xii. 16. "Be not wiſe in your own conceits," for when we get wiſe in ourſelves we are then too wiſe for God, and conſequently not fit for the ſociety of man—I mean the chriſtian part of mankind—Let all my brethren Maſons conſider what they are called to—May God grant you an humble heart to fear God and love his commandments; then and only then you will in ſincerity love your brethren: And you will be enabled, as in the words of my text, to be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love in honour prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another. Therefore, with the apoſtle
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021931_0004_0FB6073F37CA45B8"/>
Paul, I beſeech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice—let love be without diſſimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good. Theſe and many other duties are required of us as chriſtians, every one of which are like ſo many links of a chain, which when joined together make one complete member of Chriſt; this we profeſs to believe a Chriſtians and as Maſons.—I ſhall ſtop here with the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, which brings me to the points I ſhall endeavour to prove.—</p>
            <p>Firſt, the anciency of Maſonry, that being done, will endeavour to prove all other titles we have a juſt right as Maſons to claim—namely, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, free and accepted: To do this I muſt have recourſe to the creation of this our world.—After the Grand Architect of the Univerſe had framed the heavens for beauty and delight for the beings he was then about to make, he then called the earth to appear out of darkneſs, ſaying, let there be light, and it was ſo; he alſo ſet the ſun, moon and ſtars in the firmament of heaven, for the delight of his creatures—he then created the fiſhes of the ſea, the fowls of the air, then the beaſts of the earth after their various kinds, and God bleſſed them.</p>
            <p>Thus all things were in their order prepared for the moſt excellent accompliſhed piece of the viſible creation, Man.—The forming this moſt excellent creature Man, was the cloſe of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021931_0005_0FB6074158A15BE0"/>
creation, ſo it was peculiar to him to have a ſolemn conſultation and decree about his making, and God ſaid, let us make Man.—Seneca ſays, that man is not a work huddled over in haſte, and done without fore-thinking and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, for man is the greateſt and moſt ſtupendous work of God.—Man hath not only a body in common with all inferior animals, but into his body was infuſed a ſoul of a far more noble nature and make—a rational prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to act according to the deſigns of his creation; that is, to contemplate the works of God, to admire his perfections, to worſhip him, to live as becomes one who received his excellent being from him, to converſe with his fellow creatures that are of his own order, to maintain mutual love and ſociety, and to ſerve God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort. Man is a wonderful creature, and not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſaid to be a little world, a world within himſelf, and containing whatever is found in the Creator.—In him is the ſpiritual and immaterial nature of God, the reaſonableneſs of Angels, tho ſenſative power of brutes, the vegetative life of plants, and the virtue of all the elements he holds converſe with in both worlds.—Thus man is crowned with glory and honour, he is the moſt remarkable workmanſhip of God. And is man ſuch a noble creature and made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with his fellow men that are of his own order, to maintain mutual love and ſociety, and to ſerve God in conſort with each other?—then what can theſe God-provoking wretches think,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021931_0006_0FB607424653E750"/>
who deſpiſe their fellow men, as tho' they were not of the ſame ſpecies with themſelves, and would if in their power deprive them of the bleſſings and comforts of this life, which God in his bountiful goodneſs, hath freely given to all his creatures to improve and enjoy? Surely ſuch monſters never came out of the hand of God in ſuch a forlorn condition.—Which brings me to conſider the fall of man; and the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden, to dreſs it and to keep it, and freely to eat of every tree of the garden; here was his delightful employ and bountiful wages, and but one tree out of all that vaſt number he was forbidden to eat of. Concerning this garden, there have been different opinions about it by the learned, where it was, but the moſt of them agree that it was about the center of the earth, and that the four rivers parted or divided the four quarters of the world. The firſt was Piſon, that was it which compaſſeth the land of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilah; this river Piſon is called by ſome Phaſis, or Phaſi Tigris, it runs (they ſay) by that Havilah whither the Amalekites fled, ſee 1 Sam. xv. 7. and divides it from the country of Suſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna, and at laſt falls into the Perſian Gulf, ſaith Galtruchius and others; but from the opinions of chriſtian writers, who hold, that Havilah is India, and Piſon the river Ganges. This was firſt aſſerted by Joſephus, and from him Euſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Jerom, and moſt of the fathers received it, and not without good reaſon; for Moſes here

               </gap>d the gold of that land is good; now it is confeſſed by all, that India is the moſt noted for gold, and of the beſt ſort. It is added again, a note whereby to diſcover that place, that there is bdellium and the onyx ſtone—and India is famous for precious ſtones and pearls.—The name of the ſecond river is Gihon, the ſame is it which compaſſeth the whole land of Ethiopia (or Cuſh as it is in the original) there is reaſon to believe that this Gihon is the river of Nile, as the forenamed Joſephus and moſt of the ancient writers of the church hold, and by the help of the river Nile, Paradiſe did as it were border upon Egypt, which is the principal part of the African Ethiopia, which the ancient writers hold is meant there: The name of the third river is Hiddekel, that is it which goeth toward the eaſt of Aſſyria, ver. 14. That it was a river belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Babylon is clear from Dan. x. 4; this is concluded to be the river Tygris, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides Meſopotamia from Aſſyria, and goeth along with Euphrates, this being the great middle chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel that ran through Edom or Babylon, and may be thought to take its name from its fructifying quality. Theſe are the four grand land marks which the all-wiſe and gracious God was pleaſed to draw as the bounds and habitation of all nations which he was about to ſettle in this world; if ſo, what nation or people dare, without highly diſpleaſing and provoking that God to pour down his judgments upon them.—I ſay,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021931_0008_0FB6074C925D7A20"/>
dare to deſpiſe or tyrannize over their lives or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or incroach on their lands, or to inſlave their bodies? God hath and ever will viſit ſuch a nation or people as this.—Envy and pride are the leading lines to all the miſeries that mankind have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the beginning of the world to this preſent day. What was it but theſe that turned the devil out of heaven into a hell of miſery, but envy and pride?—Was it not the ſame ſpirit that moved him to tempt our firſt parents to ſin againſt ſo holy and juſt a God, who had but juſt (if I may uſe the expreſſion) turned his back from crowning Adam with honour and glory?—But envy at his proſperity hath taken the crown of glory from his head, and hath made us his poſterity miſerable.—What was it but this that made Cain murder his brother, whence is it but from theſe that our modern Cains call us Africans the ſons of Cain? (We admit it if you pleaſe) and we will find from him and his ſons Maſonry began, after the fall of his father. Altho' Adam, when placed in the garden, God would not ſuffer him to be idle and unemployed in that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate of innocence, but ſet him to dreſs and to keep that choice piece of earth; here he was to employ his mind as well as exerciſe his body; here he was to contemplate and ſtudy God's works; here he was to enjoy God, himſelf and the whole world, to ſubmit himſelf wholly to his divine conduct, to conform all his actions to the will of his Maker; but by his ſudden fall he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021931_0009_0FB6074D814DFFE8"/>
loſt that good will that he owed to his God, and for ſome time loſt the ſtudy of God's works; but no doubt he afterwards taught his ſons the art of Maſonry; for how elſe could Cain after ſo much trouble and perplexity have time to ſtudy the art of building a city, as he did on the eaſt of Eden, Gen. iv. 17. and without doubt he teached his ſons the art, ver. 20, 21.—</p>
            <p>But to return, bad as Cain was, yet God took not from him his faculty of ſtudying architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, arts and ſciences—his ſons alſo were endued with the ſame ſpirit, and in ſome convenient place no doubt they met and communed with each other for inſtruction. It ſeems that the all wiſe God put this into the hearts of Cain's family thus to employ themſelves, to divert their minds from muſing on their father's murder and the woful curſe God had pronounced on him, as we don't find any more of Cain's complaints after this.</p>
            <p>Similar to this we have in the 6 Gen. 12 &amp; 13, that God ſaw that all men had corrupted their way, and that their hearts were only evil continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and 14, 15, 16 verſes, the great Architect of the univerſe gives Noah a compleat plan of the ark and ſets him to work, and his ſons as aſſiſtants, like deputy and two grand wardens. One thing is well known, our enemies themſelves being judges, that in whatſoever nation or kingdom in the whole world where Maſonry abounds moſt, there hath been and ſtill are the moſt peaceable ſubjects, cheerfully conforming to the laws of that country
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021931_0010_0FB6074EFA919F30"/>
in which they reſide, always willing to ſubmit to their magiſtrates and rulers, and where Maſonry moſt abounds, arts and ſciences, whether mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or liberal, all of them have a mighty tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the delight and benefit of mankind; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need not queſtion but the allwiſe God by putting this into our hearts intended, as another end of our creation, that we ſhould not only live happily ourſelves, but be likewiſe mutually aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each other. Again, it is not only good and beneficial in a time of peace, in a nation or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in a time of war, for that brotherly love that cements us together by the bonds of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, no wars or tumults can ſeparate; for in the heat of war if a brother ſees another in diſtreſs he will relieve him ſome way or other, and kindly receive him as a brother, prefering him before all others, according to the Apoſtle's exhortation in my text, as alſo a ſimilar inſtance you have 1 Kings, x. from 31ſt to 38th verſe, where you find Benhadad in great diſtreſs, having loſt a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army in two battles, after his great boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he himſelf forced to hide himſelf in a chamber, and ſends a meſſage to Ahab king of Iſrael to requeſt only his life as a captive; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the brotherly love of a Maſon! no ſooner was the meſſage delivered, but he cries out in a rapture—is he alive—he is my brother! Every Maſon knows that they were both of the craft, and alſo the meſſengers.

pleaſed to honour ever ſince he breathed into Adam the breath of life, and hath from generation to generation inſpired men with wiſdom, and planned out and given directions how they ſhould build, and with what materials. And firſt, Noah in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ark wherein he was ſaved, while God in his juſtice was pleaſed to deſtroy the unbelieving world of mankind. The firſt thing Noah did upon his landing was to build an altar to offer ſacrifice to that great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God which had delivered him out of ſo great a deluge; God accepted the ſacrifice and bleſſed him, and as they journeyed from the eaſt towards the weſt, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there, and his ſons.</p>
            <p>Nimrod the ſon of Cuſh, the ſon of Ham, firſt founded the Babylonian monarchy, and kept poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the plains, and founded the firſt great empire at Babylon, and became grand maſter of all Maſons, he built many ſplendid cities in Shinar, and under him flouriſhed thoſe learned Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, whoſe ſucceſſors were ſtyled in the book of Daniel, Magi, or wiſe men, for their ſuperior knowledge. The migration from Shinar commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced fifty three years after they began to build the tower, and one hundred and fifty four years after the flood, and they went off at various times and travelled eaſt, weſt, north and ſouth, with their mighty ſkill, and found the uſe of it in ſettling their colonies; and from Shinar the arts were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to diſtant parts of the earth, notwithſtanding the confuſion of languages, which gave riſe to Maſons faculty and univerſal practice of converſing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021931_0012_0FB60758489330C0"/>
without ſpeaking, and of knowing each other by ſigns and tokens; they ſettled the diſperſion in caſe any of them ſhould meet in diſtant parts of the world who had been before in Shinar. Thus the earth was again planted and repleniſhed with Maſons the ſecond ſon of Ham carried into Egypt; there he built the city of Heliopolis—Thebes with an hundred gates—they built alſo the ſtatue of Sphynx, whoſe head was 120 feet round, being reckoned the firſt or earlieſt of the ſeven wonders of arts. Shem the ſecond ſon of Noah remained at Ur of the Chaldees in Shinar, with his father and his great grandſon Heber, where they lived in private and died in peace: But Shem's offspring travelled into the ſouth and eaſt of Aſia, and their offspring propagated the ſcience and the art as far as China and Japan.</p>
            <p>While Noah, Shem and Heber diverted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at Ur in mathematical ſtudies, teaching Peleg the father of Rehu, of Sereg, Nachor, and Terah, father of Abram, a learned race of mathematicians and geometricians; thus Abram, born two years after the death of Noah, had learned well the ſcience and the art before the God of glory called him to travel from Ur of the Chaldees, but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſoon forced him down to Egypt; the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Abram ſojourned in Egypt, as ſhepherds ſtill lived in tents, practiſed very little of the art of architecture till about eighty years before their Exodus, when by the overruling hand of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they were trained up to the building with ſtone and brick, in order to make them expert

Maſons before they poſſeſſed the promiſed land; after Abram left Charran 430 years, Moſes march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Egypt at the head of 600,000 Hebrews, males, for whoſe ſakes God divided the red ſea to let them paſs through Arabia to Canaan. God was pleaſed to inſpire their grand maſter Moſes, and Joſhua his deputy, with wiſdom of heart; ſo the next year they raiſed the curious tabernacle or tent; God having called Moſes up into the mount and gave him an exact pattern of it, and charges him to make it exactly to that pattern, and withal gave him the two tables of ſtone; theſe he broke at the foot of the mount; God gave him orders to hew two more himſelf, after the likeneſs of the former. God did not only inſpire Moſes with wiſdom to undertake the overſight of the great work, but he alſo inſpired Bezaleel with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to do all manner of cunning workmanſhip for it.—Having entered upon the jewiſh diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I muſt beg leave ſtill to take a little notice of the Gentile nations, for we have but theſe two nations now to ſpeak upon, namely, the Gentiles and the Jews, till I come to the Chriſtian aera.</p>
            <p>The Canaanites, Phenicians and Sidonians, were very expert in the ſacred architecture of ſtone, who being a people of a happy genius and frame of mind, made many great diſcoveries and improvements of the ſciences, as well as in point of learning. The glaſs of Sidon, the purple of Tyre, and the exceeding fine linnen they wove, were the product of their own country and their own invention; and for their extraordinary ſkill
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021931_0014_0FB6075AF8235298"/>
in working of metals, in hewing of timber and ſtone; in a word, for their perfect knowledge of what was ſolid in architecture, it need but be remembered that they had in erecting and decorating of the temple at Jeruſalem, than which nothing can more redound to their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or give a clearer idea of what this one building muſt have been.—Their fame was ſuch for their juſt taſte, deſign, and ingenious inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that whatever was elegant, great or pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was diſtinguiſhed by way of excellence with the epithet of Sidonian.—The famous temple of Jupiter Hammon, in Libian Africa, was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſtood till demoliſhed by the firſt Chriſtians in thoſe parts; but I muſt paſs over many other cities and temples built by the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>God having inſpired Solomon with wiſdom and underſtanding, he as grand maſter and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker, under God the great architect, ſends to Hiram king of Tyre, and after acquainting him of his purpoſe of building a houſe unto the name of the Lord his God, he ſends to him for ſome of his people to go with ſome of his, to Mount Lebanon, to cut down and hew cedar trees, as his ſervants underſtood it better than his own, and moreover he requeſted him to ſend him a man that was cunning, to work in gold and in ſilver, and in braſs, iron, purple, crimſon and in blue, and that had ſkill to engrave with the cunning men, and he ſent him Hiram, his name-ſake this Hiram, God was pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021931_0015_0FB6076582A69AA8"/>
with wiſdom and underſtanding to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and ſtrength to go through the moſt curious piece of workmanſhip that was ever done on earth.—Thus Solomon as grand maſter, and Hiram as his deputy, carried on and finiſhed that great work of the temple of the living God, the inſide work of which, in many inſtances as well as the tabernacle, reſembles men's bodies; but this is better explained in a well filled lodge; but this much I may venture to ſay, that our bleſſed Saviour compared his ſacred body to a temple, when he ſaid, John ii. 19. Deſtroy this temple and I will raiſe it up again in three days; and the Apoſtle, 1 Peter, i. 14. ſays, that ſhortly he ſhould put off this tabernacle. I could ſhow alſo that one grand end and deſign of Maſonry is to build up the temple that Adam deſtroyed in Paradiſe—but I forbear. Thus hath God honoured the Craft, or Maſons, by inſpiring men with wiſdom to carry on his ſtupendous works.</p>
            <p>It is worthy our notice to conſider the number of Maſons employed in the work of the Temple: Excluſive of the two Grand Maſters, there were 300 princes, or rulers, 3300 overſeers of the work, 80000 ſtone ſquarers, ſetters, layers or builders, being able and ingenious Crafts, and 30000 appointed to work in Lebanon, 10000 of which every month, under Adoniram, who was the Grand Warden; all the free Maſons employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the work of the Temple was 119,600, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 70,000 men who carried burdens, who were not numbered among Maſons; theſe were
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021931_0016_0FB60766F8C2A3C0"/>
partitioned into certain Lodges, although they were of different nations and different colours, yet were they in perfect harmony among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſtrongly cemented in brotherly love and friendſhip, till the glorious Temple of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah was finiſhed, and the cape-ſtone was celebrated with great joy—Having finiſhed all that Solomon had to do, they departed unto their ſeveral homes, and carried with them the high taſte of architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the different parts of the world, and built many other temples and cities in the Gentile nations, under the direction of many wiſe and learned and royal Grand Maſters, as Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar over Babylon—Cyrus over the Medes and Perſians—Alexander over the Macedonians—Julius Caeſar over Rome, and a great number more I might mention of crowned heads of the Gentile nations who were of the Craft, but this may ſuffice.—I muſt juſt mention Herod the Great, before I come to the ſtate of Maſonry from the birth of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.—This Herod was the greateſt builder of his day, the patron and Grand Maſter of many Lodges; he being in the full enjoyment of peace and plenty, formed a deſign of new building the Temple of Jeruſalem. The Temple built by the Jews after the captivity was greatly decayed, being 500 years ſtanding, he propoſed to the people that he would not take it down till he had all the materials ready for the new, and accordingly he did ſo, then he took down the old one and built a new one.—Joſephus deſcribes this Temple as a moſt admirable and magnificent fabric of marble, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021931_0017_0FB607689F092120"/>
the fineſt building upon earth.—Tiberius having attained the imperial throne, became an encourager of the fraternity.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to conſider their freedom, and that will appear not only from their being free when accepted, but they have a free inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with all Lodges over the whole terreſtial globe; wherever arts flouriſh, a man hath a free right (having a recommendation) to viſit his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and they are bound to accept him; theſe are the laudable bonds that unite Free Maſons together in one indiſſoluble fraternity—thus in every nation he finds a friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in every cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate he may find a houſe—this it is to be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to anſwer ſome objections which are raiſed againſt the Maſons, and the firſt is the irregular lives of the profeſſors of it.—It muſt be admitted there are ſome perſons who, careleſs of their own reputation, will conſequently diſregard the moſt inſtructive leſſons—Some, I am ſorry to ſay, are ſometimes to be found among us; many by yielding to vice and intemperance, frequently not only diſgrace themſelves, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect diſhonour on Maſonry in general; but let it be known that theſe apoſtates are unworthy of their truſt, and that whatever name or deſignation they aſſume, they are in reality no Maſons: But if the wicked lives of men were admitted as an argument againſt the religion which they profeſs, Chriſtianity itſelf, with all its divine beauties, would be expoſed to cenſure; but they ſay there
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021931_0018_0FB60770A11FDBC0"/>
can be no good in Maſonry becauſe we keep it a ſecret, and at the ſame time theſe very men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will not admit an apprentice into their craft whatever, without enjoining ſecreſy on him, before they receive him as an apprentice; and yet blame us for not revealing our's—Solomon ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prov. xi. 12, 13. He that is void of wiſdom deſpiſeth his neighbour, but a man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holdeth his peace; a tale-bearer revealeth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, but he that is of a faithful ſpirit concealeth the matter. Thus I think I have anſwered theſe objections. I ſhall conclude the whole by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the Brethren of the African Lodge.</p>

Gregory (ſighing) ſaid, alas! for grief, that ſuch fair faces ſhould be under the power of the prince of darkneſs, and that ſuch bodies ſhould have their ſouls void of the grace of God.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:021931_0020_0FB60773DBDD3D60"/>
I ſhall endeavour to draw a few inferences on this diſcourſe by way of application.—</p>
            <p>My dear Brethren, let us pray to God for a benevolent heart, that we may be enabled to paſs through the various ſtages of this life with reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that great and infinite Jehovah, who overrules the grand fabric of nature, will enable us to look backward with pleaſure, and forward with confidence—and in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment, the well grounded hope of meeting with that mercy from our Maker which we, have ever been ready to ſhew to others, will refreſh us with the moſt ſolid comfort, and fill us with the moſt unſpeakable joy.</p>
            <p>And ſhould not this learn us that new and glorious commandment of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to his diſciples, when he urges it to them in theſe words—Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyſelf.—Our Lord repeats and recommends this as the moſt indiſpenſable duty and neceſſary qualification of his diſciples, ſaying, hereby ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to another.—And we are expreſsly told by the Apoſtle, that charity, or univerſal love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is the end of the commandment.</p>
            <p>Shall this noble and unparalleled example fail of its due influence upon us—ſhall it not animate our hearts with a like diſpoſition of benevolence and mercy, ſhall it not raiſe our emulation and provoke our ambition—to go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Let us then beware of ſuch a ſelfiſhneſs as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues pleaſure at the expence of our neighbour's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021931_0021_0FB6077B927BC408"/>
happineſs, and renders us indifferent to his peace and welfare; and ſuch a ſelf-love is the parent of diſorder and the ſource of all thoſe evils that divide the world and deſtroy the peace of mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas chriſtian charity—univerſal love and friendſhip—benevolent affections and ſocial feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, unite and knit men together, render them happy in themſelves and uſeful to one another, and recommend them to the eſteem of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The few inferences that have been made on this head muſt be to you, my worthy brethren, of great comfort, that every one may ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of a diſcourſe on brotherly love before a ſociety of free Maſons—who knows their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as men and as chriſtians, have ſuperadded the bonds of this ancient and honourable ſociety—a ſociety founded upon ſuch friendly and comprehenſive principles, that men of all nations and languages, or ſects of religion, are and may be admitted and received as members, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as perſons of a virtuous character.</p>
            <p>Religion and virtue, and the continuance and ſtanding of this excellent ſociety in the world—its proof of the wiſdom of its plan—and the force of its principles and conduct has, on many occaſions, been not a little remarkable—as well among perſons of this, as among thoſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, who go down to the ſea and occupy their buſineſs in the great waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they know how readily people of this inſtitution can open a paſſage to the heart of a brother; and in the midſt of war, like a univerſal language, is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021931_0022_0FB6077F60F0CCE0"/>
by men of all countries—and no wonder.—If the foundation has been thus laid in wiſdom by the great God, then let us go on with united hearts and hands to build and improve upon this noble foundation—let love and ſincere friendſhip in neceſſity inſtruct our ignorance, conceal our infirmities, reprove our errors, reclaim us from our faults—let us rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with thoſe that weep—ſhare with each other in our joys, and ſympathize in our troubles.</p>
            <p>And let the character of our enemies be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affronts—but our's to generouſly remit and forgive the greateſt; their's to blacken the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and blaſt the credit of their brethren—but our's to be tender of their good name, and to caſt a vail over all their failings; their's to blow the coals of contention and ſow the ſeeds of ſtrife among men—but our's to compoſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> differences and heal up their breaches.</p>
            <p>In a word, let us join with the words of the Apoſtle John in the 19th chapter of Revelations, and after theſe things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, ſaying, Alleluia, ſalvation and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are his judgments—and the four and twenty elders, and the four beaſts, fell down and worſhipped God that ſat on the throne, ſaying, Amen; Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luia; and a voice came out of the throne, ſaying, praiſe our God, all ye his ſervants, and ye that fear him, both ſmall and great.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:021931_0023_0FB60782ABE4E488"/>
To conclude the whole, let it be remembered, that all that is outward, whether opinions, rites or ceremonies, cannot be of importance in regard to eternal ſalvation, any further than they have a tendency to produce inward righteouſneſs and goodneſs—pure, holy, ſpiritual and benevolent affections can only fit us for the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore the cultivation of ſuch muſt needs be the eſſence of Chriſt's religion.—God of his infinite mercy grant that we may make this true uſe of it. Unhappily, too many Chriſtians, ſo called, take their religion not from the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt and his apoſtles, but from the writings of thoſe they eſteem learned.—But, I am to ſay, it is from the New-Teſtament only, not from any books whatſoever, however piouſly wrote, that we ought to ſeek what is the eſſence of Chriſt's religion; and it is from this fountain I have endeavoured to give my hearers the idea of Chriſtianity in its ſpiritual dreſs, free from any human mixtures—if we have done this wiſely we may expect to enjoy our God in the world that is above—in which happy place, my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we ſhall all, I hope, meet at that great day, when our great Grand Maſter ſhall ſit at the head of the great and glorious Lodge in heaven—where we ſhall all meet to part no more for ever and ever—Amen.</p>
