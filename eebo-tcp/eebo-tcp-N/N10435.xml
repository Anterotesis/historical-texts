            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>II. THESSALONIANS ii. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Now we beſeech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Chriſt is at hand.</p>
                  <p>Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day ſhall not come except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Who oppoſeth, and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that He as God, ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that He is God.</p>
                  <p>And then ſhall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming. Even him, whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Romiſh ſuperſtition, conſidered in its ſtructure, and the progreſs it has made in the world, is at once a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing monument of human ſagacity and weakneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013228_0004_0F90430F0B012768"/>
ADVANCING by ſlow degrees to that fatal maturity it acquired before the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it was nurtured by the obſervation and experience of ages, and the abilities of a long ſucceſſion of as deep politicians as perhaps the world ever produced. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a thorough acquaintance with the frailty of the human mind: Its pomp and pageantry ſtrike the ſenſes: It manages with uncommon art and addreſs, every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that can touch the paſſions; and while it flatters the corrupt inclinations of the heart, it is at the ſame time covered with a glare of devotion and auſterity, and ſupported with a ſophiſtry, extremly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dazzle and miſlead the underſtanding.</p>
            <p>LONG before <hi>Luther</hi> appeared, it had extended itſelf over the whole face of the Chriſtian world: It had grown venerable by age: It had acquired aſtoniſhing ſtrength by its long prepoſſeſſion of the minds of men: It had broken and nearly extinguiſhed, what it had moſt to dread, a liberal ſpirit of enquiry: To conceal its own oppoſition to the model upon which it profeſſed to form itſelf, it had art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully withdrawn the ſacred ſcriptures from common view: It had cloſely interwoven itſelf with the conſtitution of ſtates and kingdoms; and under a pretence of aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013228_0005_0F90430FC3C95470"/>had ſtrangely gained an aſcendancy over the civil power, for which it ſoon plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a divine authority. While therefore we may juſtly wonder that ſo much of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in this enlightened age, we are at the ſame time obliged to acknowledge and adore a particular interpoſition of divine providence, in the reſcue of ſo many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, from a ſpecies of falſe religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the deep poſſeſſion it takes of the minds of thoſe who have once been devoted to it.</p>
            <p>POPERY, like other oppreſſive powers, grew too confident of its own ſtrength, and preſumed too much upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſubmiſſive temper of thoſe whom it had ſubjected. Having long practiſed, with amazing ſucceſs, upon the credulity and weakneſs of mankind, it at length puſhed the experiment too far. Contrary to that ſpirit of diſſimulation and ſubtilty by which it had been generally guided, it neglected to varniſh its avarice, and venal diſpenſations for licentiouſneſs, with the colour of prudence and ſobriety. The ſale of indulgences at the beginning of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, was conducted in a manner that ſhocked the groſſeſt underſtanding, and offended the conſciences even of thoſe who had implicitly reſigned them to the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013228_0006_0F90431078D11EC8"/>direction of the church, and had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained very rigid ſentiments of morality.</p>
            <p>THIS rouſed the great ſpirit of <hi>Luther,</hi> and prepared the minds of men to liſten to his diſcourſes, and adopt his free and noble ſentiments, as they gradually open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enlarged themſelves.</p>
            <p>HAPPILY for the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs, the tenth <hi>Leo,</hi> though care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the reputation of the church for ſanctity and morals, was a friend and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of the liberal arts. Protected and ſoſtered by him, they were eagerly ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reformers, and employed by them with happy advantage in effecting one of the moſt important and glorious revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions the Chriſtian church ever ſaw. The human mind, awakened from its lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and engaged in the purſuit of religious truth, felt an unuſual pleaſure in the free exertion of its own faculties, and puſhed its enquiries from one ſubject to another with ſurpriſing avidity and ſucceſs. The ſcriptures being laid open, and the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them greatly aided by the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> learning, it ſoon appeared how contrary the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing doctrines of <hi>Popery</hi> were, to thoſe delivered by Chriſt and his apoſtles; and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013228_0007_0F90431161ADF2C0"/>how exactly the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that had ſo long been revered as <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> reſembled that apoſtate and idolatrous, that ſubtil and fraudful, that tyrannical and perſecuting power, predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our text, and in other paſſages of the new-teſtament.</p>
            <p>WITH this reſemblance, the reformers and their followers were greatly ſtruck, and finding the event ſo plainly correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding to the prophecy, not only their faith was hereby confirmed in the ſacred writings, as a revelation from him <hi>who alone declareth the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done;</hi> but their confidence in the truth and goodneſs of their cauſe was ſtrengthened, and their honeſt zeal and ambition enlivened, to ſeparate themſelves from a religious community that had ſo groſsly departed from the doctrine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> to oppoſe its corruptions with the <hi>armor of light;</hi> and to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as inſtruments in the hand of divine providence, of delivering mankind from a ſyſtem of falſe religion, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic ſpirit itſelf had deſcribed and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated as a <hi>child of perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON this ground they boldly withſtood the exorbitant and impious demands of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013228_0008_0F9043142A0F1AE8"/>the chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which had long been regarded as the centre of unity, and infallible in its dictates: Upon this ground they ſupported themſelves againſt the charge of ſciſm, a charge which in that day carried a dreadful ſound to the ears of men, and which the papal power had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed every artifice, every ſpecies of perſecution and cruelty, to render for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.</p>
            <p>THE argument was indeed popular, and had great effect: The ſound of <hi>antichriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> muſt have heightened an abhorrence of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the reformers did not invent it; they found it prepared for them by the ſpirit of truth; and they urged it with a manly boldneſs and energy, for which they will long be honoured in the church of God. That it was not the extravagance of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, not the artifice of a party heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by controverſy, and exaſperated by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, to ſupport its own cauſe, but the reſult of a ſober, though free enquiry into the ſacred writings, has been confirmed by the judgment of the moſt learned and temperate expoſitors from that day to the preſent; and muſt be evident to every one who impartially conſiders what theſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have delivered to us upon this point,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013228_0009_0F904314550C8CC0"/>and eſpecially the paſſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which I have now read. A ſubject that very properly comes under our preſent conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as it has been particularly pointed out by the honourable founder of this Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; who, in an inſtitution that will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his name to poſterity as a warm and generous friend to proteſtant piety, and the rights of conſcience, has expreſſed his will, that the buſineſs of the third diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion ſhould be <q>for the detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and expoſing the idolatry of the Romiſh church; their tyranny, uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fatal errors, abominable ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other crying wickedneſſes in their high places; and finally, to prove that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> that MAN OF SIN, that apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate church, ſpoken of in the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>No one will aſſert that propheſy, or a prediction of things to come, which depend upon what are to us contingencies, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. To man indeed, futurity is veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at beſt, the object of uncertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; but to the eye of God <hi>all things are naked and open.</hi> He may then, in what manner, and to what degree he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, foretell future events. Nor is there in reaſon, any preſumption againſt his doing
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013228_0010_0F904315A4F0A270"/>this, upon ſpecial occaſions, and for ſome important purpoſe. And when he does it, in a manner plainly beyond all human fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and in a great compaſs and variety of connected inſtances, ſuch a ſcheme of prophecy, accompliſhed, authenticates it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and carries, in the very face of it, the moſt genuine and convincing mark of its divine original and authority.</p>
            <p>BE it allowed, that a bold conjecture may be fortunate, and the event ſometimes ſurpriſingly anſwer what was foretold at random, or upon the principles of human probability, or ſome pretended occult art. Let the prediction of <hi>Vettius Valens,</hi> the augur,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>From the twelve vultures that appeared to <hi>Romulus, Valens</hi> foretold that the ſovereignty of <hi>Rome</hi> would laſt twelve hundred years.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Hurd</hi> cites another prediction, reſpecting what he calls <hi>a ſtill more important ſubject,</hi> in which every American is particularly intereſted. "A Poet, ſays he, in the idea of paganiſm, was a Prophet too. And <hi>Seneca</hi> hath left us in proof of the inſpiration to which, in his double capacity, he might pretend, the following Oracle,</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>—Venient annis</l>
                     <l>Secula ſeris, quibus Occanus</l>
                     <l>Vincula Rerum laxet, et ingens</l>
                     <l>Pateat Tellus, Typhiſque novos</l>
                     <l>Detegat Orbes; nec ſit Terris</l>
                     <l>Ultima Thule.</l>
                  </lg>

                     <q>This prediction was made in the reign of <hi>Nero;</hi> and for more than fourteen hundred years, might only paſs for one of thoſe ſallies of imagination, in which poetry ſo much delights. But when at length, in the cloſe of the fifteenth century, the diſcoveries of <hi>Columbus</hi> had realized this viſion; when that enterprizing navigator had forced the barriers of the vaſt atlantic ocean; had <hi>looſened</hi> what the Poet calls <hi>the chain of things;</hi> and in theſe later ages, as was expreſsly ſignified, had ſet at liberty an immenſe continent, ſhut up before in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ſeas from the commerce and acquaintance of our world: When this event I ſay, ſo important and ſo unexpected came to paſs, it might almoſt ſurpriſe one into a belief, that the prediction was ſomething more than a poetical fancy; and that heaven had indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to one favoured <hi>Spaniard,</hi> what it had decreed, in due time, to accompliſh by another.</q>

               <hi>Roman</hi> empire, be cited as an example. Should we grant that this was as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its accompliſhment as it is ſaid to have been, and that more of the like kind might be produced; yet, what ſober man can ſuppoſe, that a few ſuch unconnected inſtances, reſpecting ſeparate and unrelated events, in diſtant ages, can vie with or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the credit and authoirty of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013228_0012_0F9043167986EDC0"/>ſyſtem of prophecy? A ſyſtem vaſtly extenſive, and conſiſting of a great variety of parts, all cloſely combined in tendency and deſign; ſurpriſingly various, and yet minutely particular in the events it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells, which do all gravitate, ſo to ſpeak, to one common centre: A prophetic ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, that has been gradually accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the infancy of the world; that is fulſilling more and more every day, and increaſing the evidence of its own divine original, and will do ſo, till <hi>the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT has been inſinuated, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof, but in direct oppoſition to the teſtimony of all hiſtory, that ſome ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture predictions were framed after the events had happened, and are only hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, antedated and tranſmuted by pious fraud into the ſhape of prophecies. But this cannot be pretended in the inſtance we are now conſidering. For as the ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions reſpecting Jeſus Chriſt were in the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> his greateſt enemies, who preſerved with religious care and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, what has long ſince become the monument of their own blindneſs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate infidelity; ſo the prophecies of the new-teſtament, concerning the apoſtacy of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have been for many
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013228_0013_0F904317DA7456C0"/>ages in the cuſtody of that church (a very ſtrict cuſtody indeed) and with all their policy, ſo infatuated have they been, as that with theſe predictions in their hands, the divine authority of which they zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly maintain, they have yet been gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fulfilling them, and proving their own eccleſiaſtical polity, to be that very <hi>myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of iniquity</hi> there deſcribed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>LET it be further obſerved, that though we eſteem the argument from prophecy, to be ſolid and convincing, and a good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional one, againſt the church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet it is only one, among many; and not ſo eſſential to the Proteſtant cauſe, as that upon ſuppoſition it ſhould fail, and be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up, that cauſe muſt fall with it. The main arguments againſt the corruptions of Popery, ariſe from their own intrinſic abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and direct oppoſition to the firſt noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the human mind in a religious enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; from the unprophetic and didactic part of holy writ; from the plain doctrines and precepts of Jeſus Chriſt; and from the genius and ſpirit with which the whole goſpel is animated and diſtinguiſhed. Not only doth ſcripture condemn, but reaſon and common ſenſe reclaim, againſt the diſtinguiſhing tenets and practices of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013228_0014_0F904317FB292C10"/>church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and againſt that arrogant and lordly, that intolerant and cruel, that deluſive and worldly ſpirit, that guides her deciſions, directs her conduct, and breathes through the whole pompous exterior of her religious offices and rites. So that we have enough to ſatisfy us, without recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to prophecy, that Popery is in the true and proper ſenſe, <hi>antichriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET, when we behold with wonder this ſyſtem of falſhood and iniquity, and that divine providence ſhould permit it to lift its head ſo high, and to obtain ſo wide and laſting an eſtabliſhment, in the viſible kingdom of God; does it not relieve our minds, and ſupport our conſtancy to the truth, to conſider, that all this was not unforeſeen by the true head of the church; that it was permitted by him for wiſe and holy purpoſes; that it was foretold, and the church early warned of it by the ſpirit of truth; and that the ſame ſpirit hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us, this grand deluſion ſhall in due time paſs away, and like the "baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, leave not a wreck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind."</p>
            <p>I AM aware indeed, that in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of learned authors, who conſider the

A particular account of the ground of this diſſent, on the one ſide, and what has been offered on the other, by the much larger number of equally great and unbiaſſed men, cannot be expected in a ſingle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe<note n="†" place="bottom">See, Mede, Poole, Whithy, Benſon, Biſhop, Newton, Hurd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>GROTIUS, ſuppoſes this prophecy to refer to the time preceding the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> was the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor <hi>Caligula:</hi> And not being able to make out the reſemblance, between this Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and the ſubſequent part of the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is obliged to introduce <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> as that wicked one who was to come <hi>with ſigns and lying wonders.</hi> But <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> whoſe parts and learning are every where confeſſed, carried his candor to an exceſs. He was deeply engaged in a plan, which almoſt every one but himſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as vain and impracticable, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating the difference between the Proteſtant and Popiſh communion: His
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013228_0016_0F904319838513C8"/>hopes, however, upon this point, were for a good reaſon, flattered by ſome of the moſt reſpectable perſonages on the papal ſide. This might give a biaſs even to the mind of ſo great a man; and knowing that nothing was more offenſive to the Pope and his adherents, than the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the propheices concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> to the papal chair, he might be led to employ his abilities to find out another meaning. However this may be, it ſhews the ſoundneſs of the common interpretation of this paſſage, that even ſuch abilities could oppoſe it with no greater advantage. For it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed on all hands, that <hi>Grotius</hi> never fell ſo much below himſelf as upon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The Romaniſts themſelves have tacitly acknowledged this, of whom it has been obſerved, that while they have been fond of his name in this diſpute, they have never boaſted of the ſtrength or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his arguments. In the opinion of the beſt chronologiſts, the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he contends for, was prior to the prophecy; for <hi>Caligula</hi> died before St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this epiſtle.</p>
            <p>DR. <hi>Hammond,</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſtics</hi> to be here deſcribed. Among the learned refuters of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013228_0017_0F90431A444E0530"/>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf is one; and <hi>Le'Clerc,</hi> another; whoſe opinion is, that the apoſtacy predicted in this paſſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was the revolt of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that <hi>Simon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gioras,</hi> who headed the revolt, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his rebellious followers, was the <hi>Man of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE defenders of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> are divided in their opinion upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Some interpret it of <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, or particular Emperors. Some plainly diſcern the grand impoſtor <hi>Mahomet</hi> in this prophetic paſſage, and aſſert it refers to him alone; of which opinion there are writers, not of their own communion. Others, return the weapons of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants upon themſelves, and affirm with much reſentment and conſidence, though little plauſibility, and leſs truth, that the northern hereſy, as they call the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the apoſtacy foretold by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and the chief promoters of it, the <hi>Man of Sin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> on this ſubject the authors before referred to, and particularly the Biſhop Newton, and Dr. Benſon.</note> But the greater part of the Romiſh writers, ſenſible of the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of other interpretations in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their cauſe, do frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Antichriſt is here deſcribed, the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013228_0018_0F8FB4EB4CDE3468"/>grand oppoſer of Chriſt and his religion. But Antichriſt, ſay they, is a ſingle perſon, not a combination or ſucceſſion of perſons; his continuance upon earth will be very ſhort: Adopting upon this occaſion the prophetic period, <hi>a time, and times, and half a time,</hi> and taking it lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, they limit the duration of Antichriſt to three years and an half. He will be revealed, they affirm, ſome time before the coming of our Lord at the laſt day; when the church will ſeed the ſad effects of his ſubtilty and power; but, in their opinion, he has never yet made his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the world.</p>
            <p>This deſerves particular attention. It is an important confeſſion from an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; not from a ſingle writer upon this ſubject, but the beſt popiſh Doctors. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> himſelf, in his diſſertation upon Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, authoriſes us to aſſert this. They own then, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> are one and the ſame; they own that nothing has yet appeared in the world to fulfil the prophecies concerning this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous power. Is not this to confeſs, that all the expoſitors we have now mentioned, and others who have endeavoured to prove, that <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, or
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013228_0019_0F8FB4EC089DDF20"/>
               <hi>Mahomet,</hi> were ſolely intended by theſe predictions, are quite miſtaken, ſince An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt has never yet been ſeen? Strange indeed, that ſo remarkable a power as the myſtery of of iniquity is repreſented to be in the ſacred writings, and which the Apoſtle expreſsly tells us began to work in his own day, ſhould not in the courſe of ſeventeen hundred years, have grown to ſuch a ſize as to be viſible ſomewhere! Yet ſo it is, according to the beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters on the papal ſide; and if Antichriſt is not to be found in the chair of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he is no where to be found; but, like the imaginary Meſſiah of the modern <hi>Jews,</hi> is ſtill to come.</p>
            <p>How then, you may perhaps ſay, ſhall we diſtinguiſh truth from error upon ſuch a ſubject, and amidſt ſo many various and contradictory opinions of thoſe who have employed much time, and no ſmall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in theſe reſearches? But let us not be diſcouraged: Difficulties excite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and call forth the exertion of the human mind; and attention to ſo noble a ſubject as the ſacred writings will ever be well repaid. There is a portion of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity intermingled with the light of ſcripture prophecies, before their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, and even after this is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013228_0020_0F90431BB4742190"/>advanced. We ourſelves are able to aſſign ſome good reaſons for this; and there may be more, with which we are not acquainted. Even the doctrinal part of ſcripture is not, in all its branches, ſo plain, but that wiſe and good men have differed in their explanations of it; and can we wonder that this ſhould take place with reſpect to the prophetic! If we do not drop our attention to the former up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this account, why ſhould we to the latter. Are not the deciſions of mere reaſon, in different perſons, various and often oppoſite upon the ſame ſubject? Muſt we therefore turn ſceptics? Time matures our obſervations and reaſoning upon common ſubjects, and give us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of <hi>natural</hi> knowledge: Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our <hi>religious</hi> enquiries with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge more important: Time illuminates what was dark, and explains what was myſterious in the prophecies of holy writ. The ſucceſſive labours of the learned and inquiſitive, upon this, as upon all other ſubjects, however they may differ in their proceſs and concluſions, have jointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to enlarge the human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>DR. <hi>Whitby,</hi> whom I have not yet mentioned, ſo far agrees with <hi>Le'Clerc,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:013228_0021_0F90431BEA46B160"/>as to ſuppoſe this apoſtacy, or <hi>falling away,</hi> to intend the rebellion of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> government; but then he includes in it alſo, the apoſtacy of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jewiſh converts, from the chriſtian faith; and the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> according to his explanation, is the body of the Jewiſh nation, <hi>the man of diſobedience, who will not ſubmit to law and government.</hi> He allows, however, this and other characters here given, to refer in part to the papal apoſtacy and uſurpation. "I grant, ſays he, it may in a ſecondary ſenſe, be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the papal Antichriſt or <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and may be ſignally fulfilled in him, he being the ſucceſſor to the apoſtate Jewiſh church, to whom theſe characters agree as well as to her."</p>
            <p>THIS leads me to obſerve, that there is doubtleſs, a double ſenſe in many ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prophecies. By this double ſenſe, I do not mean a ſtudied and deceitful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in the expreſſion, on purpoſe to ſecure the credit of the prediction, on which ſide ſo ever the event may fall.</p>
            <p>OF this kind was the anſwer of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle at <hi>Delphos</hi> to <hi>Craeſus:</hi> To <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> it was the ſame: So compleat was the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity, that one would heſitate in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013228_0022_0F8FB4ECB93CCD30"/>which was the moſt natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the words, whether the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſhould vanquiſh him, or he ſhould vanquiſh the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH was the baſe duplicity of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pagan oracles, which ſome, even of their own writers have not failed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, and expoſe. But not an inſtance of this kind is to be found in the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſcripture. They do not indeed ſpeak of ſingle and unrelated events; they are a regular ſyſtem, whoſe parts relate to one another, and to one grand object; and when they predict an event, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do it in language that plainly riſes above it, and looks further, and is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found to be more fully accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſubſequent one, ſimilar indeed to the firſt, but perhaps much more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. This is what I intend by a double ſenſe: More events than one may correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond to, and be intended by, the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; events that have ſome general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to each other, and refer to one grand deſign, though they may differ in ſome circumſtances, and happen in diſtant ages.</p>
            <p>THIS is undoubtedly true of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of holy writ; and ſo far is it from
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013228_0023_0F90431CB26A95F0"/>diminiſhing, that it rather increaſes their luſtre and authority. They appear more plainly from this circumſtance to be a plan of prophecy not to be counterfeited; and to proceed from that divine foreſight, to which all events in all ages, are at once open. This was the opinion of Lord <hi>Bacon.</hi> "In ſorting the prophecies of ſcripture with their events, we muſt allow for that latitude which is agreeable and familiar to divine prophecies, being of the nature of their author, with whom <hi>a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years are but as one day:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not fulfilled punctually at once, but have ſpringing and germinant accompliſhment throughout many ages, though the height or fullneſs of them may refer to ſome one age." Thus ſpeaks, that great man.</p>
            <p>THERE is a general analogy that runs through the whole providence and moral government of <hi>God.</hi> One thing is often by its very nature the figure and type of another. The diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ruder draught of that which the goſpel has eſtabliſhed; and the ſtate of the Jewiſh, preluded in many circumſtances that of the Chriſtian church. And though the ancient prophecies might be partly fulfilled in that age, yet we cannot doubt that they
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013228_0024_0F90431D3A2FA528"/>looked further, and have been more fully accompliſhed under the goſpel. In like manner, there is an analogy between the firſt and ſucceeding ages of the chriſtian church; and though the predictions of our Saviour and his apoſtles might have a firſt reſpect to events, in their own day, or not very diſtant from it, yet we have the beſt reaſon to conclude, that in many parts of them, they regarded diſtant ages, and will not have their full and abſolute completion till <hi>the time of the reſtitution of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON this principle, may we not in ſome meaſure, reconcile the opinions of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtant authors before mentioned, and even ſome of the Romiſh, with the truth of ſcripture prophecy, and at the ſame time maintain the concluſion of by far the greater part of our own writers, that the papal Antichriſt is ultimately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and that no other power fully anſwers to all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in this prophetic deſcription.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> expreſsly tells us, that there are <hi>many Antichriſts.</hi> Theſe are of different forms and ſizes, and may appear in different ages, though all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their oppoſition to Jeſus Chriſt and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013228_0025_0F8FB4EE19BA0F40"/>his kingdom. A number of them then may be ſo conſiderable, as to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſcripture prophecy, and pointed out before hand by the ſpirit of truth in this and other predictions, for the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſupport of the faithful in different periods, though there may be one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Antichriſt, chiefly and ultimately intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe predictions, in which they do all evidently center and unite.</p>
            <p>WE may grant then, that the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> he that oppoſeth himſelf, and was in due time to be conſumed and deſtroyed, does not excluſively intend the papal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but alſo other enemies to chriſtianity,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"There is, ſays a late learned and judicious writer, a complex kind of prophecy, <hi>viz.</hi> when future perſons and things in their natural characters and actions, are made emblems of perſons and things more remote than themſelves, and are predicted with this very view, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them. In this certainly there is nothing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous. Known unto God are all the actions of men from the beginning. Every event that comes to paſs is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his providence. From the characters and actions therefore of perſons, who he knew would come upon the ſtage, he might eaſily chooſe thoſe which in their nature and circumſtances, were beſt adapted to be emblematical repreſentations of the future perſons and events to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in more diſtant periods: And having fixed upon ſuch as he ſaw to be proper for that end, it was every way agreeable to his wiſdom to foretel them, in order that he might raiſe and keep up among mankind, an expectation of the more diſtant greater events. Indeed this method of prophecy is ſo far from being abſurd, that nothing can be conceived better adapted to diſplay the perfections of God. For it gives us the grandeſt, moſt magnificent, and moſt affecting idea of the power and fore-knowledge of God, and of the extent of his providence, whereby the world is governed."</p>
                  <p>"Of this kind of prophecy we have an example 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii. 12. In its firſt meaning, this prophecy evidently refers to <hi>Solomon.</hi> Nevertheleſs, that it had a ſecond meaning, referring to more diſtant perſons, is equally plain. The different paſſages of the prophecy muſt be applied, in their higheſt ſenſes, to the different perſons ſpoken of, according to the peculiar nature of each. Some, of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his ordinary deſcendents; others, of the Meſſiah only; and of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as his type."</p>

               <hi>Gods</hi> in the ſenſe that civil rulers are ſo called in the ſacred writings. But the power and polity of this nation were ſoon after, according to ſcripture predictions, ſignally broken, by the coming of the Lord Jeſus, to execute his judgments upon them.</p>
            <p>SIMON MAGUS was a <hi>Man of Sin;</hi> he came with <hi>ſigns and lying wonders;</hi> but with other ſeducers, and oppoſers of the goſpel, who accompanied, or ſoon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he has long ſince paſſed away.</p>
            <p>THE Pagan Emperors employed their power to deſtroy the religion of Jeſus in its infancy, and ſeverely oppreſſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted his followers: But the goſpel, as had been foretold, prevailed; and at length the Empire, with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at its head, aſſumed the profeſſion of chriſtianity. This was one remarkable coming of the ſon of man, though clouded by the internal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the church.</p>
            <p>MAHOMET, was a <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> a falſe prophet; who came with <hi>deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and induced many <hi>to believe a lie;</hi> a great and ſucceſsful oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the goſpel by the ſword. His ſeat the Turkiſh Empire, has for a long time,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013228_0028_0F904321CC39CA90"/>according to ſcripture predictions, been upon the decline. It was once the terror of all <hi>Europe;</hi> it can now ſcarcely ſupport itſelf againſt the attack of a ſingle Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian power.</p>
            <p>HOW far we may allow this prophetic deſcription of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to refer to theſe perſons, and events, I leave, after what has been ſaid, to the deciſion of others: My principal deſign being to ſhew, that none of them do fully anſwer and abſolve this prophecy; while in the Papal Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, all the characters ſurpriſingly center and unite.</p>
            <p>THESE characters are, apoſtacy; a <hi>Man of Sin</hi> who <hi>ſitteth in the temple of God;</hi> or in the church; who at the ſame time <hi>oppoſeth himſelf</hi> to Chriſt and his kingdom; who <hi>exalteth himſelf above all that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God,</hi> all civil rulers; who <hi>ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he is God,</hi> impiouſly aſſuming the power and authoriry of the Almighty: whoſe coming is <hi>after the working of Satan;</hi> with cruelty, ſubtilty, and unrighteous deceivings; <hi>with lying wonders</hi> and falſe miracles. The time alſo of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though not particularly aſcertained, is in general pointed out by ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:013228_0029_0F8FB4EE2DA97FB8"/>
SOME of theſe characters do not agree to the body of the Jewiſh nation. They did not apoſtatize from chriſtianity, for they never aſſumed that profeſſion: Thoſe who fell away from the goſpel, had no leader, and were abſorbed in the much greater part of the nation, to which they returned. <hi>Simon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gioras</hi> was never exalted above the Emperor, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his captive. Neither he, nor the High Prieſt, nor the Sanhedrim, much leſs the body of the nation, ever ſat in the temple, and received homage <hi>as God;</hi> for the <hi>Jews</hi> in that age, with all their impieties and vices, had the greateſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of idolatry, and could not endure any approaches to it. Theſe important circumſtances evidence, that the Jewiſh nation does not afford a compleat fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this prophecy.</p>
            <p>NEITHER do <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſtics,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Whithy</hi> has largely and fully proved. The Apoſtle declares, in the beginning of this chapter, <hi>that the day of Chriſt was not at hand:</hi> But if by this day be principally meant, the day in which he was to come for the deſtruction of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s hypotheſis ſuppoſes, it was, contrary to the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle, near at hand; for
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013228_0030_0F90432283B7EB68"/>
               <hi>Simon</hi> periſhed within four years after the writing of this epiſtle; and ſixteen years before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He never ſat, <hi>ſhewing himſelf as God,</hi> either in the Jewiſh temple, or the Chriſtian church. Nor did the ſect of the <hi>Gnoſtics</hi> fall with this their ſuppoſed leader; nor indeed with the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the ruin of their temple and City; for it prevailed moſt after both theſe events.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, though inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to Jeſus and his religion, do not fully anſwer to this deſcription of the <hi>Man of Sin.</hi> They never apoſtatized either from the Jewiſh or Chriſtian faith: They <hi>were revealed</hi> before the writing of this epiſtle: Their power and authority, and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the goſpel, was open and known to all the world; whereas the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> though he <hi>already began to work,</hi> yet did not appear, but was to be <hi>revealed</hi> in ſome future time. They did not pretend to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of working miracles; nor was their chair or ſeat <hi>in the temple of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAHOMET was no apoſtate; for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſſed either the religion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He never ſat <hi>in the temple of God;</hi> for though he changed many
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013228_0031_0F9043233B6E8210"/>Chriſtian churches into <hi>Moſques;</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe edifices, filled with Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan zealots, could not be called after ſuch a change, in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, the temple or the church of God: Nor did this deceiver ever pretend to eſtabliſh his authority by miracles. This is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> aſſures us, in the Alcoran itſelf, and by the beſt interpreters of it.</p>
            <p>As to the recrimination of the Papal writers againſt the Proteſtants upon this point; in order to ſhew the juſtice of it, they muſt firſt prove that the reformed churches have a <hi>Man of Sin</hi> at their head, to whoſe ſupremacy they pay an unlimited ſubmiſſion; that he ſitteth in ſome capital temple <hi>as God;</hi> and that his cauſe has been promoted by pretended miracles: And finally, to prove the reformation an apoſtacy, they muſt overthrow all the arguments brought by the reformed againſt the diſtinguiſhing dogmas and rites of their own church; and evidence, that theſe are ſupported by the authority of the new-teſtament. But this would be a much greater miracle, than with all their pretenſions, they have ever yet been able to perform.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:013228_0032_0F904323F9AD5D98"/>
HAVING thus ſhewn, that none of theſe perſons and events do fully anſwer to this prophecy; though in ſeveral of them there is ſome general and ſtrong reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of it; if now we can prove that all its characters are to be found in the Papal power, it muſt ſatisfy us, that this power was ultimately, and principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, let it be obſerved, that the Apoſtle's deſign in the begining of this epiſtle, is to ſhew, that <hi>the day of Chriſt,</hi> by which he plainly means, as has been abundantly proved by expoſitors, the final judgment, <hi>was not at hand,</hi> and ſhould <hi>not come, except there come a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away firſt; and that Man of Sin be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</hi> By which he ſtrongly intimates, that the apoſtacy he principally meant ſhould be extended to a diſtant time, and far beyond the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS apoſtacy is evidently a religious one; not a falling away from government, but from the purity of faith and worſhip: It was to be effected by <hi>ſtrong deluſions,</hi> and the <hi>deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs;</hi> through which thoſe who <hi>had not the love of the truth,</hi> ſhould be induced to <hi>believe a lie that they might be damned; having
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013228_0033_0F8FB4EF064DB178"/>had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and been fond of the deception.</p>
            <p>THE principal character in it; the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to whom the prophecy chiefly refers, is the <hi>Man of Sin:</hi> A ſtrong expreſſion, indicating not only one who is very wicked himſelf, but eminently induces others to act wickedly. By this <hi>Man,</hi> in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, the abſolute monarchy in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is well deſcribed; though we do not ſuppoſe any particular Pope is intended, but the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſucceſſion. It gives us a general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that order of men, and of thoſe who have had the principal ſhare in their eccleſiaſtical adminiſtration; the chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters and defenders of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>THAT this application, ſevere as it may ſeem to be, is not unjuſt, all hiſtory atteſts. No man can read <hi>Platina</hi>'s lives of the Popes, and <hi>Bowers</hi>'s larger and more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern hiſtory, without being ſhocked at the impieties, the perfidy, and unbounded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries of thoſe who have ſat in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s chair; and without acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that theſe, if any upon earth, were <hi>Men of Sin.</hi> Nor can we take even a curſory view of the Papal ſyſtem of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; its direct oppoſition to the honour
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013228_0034_0F904324B9CB1310"/>of God and the one mediator; its groſs ſuperſtition and idolatries; its tendency to debaſe and enſlave the human mind; the indulgence it grants to vice in every form; and the pleas it allows for crimes, at which the untutored breaſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revolts; without acknowledging, that the contrivers of ſuch a ſyſtem, with the goſpel in their hands, muſt have had an heart, to an uncommon degree inſenſible and depraved.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER character is, <hi>he oppoſeth:</hi> He is an adverſary to Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdom. This directly anſwers to the name <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and indicates the head of the Romiſh church to be the principal <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> ſpoken of by St. <hi>John;</hi> which may ſignify, both one who places himſelf in the room of Chriſt, and acts in oppoſition to him. The Pope calls himſelf the vicar of Chriſt; the only viſible head of the church; and blaſphemouſly arrogates to himſelf the infallibility and ſupremacy of our aſcended Lord. Under the pretence of ſerving him, he ſteps into his place; and there corrupts the ſimplicity, defiles the purity, and oppoſes the true power and ſpirit of his religion. This <hi>Son of perdition,</hi> the very phraſe by which our Lord deſcribes <hi>Judas,</hi> betrays his maſter
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013228_0035_0F9043261C330A38"/>with a kiſs, and ſells him for ſilver; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing his doctrine and worſhip for the <hi>gain of unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE oppoſes with fierceneſs, as well as ſubtilty and deceit. <hi>He maketh war with Saints,</hi> and proves himſelf to be that cruel and oppreſſive power, predicted by <hi>Daniel,</hi> and afterwards in the revelations of St. <hi>John,</hi> which <hi>hath horns like a Lamb,</hi> but at the ſame time, <hi>ſpeaketh like a Dragon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How mild his appearance, how gentle his language, upon ſome occaſions! But how dreadful his power! How relentleſs his cruelty! Speak, ye holy ſouls, for you can tell! Ye martyrs, and confeſſors! Who, becauſe you would not violate your conſciences by ſubmitting to his unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous impoſitions, and renouncing the <hi>truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> have loſt your eſtates; been torn from your tendereſt connections; have languiſhed in dungeons, have groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the wreck, and expired in flames. Speak, ye who ſuffered in <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Marian days!</hi> Speak, ye thouſands, ye many thouſands, that fell at once in the maſſacres of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Ireland!</hi> Speak, ye <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> who fell in ſtill greater numbers, and more varied forms of torture! Your blood indeed is
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013228_0036_0F904326423283E8"/>vocal, <hi>it crieth from the ground:</hi> Though art and falſhood have been employed, to diſguiſe the facts, and to ſtifle the voice; it pierces through all, and rings in the ears of men, the unparalleled cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of that myſtical woman, that <hi>mother of abominations,</hi> the church of <hi>Rome; drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN vain does ſhe attempt to conceal, or palliate this part of her odious character: The ſtain is indelible. To her we may apply the words of the prophet; <hi>though thou waſh thee with nitre, and take thee much ſoap, yet is thine iniquity marked before me, ſaith the Lord God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jerm. ii. 22.</note>.</p>
            <p>IT can be demonſtrated from hiſtory that ſhe has ſhed ten times more chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian blood, by her holy wars, her cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zades, her aſſaſſinations, and numberleſs perſecutions, than all the pagan Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors united. The inhumanity of her court of inquiſition is not to be equalled, among the moſt barbarous nations, nor by any other court, ever erected by the greateſt tyrant.</p>
            <p>WHAT an idea does it give us of the deteſtable cruelty of the ſons of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:013228_0037_0F8FB4EFAB6E8F90"/>to be told, that an <hi>American</hi> ſavage, ready to expire under the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> aſked a prieſt, who offered to prepare him for Heaven, whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would dwell there: Being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured they would; then, ſaid he, "let me go to another place." It was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of nature: He knew he could not be happy with ſuch aſſociates. Much the ſame idea of chriſtianity was given to the pagan <hi>Saxons. Charles</hi> the great, under the influence of the court of <hi>Rome, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur St. Faux</hi> ſays, having conquered them, commanded them to abſtain from meat in Lent, and to be baptized, under pain of death. In this manner was the Prince of peace firſt revealed to them; and the poor <hi>Saxons</hi> were driven to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian baptiſm, from the terror of being baptized in their own blood<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Popiſh writers aſſure us, that they are now grown much more mild and moderate, and have none of the ferocity and cruelty which was the temper of former times, and that they condemn perſecution for a mere diverſity of religious ſentiments. They may be ſo, and they muſt be fools who believe them. It is probable enough, that amongſt their Laity there are ſeveral who diſlike all ſanguinary methods of ſupporting their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but it is becauſe they do not fully underſtand their own eccleſiaſtical ſyſtem, into the very nature of which perſecution is ſo cloſely woven, that nothing can ſeparate it. Upon blood it was built, and by blood it muſt be ſupported. Toleration and liberty of conſcience would infallibly undermine and deſtroy it. In this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent century, and in our own times, there have been cruel examples of Popiſh intoleration and perſecution; ſufficient to warn us what we are to expect from them.</q>

THE next character of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> is, <hi>he exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped.</hi> Who does not immediately confeſs the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in this deſcription? He exalteth himſelf, not only above all paſtors, all eccleſiaſtical officers and dignitaries, but above all civil rulers, who are called Gods; above all Kings and Emperors. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt, held the ſtyrup of his horſe, and was chid for holding it on the wrong ſide. Another Emperor, <hi>Henry</hi> IVth, waited three days at the gates of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VIIth, to obtain an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Frederick,</hi> fell proſtrate in St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s church at <hi>Venice,</hi> before <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> III, in preſence of the people; while the humble Biſhop, placing his foot upon his neck, uttered that paſſage of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt; <hi>thou ſhald tread upon the lion and the adder; the young lion and the dragon ſhalt thou trample under foot.</hi> The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Rome</hi> has depoſed Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; abſolved their ſubjects from all allegiance to them; and authoritatively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their taking arms againſt them.</p>
            <p>This has not only been done by ſome who have filled the pontifical chair, but is
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013228_0039_0F904329CBF57278"/>agreeable to one of the profeſſed principles of the Romiſh church. It is to be ſeen in their <hi>decrees,</hi> of at leaſt equal venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and authority among them, with the Bible itſelf; <q>That all Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors ought to be ſubject to the Pope; that he is placed by the Lord over na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and kingdoms; not ſome only, but <hi>all:</hi> That whatſoever the <hi>Roman</hi> church ordaineth, muſt be obſerved by <hi>all,</hi> without control, and everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that it is of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, that every human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be ſubject to the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Accordingly, <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth declared, that by his undoubted ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority to the Emperor, and by the fulneſs of power Chriſt had given him in the perſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul all his proceedings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle adds, <hi>So that he as God, ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he is God.</hi> The temple of God, ſignifies, in prophetic language, the church of God; and as the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> was to appear after the abrogation of the Jewiſh law, it is plainly intimated here, that he was to be found in the chriſtian church; that by means of his rank and influence in this church, he was to riſe to his exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013228_0040_0F90432B248CE730"/>power; and that it would be held and adminiſtred in an eccleſiaſtical form. He is then a profeſſed chriſtian: The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he claims is ſpiritual; and in the church he receives the homage of a God.</p>
            <p>WHAT can give us a more exact idea of the ſovereign Pontiff at <hi>Rome?</hi> When he is elected, he is ſeated on the high al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s church, the very place of the idolized hoſt, which the Papiſts ſay, is Chriſt himſelf: The people proſtrate themſelves before him, and implore his favour and bleſſing. They addreſs him, "Our Lord God the Pope." He extends his ſinger, and makes a motion with his hand, and their ſins are all forgiven. Is not this like the feigned <hi>Jupiter,</hi> on old <hi>Olympus?</hi> Is not this to <hi>ſit in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFTERWARDS he ſovereignly controls every thing in religion. He exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above God himſelf; he makes void the law of God by vain traditions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious eſtabliſhments of his own. He holds back from the people the ſcriptures of God, and places in their room his own decrees. He forgives ſins upon terms di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to thoſe upon which God hath declared them to be forgiven; and allows vice to be juſtified by a caſuiſtry,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013228_0041_0F90432C70572EE0"/>of which even a pagan would be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>THE coming of the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> is ſaid by the Apoſtle to be <hi>after the working of Satan.</hi> This I know is generally taken to refer to the <hi>ſigns and lying wonders,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned immediately after. But does it not appear natural to ſuppoſe, that <hi>this coming after the working of Satan,</hi> may intend, more generally, after the <hi>model</hi> of Satan, <hi>the God of this world,</hi> in his own kingdom; or among the pagans, where he had ſo great an influence; and that it contains a ſtrong intimation that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt religion introduced and eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> ſhould bear a ſtrong reſemblance to that which was formerly found in the kingdom of darkneſs? That this is true, no one who takes a fair and impartial view of both, can doubt. So that however really chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> once was, it has for many ages ſo far returned to an imitation of its former pagan ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and ſuperſtitions, that chriſtianity ſeems to be almoſt covered and buried under them.</p>
            <p>IN place of the worſhip of the one God and Father of all, their prayers and vows are chiefly directed to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other ſaints. The canonizaton of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013228_0042_0F90432D002DEDD0"/>theſe ſaints ſtrongly reſembles the apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſis of the ancient pagans.</p>
            <p>THE cuſtom of leaving legacies to their gods, which grew to ſuch exceſs, as to require being bounded by the <hi>Roman</hi> law, as we learn from <hi>Ulpian,</hi> has in no ſmall degree been followed by the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In imitation of the pagan feſtivals, the Popiſh calendar has marked at leaſt an equal number of chriſtian holidays. The writers of their legends, and lives of the Saints, have evidently borrowed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of many marvellous tales from <hi>Ovid,</hi> and other pagan authors, leaving out at the ſame time, the beauty and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the claſſic originals<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>Go into the churches of modern <hi>Rome,</hi> and according to the account of the moſt judicious and faithful travellers, you will ſee almoſt every thing, <hi>after the working of Satan,</hi> and the model of paganiſm. You will ſee many altars, called chriſtian, ſmoaking at once in the ſame church, with incenſe; though the primitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the goſpel, would endure any thing, rather than offer incenſe before an idol. You will there ſee, as in ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> innumerable tapers and candles, burning before the ſhrines and images of

Enter their cities, you will find the ſame kind of idols, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſame homage, at the corners of the ſtreets, in the baths, in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and in almoſt every place of public reſort. All this, which is certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the model, formerly produced <hi>by the working of Satan,</hi> in the darkneſs of heatheniſm, you will now find in the patrimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in the very city where his pretended ſucceſſor ſits en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> comes, ſays the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders: And with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> This part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, as exactly correſponds to the papal Antichriſt, as any we have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013228_0044_0F90432E918D9B48"/>Every one knows the pious frauds that have been ſanctified and practiſed by the Romiſh church; and that it has all along been fond of ſupporting its credit and authority by pretended miracles.</p>
            <p>BELLARMINE mentions miracles as one mark of the true church; and it would fill volumes, to give a particular account of all theſe lying wonders. How many ghoſts have appeared, to eſtabliſh the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of purgatory, and ſupport the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue which the church draws from it? All the images of their Saints, have wrought miracles. They have ſweat; they have groaned; they have ſhed tears; they have bled; they have ſpoken; they have changed their poſture; they have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they have flown through the air; they have diſappeared in one place, and been viſible again in another; they have given ſight to the blind; hearing to the deaf; health to the ſick; and even life to the dead. Almoſt every votive gift, is produced as an evidence of ſome mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle performed by the ſaint at whoſe ſhrine it ſtands; and theſe miracles are related to encourage ſuch donations, by which the wealth of the church has become immenſe. The holy houſe of <hi>Loretto,</hi> which they tell us, was brought many miles through the air, to the place where it now ſtands,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013228_0045_0F90432F523B1958"/>has upon this account been amazingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by ſuch offerings.</p>
            <p>THE legends of the Romiſh church are full of theſe ridiculous miracles: And though ſince knowledge has increaſed in the world, they have grown more modeſt in their accounts; yet the ſame fondneſs for theſe lying wonders continues among them; as appears from the pompous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, publiſhed not many years ago, of the miracles performed at the tomb of the <hi>Abbe' de Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT would be endleſs to reckon up all the <hi>unrighteous deceivings</hi> practiſed by the papal Antichriſt; and to trace the art and ſubtilty employed to cover the falſhood and deformity of his religious ſyſtem. The Pope pretends to nothing but a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power, and holds his territories and wealth in right of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> He is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der father, and makes no uſe of the ſword; he only gives up obſtinate heretics and incorrigible offenders to the civil magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and admoniſhes him to do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Though the idolatry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he authorizes are groſs in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as the pagan; and though the people are known to addreſs the image, and to believe that the Saint ſome how dwells in it; yet the plea is, that the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013228_0046_0F90432FF8CBDF08"/>higheſt worſhip is not given to the latter, and that the former is deſigned only to bring to remembrance ſome eminently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon.</p>
            <p>WITH what ſpecious pretences doth he varniſh ſome of the blackeſt crimes, and even ſanctify perfidy, treaſons, murders and maſſacres, while he throws the moſt frightful colours upon every manly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rights of human nature, and the freedom of conſcience? Thoſe who have diſputed his uſurped authority, and nobly reſiſted his unrighteous impoſitions, if it was without the reach of his power to torment their bodies, have at leaſt been blackened by every artifice of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and repreſented in the moſt odious characters. <hi>Luther,</hi> among many others, experienced this. His motives for oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the papal power, his whole life, and the manner of his dying, have been baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſrepreſented by the Romiſh writers. But the faithful pen of hiſtory hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed theſe malicious calumnies, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his integrity; and without raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him above the frailties of a man, hath preſerved his name in all the luſtre, that undaunted fortitude, and uncommonly great and ſucceſsful efforts, in a cauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portantly good, never fail to impart.</p>
            <p>

To thoſe who have a reſpect for rigid morals, and a life of mortification and ſelf-denial, the Romaniſts hold up the ſeverity of their pennances, and the rigour and auſterity of ſome of their religious orders. At the ſame time, they who chooſe to live like men of the world, need not, upon this account, go out of their church, nor reſign one of its privileges. The pontiff has the merits of all the Saints, as well as of Chriſt, in a common fund at his own diſpoſal, and from thence for a good price he draws diſpenſations, indulgences and pardons, adequate to the moſt licentious inclinations. Under this pretext he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates every obligation to a religious life, and leads thoſe to deſtruction, who <hi>have pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs; whoſe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is juſt;</hi> inaſmuch as ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſo contrary to the prompt deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conſcience, muſt be choſen and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By theſe and ſuch like arts, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ſhare of the lands and wealth in <hi>England,</hi> and in other kingdoms and ſtates in <hi>Europe,</hi> was, before the reformation, the property of the church.</p>
            <p>THE terms in which the benefit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and the neceſſity of purchaſing them, were recommended by <hi>Tetzel</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013228_0048_0F904333AFA70150"/>his aſſociates in <hi>Germany,</hi> are too extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant to gain belief had we not the moſt authentic teſtimony for them. <q>If any man, ſaid they, purchaſes letters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, his ſoul may reſt ſecure of its ſalvation<note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon's Hiſtory of Charles <hi>v. vol. ii. page 41.</hi> Am. Ed.</note>. The ſouls confined in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, for whom they are bought, as ſoon as the money tinkles in the cheſt, immediately aſcend from their torments to Heaven: Through them, the moſt heinous ſins, though one ſhould violate the mother of God, would be remitted! The croſs erected by the <hi>catholic</hi> preachers of the goſpel is as efficacious as the croſs of Chriſt himſelf. Lo! the Heavens are opened; you may enter now. For twelve pence, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the ſoul of your father from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: And are you ſo ungrateful that you will not redeem the ſoul of your father from torment? If you had but one coat, you ought to ſtrip your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſtantly and ſell it, to purchaſe ſuch benefits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To all this we might add the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deceivings by which the Romaniſts have corrupted chriſtian morals; their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable principle, that faith is not to be kept with heretics; the perfidy and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013228_0049_0F904333DEFD0F48"/>with which, according to this principle, <hi>Huſs</hi> was treated at the council of <hi>Conſtance:</hi> Their allowance of equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and mental reſervation; and that the blackeſt crimes may become innocent and even meritorious, if they be done from a good intention, and for the ſervice of the church. All this is well known to the world, and may at once be diſcerned to be part of the character of that <hi>wicked one</hi> deſcribed in our text.</p>
            <p>BUT high as he may exalt himſelf; confident as he may be in his own policy and power, and in the ſupport given him by <hi>the kings of the earth,</hi> he is after all the <hi>ſon of perdition, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the breath of his mouth, and deſtroy by the brightneſs of his coming.</hi> This prediction, we have before obſerved, does not reſpect any particular perſon, but an order of men in ſucceſſion, contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and advancing a ſyſtem of falſhood and iniquity. This is the object to be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The breath of Chriſt's mouth is his word, and a brightneſs ever attends it. Error is deſtroyed by the light of truth, as darkneſs ceaſes when the ſun appears.</p>
            <p>WHILE the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> roſe, the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was obſcured, and gradually withdrawn
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013228_0050_0F904335035E07B0"/>from the view of men; <hi>the truth was held,</hi> or impriſoned, in <hi>unrighteouſneſs:</hi> But when this was ſet at liberty, and the ſacred volumes opened, the papal ſyſtem felt the ſhock, and was evidently blaſted, though not deſtroyed, as by the fire of Heaven; blaſted by the ſtroke of that goſpel, which our Saviour compares to <hi>the lightning which cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even to the Weſt.</hi> So fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the Revelations, and <hi>devoureth their enemies.</hi> The ſimplicity of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, carries with it a wonderful light and energy: It is great, and will finally prevail. Like a flame, it goes through <hi>the briars and thorns</hi> that oppoſe it, and <hi>burns them together.</hi> In its progreſs, it puniſhes and torments the obſtinately erroneous and wicked: They <hi>gnaw their tongues for pain,</hi> at the detection of thoſe errors they will not renounce, and at the pungent reproof of thoſe vices which they cannot forſake. They have often other puniſhments from the judicial diſpenſations of Heaven, even in this life; which are a prelude of what ſhall be awarded them, in proportion to their guilt, at the bar of the Son of Man.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond coming of Chriſt extends in ſome ſenſe from his aſcenſion to the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013228_0051_0F9043353A6B6DD8"/>final judgment. In this period Antichriſt will be conſumed. We have ſeen already this part of the prediction in a conſiderable degree fulfilled. He has ſurpriſingly waſted away. He no longer appears what he once was; the diſpoſer of crowns, the arbiter of kingdoms, and the dread of the world. His ſtrength is abated, and the reverence that was once paid him by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces greatly diminiſhed. He now palliates and ſeems half aſhamed of what he once openly profeſſed, and boaſted in. This is owing to the increaſing light ſpringing from the reformation.</p>
            <p>NOR ought we to overlook a late event, that deſerves particular attention. One of his religious orders, I mean the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> remarkable for a mixture of ſubtilty and enthuſiaſm, which rendered them ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly active and ſucceſsful in his cauſe, has not long ſince been ſuppreſſed by Princes, that once were moſt zealouſly devoted to him, and particularly friendly to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order. Even the Pope himſelf, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome recent accounts, has at length been compelled, ſorely againſt his will, to imitate their example, and to concur with them in this ſignal, but very humiliating act of reformation. Theſe things, among others, plainly ſhow, how far this <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:013228_0052_0F90433604CA8448"/>ſon of the morning, this pretended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light, and diſpenſer of infallible knowledge, hath declined from his zenith, and may be one means of accelerating his deſcent. However this may be, we are aſſured, that at furtheſt, he will be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed by the brightneſs of our Lord's ſecond coming.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, whoever compares the predictions of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> with that of <hi>Paul</hi> in our text, will find in them a ſurprizing agreement; and that all theſe diſtinguiſhed ſervants of God, ſpake of the ſame iniquitous and oppreſſive power that was to riſe in his kingdom, in latter ages, and oppoſe himſelf to it: A power that <hi>ſpeaketh great things, even great things againſt the moſt High, and is full of the names of blaſphemy:</hi> A power that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth againſt, and weareth out the Saints; that changeth times and laws,</hi> and aſſumeth an authority, <hi>over all kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and tongues, and nations:</hi> A pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that <hi>caſteth down the hoſt of Heaven,</hi> all civil rulers, <hi>and magnifieth himſelf againſt the Prince of the hoſt;</hi> to whom notwithſtanding, <hi>the Kings of the earth do give their ſtrength:</hi> A power that <hi>deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by falſe miracles, done in the ſight of the beaſt, them that dwell upon the earth;</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:013228_0053_0F904336C3618E08"/>and upon whom <hi>the judgment ſhould final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſit, to take away his dominion, and to conſume and deſtroy it to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THE predictions of the three ſervants of God above-named, concerning the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of chriſtianity in the Romiſh church, and concerning the political ſtate of the world from firſt to laſt, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the revolutions of empire had a relation to our religion, theſe, I ſay, when united, form a prophetic picture, which in reſpect of the grandeur and importance of the events delineated therein, the variety and ſingularity of the particulars whereof theſe events conſiſt, the clearneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion with which they are delineated, the exactneſs of their accompliſhment, and the length of time taken up in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is one of the moſt aſtoniſhing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which it is poſſible for the human mind to contemplate. And therefore the due examination of this picture, cannot fail to ſtrike all wiſe men with the higheſt conceptions of the preſcience and power of God, and with the deepeſt veneration for the chriſtian religion, in the records of which this aſtoniſhing picture is found. For common ſenſe dictates, that the Ruler of the univerſe never would give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of future events to impoſtors; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013228_0054_0F9043377B8E8560"/>as upon the credit of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they have required mankind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the hiſtory of Jeſus. Wherefore, the corruptions of chriſtianity, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any objection againſt the divinity of our religion, by having been ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predicted, are in reality the foundation of one of the ſtrongeſt arguments in its favour<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Macknight</hi>'s Truth of Goſpel Hiſtory. Page 602.</note>."</p>
            <p>TIME will not allow me to enlarge on the reflections which naturally ariſe from our ſubject.</p>
            <p>WHAT a bleſſing to mankind was the reformation? What a yoke of bondage did it break? Even the papal power, where it ſtill prevails, has been tempered by it. It was at once favourable to civil liberty, and to the rights of conſcience. Religion and learning revived together. The Bible, the fountain of divine knowledge being unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the thirſty came and <hi>drank of the water of life freely.</hi> At the ſame time the beſt human models of writing, and the nobleſt ſentiments on civility and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were read with avidity in the ancient claſſics. The church emerged from darkneſs; human ſociety was poliſhed; the arts cultivated, and commerce enlarged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:013228_0055_0F90433890001D78"/>
THE happy fruits of the reformation have been tranſplanted to <hi>America;</hi> and what a change have they made already in the face of this continent? Here may they all flouriſh to the ſecond coming of the Son of Man! And may this literary <hi>Society,</hi> according to the generous deſign of its founders, be eminently conducive to ſo happy a purpoſe! We have a Romiſh Biſhop, and a Popiſh colony, not far from us; where, I am well informed, inſtead of the advancement of proteſtant truth, ſince its ſubjection to the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, numbers have been perverted from our own profeſſion. And if popery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully aſſuming a milder form, ſeems to be leſs dreaded and abhored than it once was; let us be upon our guard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering it is popery ſtill, be prepared to oppoſe it in every form. At beſt it is the extremeſt deſpotiſm. It decides all things at once, and by mere authority, and allows no examination of its own mandates and decrees. It is a direct, an everlaſting enemy to freedom of enquiry, and conſequently to knowledge, and good literature. There are indeed many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed catholics; but the learning among them is, in one way or another, greatly owing to the reformation: For when po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery reigned without oppoſition, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013228_0056_0F90433B268C83D8"/>every where prevailed. And even at this day, the body of the people in the Romiſh, are not near ſo enlightened as in the proteſtant communion.</p>
            <p>POPERY is incompatible with the ſafety of a free government. It ſets up a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign head, ſuperior to all civil rulers; a ſpiritual power that reaches to every thing upon earth, and can brook no control. Trampling upon the rights of conſcience, and aſſuming an authority to diſſolve eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſacred obligation, what pledge can it poſſibly leave us for the ſecurity of civil freedom?</p>
            <p>COMPARE the preſent ſtate of <hi>Italy</hi> with what it once was. Where are the poets, the orators, the philoſophers, the ſtateſmen and heroes, that once guided, defended, and adorned that diſtinguiſhed country? Where are the numbers it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and the ſpirit and vigour of its inhabitants? Nature is the ſame; it is tyranny, and moſt of all the papal tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that hath made the change. We have indeed, may a Popiſh bigot ſay, we have happily no more the fierce contentions of ancient <hi>Rome:</hi> All things are now ſettled by an indiſputable authority; and we are at peace. But have there been no bloody
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013228_0057_0F90433B4BF99CE0"/>conteſts in papal <hi>Rome?</hi> And what kind of tranquility does it ever enjoy? Is it the eaſe and happineſs of a vigorous well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned ſtate? Far from it: It is the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of death; it is the peace of a church yard.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore, <hi>ſtand faſt in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty wherewith Chriſt has made us free,</hi> and allow no unſcriptural impoſition, no trace of the papal bondage, to be found among us! May a liberal inquiry, a free and temperate diſcuſſion, diſſipate error of every kind, and by advancing truth, ſecure the true order and felicity both of church and ſtate! May the honor of the inſpired writings, as the only infallible rule of faith and practice, and the right of private judgment, the baſis of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ever be ſacredly preſerved among us! And may ſerious piety, and chriſtian morals, the end of all, adorn our profeſſion as proteſtants, and ever keep pace with our improvements in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledge!</p>
