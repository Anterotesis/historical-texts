            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE IMPARTIAL PUBLICK.</head>
            <p>FULLY convinced of the Neceſſity which exiſts, that a ſtrict Union between the Head and Members of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire ſhould take Place, no Perſon can harbour a ſincerer Veneration for every Branch of it, or would more cordially rejoice in every Incident which had a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote the Honour and Happineſs of the Whole. Problematical as this Language may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in ſuch as are diſpoſed to offer modern publick Opinions, I can with Truth aver, that it is in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this Veneration, and that Conviction, I now attempt to expoſe the Imbecility of a Pamphlet ſigned <hi>Freeman,</hi> which lately made its Appearance, and point out a few of the many Abſurdities with which it teems.</p>
            <p>Men, who, to humour unprovoked Reſentment on the one Hand, or to ſerve unjuſtifiable Purpoſes on the other, would invert the Order of Things, as well as the Grounds of eſtabliſhed Policy, ſhould be deemed Enemies to Society; but when this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Corruption is extended, and Perſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed Characters and upright Lives are ſingled
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013630_0003_0F9147F0F995CA70"/>
out as Objects for Envy and Diſappointment to wreck their Effects on, we may, without heſitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, proceed a Step further and venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſuch, the Author of Calomnies, and deſtitute of every Species of honourable Feeling.</p>
            <p>I muſt freely confeſs my preſent Difficulty. In this little Pamphlet, I could wiſh to give ſome exact Portrait of <hi>Freeman,</hi> but am at a Loſs in the Choice of Colours. Whether I ſhould conſider him as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotick or miniſterial, heterodox, or orthodox, <hi>ſimplex vel unus, compoſitus vel idem,</hi> or both, or either, or neither, I cannot with Candour determine? But as it is not in the leaſt my Intention to cenſure a Man who, in a perſonal Capacity, cannot much obſtruct the publick Good, I will only confine myſelf to ſuch Arguments as tend to illuſtrate the relative Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which ſubſiſts between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies.</p>
            <p>I am well aware of the many Diſadvantages which accompany an Attempt of this Nature. The beſt of Men are at Times liable to receive wrong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, under the Influence of which many are apt to conſider Objects only in that Point of View which favours the natural Bias of the Mind. An Habit of thinking thus acquired is not readily eraſed; indeed with Time it collects a Strength in the Fancy frequently too ſolid for the forcible Appearance of Reaſon or Argument to ſubdue. It is not to be then wondered that many Perſons ſhould be dazzled by thoſe falſe Lights which are often diſplayed for ſiniſter Purpoſes, though in other Reſpects poſſeſſed of a good Share of Underſtanding, as well as Integrity, Qualities which, in general, characterize <hi>Americans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:013630_0004_0F9147F204805030"/>
As I ſolemnly declare that I do not wear the Features of any Party, the impartial Publick may ſafely rely on the Candour of ſuch Reaſons as will be uſed in inveſtigating the Nature of that Right of Dominion which <hi>Great-Britain</hi> claims over the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>North-America.</hi> It is the immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of every Man born free, to give his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on publick Affairs with Truth; as an Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual I claim that Right. My Opinion, however, ſhall be free, it muſt; for certainly it will be the Language of my Heart, unſtudied, uncorrected.</p>
            <p>The Sovereignty of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament over all the Dominions belonging to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential a Part of the Conſtitution, that the Right cannot be renounced without a Confuſion of Ideas, or a treaſonable Surrender. Notwithſtanding that internal Evidence which ariſes in the Mind of a thinking Man to ſupport the Truth of this Maxim, from a Survey of thoſe Principles on which parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Power is grounded, a Pamphlet, ſigned <hi>Freeman,</hi> was publiſhed a few Days ſince, replete with the moſt groſs Strictures on the Conduct of his Majeſty, his Miniſters, his Parliament, with many others of his Majeſty's Servants;—a Pamphlet, which, if accompanied with Grammar-Coherence, ſome Appearance of Decency, or ſhew of Reaſoning, would evidently tend in its Conſequences to ſubvert the Conſtitution, overturn a ſettled Syſtem of ſub-ordination, and blot out that Ear-mark by which legal Dominion is diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Arguments advanced by <hi>Freeman</hi> to ſuſtain Poſitions in direct Contradiction to the inherent Rights of a State, are as incongruous as the Poſitions
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013630_0005_0F9147F51056C8F8"/>
themſelves are abſurd. Since the firſt Eſtabliſhment of Mankind into ſeparate Societies, there was a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power centered in ſome Part of the State or Society, for the Purpoſe of forming neceſſary Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for the Good of the Whole. It was juſtly preſumed, that ſuch Regulations, though eſſential for the Preſervation of the Society, would not prove equally agreeable to each Individual, who might be left at Liberty to judge them a heavy Reſtraint on the Laws of Nature, there was a coercive Power, <hi>ex neceſſitate,</hi> eſtabliſhed, which enjoined an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Obedience to ſuch Laws as the Wiſdom of the legiſlative Body judged proper to enact. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Dictates of natural Law being thus wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, for the general Benefit of the Community, and reduced to a ſubordinate Limitation, no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on the ſuppoſed Impropriety of ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as were adopted by the acknowledged legiſlative Power could be admitted, being in their Nature op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to thoſe Principles on which the conſtitutional Power of the State or Society was founded.</p>
            <p>On this Ground I will meet <hi>Freeman'</hi>s Opinion, and demonſtrate its Incoherency: That Gentleman may, if he pleaſes, uſe the Dialect of metaphyſical Jargon, I will confine myſelf to thoſe plain Reaſons which ariſe from a Contemplation of that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Authority which is eſtabliſhed in <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> His Opinion might poſſibly carry ſome Weight in <hi>Foro Coeli,</hi> but I ſtrenuouſly deny that a Retroſpect to the firſt Principles of our Conſtitution will render his Plea in Behalf of <hi>American</hi> Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence admiſſible at the Bar of an earthly Tribunal, guided by Wiſdom or ſound Policy. The Colonies
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013630_0006_0F9147F649CBB4A8"/>
were peopled and planted by <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects; at their Departure for <hi>America,</hi> they brought with them their Allegiance, an indelible Mark of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament; a Token of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence derived from their Anceſtors, who were coeval with the Origin of the State, which no Change of Climate, no after-Act of theirs, could eraſe from their Perſons. Thus circumſtanced, the firſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants reached the weſtern Continent, which had been previouſly declared to be ſubjected to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> State by the Diſcoverers thereof, agreeable to their Principles of Duty and Allegiance. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietorſhip of thoſe new Territories was granted by the executive Magiſtrate to the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Company, with Intent of promoting their Colonization; an Ability of forming ſuch municipal Regulations for their Government, as were conſiſtent with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Tie of Subjection they were under to the State, was alſo confirmed to the Company. They regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exerciſed their Right of Power until their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge ceaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whatever local Regulations were made, were inſtituted in <hi>England.</hi> In like Manner the other Provinces of <hi>America</hi> were granted to different Perſons, with Power of ſupreme Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though ſubſervient to the Controul of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And no later than 1732, half a Dozen <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentlemen regularly aſſembled at a Tavern in <hi>London,</hi> and there framed Laws for the Province of <hi>Georgia,</hi> for the Purpoſe of collecting a Revenue, &amp;c. without the ſmalleſt Altercation held by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that Province, concerning the Right of their Proprietors ſo to do. It muſt have required a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Acceſſion of Knowledge ſince the above Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013630_0007_0F9147F6F5905760"/>
to diſcover; that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, aſſembled in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> cannot legally aſſume a Power which, when veſted in Five or Six <hi>Britiſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, enjoying themſelves over a Bottle at the <hi>Crown-and-Anchor,</hi> they held ſacred, and with a placid Compoſure ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>America</hi> is not a Part of the King's hereditary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; it conſtitutes a Share of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire. The Dominion of the King in <hi>America</hi> ariſes from Parliament, which hath appointed him ſupreme Governor over all the Dominions of the State; and here I cannot ſufficiently admire the Sophiſtry of Perſons who affect Obedience to a Magiſtrate, and renounce at the ſame Time Subjection to that para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount Authority from which the Magiſtrate derives his Power. It is a unlucky Circumſtance, that Partizans for that Doctrine of Independence lately broached by <hi>Freeman,</hi> under a new political Phiz, cannot avoid the ſad Alternative of either maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are not Subjects to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or, if that be granted, of confeſſing their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, to the conſtituted chief Magiſtrate of which they humbly condeſcend to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>Parliament, foreſeeing that the Crown might claim an excluſive Dominion over the Colonies, took an early Opportunity of aſſerting its Right. This Precaution in Parliament was very neceſſary. We find, that on a Complaint exhibited by the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> Settlers to King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, againſt thoſe who, under the Countenance of Parliament, carried on a Fiſhery on the Coaſts, that many Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages had been committed by Perſons employed in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013630_0008_0F9147F7E2DB89C8"/>
that Buſineſs, on their Perſons and Property, by cutting down Wood in their Encloſures, &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> was glad of this Pretext, thinking it would furniſh him with a proper Excuſe for uſurping a ſole and excluſive Right of Power. He therefore iſſued a Proclamation, not only for the Purpoſe of redreſſing Grievances complained of by the infant Settlers, but plainly importing the Idea of abſolute Dominion, which in his regal Capacity he claimed. The <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Senate now judged it high Time to interpoſe, and curb this gigantick Stride of Prerogative. The Affair being introduced into Parliament, <hi>James</hi> ſent his Secretary with a Meſſage deſiring they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, as having no Authority over the Colonies<note n="*" place="bottom">Commons Journal, 1622.</note>; but Parliament ſenſible of its Right, was not to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated ſo far as to neglect a Matter of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the State, it reſumed the Debates on that Subject, and expedited a Bill clearly thwarting the Aſſertions contained in the Royal Proclamation. Though this Bill miſcarried in the Upper Houſe, through the Machinations of the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the Unanimity with which it paſſed the Houſe of Commons, (there being only two diſſenting Voices<note n="†" place="bottom">The King's Secretary, and Mr. G—.</note>) will remain a laſting Monument how conſcious the Nation was of poſſeſſing a paramount Right over all the new Settlements and Territories acquired conquered or colonized, by its Subjects.</p>
            <p>Parliament could not condeſcend to ſurrender into the Hands of the Crown a Right of ſo weighty a Concern. We accordingly find this Buſineſs taken up the Year following, in the Houſe of Commons,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013630_0009_0F9147F8935B9CB8"/>
and purſued with ſuch Ardency<note n="Dagger" place="bottom">Sir Edward Sackville's Speech, Com. Jour. 18th Feb. 1623.</note>, that the King's Secretary gave up the Point. The ſupreme Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Parliament over the Colonies being thus eſtabliſhed and acknowledged, by a Prince fluſhed with Ideas of divine Right, it cannot be doubted, that if its Competency was diſputed, of exerciſing plenary Dominion over other Colonies, as well as <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> it would have ſtept forth with the ſame Zeal, and incontrovertibly have determined its Right. Thus we ſee, that notwithſtanding the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions Individuals now adays adopt, the Language of Parliament continues the ſame, with only this Difference, that the Struggle in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Firſt was with the Crown, which attempted to ouſt it of its ſupreme Juriſdiction, and that in the Reign of <hi>George</hi> the Third was with the Colonies, which contended for a Latitude of Independence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with every Idea of Subordination.</p>
            <p>There is not the leaſt Similitude between the two Periods of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and <hi>George</hi> the Third; nor would any Perſon draw the Portrait who had the ſmalleſt Particle of Reſpect for his Sovereign. Unhappy <hi>Charles</hi> became Heir to his Father's Follies as well as his Crown; taught from his Infancy to conſider Parliaments as formal Expletives in the State, he judged them unneceſſary when once they had ceaſed to echo the Will of the Sovereign, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to rule without them. In conſequence of this fatal Reſolution, arbitrary Exertions of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative grew into Uſe. Thoſe were the Ills from which the Troubles of that Reign ſprung. The Houſe of Commons could no longer endure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

Attacks which were made on its Privileges: It therefore, (not the People, as <hi>Freeman</hi> obſerves) aroſe in its Might, and eſtabliſhed its undoubted Right. This was not a Conteſt between the Prince and a particular Body of his Subjects; it was ſtrictly a Caſe in which the Sovereign was Plaintiff and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Defendant: The Claim of the Crown was abſolute and ſole Dominion: Parliament demurred; and ſince no other Court of Judicature could deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this important Cauſe, the Appeal, from Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, lay to the God of Hoſts. What a ſoul and ungenerous Miſrepreſentation! to combine the Events of two Princes Reigns, and aſſimilate them, where there is not the moſt diſtant Parity to juſtify the Obſervation; the one having uſurped the Authority of Parliament, and ſubſtituted his will for Law; the other ſo tender of the Rights of this People, as not to proceed in the ſmalleſt Affairs without collecting the Senſe of his Senate.</p>
            <p>I will now conſider the Weight of thoſe Reaſons which <hi>Freeman</hi> urges, to exempt <hi>America</hi> from Taxation by a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>That the <hi>Americans</hi> being deſcended from the ſame Anceſtors with the People of <hi>England,</hi> and owing Fealty to the ſame Crown, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore equally with them entitled to the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> formed by their common An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; and to all and ſingular the Benefits, Rights, Liberties and Claims, ſpecified in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in the Petition of Rights, in the Bill of Rights, and in the Act of Settlement. They being no more than principally declaratory of the Grounds of the fundamental Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:013630_0011_0F9147F9F9C38578"/>
               <q>Therefore, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament ought not to have, and cannot of Right poſſeſs any Power to tax, or in any Shape to bind <hi>American</hi> Freeholders of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, ſeeing it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Franchiſes of the Land, becauſe their Conſent is not ſignified in Parliament, by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of their own Election.</q> The other principal Objection is, I think, the <hi>adjudged Caſe in Point of</hi> Durham.</p>
            <p>Having already admitted the <hi>Americans (though not deſcended from the ſame Anceſtors with the People of</hi> England, being a Compound of <hi>Engliſh, Scots, Iriſh, French, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>New-York</hi> in particular, was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Settlement until the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and was ſubject to the States of Holland, which gave Law and collected a Revenue therein) to be entitled to ſuch Rights as <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> legally ſhould enjoy, I cannot ſee a ſingle Inference that ariſes from the Conceſſion, to juſtify <hi>Americans</hi> in withdrawing an Obedience to ſuch Laws as the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> State judges convenient to enact. It is the heavy Miſfortune of <hi>Freeman,</hi> to quote Caſes which, if properly conſidered, overthrow the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he would wiſh to eſtabliſh. I muſt confeſs his Caſe is deſperate; having impatiently ſolicited the Touch of Corruption for long Series of Years, and meeting with only contemptuous Repulſes, a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Circumſtance, which, when coupled with a total and merited Diſregard of his Countrymen, and an entire Shipwreck of private Fortune, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of which, alas! the Nicks of <hi>Seven</hi> and <hi>Eleven</hi> bore no inconſiderable Share. I ſay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy thoſe Calamities. Prudence muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013630_0012_0F9147FBAD87DE58"/>
dictate ſome Meaſures proper to be purſued; and in this Purſuit, what Choice could be ſo happily adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as that which bore the Aſpect of Popularity, and offered an Occaſſion of revenging himſelf on an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling</hi> Miniſtry, unfeeling, alas! to the earneſt and repeated Solicitations of <hi>Freeman.</hi> I hope this will prove a ſufficient Anſwer to ſuch as may be led to inquire with <hi>Hudibras,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Why he choſe that curſed Sin,</l>
                  <l>Hypocriſy to ſet up in,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe it is the general Calling,</l>
                  <l>The only Saint's Bell that rings all in.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Reaſon aſſigned by the Author of the Letter to the general Congreſs, is ſo unguardedly couched that it may be retorted, I fear, with too much Succeſs. <hi>Exempli gratia;</hi> the <hi>Americans</hi> are formed of different People, <hi>Dutch, French, Swedes, Germans, Scots, Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Each Individual brought with him thoſe unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rights which were his Inheritance in the Country from whence he emigrated.</p>
            <p>Therefore each of thoſe Perſons is entitled to all and ſingular the Rights, Privileges and Benefits, which they legally could enjoy in their ſeveral Countries from which they extracted their Origin.</p>
            <p>To prevent, however, the Abſurdity and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which take birth from the Jumble of Matter contained in the firſt Poſition of <hi>Freeman'</hi>s Letter, I have taken Care to ſecure, by legal Demonſtration, to the <hi>Americans</hi> the Rights of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> in a former Part of this ſhort Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Magna Charta</hi> comes next in Order, which is <hi>"ſuch a Fellow that he will have no Sovereign."</hi> If
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013630_0013_0F9147FC5566D608"/>
he is "ſuch a Fellow," he muſt be formidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but that he is "no ſuch Fellow," will, I think, inconteſtibly appear.</p>
            <p>The firſt and principal Care of the Barons who obtained that memorable Charter, was to ſecure the Roman Catholick Religion: Their ſecond Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to lop off the luxuriant Branches of <hi>Norman</hi> Hardſhips. That which was granted to the Barons at <hi>Runnemede,</hi> and which <hi>Freeman</hi> hath ſo highly extolled, I account of little Weight, and this for two Reaſons; the firſt, as not ſufficient for redreſſing the Oppreſſions which the People then groaned under; the ſecond, becauſe the Acquiſition of the Charter did not carry a legal Complexion, being obtained from a Prince in Dureſs. But that Charter of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, which was confirmed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third to his Barons, with Amendments in Favour of the Subject, which is properly ſtiled <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> may deſerve the Eulogium of <hi>Freeman.</hi> I will now clearly demonſtrate, that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> hath been, and ſtill is, ſubject to the Controul of Parliament; firſt, in the Article of Religion, which is totally changed from that Form which the Barons contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in Blood, and indeed eſtabliſhed. Here mark. This Alteration in Religion was adopted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which did not preſume <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be a "Fellow ſuperior" to <hi>its</hi> enacting Power.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Inſtance of doing away the Subſtance of the great Charter is evident from every day's Practice. Whereas the twenty-ninth Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> expreſſes, that no free Man ſhall be diſſeized of his Lands or Tenements, or baniſhed, or impriſoned, unleſs by the Judgment of his Peers;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013630_0014_0F9147FD0A10A518"/>
we notwithſtanding ſee a Writ iſſues in the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Courts, which requires ſpecial Bail, or in Default thereof an Impriſonment of the perſon enſues before the Cauſe comes to a Trial, or a Judgment of his Peers can be obtained. Leaſt this Cuſtom ſhould be deemed an Abuſe, and uncoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by Parliament, we have only to refer to to thoſe various Acts of Inſolvency made for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Unhappy. Although thoſe humane Laws free many Objects from the Claws of mercileſs Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, is it not clearly apparent, that by a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Wind they ſupport, a Cuſtom expreſſed in Cap. 29th of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be oppreſſive and unwarrantable? Indeed the Wiſdom of that Body which enacted a Law in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſhould be deemed and conſidered as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England</hi> was not very conſpicuous; for if it was the common Law of the Realm, or <hi>lex non ſcripta,</hi> and ſtood unrepealed by any Statute, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported ſuch abſolute Authority and Verity in itſelf, as not to require the Aid of Parliament to ſuſtain it. But when an Act had been paſſed for that Purpoſe, ſo far from confirming the Subſtance of the Charter for common Law, that every immemorial Cuſtom or municipal Uſage contained therein muſt immediately loſe its Habit of Action, and aſſume the Name of <hi>lex ſcripta,</hi> thro' the legal Operation of that Statute. Even this Law, tho' not penned with a ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Share of Wiſdom, is an inconteſtible Proof that Parliament only conſidered the great Charter as the beſt Confirmation of the Subjects Rights that could then be obtained, and by no Means faſtened on it an Idea of an excluſive paramount Controul over ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013630_0015_0F9147FDCB9FB540"/>
Parliaments, which in Truth have repealed, explained or reſcinded, almoſt every Article in this celebrated Charter, notwithſtanding the blind Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "that he is ſuch a Fellow, that he will have no Sovereign." I will now proceed and ſpeak on the <hi>Petition of Rights,</hi> which is the next in Order of Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Nature of this Petition is ſo unconnected with the Purpoſe it was intended to ſecond, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Letter to the Delegates muſt certainly have imagined no Perſon properly informed of our Hiſtory would have ever peruſed it. Supplemental Acts of State to ſupply the Defect of Laws, Tonnage and Poundage, and a Collection of other Duties upon Merchandiſes of all Kinds, <hi>all which had been poſitively refuſed to be granted by Act of Parliament,</hi> with many other Impoſitions on Trade, formed the Baſis on which the Superſtructure of this Petition was raiſed. This alſo was a Conteſt between the <hi>King and his Parliament,</hi> and not in any Degree analagous to the Caſe of the <hi>Americans.</hi> I could ſay more on this Head: but behold the <hi>Bill of Rights,</hi> which claims ſome little Attention.</p>
            <p>What new and curious Alliances are hourly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! <hi>Freeman</hi> is become a Supporter of the Bill of Rights. How? From Habit of Body or Conviction of Mind? From neither! Having exhauſted his Stock of miniſterial Expectation, and ſoured by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, he hath publickly avowed his Apoſtacy, and prophecied the Approach of the final Ruin of <hi>American</hi> Freedom, with nearly as much Zeal as <hi>George Fox</hi> did the Deſtruction of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in 1660. However, it is Time to uſe a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013630_0016_0F9147FE8D6FED18"/>
ſerious Dialect. The Bill of Rights hath not the ſmalleſt Tendency to ſupport the Opinion of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> This Bulwark of Freedom was erected for another Purpoſe: It was a poſitive Declaration made by Parliament, of thoſe Conditions by which a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown could be held. The ſupreme Authority of Parliament, not only over all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions, but alſo over the Crown, was rendered manifeſt at this memorable Period; and the Subjection of the Colonies to Parliament cannot be more ſtrongly featured than in that Reſolve of the Aſſembly of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which unanimouſly agreed, That if <q>the Parliament had conſtituted the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> King, <hi>we, who are ſubject to Parliament, muſt acknowledge him likewiſe.</hi>
               </q> The fifth Poſition now only remains to be conſidered, which is the <hi>Act of Settlement;</hi> an Act equally fatal to the Deſigns <hi>Freeman</hi> would wiſh to inculcate as any of the preceding.</p>
            <p>Surely the Planet which preſided over this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Nativity muſt have been of a very inauſpicious Nature, and given early Omens of the left-handed Singularity of Fortune which was to accompany him in his political Walk of Life. That a Man, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſis,</hi> may be an Enemy to others is not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common; but when a Perſon becomes the bittereſt Enemy of the Cauſe he intended to eſtabliſh, it is a convincing Proof that he hath attained the Summit of Folly. The ſmalleſt Attention to thoſe Principles on which the Act of Settlement was founded, will render the Truth of this Aſſertion incontrovertibly clear.</p>
            <p>The Heart of Man could not deviſe an Expedient, or produce a Caſe wherein the unbounded Power
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013630_0017_0F9147FF3608FE18"/>
of Parliament could appear in that Plenitude of legal Luſtre with which it did in the Act of Settlement. The Ordinance formed for the Trial of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, was neither conſtitutional or parliamentary: The Grant of the Crown to King <hi>William,</hi> on the Abdication, wanted ſomething of Form, and can only be juſtified on Principles of Neceſſity; by ſuch as would draw Concluſions from abſtracted Principles of Government; tho', as <hi>Blackſtone</hi> obſerves, the ſafeſt Way for the Subject is to conſider that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction on the Footing of ſolid Authority: But in the Act of Settlement Parliament actually appeared in the Zenith of its legal Omnipotence. By this Act we ſee Parliament modelling the Crown, and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Perſons not in a regular but a parliamentary Order of Succeſſion. And farther; the Iſſue of King <hi>William,</hi> by any other Queen except <hi>Mary,</hi> excluded from the Inheritance of their Father's Crown, to make Way for the Acceſſion of the Princeſs <hi>Anne</hi> and her Iſſue to the Throne; on Failure of which, the Crown was to revert to the Iſſue of King <hi>William,</hi> if <hi>in eſſe;</hi> or, in Default thereof, the lineal Deſcendants of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt were to inherit; under which laſt Clauſe King <hi>George</hi> Firſt was called to the Empire, Great Grandfather to our preſent moſt gracious Sovereign, whoſe Life may God long Perpetuate.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of <hi>Durham</hi> is by no Means applicable to the Colonies: It is a Country ſituated in <hi>England,</hi> and paid Taxes equally with the repreſented Places of that Kingdom before it obtained the Privilege of Repreſentation. This Country was ordered to ſend two Knights to repreſent it, at the firſt Parliament
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013630_0018_0F9147FFF59E74A8"/>
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: Its Inhabitants preſented Petition to <hi>Mortimer</hi> ſignifying their Poverty, and could not well diſburſe Money for the Knights At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, but that, as heretofore, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their Proportion of all general Aſſeſſments. We accordingly find, ſpecified in <hi>Doomeſday-Book,</hi> the different Levies collected in <hi>Durroman,</hi> or <hi>Durham,</hi> as it is now called, when general Aids were required. The two cities in <hi>England</hi> moſt famed for Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures are now unrepreſented, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Bermingham</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter.</hi> A ſingle Doubt is not to be ſtarted, that had they deſired a Repreſentation it would have been allowed them. Indeed the former had the Offer of Privilege made it in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>66, by the Marquis of <hi>Rockingham,</hi> but it was declined: The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of thoſe Towns are a wiſe and loyal People, ſatiſfied with the Bleſſings ariſing from the auſpicious Reign of the moſt humane Prince that ever graced a Throne. They look nothing more on that Head, but beſtow their whole Attention on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Riches and Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>When the Affair of <hi>Durham</hi> was agitated in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the Reaſons quickly appeared for introducing the Motion in Behalf of its Repreſentation. This was a miniſterial Manoeuvre, to give Sir <hi>John Willoughby,</hi> a warm Eſpouſer of the Doctrine of paſſive Obedience, a Seat in the Houſe of Commons. The popular Party, headed by Sir <hi>John Coventry,</hi> diſtinguiſhed themſelves in Oppoſition, in the Lower Houſe: As did the Earl of <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> in the Upper. It was, however, agreed to, and a Right of Repreſentation confirmed to <hi>Durham.</hi>

By what ſtrange Fatality hath the Author of the Letter to the Delegates been induced to furniſh his Adverſaries with ſuch a Number of unſurmountable Arguments againſt himſelf? The moſt learned of Men may at Times inattentively ſtumble into an Error; but ſuch a Catalogue of Abſurdities is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uncommon, and muſt ouſt of him of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Clergy in the argumentative World.</p>
            <p>Indeed the firſt Poſition laid down by this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "That the <hi>Americans</hi> being deſcended from the ſame Anceſtors with the People of <hi>England,</hi>" would imply a dangerous Tendency, to deprive one Moiety of <hi>Americans</hi> of thoſe ſpecified Rights which, as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, they have a juſt Right to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: For by this Method of Reaſoning it would follow, that no <hi>Americans</hi> but ſuch as were deſcended from the ſame Anceſtors with the People of <hi>England,</hi> could with Propriety become Candidates for the chartered Rightſ of <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> The <hi>Americans,</hi> however, are entitled in general to every legal Right a Subject can demand: Not on the Principle of "being deſcended from the ſame Anceſtors with the People of <hi>England;</hi>" but for this Reaſon, that on their Arrival in <hi>America,</hi> they ſettled in a Colony, the Territory of which, with the whole Country, adjoining, was declared by <hi>Cabot,</hi> who was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by <hi>Henry</hi> VII. to make Diſcoveries, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> State, and to conſtitute a Part of its Dominions.</p>
            <p>It is a Truth to which all Men have aſſented; that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were the firſt People who colonized both Sides of the River <hi>Delaware.</hi> They called this
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013630_0020_0F91480174A20F60"/>
Settlement <hi>New-Sweden.</hi> They fortified it in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places, and erected a Fort in particular, which they named <hi>Elſenburgh,</hi> a Name it ſtill preſerves, The <hi>Dutch</hi> laid a Claim to this Country, pretending that an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> which they had appointed for the Purpoſe, was the firſt Diſcoverer thereof in 1609. They formed a Colony at the Mouth of <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River, which they named <hi>New-Amſterdam</hi> (now <hi>New-York</hi>) and the Country adjoining was called <hi>New-Netherland.</hi> They extended thoſe Settlements as far as Fort <hi>Orange</hi> (now Forty <hi>Abany</hi>) which is a Diſtance of forty Leagues up the River. They alſo eſtabliſhed a Colony on the Banks of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. The prodigious Increaſe of the, <hi>Dutch</hi> in thoſe Parts rendered them formidable to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who apprehending leaſt their more powerful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhould wreſt their Poſſeſſions from them, agreed to throw themſelves under the Protection of the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> and accordingly made a formal Surrender of that Country to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Governor. Parliament conſidered thoſe <hi>Dutch</hi> Settlements as bold Uſurpations on a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Territory; a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which flowed from the Principle of <hi>Cabot'</hi>s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Therefore, in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the Houſe of Commons voted a large Sum for ſitting out a Fleet for the Reduction of <hi>New-Netherland;</hi> which was accordingly effected, and the whole Country reduced to the Obedience of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> State.</p>
            <p>As the Proprietory of <hi>Maryland</hi> had been granted by the Crown to Lord <hi>Baltimore,</hi> a Roman Catholick, that Nobleman's Son brought over a great Number of reſpectable Popiſh Families from <hi>Ireland:</hi> Theſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013630_0021_0F914804B18736E8"/>
were the actual and primary Settlers of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Therefore, agreeable to <hi>Freeman's</hi> Logick, we muſt Reaſon thus:</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Maryland</hi> being deſcended from the ſame Anceſtors with the Papiſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> have a Right, and ought to enjoy all and ſingular the Privileges and Immunities which Papiſts enjoy in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> being declared by Law incapable of exerciſing any of thoſe Rights or Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which Proteſtants in that Kingdom hold and enjoy.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Inhabitabitants of <hi>Maryland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The manifeſt Abſurdity of ſuch Logick is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conſpicuous. Were I not well ſatiſfied that <hi>Feeman's</hi> Appetite for miniſterial Goods was truly ſickened, I would have concluded his Performance a high finiſhed Stroke in Politicks, to ſubject three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourths of <hi>Americans</hi> to the State of Aliens or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, under the outward Cloak of Patriotiſm. I have only continued that invidious Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> which characterizes the Writer of the Letter to the Deputies, with a View of expoſing the Fallacy of that Principle the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction was created to ſuſtain.</p>
            <p>I believe now I may venture to affirm, that <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Petition of Rights,</hi> the <hi>Bill of Rights,</hi> and the <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> ſerve but to ſhew the unmeaſurable Power of Parliament over the Crown and Dominions of the State. So diſtant are they from generating an Incapacity in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Senate, that they confirm its imperial Authority, I cannot ſufficiently wonder that <hi>Freeman</hi> ſhould
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013630_0022_0F914805FB996E58"/>
overlook the two principal Laws now extant, which eſtabliſh the Subject's Right, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz,</hi>
               </abbr> the 12th <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act. The former removed every Oppreſſion affecting Property, by reducing the Lands of the Kingdom to free, or ſoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage Tenure: The latter effectually ſecured the Perſon of the Subject from every Attack that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny could deviſe. It is therefore well obſerved by a learned Judge, that <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Foreſta,</hi> only pruned off ſome of the out-ſhooting Branches of <hi>Norman</hi> Tyranny: But thoſe two Acts of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign plucked up every Root from which Oppreſſion could by any Poſſibility take Birth. How thoſe two only Monuments of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Freedom ſhould eſcape the Notice of the learned Author of the Letter to the Delegates is inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me: But, when we ſee a String of Laws appealed to, Laws, which, on a proper Information of their Tendency, incontrovertibly damn tha Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of the Appealer, can we poſſibly prevent that riſible <hi>Ton</hi> which every Muſcle of the Face will naturally aſſume?</p>
            <p>Seeing, therefore, that the various Arguments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to limit the taxing Attribute of Parliament have not only failed, but fatally operated to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate its perfect Ability, I will now conſider the Principles of feodal Power, on which the Sovereignty of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> State is founded. <q>Shall an original Sovereignty, long annihilated in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown by common Law, now be permitted to revive by a Fiction, to deſtroy original Rights, expreſsly, and often aſcertained by the Forefathers of the <hi>Americans,</hi> and admitted as often by the Kings of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013630_0023_0F914806DF4F26E8"/>
                  <hi>England?</hi> To expect this, is to think the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> have no reaſoning Faculties.</q> Thus far <hi>Freeman.</hi>

            <p>It is evident, that a very reaſoning Faculty is here required, to form even a diſtant Idea of what this looſe and ungrammatical Jumble of Words would import; yet, leſt it ſhould appear to be the Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Mind totally loſt in the wide Expanſe of Space, I will beg leave to explain its Tendency: Which is, that there does not exiſt a legiſlative Power on Earth warranted with ſufficient Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive a Man of any one original or natural Right which in a State of Nature he is entitled to. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Reaſoning!—has this Phaenomenon been ſent on Earth to recall the original Juriſdiction of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? By a taliſmanick Wave to remit into the Hands of the People, thoſe Powers delegated by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors for the Purpoſe of correcting the ſavage Abuſe of natural Law! Has this <hi>ſpeculum Juſtitiae</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly forgot the firſt Principles of common Law, which Lord <hi>Coke</hi> hath laid down, that no abſolute Property is veſted in a Subject; that every Idea of <hi>allodial</hi> Right ceaſed on the Introduction of the feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Syſtem—a Syſtem on which the King's Right to collect Quit-rent and Crown-rent is founded? and indeed, until the Appearance of this celebrated Letter to the Delegates, was never conteſted. It may not be improper to obſerve, that Ideas of <hi>feodal Sovereignty were actually ſupported by the common Law,</hi> "not annihilated," as <hi>Freeman</hi> aſſerts; and in all Caſes where the Terrors of this lordly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, are now ſuſpended; with Thankfulneſs we muſt attribute it to the Wiſdom of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013630_0024_0F9148077A384818"/>
which paſſed the <hi>Soccage-Act,</hi> in the 12th Year of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign. By this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Law the Lands of the Kingdom were aſcertained to their Proprietors; and Tenants were freed from the vexatious and galling Oppreſſions which took Riſe from the ſlaviſh Tenures their feodal Tyrants ſubjected them to, and were only liable to thoſe Aſſeſſments which Parliament at different Times would judge proper to lay on.</p>
            <p>Principles of <hi>feodal Sovereignty being incorporated with, and ſupported by common Law;</hi> and the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſpringing from ſuch Principles being removed by <hi>Statute Law,</hi> does it not follow, that <hi>Freeman,</hi> not content with ſubjecting one Moiety of the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> to the hard Condition of Aliens or Papiſts, would further deprive the Whole, of thoſe Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from feodal Dominion, which their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren claim under Force of a Statute? Yet, leſt I ſhould be accuſed of Miſrepreſentation in a Matter of this Importance, I think it incumbent on me to quote the Gentleman's own Words.—<q>But ſuppoſing the Poſition to be true, that the common Law not natually operating in <hi>America,</hi> the Crown there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poſſeſſed in Appeals, an original Juriſdiction, upon the Principles of feodal Sovereignty; yet of what Importance can this be in Support of the Juriſdiction, ſince it muſt ceaſe when the common Law operates, which it has long ſince in <hi>America.</hi>
               </q> This ſurely is the moſt unluckly Argument <hi>Freeman</hi> hath hitherto uſed: In whatever extreme of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it is placed in, it will be ſtill found to eſtabliſh feodal Tyranny in <hi>America.</hi> If the common Law did not naturally operate in this Country, in ſuch a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013630_0025_0F9148085D3904A0"/>
Caſe the <hi>Americans</hi> would be ſubject to the Right of feodal Sovereignty claimed by a ſuperior State. If the common Law did naturally operate, we have alſo ſeen it would not have exempted <hi>Americans</hi> from an Obedience with its harſh Dictates. Two Reaſons which can be urged will free this Aſſertion from every Colour of Doubt. The firſt, becauſe the Idea of feodal Juriſdiction <hi>was founded on, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by common Law.</hi> The ſecond, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity it had received, and ſtill continues; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in our Courts, in all Caſes wherein it is not aboliſhed by Statute, both was, and is, given upon the ſuppoſed Idea of being a <hi>municipal Uſage</hi> of the Land. In this Light it operated to an extreme in <hi>England</hi> until the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when an Act paſſed which entirely diſcountenanced all its oppreſſive Severities. It is therefore evident, that the Writer of the Letter to the Delegates hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Nature of the feodal Syſtem, or be could not have been guilty of ſuch a criminal Want of both Accuracy and Attention to the <hi>American</hi> Intereſt in a Point of this high Moment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Americans</hi> cannot be Candidates for more Immunities than their Brethren in <hi>England claim by Law.</hi> Now, unleſs <hi>Freeman</hi> makes it appear that the Law made in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second extends to all the Colonies of <hi>North-America,</hi> it muſt give an incurable Wound to the flattering Hopes I entertained, that the <hi>Americans</hi> were free Men, and entitled to every plenary Right of Exemption from feodal Hardſhip, a Subject reſiding in <hi>England</hi> actually enjoys.</p>

It is not to be here underſtood, that the 12th of <hi>Char.</hi> II. had any farther Tendency than to remove the arbitrary Reſtraint under which the Subject's Property was held, from illegal Stretches of feodal Principles. The Idea was left untouched: It was only the frightful Edifice that was raiſed on this viſionary Foundation. which tumbled beneath that invaluable Law. The Baſis being of a magical Compoſition withſtood the Shock, and indeed could not diſappear without a Repeal of the whole Body of both Statute and Common Law; the great Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of which, in common with the Codes of every Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> are founded on this viſionary Principle. The Happineſs of the Subject was not however compleated by this Law; it is true his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was thereby ſecured; the Safety of his Perſon was not yet provided for: But the thirtieth Year of this Kings Reign produced another Law called the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, which, in Conjunction with the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> effectuated the Redemption of the Subject's Property and Perſon from every Device of Tyranny. Theſe two Laws are the Palladium of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Freedom.</p>
            <p>Were <hi>Freeman</hi>'s Principles adopted, and every genuine Right of Liberty which is eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> made attainable in <hi>America,</hi> it would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the Ruin of many <hi>American</hi> Provinces, as well as the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands. A general Manumiſſion of Negroes is a Doctrine badly calculated for the Meridian of either <hi>America</hi> or the Iſlands; yet it is one of thoſe <hi>original</hi> Rights, the Exerciſe of which all human Forms immediately enjoy, by ſetting a Foot on that happy Territory where Slavery is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to perch.</p>

As the Compliance of the Judges with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for iſſuing Writs of Aſſiſtance, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued and Effect of their Dependance on the Crown; and as the Author of the Letter to the Delegates hath been induced on this Suppoſition to draw a Compariſon between <q>two Sets of Judges <hi>learned in the Law,</hi> the one <hi>Men of Property</hi>—the other, Men without the <hi>viſible Shadow</hi> of Independence,</q> it may not be improper to conſider at large thoſe Reaſons which determined the Judges to comply with the Motion.</p>
            <p>But, before I enter into theſe Conſiderations, it will be neceſſary to take a Review of the ſuperiour Courts of Judicature, eſtabliſhed for the Benefit of the Community, and for the Support of our glorious and excellent Conſtitution, together with the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty of Juſtices appointed by the Royal Order to preſide in each.</p>
            <p>Theſe Courts are divided in two Parts, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Law and Equity: Judges in the former are ſworn, in their Diſpenſation of Juſtice, to be guided by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Statute Law of the Realm. Any wilful Appeal to private Opinion, in their ſolemn Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, where there is a Record which atteſts, or an Act that declares, how the Law in the particular Caſe ſtands, is a criminal Deviation from their Duty, and a flagrant Breach of Oath, for which they are liable to be proſecuted, and moſt ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>However, leaſt a rigorous Determination of a Court of Law ſhould affect the Subject in Caſes wherein he lay expoſed to the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Law; and, as it was <hi>impoſſible</hi> for him to obtain Redreſs from <hi>Judgeſ ſworn</hi> to act <hi>according to Law;</hi> a Court
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013630_0028_0F91480B3A7FD868"/>
of Equity was eſtabliſhed, and endued with Powers to mitigate the Rigour of ſuch Deciſions as appeared not conſiſtent with equitable Principles of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>This ſhort Review of the Duty of Judges being ended, I am now left at Liberty to conſider the Propriety of the Conduct of that <hi>"Set"</hi> of Judges which unanimouſly agreed that Writs of Aſſiſtance ſhould iſſue.</p>
            <p>The Attorney-General moved the Court of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas in <hi>February</hi> Term 1773, for a Writ of this Nature. A Gentleman who took Notes on that Day, hath done me to Favour of communicating to me the Subſtance of the Chief Juſtice's Argument; I will beg leave to inſert it here.</p>
            <p>"Tolls or Duties upon Merchandiſes, now called Cuſtoms, have been long payable to his Majeſty's Predeceſſors, Kings and Queens of <hi>England;</hi> ſo long as to induce many to believe that they were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the King by immemorial Uſage or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. But my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in his 2d <hi>Inſtitute,</hi> Page 58, in his Expoſition of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> clearly demonſtrates, that theſe Cuſtoms derived their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under the Sanction of an Act of Parliament, and were not allowable by common Law; but were firſt granted to the Crown, by the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt, in the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> I. ſo that by this we ſee King's Rights to Cuſtoms eſtabliſhed by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament almoſt 500 Years ſince; and they now conſtitute a Part of the King's extraordinary Revenue. At firſt they were granted for only ſtated Terms of Years; and afterwards to the different Kings for Life, by different Acts of Parliament. I
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013630_0029_0F91480BF7BDAF10"/>
ſhall, however, go no farther back than the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. when the Act of Tonnage and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age paſſed, among the firſt Laws made after the Reſtoration—in the 12th of <hi>Char.</hi> II. Cap. 4. By that Act a Subſidy of Tonnage and Poundage was given to his Majeſty for Life, and the Rates of Merchandiſe were ſettled, as they were then agreed upon, by the Commons in Parliament, and ſigned by their Speaker.</p>
            <p>"The ſame Duties were afterwards granted for Life to <hi>Jac.</hi> II. and <hi>W.</hi> III. And by three different Acts of Parliament made ſince, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 9th <hi>Anne,</hi> Cap. 6, the 1ſt <hi>Geo.</hi> I. Cap. 12, and the 3d <hi>Geo.</hi> I Cap. 7, they are made perpetual; ſo that the King's Right thereto appears to be clear and indiſputable, under the ſeveral Acts of Parliament mentioned."</p>
            <p>"Immediately after the Act of Tonnage and Poundage had paſſed, it became neceſſary to ſecure to the King the Payment of the parliamentary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue granted him by that Act, and to prevent him of being defrauded thereof.</p>
            <p>"And accordingly, by the 12th of the ſame King, Cap. 19, it was enacted, That where Goods liable to Cuſtoms, Subſidy, or other Duties, by the Act of Tonnage and Poundage, ſhall be conveyed away without Entry or Agreement for the Cuſtoms; that on Oath thereof before the Lord Treaſurer, or any of the Barons of the Exchequer, or the chief Magiſtrate of the Port or Place where the Offence was committed, or of the Place next adjoining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it ſhall be lawful for the Lord Treaſurer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to iſſue Warrants to any Perſon, or Perſons, enabling him or them, with Aſſiſtance of a Sheriff, Juſtice
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013630_0030_0F91480CD76CDB50"/>
of Peace, or Conſtable, to enter <hi>any</hi> Houſe by <hi>Day,</hi> where ſuch Goods are <hi>ſuſpected</hi> to be concealed; and in caſe of Reſiſtance, to break open ſuch Houſes and ſeize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all Officers and Miniſters of Juſtice are required to be aiding and aſſiſting thereto.—No Houſe to be entered except within a Month after the Offence is committed; and Damages may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered againſt a falſe Informer.</p>
            <p>"The Remedy provided by this laſt mentioned Act was what was firſt ſuggeſted for ſecuring the Payment of the King's Cuſtoms; but a very ſhort Experience of it ſhewed that it was defective, and did not anſwer the intended Purpoſe; for after an Information received by the Officers of the Cuſtoms, the Time ſpent in taking the neceſſary Steps for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Warrant, generally gave the Offenders an Opportunity of privately conveying away the Goods. A further Act was therefore neceſſary; and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly find, that in leſs than two Years after, an Act was paſſed, entitled, <hi>An Act for preventing Frauds and regulating Abuſes in his Majeſty's Cuſtoms.</hi> It is the 14th <hi>Char.</hi> II. Cap. II. the Preamble of which ſets forth, that, <q>Forasmuch as it appears that ſeveral unlawful and indirect Means and Devices are daily put in Practice, to export and import Goods and Merchandiſes prohibited by the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, as alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the King's moſt excellent Majeſty of his Dues, Cuſtoms and Subſidies, as well by ſecret and deceitful Deſigns, as by open Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence uſed againſt the King's Majeſty's Officers employed in the Affairs of the Cuſtoms; for the better preventing of which Frauds and Violences
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013630_0031_0F91480D72F56CE8"/>
in Time to come,</q> by the ſaid Act, it is among other Things enacted, <q>That it ſhall be lawful for any Perſon or Perſons, authorized by Writ of Aſſiſtance under the Seal of the Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, to take a Conſtable, Headborough, or other publick Officer, being near the Place, and in the Day time to go and enter into any Houſe, Shop, Cellar, Warehouſe, Room or other Place; and in caſe of Reſiſtance, to break open Doors, Cheſts, Trunks, or other Package, there to ſeize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any Kinds of Goods or Merchandiſe prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited and uncuſtomed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"By this Act the Remedy became as complete as poſſible; the Formality of making Oath before the Lord Treaſurer, a Baron of the Exchequer, or a chief Magiſtrate, on every Information of uncuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed or prohibited Goods, is diſpenſed with, and no Time loſt, and as little Opportunity as poſſible given to ſecrete the Goods. Under this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Officers of the Cuſtoms in <hi>England</hi> are conſtantly armed with a Writ of Aſſiſtance, which is iſſued by the Clerk of the Exchequer as a Thing of Courſe, without any particular Application to the Court. Thus the Power of the Cuſtom-Houſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer is given him by Act of Parliament, and the Writ facilitates the Execution thereof: It is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to the Conſtable of the Character and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Officer; and is at the ſame Time a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to the Subject, againſt others who might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that Character, without a Right to aſſume it. By the former Act, the Officer acted under the Authority of any inferior Magiſtrate; his Power now emanates from a higher and more ſolemn Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013630_0032_0F91480E4AA576C0"/>
a Writ under the Seal of the Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer—a Diſobedience to which is a Contempt of the Court.</p>
            <p>"It remains now to be conſidered, how theſe Powers came to be extended to the Officers of his Majeſty's Revenue in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"The firſt Act of Parliament I ſhall take Notice of for this Purpoſe is the 7 &amp; 8 of <hi>Will.</hi> III. Cap. 22. entitled, <hi>An Act for the more effectual preventing of Frauds, and regulating Abuſes in the Plantation-Trade in</hi> America. By this Act, it is among other Things provided, <q>That the Officers for managing and collecting his Majeſty's Revenue, and inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Plantation-Trade in any of the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> ſhall have the ſame Powers and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to viſit and ſearch Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to enter Houſes or Warehouſes, to ſearch for, and ſeize, prohibited or uncuſtomed Goods; and, that the like Aſſiſtance ſhall be given to the ſaid Officers, in the Execution of their Office, as by the 14th <hi>Char.</hi> II. is provided for the Officers in <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>"By this Act, it is evident the Intention of the Legiſlature was to cloath the Cuſtom-Houſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in <hi>America</hi> with the ſame Powers as thoſe in <hi>England.</hi> But as the 14 <hi>Char.</hi> II. directs the Writs of Aſſiſtance to iſſue from the Court of Exchequer, and as ſuch Courts are not generally eſtabliſhed in <hi>America,</hi> for that Reaſon it became a Doubt whether any other Court could legally iſſue ſuch Writs.</p>
            <p>"This made a further Act of Parliament neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Accordingly, by the 7th <hi>Geo.</hi> III. Cap. 46, after reciting the 14th <hi>Char.</hi> II. the 7 &amp; 8 <hi>Will.</hi> III. and then reciting, That no Authority being expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013630_0033_0F91480F03F4F080"/>
given by the Act of King <hi>William,</hi> to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Court to grant ſuch Writs of Aſſiſtance for the Officers in the Plantations, it is doubted, whether ſuch Officers can legally enter Houſes, and other Places on Land, to ſearch for the ſeize Goods in the Manner directed by the ſaid recited Acts. <q>To obviate ſuch Doubts for the future, and in order to carry the Intention of the ſaid recited Acts into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffectual Execution, it is enacted by the 7th <hi>Geo.</hi> III. That from and after the 20th of <hi>November</hi> 1767, ſuch Writs of Aſſiſtance, to authorize and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Officers of his Majeſty's Cuſtoms, to enter, and go into any Houſe, Warehouſe, Shop, Cellar, or other Place, in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies or Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> to ſearch for, and ſeize, prohibited and uncuſtomed Goods, in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner directed by the ſaid recited Acts, ſhall, and may be granted by the ſuperior or ſupreme Court of Juſtice, having Juriſdiction within ſuch Colony or Plantation reſpectively.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt Act, therefore, places the Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Doubt. It is a polar Star by which, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Oath of Office, the Opinion of Law-Judges muſt be guided, and their Determination concluded. It leaves not the ſmalleſt Opening for a ſhuffling Diſpoſition <hi>to run with the Hare, and hunt with the Hound.</hi> A poſitive Refuſal of a Judge to comply with an Act of Parliament, is a violent Breach of the Truſt repoſed in him, and includes a Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for high and mighty Crimes and Miſdemeanours.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Reaſons which influenced the Chief Juſtice to comply with the Motion. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013630_0034_0F91480FF0F37E80"/>
Acquaintance with the various Laws relating to the Cuſtoms, from the earlieſt Period to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Time, informed this Ornament of the Bench how the Law ſtood; and a <hi>Conſcience not ungrateful</hi> to the Remembrance of a ſolemn Oath, conſtrained him to determine according to Law. The three Aſſiſtant-Judges, Meſſrs. <hi>Savage, Coſlett,</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> concurred unanimouſly in this Deciſion, and gave weighty and ſubſtantial Reaſons for coinciding with the Chief Juſtice's Opinion. Even Mr. Juſtice <hi>Fewtrell</hi> (whoſe Conduct is miſrepreſented by <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> on this Occaſion) entertained no Doubt of the <hi>Legality</hi> of iſſuing Writs of Aſſiſtance; and only heſitated in concurring with the other Judges from an Uncertainty which was the ſuperior Court of Juſtice, the Court of Chancery or the Court of Common-Pleas; a Doubt which would have been entirely removed, by an Appeal to the Deciſion of all the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> on a Queſtion propoſed by the Lord Chancellor <hi>Talbot, Anno</hi> 1735, which was the ſupreme Court of Juſtice in the Kingdom. The Houſe of Lords and the King's Bench were declared to be the two ſupreme Courts of Juſtice<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Obſervations on Lord <hi>Ferrers'</hi>s Trial before the Lords.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Having taken a comprehenſive View of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which conſtrained one "Set" of Judges, "Men without the <hi>viſible Shadow</hi> of Independence" to grant thoſe Writs, it will be only fair to conſider what Motives could reſtrain another "Set" of Judges, <hi>Men of Property,</hi> from iſſuing ſuch Writs. But, before I proceed further, it will not be amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>Freeman</hi> might have been contented with holding up his own Conduct to publick Ridicule,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013630_0035_0F91481074879220"/>
without introducing the Names of other Gentlemen to ſhare a Part of his Calamity. It is with Regret I anſwer this Paſſage in his Letter, as I am neceſſitated to analyze ſomewhat unfavourably thereon; yet, perhaps, my Method of cenſuring may do the Gentlemen at leaſt as much Honour, as the ill-favoured Eulogiums beſtowed on them by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Letter to the Delegates.</p>
            <p>The firſt Motive, therefore, which naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, why Judges, <hi>Men of Property,</hi> in a mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Colony like this, ſhould determine contrary to <hi>written Law,</hi> might ariſe from a partial Adherence to Self-Intereſt. The <hi>beſt</hi> of Men, as Times now run, are induced to take every Step of aggrandizing their Fortunes. The Spirit of accumulating Dollars, when added to that diſſolving Satisfaction of Mind which a free born Subject of <hi>America</hi> taſtes in ſeeing a ſtately Slave ſtand on every Perch of his extenſive Plantation, is ſomewhat allayed by the bitter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paying Tribute to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> I may with Truth here add, that our Brethren in <hi>England</hi> would heartily concur with <hi>Americans,</hi> in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of paying neither Taxes or Cuſtoms (with which it muſt be allowed they are heavily laden) were they not compelled by the poſitive Injunction of a ſuperior Power, and with which, as inferiors, they are bound to comply.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon, why <hi>they refuſed</hi> to grant thoſe Writs, is humourouſly related by <hi>Freeman;</hi> becauſe the Opinion of the Bench was guided by <hi>Rawlins Lowndes,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who, <hi>Freeman</hi> aſſerts, was not bred regularly to the Profeſſion of the Law; and the other Judges went to School to Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:013630_0036_0F914813DF5E3A48"/>
who taught them to quaff ſuch large Draughts of Law, as quickly enabled them to <hi>adminiſter Juſtice with publick Approbation.</hi> This is, I think, the richeſt and moſt expreſſive Deſcription of Quackery that ever caught my Attention. Indeed Empyriſm is diſplayed with ſuch <hi>Pathos,</hi> that I would have conſidered it in no other Light than of a <hi>Burleſque</hi> on the "Set" of learned Judges referred to, was I not ſenſible that the ingenious Author of the Letter to the to the Delegates, intended, <hi>ſub ficto nomine,</hi> to be the Herald of his own Fame, and by the Side-Wind of his <hi>Eulogium</hi> on the great Abilities of Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> "who had never eat Commons at the Temple," formed a Deſign to eſtabliſh an Idea of his own <hi>uncommon</hi> Powers, by the ſole Strength of which he hath been enabled to make ſuch a rapid Progreſs in <hi>Law-Story,</hi> without the <hi>vulgar</hi> Aid of a <hi>Temple-</hi> Erudition.</p>
            <p>I can now ſincerely aver, that nothing but a warm Wiſh of promoting an Union between the Mother-Country and her Colonies, induced me to anſwer the mad Arguments of a Man, who, ſoured by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, would widen the Breach of Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: But, <hi>Americans!</hi> reſume your Underſtanding, and diſcountenance every Deſign of Faction. Famed as you are for Juſtice, Humanity and Honour; it would ill become Men, juſtly celebrated for ſuch godlike Virtues, to ſubmit their Judgment as a Prey for Artifice to ſport with; or to ſuffer their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be diverted into any Channel but that which alone can render them a great and flouriſhing People.</p>
            <p>Imperial <hi>Rome,</hi> which once gave Law to the World, fell by publick Diſcontents, as much as by

Debauchery. Whilſt the <hi>Romans</hi> continued a firm united People, they extended their Conqueſts over the Earth; but when Faction reared its Head, and Perſons thought it their Intereſt to embrace Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, ambitious Men were not wanting to keep theſe Breaches open: It was then the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Virtue began to decline. Publick Offices, which were in the Gift of the People, were generally filled by their deſigning Leaders; indeed the moſt flagrant and turbulent Characters were commonly preferred. The guilty Cuſtom drawing into an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment, ſoon rendered the Air of <hi>Italy</hi> too polluted for <hi>Freedom</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> to dwell in; they therefore winged their Way: By which Flight the <hi>Romans</hi> loſt themſelves and the Empire of the World together.</p>
