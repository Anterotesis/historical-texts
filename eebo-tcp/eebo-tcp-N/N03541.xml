            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEING aſſembled here on ſuch a ſolemn Occaſion, when we have before us a <hi>ſorrowful Spectacle,</hi> one of our Fellow-Creatures under a Sentence of Death, for his Crimes committed, to be ſpeedily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; it is very fit it ſhould be accompanied with the <hi>Word of God and Prayer</hi>; that when ſuch a numerous Audience of Chriſtians are together, not out of Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we truſt, but in a ſerious Frame, with their Hearts affected, to conſider the ſorrowful Effects of Sin, and what <hi>Folly is in the Hearts of the Children of Men while they live,</hi> and how ſoon for it, <hi>they go down to the dead</hi>; that they, as well as the Perſon himſelf, may receive ſome <hi>ſeaſonable Divine Inſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having bin deſir'd by the <hi>Reverend Paſtor</hi> of the Church in this <hi>Town,</hi> to ſtand in his Place on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I have turned my Tho'ts on this ſerious Subject,— the <hi>Words</hi> which I have now read unto you; which ſuggeſt unto us ſome of the moſt affecting Motives <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> engage Perſons againſt any manner of Irregularity, and that we ſhould always <hi>ſtand in awe, and not ſin againſt God.</hi> This is the Improvement we ſhould make of the <hi>Inſtances</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> executed upon Men for their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and of the Admonitions and Warnings of the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004326_0004_100414D75540A4B0"/>
               <hi>Word,</hi> in both which <hi>the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt the Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter, which is the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of <hi>Job</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with his <hi>Friends,</hi> he makes a very large and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Defence</hi> of his Innocence and Integrity, and that he was clear of the Crimes that his Friends either charg'd upon him, or might ſuppoſe him to be guilty of; which was not in way of Oſtentation, but juſt and neceſſary Vindication of himſelf. Happy the Man whoſe Heart was thus upright towards God! This was his Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>day of evil.</hi>—I ſhall not ſtay to conſider the Particulars in which this holy Man acquits himſelf.— The Words of the <hi>Text</hi> come in as the Reaſon why he avoided all <hi>harſh or ſevere</hi> Dealing towards his <hi>Servants,</hi> which were very numerous. He conſidered God as <hi>his Judge,</hi> as well as <hi>his and their Creator,</hi> (v. 15.) and therefore he would not do any <hi>unequal or unrighteous</hi> thing to them.— Upon this Suppoſal, or if I ſhould do ſo—<hi>what then ſhould I do when God riſeth up?</hi>—&amp;c. God ſo ſuperiour to me and all Men, of infinite Power, and inflexible Juſtice!</p>
            <p>In this and divers other Paſſages in the Chapter, he ſhews the Reaſon of his <hi>eſchewing Evil</hi>: It was becauſe he had a devout Regard to God, and
<q>feared him, and that his Piety was at the Bottom of his Juſtice and Charity, and this (as one <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> well obſerves) crowns the Proof of his Sincerity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To give ſome Explication of the Words—</p>
            <p>—<hi>When God riſeth up</hi>—Such Poſtures of ſitting and riſing—, are attributed to God, only figuratively, or after our manner of ſpeaking. God is ſaid to <hi>ſit on his Throne,</hi> in Alluſion to earthly <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> who ſit and hear Cauſes, and give Sentence. "And he may be ſaid to <hi>riſe up,</hi> when he proceeds to <hi>execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> To <hi>riſe up,</hi> notes <hi>readineſs</hi> to Speech or Action"<note n="†" place="bottom">C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ryl <hi>on</hi> Job.</note>. God's riſing up means the <hi>manifeſtation of his Purpoſe,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004326_0005_10043FF77B157D00"/>
the <hi>actuating</hi> of his Power. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> prays, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Riſe up, Lord, and let thine Enemies be ſcattered.</hi> And thus his Church are taught to pray, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.1. When any expoſe themſelves to God's Diſpleaſure by Sin, they have Reaſon to put this trembling Queſtion to themſelves, <hi>What ſhall I do, when God riſeth up?</hi> The Expreſſion imports, 1. <hi>Enquiry,</hi> as one asking Counſel and Advice, not knowing what to do. Or, 2. It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, or is the Language of Grief and Trouble, as one bemoaning his ſad Condition, perplexed with the Tho'ts of what he has done, or the Fears of what he ſhall ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To viſit is, in Scripture Senſe, 1. ſometimes to <hi>ſhew Favour</hi> and Kindneſs, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.68. <hi>God hath viſited</hi> and redeemed his People—, and v. 78. This was a moſt gracious Viſit indeed.</p>
            <p>It is not meant in this Senſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To viſit is to manifeſt Diſpleaſure, and to <hi>execute Judgment.</hi> Exod. 32.34. Nevertheleſs, <hi>in the day when I viſit, I will</hi> viſit <hi>their Sin upon them.</hi> i. e. In way of Puniſhment; they ſhall ſuffer the ſorrowful Effects of their Sin. And <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.9. and</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſignifies to <hi>call to an Account.</hi> This is the Office of a Superiour towards thoſe under his Charge and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.9.)</p>
            <p>In this and the ſecond Senſe this Expreſſion may be underſtood. And the <hi>Queſtion</hi> imports, that he ſhould not be able to anſwer when God ſhould call him to an Account, for any contemptuous Treatment or <hi>Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>: That he could not <hi>excuſe</hi> himſelf, nor expect to eſcape his righteous Judgment, nor could he deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of his righteous Hand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not conſider the Words with the reference they have to thoſe juſt preceeding, but as carrying in them a powerful <hi>Reſtraint</hi> from <hi>all manner</hi> of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine.</hi> They are very weighty Queſtions, which Perſons ſhould put cloſely to themſelves, as a good Means to prevent their ſinning, —<hi>What they ſhall do
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004326_0006_100411BB63704FB8"/>
when God riſeth up? and when he viſiteth, what they ſhall anſwer him?</hi> Or,</p>
            <p>That <hi>the ſerious Conſideration of God's viſiting and judging Perſons for their Sins, would be a happy Means to prevent their ſinning againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 23d. v. of this Chapter, <hi>Job,</hi> to the like Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, profeſſes, <hi>Deſtruction from God was a Terrour to me!</hi> Well may it be ſo: It is ſo to Nature, and it is ſo to a gracious Soul.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>ſervile Fear</hi> in ſome, avoiding Evil, or <hi>Sin,</hi> only for fear of Evil or <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> But there is alſo a <hi>filial Fear,</hi> which ſhould be laboured for and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. This ſanctified Affection is attempered with Love to God, and does not afflict and diſquiet the Soul in its way, but keeps it from wandering out of the <hi>way of Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is becauſe Men don't <hi>conſider,</hi> that they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Judgments of God. The want of Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is the great Miſery of Men! They <hi>conſider not that they do evil.</hi> And they conſider not what will <hi>be the Conſequences</hi> of their doing evil: And ſo they dare to <hi>omit</hi> the Duties which God requires of them, and to <hi>Tranſgreſs</hi> his ſacred Laws. Divine Counſels and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions prevail not, to any good Purpoſe, becauſe they do not ſet themſelves to ponder and conſider. This is God's complaint of his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my People doth not conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are very weighty Conſiderations which God ſets before Men to keep them in awe, that they might not dare to ſin againſt him; ſufficient to over balance their corrupt Inclinations, and the ſtrongeſt Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they are expoſed to; but this is their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, they will not <hi>apply</hi> their Hearts thereunto. It would ſurely be of very powerful Tendency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Men's ſinning, if they would ſeriouſly conſider, <hi>What they ſhould do in the end thereof</hi>! as <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.31.</p>

That ſuch Tho'ts will lead them into the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that their <hi>Probation Time will come to an end.</hi> That there will certainly be an <hi>end of their Time,</hi> and Action, and manner of Life. God hath placed Men here on Earth in a ſtate of <hi>Trial for Eternity.</hi> They have a great Buſineſs to do, and but a ſhort Time to do it in. There is a Time and Seaſon for every lawful Buſineſs Men have to proſecute, but none for Sin. If Men would but conſider, ſurely they muſt conclude, that God in <hi>whoſe Hands their Breath is, and whoſe are all their Ways,</hi> will bring their Opportunities to a Period; and that they know not how ſoon: That he will not wait al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and it may be not long. A few Weeks or Days, or for ought they know, an <hi>Hour</hi> may bring them to an End. If they preſs'd home this Tho't; God ſhall not always be as one ſtill and ſilent; he will put a Period to their Days, and then as there ſhall be an End of all their worldly Enjoyments and Purſuits, of all their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Gratifications, of all their Sports and Pleaſures, ſo alſo of all their <hi>Advantages</hi> of ſeeking the Favour of God, and making Proviſion for their Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this leads them to conſider that a righteous God will call them <hi>to an Account</hi> for all that they do. This is the Purport of the Words—, <hi>When God riſeth up, and when he viſiteth</hi>—. And this may refer to <hi>three</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Periods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) God does often <hi>in this Life</hi> reckon with Men, or manifeſt his Diſpleaſure for their Sins, in the <hi>Strokes of his Hand upon them.</hi> Thus the <hi>Lord is known by the Judgments which he executes. (Pſal.</hi> 9.16.) He ſaith concerning his People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things</hi>—? And Ch. 14.10. <hi>I will remember their Iniquity, and viſit their Sin—. Hoſ.</hi> 9.9. Sometimes he viſits them in Wrath, and puniſhes them in his ſore Diſpleaſure; ſometimes in Mercy, and to reduce them from the Error of their Ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32. He hath a great variety of Methods whereby he viſits and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes them for their Sins in this Life, as he threatned
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004326_0008_100453694A720AB0"/>
them <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.14—39. He brings Wars, Scarcity, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and ſometimes ſore &amp; mortal Sickneſs, <hi>ſore Sickneſs, and of long continuance,</hi> and all to vindicate his own Name and Honour, becauſe Men would not conſider their Ways, and turn from their Sins.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) God viſits all Men at the <hi>Day of Death.</hi> And this ſometimes by the Hand of <hi>Humane Juſtice,</hi> or by his own immediate Hand—. It may be ſuitable on this Occaſion, to mention <hi>ſuch Crimes</hi> as the Laws of this Land have made <hi>Capital,</hi> or to be puniſhed with <hi>Death.</hi> Poſſibly it may prevent ſome Perſons ſinning in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Danger.— As, the <hi>murdering</hi> of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is to be puniſhed with <hi>Death,</hi> by the Laws of God, and the Laws of all civilized Nations. And a Woman being delivered when <hi>alone</hi> of a <hi>ſpurious Child,</hi> tho' the Child may happen to be <hi>ſtill born,</hi> or <hi>die,</hi> yet ſhe is liable to ſuffer as a <hi>Murderer,</hi> not calling for Help. So the <hi>burning</hi> of a dwelling <hi>Houſe,</hi> or other Houſe or Parcel thereof, or any Houſe built for <hi>publick Uſe,</hi> any Barn having Corn, Grain or Hay therein, any Mill, Malt-Houſe, Store-Houſe, Shop or Shops, when done wilfully by any Perſon above the Age of Sixteen Years, the ſame is adjudg'd a <hi>Felon,</hi> and to ſuffer the <hi>Pains of Death.</hi> And ſo the abominable Sin of <hi>Buggery,</hi> with Mankind or Beaſt, and the Sin of <hi>Rape or Raviſhment</hi>; as alſo <hi>Polygamy,</hi> or having more than one Wife at the ſame Time—. For <hi>Treaſon</hi> of any kind, and particularly <hi>counterfeiting the King's Great or Privy Seal</hi>: For <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the Seal of the Province</hi>: For counterfeiting the <hi>Bills of publick Credit.—Aſſault and Robbery</hi> upon a <hi>ſecond Conviction.</hi> And for <hi>Burglary,</hi> or a Perſon's break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and entring a Dwelling Houſe in the Night, with a felonious Intent to rob or ſteal, or do any other Felony, being convicted thereof, ſhall <hi>ſuffer the Pains of Death.</hi> For which Crime the <hi>poor Priſoner</hi> here, has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd to ſuffer Death.</p>
            <p>But if it be by the Hand of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, or in what Manner ſoever, it is an awful <hi>Viſit</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004326_0009_10045413E33F8B58"/>
to every unrighteous Man, every impenitent Sinner; for then the <hi>Reward of his Hand ſhall be given him.</hi> Iſa. 3.11. We are aſſured concerning Men in common, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27.) <hi>It is appointed unto Men once to die, and after that the Judgment.</hi> Tho' we know not what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Proceſs</hi> there ſhall be at Death, yet this we are ſufficiently aſſur'd of from many Paſſages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that every particular Perſon's Judgment is paſs'd <hi>at Death,</hi> and their State irreverſibly determined by the glorious Judge. The <hi>Spirits of the juſt</hi> are <hi>made perfect,</hi> and the Souls of the wicked are preſently ſent into the Place of Torments. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The great Judge will come to <hi>viſit</hi> and call all Men to an Account <hi>at the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> This we are plainly aſſured of in the <hi>ſacred Oracles,</hi> that God ſhall judge both the Righteous and the wicked. God <hi>hath appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs.</hi> Act. 17.31. No Man ſhall eſcape this Judgment of God. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat of Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. Then the <hi>Books ſhall be opened,</hi> and all that have liv'd and died from <hi>Adam</hi> to the end of Time, ſhall be judged out of them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. This was what the World was warned of ſo long ago as the Days of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Jude, v. 14,15. Thus there will be a ſtrict Account taken what <hi>Rules</hi> they have tranſgreſſed, what Bonds and Obligations they have vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, what <hi>Evils</hi> they have done, and what <hi>Duties</hi> they have left undone. Then Sinners muſt <hi>ſtand forth</hi> before the vaſt Multitude, however reluctant, miſerable and aſhamed they may be! Then they ſhall be call'd to an Account how they have improv'd the <hi>outward En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments</hi> God gave them; whether they honoured the Lord with their Subſtance, and were <hi>juſt and honeſt</hi> in all their Dealings and Concerns with Men. Whether they were <hi>merciful, kind and charitable</hi>; — and how they govern'd their <hi>bodily Appetites</hi> and Inclinations; whether they were <hi>ſober, chaſt and temperate</hi>; and whether they were good and faithful and obliging in the ſeveral <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004326_0010_1004537606C92EC0"/>
they ſuſtained; and how they improved their <hi>Time,</hi> and eſpecially their <hi>Seaſons of Grace,</hi> their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> they receiv'd; and whether they made <hi>Religion</hi> the main Buſineſs.— Nothing will be then forgotten, nothing can be hid from the Eyes of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient Judge! In Sum, we are taught <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.14. <hi>God ſhall bring into Judgment every Work, with every ſecret Thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi> Then the Lord who is <hi>a God of Knowledge,</hi> and by whom <hi>Actions are weighed,</hi> (1 Sam. 2.3.) and who knows <hi>all Hearts,</hi> will not only diſcover "who and what was good, and what "was bad, but <hi>how good</hi> and <hi>how bad,</hi> every thing was, that was done by Men.</p>
            <p>And in this <hi>great Audit,</hi> this <hi>Viſitation Day,</hi> who will be able to anſwer! We are aſſured that the <hi>ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the Judgment.</hi> The Lord <hi>acknowledgeth the way of the Righteous</hi>; only thoſe ſhall be in Safety, who have a Principle of Holineſs wrought in them, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them.</p>
            <p>Would not ſuch Tho'ts cloſely preſs'd upon the Mind, greatly reſtrain Perſons from all Ways of Sin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Repentance for Sin?</p>
            <p n="3">3. By ſuch Tho'ts they would be led to diſcern the <hi>Vanity</hi> and Inſufficiency of thoſe <hi>Pleas and Excuſes,</hi> whereby they endeavour to quiet themſelves in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neglects and Tranſgreſſions. Sometimes Perſons excuſe themſelves that they were drawn and enticed into Sin by <hi>inſnaring Companions</hi>: And it is too true, that this has bin the Bane of many a one! But if they would conſider, that God takes Notice of their Sins, and will <hi>riſe up againſt them</hi> in his ſore Diſpleaſure, and not ſuffer their Iniquity to go unpuniſhed; would not this be more powerful to reſtrain them, than any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements can be to allure them? Surely they would rather hearken to <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 1.10. <hi>My Son, if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners entice thee, conſent thou not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Temptations of airy <hi>Honour,</hi> of worldly <hi>Gains,</hi> of ſenſual <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> can be of equal Force with theſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004326_0011_1004541E2C039BD0"/>
Conſiderations? Which muſt convince Men, that to ſin againſt God, is <hi>to wrong their own Souls,</hi> and practically to <hi>chuſe Death</hi>! And what is the Honour that is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Sin? Superficial and vaniſhing now, and which will end in <hi>Shame and everlaſting Contempt</hi>! What is that Pleaſure worth, or how dear bought, which is but ſhort liv'd, and will end in <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> and everlaſting Pain? And what are the Gains of <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> and Fraud, <hi>Stealth and Robbery,</hi> which bring a Blaſt and Curſe from God, and for which the righteous Judge ſhall caſt them <hi>into the Priſon of Hell?</hi> Rom. 6.21. <hi>What Fruit had ye then of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? for the end of thoſe things is Death.</hi> Mat. 16.26. <hi>What is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as theſe Tho'ts would ſerve to arm Men againſt vicious and wicked Practices, ſo alſo to <hi>Silence</hi> their fooliſh <hi>Excuſes</hi> for Sloth and <hi>negligence in Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are tempted or diſpoſed to put away ſerious Tho'ts as <hi>uncomfortable and melancholy</hi>; or if they have ſome concern about forſaking their Sins and turning to God, they ſtumble at the <hi>Difficulties of Repentance and Converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But would not theſe Tho'ts convince Men, that it will be far more <hi>difficult and hard</hi> to bear the Diſpleaſure and Wrath of an <hi>angry God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would they quiet themſelves with the Excuſe that they are <hi>weak and impotent</hi> to Good, and ſo ſit ſtill? Would not the Tho'ts of God's Anger, and that they muſt ſtand before his <hi>dread Tribunal,</hi> make them uſe their utmoſt Endeavours, and cry to him for Pity and Help?</p>
            <p>Would Men content themſelves in their <hi>Neglect</hi> with this Pretence, That it is <hi>uncertain</hi> whether they ſhall ſpeed, whether they ſhall obtain Grace if they ſeek it? If they had theſe ſerious Tho'ts, that they ſhall <hi>certainly</hi> be rejected and condemned if they do not, would they not ſet themſelves to improve a bare Probability, a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure</hi> that God <hi>may grant them Repentance unto Life</hi>?
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004326_0012_1004537E8DFFEC60"/>
And eſpecially be excited to take hold of the gracious <hi>Encouragements</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would they flatter themſelves with <hi>Purpoſes of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hereafter,</hi> and live careleſs in their Delays? Surely theſe Tho'ts cloſely applied would rouze them. If they conſidered that <hi>God is angry with the wicked every Day,</hi> and his Judgments may ſpeedily break forth upon them, <hi>and Death</hi> overtake them; they would not dare to <hi>boaſt of to Morrow,</hi> when they knew not what a Day may bring forth; but to <hi>Day they would hear his Voice, and not harden their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſolemn Tho'ts would ſerve to bear down all vain Pleas and Excuſes, whereby Men too often quiet themſelves in their <hi>Negligence and Impenitency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly. As theſe Tho'ts would naturally lead them to apprehend ſomething of the <hi>Greatneſs and Dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Puniſhment</hi> which God will inflict upon Sinners. Our Lord and Judge hath told us beforehand for our Warning, what will be the terrible Sentence pronounced upon Sinners in the great Day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. and after that the Puniſhment which will follow, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. This Puniſhment will fall upon both Body and Soul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.28. —Fear him who can <hi>deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell.</hi> Mark 9.44. —<hi>where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miſery is ſet forth in <hi>Scripture,</hi> by the moſt awful diſtreſſing and afflicting Things in Nature, to ſignify the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of it, and that we might know that nothing can fully repreſent the <hi>Dreadfulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Wrath of God.</hi> Their Pains will far exceed all the Pains and Miſeries in this World! Such as to extort the moſt bitter Outcries and Lamentations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.42. —<hi>Shall caſt them into a Furnace of Fire, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will not know how to <hi>bear</hi> the Torment, neither can they any way <hi>ſhun or eſcape it</hi>; and the <hi>Everlaſting Duration</hi> adds to the greatneſs of it. There will be no Intermiſſion of their Miſery, no Period, it will abide for ever!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004326_0013_1004542395C0F840"/>If Sinners would ſeriouſly conſider theſe Things, would they not own, that it is a <hi>fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God?</hi> Heb. 10.31. And would not ſuch Reflections make them afraid to offend him, and convince them that it is the Extremity of Folly and Madneſs, for the ſake of the mean and temporary Gains or Pleaſures of Sin, to expoſe themſelves to ſuch tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Evils!</p>
            <p>Uſe 1. We learn, that they are very <hi>faulty and fooliſh,</hi> who do not take it into their <hi>ſerious Conſideration, That God will viſit them for their Sins, or bring them into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; yet we have Reaſon to think that there are many ſuch: tho' they wear the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and profeſs to own the Truths of the Goſpel, and often hear the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of it, reaſoning of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Temperance and a Judgment to come,</hi> yet they neglect the great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, and go on in their Sins. Tho' ſome may be ſtarted as <hi>Felix</hi> was; yet they get rid of the Tho'ts, and chuſe to give themſelves a Liberty to <hi>walk in the Ways of their Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are purſuing <hi>Earthly Things,</hi> and their carnal Affections carry their Tho'ts and Affections after ſuch Objects. Some make <hi>Proviſion for the Fleſh,</hi> to fulfil the Luſts of it, and are indulging their ſenſual Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Some have <hi>ſecret Hopes that there is no Occaſion</hi> for ſuch Tho'ts, and flatter themſelves that they <hi>ſhall have Peace, tho' they add Drunkenneſs to Thirſt,</hi> Deut. 29.19.</p>
            <p>Some are <hi>afraid</hi> to entertain ſuch ſerious Tho'ts, and ſtrive to divert them; and would not ſuffer them to lodge within them; becauſe they bring a damp upon their Spirits, and render their Pleaſures inſipid, and make their Enjoyments look with a gloomy Aſpect.</p>
            <p>But certainly all ſuch are greatly to blame, as they deſpiſe God's Authority and Government, ſo they <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly injure</hi> their own Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I might have inferred, That the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt had need, after his Example, <hi>to be frequently putting

Sinners in mind of theſe Things,</hi> That God will viſit and judge them, as a <hi>great Means</hi> to <hi>reſtrain</hi> them from Sin, to promote <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to <hi>prepare</hi> them to receive the Offers of the Goſpel. But I ſhall only further apply what hath been offer'd, in a</p>

What will comfort you? Will the Gain counter-ballance the Loſs?</p>
            <p>And ſuch as avoid theſe more enormous Crimes, yet are liable to ſuffer the Judgments of God. You know for what ſinful Diſorder and <hi>Irreverence,</hi> the Apoſtle told the <hi>Corinthians, many are weak and ſickly among you, and many fallen aſleep.</hi> (1 Cor. 11.30.)</p>
            <p>For the Sins of the People of <hi>this Land,</hi> God hath been viſiting us with a <hi>ſtrange Puniſhment</hi> in many parts of it.

What will you do when you ſhall ſee Death ſuddenly ſeizing your tender Off-ſpring, your <hi>beloved Children,</hi> and threatning yourſelves? To whom will you flee for Help? You may flee to your Friends and Neighbours, or to the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> but all Help will fail if God will not help you, as ver. 4. <hi>Without me, they ſhall bow down, — and ſhall fall under the Slain.</hi> Will you not then bewail your Sins, whereby you have diſpleaſed the Lord? And

why not <hi>now,</hi> renounce them, and get into a State of Reconciliation with God? that you may not have the <hi>Terrors of an accuſing Conſcience</hi> to grapple with, beſides the afflicting Strokes of God's Hand!</p>
            <p n="2">2. What will you <hi>do in the Day of Death?</hi> when the Lord of Life ſhall ſend the <hi>King of Terrors to viſit you?</hi> And the Time will certainly and may ſpeedily come: It haſteneth greatly as the ſwift Moments flee away!</p>

            <p n="3">3. Laſtly. What will you do, in <hi>that great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Day of the Lord?</hi> When he comes to Judgment, <hi>what will you anſwer him,</hi> if you die in your Sins?</p>
            <p>When you ſhall ſee the Son of God <hi>coming in his Glory, and with the Glory of the Father, and all the holy Angels!</hi> (Mat, 25.31.) When he ſhall make his <hi>laſt Viſit</hi> to this Earth, to determine the State of every Man according to his Works.— Will not your Heart and Fleſh tremble to think, how <hi>you have ſlighted and deſpiſed him?</hi> —To think how ungratefully you refuſed his moſt <hi>gracious Offers,</hi> and would not obey his moſt reaſonable

Commands! O how terrible to have your only Saviour your <hi>Enemy?</hi> To whom can you flee for Help? We are told, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Behold he cometh with Clouds, and every Eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo who pierced him, and all kindreds of the Earth ſhall wail becauſe of him!</hi> And how is their Diſtreſs repreſented, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16, 17?</p>
            <p>And what will you do, how will you bear it, when you <hi>ſhall ſee the Saints</hi> at his <hi>right Hand in Robes of Glory</hi>? (Mat. 25.33.) and ſome perhaps, that have been of your <hi>Relatives</hi> or <hi>Acquaintance</hi> in this World, to think that you had the ſame Opportunities and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and Offers of Life that they had, but indulg'd your Sin and Sloth, and loſt alas! your precious Seaſon, and your <hi>Souls!</hi> Luk. 13.28. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth! when ye ſhall ſee Abraham and Iſaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of God, and you yourſelves thruſt out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the all-knowing Judge ſhall bring all your <hi>Sins to your Remembrance,</hi> and <hi>ſet them in order before your Eyes,</hi> what will you do? how will you anſwer him? when Conſcience will witneſs againſt you, thus and thus you have <hi>done,</hi> and theſe and thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> you have left undone! Whatever Pleas and Excuſes Sinners quiet themſelves with now, they will have no <hi>Cloak nor Excuſe</hi> for their Sin then.

            <p>And what will you do when you ſhall hear the <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence pronounced,</hi> from the glorious Judge, as the <hi>laſt Word</hi> to the wicked.—The Voice of God on <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> made the People <hi>tremble</hi>; but how much <hi>more amazing</hi> will that be, (Mat. 25.41.) <hi>Depart ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels!</hi>—Every Word carries <hi>Terror</hi> in it, and given forth with Majeſty and Authority from the <hi>Lord God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi>; it will be far more terrible than the <hi>loudeſt

Thunder,</hi> or roaring <hi>Earthquake!</hi> O what unutterable Horror, Confuſion and Anguiſh will fill your Souls!</p>
            <p>And when preſently the tremendus <hi>Doom</hi> is <hi>executed</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, then with what amazing Diſpair will Sinners cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> O how will you be able to bear the <hi>loſs of all Good</hi>? How will you be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <hi>ſuffering of all Evil?</hi> when you'l have no Friend to ſupport you, no Hope to relieve or comfort you for ever!</p>
            <p>Such as will <hi>ſeriouſly conſider</hi> theſe Things now, and call their Souls to an Account, would ſurely <hi>Reſolve</hi> by the Strength of Chriſt, to forſake and ſtrive and watch <hi>againſt Sin,</hi> and attend their Duty, and earneſtly endeavour to get into <hi>good Terms</hi> with God, or elſe they muſt be ſtupid and hardened, and not afraid of the Wrath of the Almighty!</p>
            <p>And may the Sight of this unhappy <hi>Criminal,</hi> here in <hi>Chains,</hi> and preſently to ſuffer the <hi>Pains of Death,</hi> and to appear before the glorious <hi>Judge of all the Earth,</hi>— give an Edge to theſe Meditations, and fix them with <hi>laſting Impreſſions</hi> on all our Hearts: If ſo, our Attendance here will not be Time ſpent in vain.

            <p>Think how you have proceeded from Step to Step in Sin, until you provoked God to leave you to your own <hi>Hearts Luſts</hi>; to indulge your covetous Deſires, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat your <hi>Thefts</hi> and Unrighteouſneſs and <hi>Burglary,</hi> till now for this Crime, by a righteous Sentence, you are condemned to ſuffer a ſhameful Death.

            <p>May you call to Mind the ſerious and pertinent <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> and <hi>Counſels</hi> which have been given you publickly and privately.
