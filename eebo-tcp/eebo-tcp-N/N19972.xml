            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And as there ſtill remain diſeaſes, which dare raiſe up their reproachful heads, in obſtinate defiance of our art, it is more eſpecially our duty to ſearch out weapons for their deſtruction: for it is not conſiſtent with our ideas of the goodneſs of the Deity, to ſuppoſe that he would have permitted the favourites of his creation to be inflicted with diſeaſes, without having formed remedies for their relief: but for theſe, as for relief from ſpiritual evils—<hi>we muſt ſeek, and we ſhall find;</hi> and as in the latter caſe, we are directed to the almighty "Father of ſpirits;" ſo in the former we ſhould apply to the ſupplier of all corporeal wants—our all bountiful mother earth, out of whoſe boſom, as above ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, "The Lord hath created medicines."</p>
            <p>AMERICAN phyſicians, in particular, from their being ſituated in a country, with reſpect to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical reſearches, almoſt unexplored, muſt conſider it doubly incumbent on them, to attend to its productions; for beſides the ipecacuanha, the nake-root, the jalap, and many other uſeful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;

America has alſo already furniſhed a bark, that has removed the fatality of that diſeaſe, which in leſs than forty years deprived Britain of two of its monarchs<note n="*" place="bottom">The intermittent fever, which is now conſidered as an innocent complaint, was arranged in the claſs of incurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, till the diſcovery of the Peruvian bark: James the 1ſt, and Oliver Cromwell, both died of this complaint.</note>: and "Who knows but what at the foot of the Allegany mountain there blooms a flower, that is an infallible cure for the epilepſy? Perhaps on the Monongahela, or the Potowmack, there may grow a root, that ſhall ſupply, by its tonic power, the invigorating ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſavage or military life, in the cure of conſumptions<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Ruſh's concluding lecture.</note>:" and why may there not ſpring up a water, in ſome neglected valley, whoſe ſolvent quality, may melt down the torturing ſtone, or whoſe penetrating influence may root out the ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula from the ſyſtem?</p>
            <p>WHAT funds of uſeful knowledge may there ſtill be reſerved for the diſcovery of Americans: ſince it was for them to check the fatal career of the cynanche maligna<note n="‡" place="bottom">The late Dr. Ogden, of Jamaica, Long-Iſland, was the perſon who firſt introduced the uſe of Calomel, in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; before which, its fatality among children, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled, by any diſeaſe to which they are liable.</note>, and alſo to looſen the fixed jaw, and relax the rigid muſcles of a teta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus<note n="*" place="bottom">We are indebted to Dr. Ruſh, for eraſing this from the liſt of incurable diſeaſes.</note>?

Why may we not hope, that ſome other of our countrymen, may be fortunate enough, ſtill farther to diminiſh the liſt of thoſe diſeaſes, which yet continue to elude the power of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine?</p>
            <p>THESE reflections prevailed upon me, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a ſurrounding cloud of difficulties<note n="†" place="bottom">The moſt able profeſſions in Europe, ſay, that <q>The analyſis of mineral waters, is juſtly conſidered, one of the moſt difficult problems in chemiſtry.</q>
               </note>, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to aſcertain the compoſition of the mineral wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Saratoga—whether I have fully ſucceeded or not, my experiments, (which I have inſerted at full length, for that purpoſe,) with the ſkilful chemiſt will determine; In the mean time, not doubting but that his knowledge of the intricacy of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will furniſh him with a cover for the little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracies he may detect, particularly when he conſiders, that in this work, I have acted in the dangerous and toilſome capacity of a pioneer, I have opened a way to the analyſis of theſe waters, whereby others may follow on, probably with more ſucceſs, at leaſt with leſs difficulty<note n="‡" place="bottom">No one has heretofore attempted to analyſe theſe waters, all that has been done, was merely ſkimming their ſurface; juſt an enquiry into the nature of the air diſcharged from them; ſee Dr. Mitchell's experiments, related in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Muſeum, Vol. IV. I am the firſt who has ventured to ſearch into their real ſubſtance, to aſcertain the ingredients of their compoſition.</note>.</p>

IT has been my intention to render this treatiſe as generally uſeful as poſſible; I have, therefore, not only forborn the uſe of the new and accurate nomenclature of the French chemiſts; but have alſo, in other reſpects, employed as familiar terms as the nature of the ſubject would admit of; and as in compoſitions of this kind, beauty of ſtile is leſs aimed at, than perſpicuity of expreſſion—I doubt not but that the reader will excuſe me, if he finds ſome ſentences which might have been expreſſed in more elegant language.</p>
            <p>WHETHER water of itſelf conſidered, is a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple elementary ſubſtance, according to the opinion of the ancients, or a compound, as aſſerted by many of the moderns, though, perhaps, well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of attention, is not the buſineſs of this diſſertation to determine? Its views being confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, merely to diſcover the nature of ſuch mineral ſubſtances, as are often diſſolved in it, and to which many waters owe their particular medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal virtues.</p>
            <p>SUCH mineral waters have been noticed as far back as the time of <hi>Hyppocrates. Pliny</hi> mentions certain of them, as poſſeſſing medicinal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but we do not find any account of a method to detect their compoſition, till about the middle of the ſeventeenth century, when <hi>Boyle</hi> firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the infuſion of vegetable blues, was an accurate teſt for diſcovering the preſence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combined acids or alkalies, by becoming red with
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:026149_0007_0FCF55DD66071B80"/>
the former, and green with the latter. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found out many other ſubſtances, for the more full examination of waters.</p>
            <p>DURING the time that <hi>Boyle</hi> was employed in theſe reſearches, <hi>Duclos</hi> was buſy in the analyſis of the waters of France, and made ſeveral improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the addition of galls, and the tincture of turnſol, to our ſtock of regents. <hi>Hierne, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, Boulduc</hi> and many other celebrated che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, continued to render this branch of ſcience more perfect.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the preſent century, <hi>Hoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> followed by <hi>Springsfield</hi> and <hi>Venel,</hi> paid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention to what they called the mineral ſpirit of waters, and which ſince, by <hi>Dr. Prieſtly,</hi> has been proved to be the aerial or cretacious acid.</p>
            <p>THE mode of analiſing waters have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually improving, ſince the firſt experiments of <hi>Boyle</hi>—till at length the celebrated <hi>Bergman</hi> has given the finiſhing ſtroke of its preſent perfection.</p>
            <p>IN examining theſe waters. I have proceeded first by <hi>reagents,</hi> to aſcertain the different ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in their compoſition: for notwithſtanding a late author<note n="*" place="bottom">

upon a candid peruſal of this diſſertation: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge we are thereby only enabled to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the different ingredients of mineral waters—but not the proportion of each. I was, therefore, obliged to apply to <hi>diſtillation,</hi> to obtain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their aerial, and to <hi>evaporation</hi> and <hi>chryſtalization</hi>—that of their fixed principles.</p>

               <p>THE cauſe of this ſudden change of ſoil, which however, is not peculiar to this place alone<note n="*" place="bottom">As Hempſtead plains on Long Iſland and its contiguous ſoil is a remarkable inſtance.</note>, and alſo of the river's making its way, at this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar juncture—I leave to the ſpeculation of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt to determine, a mere knowledge of their exiſtence and ſituation being all that is neceſſary, either as to their affording us an aſſiſtant means for aſcertaining the nature of the mineral waters, in their neighbourhood, or as enabling us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the preſence of ingredients we may find in them. About four miles weſt of theſe ſprings, I am informed there is a ſtrong ſcented ſulphuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpring.</p>
               <p>THE ſprings are eight or ten in number, and all are within the ſpace of about half a mile; the one which has particularly attracted the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the curious, and which is moſtly drank by valetudinarians, riſes about midway between the others; it is entirely ſurrounded by a rock of a conical ſhape, which is about five ſect high,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026149_0011_0FCF55E1C0F83310"/>
and whoſe baſe is about nine feet in diameter; it has a circular hole, in its apex, of near ten inches acroſs, which is the opening of its inner cavity in which the water riſes to within about two feet of its top. This cavity, like the outſide of the rock, enlarges, as it deſcends. The ſurface of this rock is of a browniſh colour, and appears compact and poliſhed, it has a check in one ſide of it, which is ſuppoſed to deſcend internally and form ſome vent below the ſurface of the ground, by which the water makes its way out, as it has not been known to overflow for ſeveral years paſt. The crack is believed to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the fall of a tree over the ſpring; and the remains of the upper part of one which lies in the marſh below, and whoſe body is directly immediately towards it, renders this opinion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, ſince its ſize and ſituation prove that it muſt have ſtood on the oppoſite ſide of the rock; indeed I am informed, by a man of that country, that he very well recollects when the tree ſtood there, and that then the water overflowed the rock: another perſon informed me, that he knew it to overflow in the time of the late war.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Firſt. Of their phyſical properties.</head>
                  <p>I. THESE waters, in general, appear <hi>nearly</hi> tranſparent, yet none of them are perfectly ſo, excepting that which riſes up in a barrel, which the neighbours have fixed for the purpoſe of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting it, and is called the <hi>barrel ſpring;</hi> they are <hi>colourleſs,</hi> and emit a great quantity of <hi>air</hi> by agitation, even by ſtanding ſtill in an open veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, it almoſt immediately forms bubbles around its inſide, which ſoon riſe up and are diſcharged. The veſſel uſed to dip the water out of the rock, and alſo the bathing tub, ſoon gather an <hi>ochery cruſt</hi> upon their inner ſurfaces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe waters ſtagnate, around the ſprings, beſides depoſiting the ſtony matter before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, they alſo ſoon become covered with a <hi>pellicle</hi> of a metallic ſplendour, reflecting variegated colours.</p>
                  <p>II. THEY diffuſe a <hi>ſubtle penetrating odour,</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:026149_0014_0FCF55E4CA6E6130"/>
which is moſt particularly experienced by breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the orifice of the rock.</p>
                  <p>III. WHEN drank, their firſt impreſſion on the palate, is agreeably <hi>aceſcent,</hi> ſucceed by a nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſaline taſte; they afterwards give up aceſcent eructations, like fermented liquors, and which are no ways unpleaſant.</p>
                  <p>IV. THE hydrometer ſtands at the ſame height in theſe, as in ſnow water.</p>
                  <p>V. NOTWITHSTANDING the diſcharge of air from theſe waters, makes them appear to be in a continued ebulition, yet they are cold, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, however, is not the ſame in all the ſprings; but ſeems to diminiſh in proportion to their briſkneſs, thus the bathing ſpring and the barrel, each of which diſcharges about twenty gallons in an hour, which is much more than the reſt do, lowered Fatherinheits thermometre from 72°, the heat of the atmoſphere, to 52°, while in the others it ſtood at 56° and 58°, but in the rock water, which runs very ſlowly, it remained at 67°.</p>
                  <p>VI. BY the application of a gentle heat, theſe waters diſcharge a great quantity of <hi>air</hi> in bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; it is upon this property, that their uſe in raiſing bread depends, and for which purpoſe they are carried away in conſiderable quantities, daily, even ſometimes to eight or ten miles diſtance; all that is neceſſary being merely to make the dough, with flour and this water alone, and it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ready to put in the oven.</p>

                  <head>II. EXPERIMENTS UPON THE AIR.</head>
                  <p>I. A <hi>lighted candle</hi> let down in the crater of the rock, was immediately <hi>extinguiſhed,</hi> both blaze and wick, before it came within a foot of the ſurface of the water: the air obtained by agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the water of this, as well as of the other ſprings, was equally incapable of ſupporting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, as was alſo that collected from the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that were continually diſcharging from the different ſprings.</p>
                  <p>II. A <hi>chicken</hi> being immerſed in this air, <hi>expired</hi> in three minutes. A <hi>kitten</hi> confined in it for one and a half minutes, appeared very flaccid and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dead; yet, on being brought out, into free atmoſpheric air, its fleeting life was ſoon recalled through the medium of violent convulſions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again put into the noxious gas, in fourteen minutes it was irrecoverably <hi>dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. THE air being made to paſs through <hi>lime-water</hi> immediately rendered it very <hi>turbid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. IT rendered a diluted <hi>tincture of turnſol</hi> of <hi>a red</hi> tinge, by paſſing through it.</p>
                  <p>FROM the phyſical qualities mentioned, and from the above experiments, we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this air is the true <hi>ſpiritus mineralis</hi> of Hoffman, the <hi>carbonic acid gas</hi> of the French che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, the <hi>aerial acid</hi> of Bergman, the fixed air of Prieſtly and Black, the <hi>cretacious acid</hi> of Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croy,

and what is generally known with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by the name of <hi>choak damp;</hi> it is ſimilar to the noxious gas, which riſes up to the height of ſeveral inches, in the famous <hi>grotto del cani</hi> in Italy; this cave having received its name from its fatality to dogs: they, from carrying their heads below the ſurface of this ſtratum of air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the animals which are generally ſubmitted to experiment, to ſatisfy travellers of its delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects. It is this air which is ſo plentifully given out, during the ſpirituous fermentation, and is what gives that briſkneſs to porter, and other malt liquors. Being united with the vegetable alkali, it forms our common potaſh—hence the reaſon why our good houſewives are enabled, any time, at half an hour's warning, to furniſh us with a well raiſed cake, merely by mixing up the flour with a ſolution of potaſh and ſour milk; here the acid of the milk, from a greater attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, joins itſelf to the alkali, while the aeriform acid being ſet at liberty, and aſſiſted by the expanſive power of heat, penetrates and puffs up every particle of the dough. It is this air alſo, which conſtitutes the difference between quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and chalk or limeſtone, its diſcharge is the effect of their calcination.</p>

                  <p>I. THE <hi>rock water</hi> had a little of the <hi>tincture of turnſol</hi> dropped into it, which immediately gave it a <hi>reddiſh</hi> tinge.</p>
                  <p>II. The infuſion of our common blue lark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur<note n="*" place="bottom">The infuſion of blue lark-ſpur, I have found to be a moſt accurate teſt for diſcovering the preſence of the ſmalleſt quantity, of either uncombined alkalies, or fixed acids.</note> was not changed by it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Tincture of galls</hi> rendered it <hi>purple</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">It has been obſerved, that notwithſtanding this water mixes with gin, without diſcoloration; yet it will not make grog: for immediately upon pouring in the ſpirits, it becomes blackiſh.

                  <p>V. <hi>Pruſian lime-water</hi> produced no change in it.</p>

                  <p>MOST of theſe experiments were frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and with ſimilar reſults.</p>
                  <p>THE waters of the <hi>other ſprings</hi> exhibited the ſame appearances, with the above reagents, as the rock water, excepting that of the <hi>bathing ſpring</hi> and of the <hi>barrel's</hi> ſhewing a <hi>deeper purple</hi> tinge with <hi>tincture of galls.</hi>

had not that briſk accidulous taſte, as before, but was extremely <hi>nauſeous;</hi> it was not reddened by <hi>tincture of turnſol,</hi> nor rendered purple <hi>by tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of galls;</hi> with infuſion of <hi>lark-ſpur,</hi> it became <hi>green:</hi> it ſtill <hi>precipitated lime-water,</hi> though not ſo plentifully as before, and alſo <hi>efferveſced</hi> ſlightly, <hi>with vitriolic acid;</hi> but was not made <hi>turbid</hi> thereby. <hi>Acid of ſugar</hi> did not induce a turbidneſs, its appearance was not altered by the <hi>cauſtic vegetable</hi> nor <hi>volatile alkalies,</hi> nor by the <hi>aerated vegetable alkali.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FROM theſe experiments, I conclude, that theſe waters contain,</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>An uncombined</hi> ACID, whereby they become red by tincture of turnſol, and that this cannot be a fixed acid, ſince it does not redden infuſion of lark-ſpur, and is evaporated by boiling; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the water does not change tincture of turnſol; therefore it muſt be the <hi>cretacious acid,</hi> the ſame as has been heretofore proved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſcharging from them, in large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: it is from the preſence of this, that lime-water becomes ſo very turbid; for with lime it forms an inſoluble compound.</p>
                  <p>II. IRON.—Hence it takes a purple tinge, with tincture of galls, and alſo, when previouſly joined with vitriolic acid, becomes blue, with Pruſian lime-water, and that the iron is not kept in ſolution, by the vitriolic acid, or it would have
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026149_0020_0FCF55ED2656D990"/>
become blue by this teſt, before the acid was united with it; but by the cretacious acid, ſince after being boiled, this water is no more diſcolour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by tincture of galls.</p>
                  <p>III. A QUANTITY of LIME <hi>held in ſolution by the cretacious acid;</hi> for notwitſtanding lime, as above obſerved, is rendered inſoluble by uniting with the cretacious acid, yet it is otherwiſe when ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſaturated therewith; for then it is, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, much more ſoluble: hence the cauſe of a precipitation, by the cauſtic vegetable, and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile alkalies. They, from their affinity to the acid, deprive the lime of its ſuperabundance, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to fall down in a white powder. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic acid, on the contrary, attracts the lime, and forms a gypſeous depoſition, while the cretacious acid flies off in a great efferveſcence. The acid of ſugar, alſo, evinces the preſence of lime, by uniting and forming an inſoluble compound with it. Theſe teſts did not exhibit the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances with the water, after ebulition: hence the pellicle and depoſition formed, during that proceſs, I take to be calcarious earth and iron.</p>
                  <p>IV. A MURIATIC ACID. Hence with ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated ſilver it forms a ſudden, caſeous precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and alſo a precipitate with nitrated mercury; this laſt precipitate on being ſublimed, afforded corroſſive ſublimate.</p>
                  <p>V. A NEUTRAL SALT. Since they have
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026149_0021_0FCF4CC56375F120"/>
been proved by the two laſt mentioned experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to contain a marine acid, and by ſome of the previous ones, that this cannot exiſt in a ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate; therefore it muſt be united either with an earth, or an alkali, and as a cretacious alkali will be ſhewn to be preſent in the water, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it muſt be joined with the latter; ſince alkalies have a greater attraction for acids, than earths have.</p>
                  <p>VI. A CRETACIOUS ALKALI, whereby, after the water has been boiled, it renders the infuſion of lark-ſpur green, and efferveſces with vitriolic acid; this may alſo be the cauſe why lime-water is ſtill precipitated by it. Here the cretacious acid quits the alkali, to unite with its more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting lime, forming therewith, as abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, an inſoluble compound. The reaſon why the water did not change the infuſion of lark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur, before it had been boiled, muſt be owing to the alkali's being ſuperſaturated with the creta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acid, in which caſe, as I proved by an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment made for that purpoſe, it may exiſt in a conſiderable quantity in a water, without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vegetable blues.</p>
                  <p>VII. A SLIGHT <hi>impregnation of</hi> SULPHUR, thereby darkening the nitrated ſilver; this is what might reaſonably be expected, as within about four miles there is a proper ſtrong ſcented ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſpring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:026149_0022_0FCF55EF8EAB5730"/>
THE laſt mentioned experiment, on the waters, previous to ebulition, (ſee p. 20.) proves, by the precipitate's not appearing granulated, that vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic acid does not exiſt in theſe waters, either in a ſimple or combined ſtate.</p>
                  <p>THE preſence of an uncombined alkali, (if we may ſtill be permitted to call aerated alkali's ſo) as proved, by the boiled water's rendering infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of lark-ſpur green, clearly proves the non-exiſtence of any earthy or metallic ſalts in this water; ſince the alkali, from its ſuperior attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to acids, muſt entirely prevent their forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>FROM the above effects of reagents, it appears, that <hi>the waters contain</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>Cretacious acid,</item>

                     </list>
and a Sulphurious impregnation.</p>
                  <p>THE proportion of each of the above ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and the nature of the baſe of the neutral, and the ſpecies of the cretacious alkali, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unknown; I therefore proceeded, by the more tedious proceſſes of diſtillation, evaporation, and chryſtalization, to aſcertain theſe points.</p>

                  <p>FROM the experiments of Bergman, it appears that water is capable of abſorbing about equal its bulk of cretacious acid, at the temperature of 55°, and proportionably leſs as its temperature is increaſed. Now, as before obſerved, the bubbles of this acid, are continually paſſing through the waters, under examination, it is therefore clear that they muſt be fully ſaturated with it, and as their temperature is higher than that at which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will retain its equal bulk, we are obliged to conclude, that it does not contain quite ſo much; but from the following experiment I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it lacks much of it.</p>
                  <p>BY the means of a florence flaſk, with a ſyphon properly affixed to it and the application of heat, I collected, from a given quantity of this water, in a glaſs veſſel that had been previouſly filled with, and inverted in hot water, upwards of its bulk of aerial fluid, the greater part of which I take to be the abovementioned acid; the reſt, perhaps, partly atmoſpheric mephites, and partly vital air. That the water contains this laſt, is proved, by its depoſiting an ochery ſubſtance, after having ſome green vitriol diſſolved in it, in a well corked viol.</p>

                  <head>V. EVAPORATION.</head>
                  <p>AFTER evaporating ten pounds of the water of the rock, in glaſs veſſels, by the heat of a <hi>water bath,</hi> I obtained a browniſh coloured reſidue, which when dried, weighed 6 drachms, 2 ſcruples, 3 grains; this reſidum was put into four times its weight of <hi>ſpirits of wine,</hi> and after ſtanding a conſiderable time, being frequently agitated; was filtered and dried, and was found to have loſt about 17 grs. which proved to be common ſalt; for by evaporating the ſpirits, I obtained it in regular <hi>cubic chryſtals.</hi> This circumſtance of ſpirits of wine diſſolving a portion of marine ſalt, I take to be owing to its not being ſo highly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, as it ought to be: for when perfectly pure, it will only take up ſalited lime, and ſalited mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia, nitrated lime, and nitrated magneſia, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lited terra ponderoſa; but when ſome what diluted, it will, beſide theſe ſalts, alſo take up others: but, however, as by evaporation I obtained nothing but cubic chryſtals, I now conclude, poſitively, what in fact was before proved by reagents, that there are none of the above mentioned earthy ſalts in theſe waters.</p>
                  <p>I now immerſed the reſidum in 8 oz. of <hi>cold diſtilled water,</hi> which, after remaining ſeveral hours, and being frequently agitated, was filter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the inſoluble reſidue being dried and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026149_0025_0FCF55F483DE7A80"/>
was found to have loſt, 3 drachms, 2 grains; this watery ſolution, by turning the infuſion of larkſpur green, is proved to contain an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined alkali. Experiments before made, ſhew that theſe waters contain the muriatic acid, and as the mutual attraction, between an acid and an alkali, will not permit them to remain in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with each other, particularly when ſurrounded by their conjuctive agent, water: without unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore, we muſt again ſuppoſe this acid to be in combination, and indeed its not rendering the infuſion of larkſpur red, decidedly forbids any other concluſion.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſolution of a muriatic neutral ſalt and an alkali, I ſubmitted to the heat of the ſun, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, after great part of the water was evaporated, ſome <hi>cubical chryſtals</hi> appeared to form upon its ſurface, but which were ſoon diſturbed, by <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſaline concretions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HAVING aſcertained the preſence of a <hi>muriatic neutral ſalt,</hi> and an uncombined <hi>alkali;</hi> but not knowing decidedly, either the ſpecies of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali, or the baſe of the neutral ſalt; I therefore made a ſaturated ſolution of this mixed ſalt, and added thereto, <hi>acid of tartar,</hi> and no precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taking place, I concluded that no <hi>vegetable alkali</hi> can be preſent, or it would have fallen down in the form of cremor tartar; therefore, the <hi>aerated alkali</hi> muſt be of the <hi>mineral</hi> kind,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026149_0026_0FCF55F66A4C9918"/>
and the baſe of the <hi>neutral,</hi> muſt be the ſame, which, with its acid, forms our common <hi>ſea ſalt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To find the <hi>proportion</hi> of the marine ſalt and the alkali, I diſſolved the mixed ſalt in water and added <hi>diſtilled vinegar</hi> thereto, until I brought it to the exact point of ſaturation: I then ſatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated an equal quantity of diſtilled vinegar, with mineral alkali, for which purpoſe it required 26 grains, whence it appears, that ten pounds of this mineral water contains 26 grs. of <hi>mineral alkali,</hi> the remainder, 156 grs. muſt be common <hi>ſalt,</hi> which added to the 17 grs. diſſolved in the ſpirits of wine, makes ten pounds of the water contain 173 grs.</p>
                  <p>THE remaining 3 drachms, I ſcruple, 4 grains, I expoſed to the ſun, for ſeveral weeks, moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it frequently with rain water; this was done, in order to ruſt the iron, ſo as to make it inſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>diſtilled vinegar;</hi> in which this reſidue was afterwards digeſted and filtered. The filtered li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor was then evaporated, and what was left, was re-diſſolved, in <hi>vitriolic acid,</hi> with which it formed a <hi>gypſum,</hi> but no bitter ſalt; hence, as there was but about 12 or 14 grs. remaining on the fillet, it appears that ten pounds of this water contains 3 drachms, 10 grs. of <hi>aerated lime</hi>—but no mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia.</p>
                  <p>THE ſubſtance remaining on the filter, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved in vitriolic acid, afforded 8 and 1-2

               <p>THE mineral waters that have been already noticed, are not the only one's in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Saratoga. About three miles below the junction of Fiſh-Creek with the North River, and about two miles weſt of the latter, in a hollow belonging to, and immediately back of the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe of, <hi>William Barker,</hi> are ſeveral mineral ſprings, the waters of which, both by their ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities, and by the operation of reagents, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be very ſimilar to thoſe heretofore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. They do not, however, depoſit the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter, as the others do, nor do they in other reſpects, appear to be ſo ſtrongly impregnated with mineral ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:026149_0028_0FCF55F9096B8F60"/>
THEY are ſituated in a clayey ſoil, with no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of lime-ſtone in their neighbourhood. The land is covered with beach and oak trees.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>air</hi> which bubbles up in theſe ſprings, by the experiments formerly mentioned; appears to be the ſame <hi>cretacious acid</hi> as is diſcharged from the other ſprings, it equally <hi>extinguiſhes flame,</hi> render <hi>lime water turbid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THE water is alſo proved to contain the ſame <hi>air</hi> in its compoſition, not only by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as made at the other ſprings; but alſo by its not being able to ſupport animal life. <hi>A fiſh</hi> in two and a half minutes <hi>died</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>IRON appears to exiſt in theſe waters, by their becoming <hi>tinged,</hi> though ſlightly with <hi>tincture of galls;</hi> and it muſt be aerated; ſince this property no longer continues after the water has been boiled.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>air</hi> diſcharged from it by boiling, being made to paſs through <hi>lime water;</hi> produced <hi>no turbidneſs,</hi> hence they contain no free aerial acid.</p>

               <head>OF THE MEDICAL VIRTUES OF THE WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS OF SARATOGA.</head>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe waters, when properly applied may be uſeful in many complaints; yet as is generally the caſe with medicines that get into practice, and gain a degree of reputation, before their real qualities are known; they are uſed too indiſcriminately for the cure of almoſt every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, even thoſe of a directly oppoſite nature, thus we find intermittents, pleuriſies, dropſies, manias, &amp;c. all equally apply here for help, and what is ſtill more extraordinary, while I was at the ſprings I ſaw a perſon there who had come upwards of three hundred miles, to drink the waters for the cure of a fiſtula lachrymalis.</p>
               <p>THESE waters may be taken in very large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities into the ſtomach without producing any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs or weight, excepting ſometimes in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſtomachs, they cauſe a ſenſe of coldneſs and ſometimes proves emetic: ſome perſons will drink ſeveral quarts within half an hour, without any inconvenience, in which caſe they generally ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate two or three times by ſtool, and very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly by urine; they at the ſame time frequently produce a gentle diaphoreſis; they more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly act upon theſe two laſt excreories, when tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in ſmall doſes as from half a pint to a pint, and repeated four or five times in the courſe of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026149_0031_0FCF55FDAFFD5EB0"/>
the day; in ſome perſons theſe waters induce a degree of inebriety ſimilar to wine: they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe the appetite.</p>
               <p>IT is much to be regretted, that there does not ſome perſon properly qualified reſide at theſe ſprings; who would keep a regiſter of the complaints of thoſe who apply there for relief; and the effects of the waters upon them: the want of this oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us to eſtabliſh their virtues, from the known effects of the ingredients of their compoſition, which are now aſcertained; aſſiſted by the inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate accounts of the neighbours.</p>
               <p>FROM the great relief that Benjamin Colburn firſt received by the uſe of an alkaline water, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaturated with cretacious acid, and which afterwards proved equally ſerviceable to his fellow-ſufferers, with <hi>ſtone and gravely complaints;</hi> and alſo from the experience of DR. FALCONER in confirming the ſame<note n="*" place="bottom">See Falconer's appendix to Dobſon's commentary on fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed air.</note>, I have not the leaſt doubt but that theſe waters may be uſed with advantage in theſe complaints; ſince they are proved to contain a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſaturated aerated alkali, and alſo as they are found to operate very quickly and powerfully on the urinary paſſages, indeed the neighbours report of its uſe in ſuch caſes, confirms this opinion.</p>
               <p>THE cretacious acid is proved by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of DR. DOBSON, to be a powerful ſtimulant and antiſceptic, and in theſe waters its being conjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a chalybeate; I fully believe according to the accounts of the neighbours, and perſons who
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026149_0032_0FCF55FF10BC0AD8"/>
had experienced relief from thoſe complaints, that they may be very ſerviceable in <hi>chronic rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, dyſpepſia,</hi> and ſome other long ſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of debility: and alſo in <hi>old phagedenic ulcers</hi> and <hi>ſcorbutic complaints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM their conjoined effects of purgative anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeptic and tonic qualities; they appear to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly formed for the cure of the <hi>dyſentery:</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the ſprings, was uſing them for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint while I was there, he informed me that they formerly cured him of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cutanious Eruptions,</hi> frequently prove very obſtinate diſeaſes; therefore are found in great plenty at theſe ſprings, and I am happy to add, that they have generally diſappeared by the uſe of the waters: for this purpoſe they muſt be uſed externally, as well as internally. We need not be ſurpriſed that theſe waters are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful in ſuch complaints, ſince from their proving gently diaphoretic, and alſo by the bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings keeping the ſkin clean and moiſt, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the ſulphurious impregnation, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exiſt in them; they appear to be extremely well calculated for that purpoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">I am told that during the late war, while the troops lay at Saratoga, many of them were affected with the itch and were ſent off in companies to theſe ſprings; by which they were all cured.</note>.</p>
               <p>I HAVE never heard of the effects of theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>ſerophula;</hi> (or kings evil) but as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſea-ſalt, and as they appear from increaſing the different excretions to act particularly on the glandular ſyſtem; and as they alſo prove a ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus

and tonic to the ſyſtem at large. I think them well deſerving a trial in this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>THEIR uſe in <hi>bypochondriaſis</hi> and other <hi>nervous affections,</hi> which are diſeaſes generally ariſing from the indolence and luxury of a city life; and conſequently a conſiderable diſtance from the ſprings, perhaps depend in a great degree upon the amuſing ſcenes, more ſimple food and conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which are unavoidably connected with a long journey; and if any advantage is gained in <hi>conſumptions</hi> from their uſe, I rather ſuppoſe it owing to the ſame circumſtances connected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; ſince fixed air, which ſeems to be the predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inant agent in the operation of theſe waters, has, by thoſe who have made experiments thereon, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been found prejudicial in theſe complaints, in fact the common report is, that theſe waters are prejudicial in phthiſical complaints.</p>
               <p>THESE waters have alſo been in repute for the cure of <hi>Dropſy,</hi> and from their poſſeſſing ſuch a conjoined ſtimulant, and evacuative quality as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned; it appears very probable that they may promote the abſorption of the fluid in the cavities of the human body; and carry it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>THERE are likewiſe very ſatisfactory accounts of <hi>paralitic</hi> affections, having been cured or at leaſt conſiderably relieved, by the inward and outward uſe of theſe mineral waters.</p>
               <p>IT has likewiſe been related, upon undoubted teſtimony, that <hi>fevers</hi> and <hi>agues</hi> or <hi>intermittents</hi> have frequently been cured by them.</p>

               <head>A CONJECTURE UPON THE MANNER OF THE NATURAL FORMATION OF THESE WATERS.</head>
               <p>THE manner by which theſe waters become charged with their iron, lime, ſalt, and alkali, hardly needs an explanation; as all theſe ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces exiſt ready formed in the bowels of the earth; and water after being aerated cannot paſs over them without taking up a part; but the manner in which it gains this aerial impregnation, as the cretacious acid does not naturally exiſt in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combined ſtate in the earth; is not ſo eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for.</p>
               <p>THE cretacious acid is extricated from its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations in the large way, by three different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by <hi>fermentation,</hi> by the action of a <hi>ſtronger acid,</hi> and by <hi>heat;</hi> the firſt method can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not operate in this inſtance, the ſecond may have its effects; let us try how far it will explain the ſubject in queſtion. Suppoſe this water firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a marine acid, ſhould have paſſed over a quantity of cretacious alkali; here the acid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ten pounds of it, would unite with 73 grs. of pure alkali, which contained, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly will diſcharge 58grs. equal 116 ſquare inches of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026149_0035_0FCF5603850AB1F8"/>
this acid. Now the water is ſuppoſed to contain at leaſt 200 inches, hence we ſee that the moſt favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtatement of this mode, will not account e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the quantity of air actually exiſting as a component part of the water; much leſs for the great ſuperabundance which is continually bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling up through it, and is diſcharged. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe that the vitriolic acid, might act on calcarious earth, and diſcharge this air, whereby the water might become impregnated, before it was charged with ſea-ſalt and alkali; or elſe we ſhould have detected ſome glaubers ſalt in the waters, as they would at the time that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their air, alſo unavoidably become ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with gypſum, which when it came in contact with the alkali would have been decompoſed thereby, and form this ſalt.</p>
               <p>WE muſt therefore conclude, that this air muſt be produced by <hi>ſubterranean heat,</hi> acting on cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious earth or limeſtone; thereby ſetting it at liberty in this great profuſion; indeed the deep caverns opening on the lime ſtone bank before-mentioned, gives ſome plauſibility to this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it clearly evinces that ſome conſiderable operations muſt be going forward in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: the only objection that can be raiſed againſt this conjecture is, the coldneſs of the waters, but this may be obviated by conſidering, that even if they do not come any great diſtance after their ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial impregnation; yet they may have afterwards met with their ſalts, which as is the caſe with all ſubſtances going from the ſolid to the fluid ſtate,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026149_0036_0FCF5605D1179858"/>
will abſorb a conſiderable quantity of heat, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their diſſolution, and thereby produce the coldneſs in queſtion: ſhould any ſuppoſe that this cauſe is not adequate to the production of the coldneſs of theſe waters, they are at liberty to conſider them as being aerated at a greater diſtance from the ſprings than is ſuggeſted; my above ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations however will not permit them to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but that the air they contain muſt have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved from its combination by ſubterranean fire, the which is proved, by the heat of the waters of Lebanon, to exiſt at no great diſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">About 5<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ONE great advantage reſulting from the Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of mineral waters is, the being enabled thereby to make artificial waters ſimilar to them, whence all their virtues may be obtained at pleaſure; and at any place, without the inconvenience or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of attending at the ſprings.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome mineral waters, that from the fixed nature of their ingredients, may be kept for a conſiderable time and tranſported from place to place without ſuffering much, if any, alteration in their natures; as for inſtance thoſe of Epſom,

Richmond, Swanſey, and the like; while others as thoſe of Pyrmont, Seltſer, Saratoga, &amp;c, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our greateſt care, can be kept but a ſhort time and conſequently cannot be conveyed to any great diſtance, without looſing in a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable degree their medicinal qualities; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the cretacious acid which from its volatile nature flies off, the iron that was kept in ſolution thereby, is alſo depoſited; hence they muſt looſe the two moſt active and eſſential parts of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; therefore if any one would have theſe waters at a diſtance from the ſprings, it is art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that can ſupply him.</p>
               <p>THE manner in which I prepared a water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Saratoga waters, not being poſſeſſed of Nooth's apparatus, was as follows: To a quart of ſimple water, I added 38grs. aerated lime or chalk, 34.6 grs. common ſalt, and 5.2 aerated mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral alkali; being juſt the proportion that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from a quart of the mineral water; I alſo ſuſpended in it ſome freſh iron filings tied up in a linen rag, then by means of a bottle with a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon affixed to it, and which alſo had a mouth whereby I could put in my ingredients, I cauſed the air that was diſcharged from chalk by a dilut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vitriolic acid, to paſs through the water above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, till it appeared to be fully ſaturated: to this water was then added ſome coarſely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſulphur, which after ſtanding awhile was decanted off.</p>
               <p>THIS liquor was now acknowledged by ſeveral
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026149_0038_0FCF560691CD30A0"/>
perſons who had drank of the Saratoga waters perfectly to reſemble them in taſte.</p>
               <p>MOST of the reagents uſed on the natural waters, were repeated on theſe and with like effects; here then is a clear proof of the ſucceſs of the analyſis, for ſyntheſis or the recompoſition of a ſubſtance, with ſimilar ingredients to what were obtained from it, by all chemiſts is conſidered the ſureſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the truth of an analyſis.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING I have not had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of trying the effects of this water in diſeaſes, yet the above circumſtances proving it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the ſame ingredients as the natural wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; leaves no doubt, but that it muſt poſſeſs the ſame medicinal virtues.</p>
