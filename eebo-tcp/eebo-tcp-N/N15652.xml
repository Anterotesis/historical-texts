            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PLAN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I proceed to ſuggeſt a Plan for the eſtabliſhment of public ſchools in Pennſylvania, I ſhall point out, in a few words, the influence and advantages of learning upon mankind.</p>
            <p>I. It is friendly to religion, inaſmuch as it aſſiſts in removing prejudice, ſuperſtition and enthuſiaſm, in promoting juſt notions of the Deity, and in enlarging our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his works.</p>
            <p>II. It is favourable to liberty. A free government can only exiſt in an equal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of literature. Without learning men become Savages or Barbarians, and where learning is confined to a <hi>few</hi> people, we
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019974_0003_0FAD489E88244E08"/>
always find monarchy, ariſtocracy and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>III. It promotes juſt ideas of laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. "When the clouds of ignorance are diſpelled (ſays the Marquis of Beccaria) by the radiance of knowledge, power trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but the authority of laws remains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable."</p>
            <p>IV. It is friendly to manners. Learning, in all countries, promotes civilization, and the pleaſures of ſociety and converſation.</p>
            <p>V. It promotes agriculture, the great ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of national wealth and happineſs. Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture is as much a ſcience as hydraulics, or optics, and has been equally indebted to the experiments and reſearches of learned men. The highly cultivated ſtate, and the immenſe profits of the farms in England, are derived wholly from the patronage which agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has received in that country, from learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men and learned ſocieties.</p>
            <p>VI. Manufactures of all kinds owe their perfection, chiefly to learning—hence the nations of Europe advance in manufactures and commerce, only in proportion as they cultivate the arts and ſciences.</p>
            <p>For the purpoſe of diffuſing knowledge through every part of the ſtate, I beg leave to propoſe the following ſimple plan.</p>
            <p>I. Let there be one univerſity in the ſtate, and let this be eſtabliſhed in the capital.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019974_0004_0FAD489F5CBBD9A8"/>
Let law, phyſic, divinty, the law of nature and nations, oeconomy, &amp;c. be taught in it by public lectures in the winter ſeaſon, after the manner of the European univerſities, and let the profeſſors receive ſuch ſalaries from the ſtate as will enable them to deliver their lectures at a moderate price.</p>
            <p>II. Let there be four colleges. One in Philadelphia,—one at Carliſle—a third, for the benefit of our German fellow citizens, at Manheim,—and a fourth, ſome years hence, at Pittſburgh. In theſe colleges, let young men be inſtructed in mathematics and in the higher branches of ſcience, in the ſame manner that they are now taught in our American colleges. After they have taken a degree in one of theſe colleges, let them, if they can afford it, complete their ſtudies by ſpending a ſeaſon or two in attending the lectures in the univerſity. I prefer four col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in the ſtate to one or two, for there is a certain ſize of colleges as there is of towns and armies, that is moſt favourable to morals and good government. Oxford and Cambridge in England are the ſeats of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while the more numerous, and leſs crouded univerſities and colleges in Scotland, are remarkable for the order, diligence, and decent behaviour of their ſtudents.</p>
            <p>III. Let there be an academy eſtabliſhed in each county, for the purpoſe of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019974_0005_0FAD48A00E139788"/>
learned youth in the languages, and thereby preparing them to enter college.</p>
            <p>IV. Let there be free ſchools eſtabliſhed in every townſhip, or in diſtricts conſiſting of one hundred families. In theſe ſchools, let children be taught to read and write the Engliſh and German languages, and the uſe of figures. Such of them as have parents that can afford to ſend them from home, and are diſpoſed to extend their educations, may remove their children from the free ſchool to the county academy.</p>
            <p>By this plan, the whole ſtate will be tied together by one ſyſtem of education. The univerſity will in time furniſh maſters for the colleges, and the colleges will furniſh maſters for the academies and free ſchools, while the free Schools, in their turns, will ſupply the academies—the colleges, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, with ſcholars—ſtudents, and pupils. The ſame ſyſtems of grammar, oratory and philoſophy will be taught in every part of the ſtate, and the literary features of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania will thus deſignate one great, and equally enlightned family.</p>
            <p>A queſtion now riſes, and that is, How ſhall this plan be carried into execution?—I anſwer—</p>
            <p>The funds of the univerſity of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania (if the Engliſh and other ſchools were ſeparated from it) are nearly equal to the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019974_0006_0FAD48A0D73BB548"/>
purpoſe of ſupporting able profeſſors in all the arts and ſciences that are taught in the European univerſities.</p>
            <p>A ſmall addition to the funds of Dickinſon college, will enable it to exiſt without any further aid from government.</p>
            <p>Twenty thouſand acres of good land in the late Indian purchaſe, will probably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a revenue large enough to ſupport a college at Manheim, and another on the banks of the Ohio, in the courſe of twenty years.</p>
            <p>Five thouſand acres of land, appropriated to each county academy, will probably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a revenue ſufficient to ſupport them in twenty years. In the mean while let a tax from £200 to £400 a year be laid on each county for that purpoſe, according to the number and wealth of its inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Let ſixty thouſand acres of land be ſet apart, to be divided, twenty years hence, among the free ſchools. In the mean while let a tax from £30 to £60 a year be levied upon each diſtrict of one hundred families, for the ſupport of the ſchoolmaſter, and to prompt him to induſtry in encreaſing his ſchool, let each ſcholar pay him from 1<hi>ſ</hi>6 to 2<hi>ſ</hi>6 every quarter.</p>
            <p>But, how ſhall we bear the expence of theſe literary inſtitutions under the preſent weight of our taxes?—I anſwer—Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019974_0007_0FAD48A185186D98"/>
are deſigned to <hi>leſſen</hi> our taxes. They will enlighten us in the great buſineſs of finance—they will teach us to encreaſe the ability of the ſtate to ſupport govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by encreaſing the profits of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by promoting manufactures. They will teach us all the modern improvements and advantages of inland navigation. They will defend us from haſty and expenſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in government, by unfolding to us the experience and folly of paſt ages, and thus, inſtead of adding to our taxes and debts, they will furniſh us with the true ſecret of leſſening and diſcharging both of them.</p>
            <p>But, ſhall the eſtates of orphans, batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and perſons who have no children be taxed to pay for the ſupport of ſchools from which they can derive no benefit? I anſwer in the affirmative, to the firſt part of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and I deny the truth of the latter part of it. Every member of the community is intereſted in the propagation of virtue and knowledge in the ſtate. But I will go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and add, it will be true oeconomy in individuals to ſupport public ſchools. The batchelor will in time ſave his tax for this purpoſe, by being able to ſleep with fewer bolts and locks to his doors,—the eſtates of orphans will in time be benefited, by being protected from the ravages of unprincipled and idle boys, and the children of wealthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019974_0008_0FAD48A2433146A8"/>
will be leſs tempted, by bad company, to extravagance. Fewer pillories and whipping poſts, and ſmaller jails, with their uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and taxes, will be neceſſary when our youth are properly educated, than at preſent. I believe it could be proved, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of confining, trying and executing criminals amount every year, in moſt of the counties, to more money than would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to maintain all the ſchools that would be neceſſary in each county. The confeſſions of theſe criminals generally ſhow us, that their vices and puniſhments are the fatal conſequences of the want of a proper edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in early life.</p>
            <p>I ſubmit theſe detatched hints to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the legiſlature and of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Pennſylvania. The plan for the free ſchools is taken chiefly from the plans which have long been uſed with ſucceſs in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and in the Eaſtern ſtates<note n="*" place="bottom">There are 600 of theſe ſchools in the ſmall ſtate of Connecticut, which, at this time, have in them 25,000 ſcholars. Only two natives of this ſtate have been executed in the courſe of the laſt 25 years. The German Lutherans in Pennſylvania take uncommon pains in the education of their youth. Not one of this ſociety has ſubmitted to the ignominy of a legal puniſhment, of any kind, in the courſe of the laſt 17 years.</note> of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, where the influence of learning in promoting religion, morals, manners, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019974_0009_0FAD48A304FBC990"/>
&amp;c. has never been exceeded in any country.</p>
            <p>The manner in which theſe academies and ſchools, ſhould be ſupported and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—the modes of determining the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and qualifications of ſchoolmaſters, and the arrangement of families in each diſtrict, ſo that children of the ſame religious ſect and nation, may be educated as much as poſſible together, will form a proper part of a LAW for the eſtabliſhment of ſchools, and therefore, does not come within the limits of this plan.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this part of the plan, by ſubmitting it to the wiſdom of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether in granting charters for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in future, they ſhould not confine them to giving degrees only in the <hi>arts,</hi> eſpecially while they teach neither law, phyſic nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. It is a folly peculiar to our Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can colleges, to confer literary honours in profeſſions that are not taught by them, and which, if not ſpeedily checked, will render degrees ſo cheap, that they will ceaſe to be the honourable badges of induſtry and learning.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid nothing of the utility of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic libraries in each college, academy and free ſchool. Upon this ſubject, I ſhall only remark, that they will tend to diffuſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge more generally, if the farmers and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019974_0010_0FAD48A4D4661B60"/>
tradeſmen in the neighbourhood of them, (upon paying a moderate ſum yearly) are permitted to have acceſs to them.</p>
            <p>The eſtabliſhment of news papers, in a few of the moſt populous county towns, will contribute very much to diffuſe knowledge of all kinds through the ſtate. To accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this, the means of conveying the papers ſhould be made eaſy, by the aſſiſtance of the legiſlature. The effects of a news paper, upon the ſtate of knowledge and opinions, appear already in ſeveral of the counties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Suſquehannah. The paſſion for this uſeful ſpecies of inſtruction, is ſtrongly marked in Pennſylvania, by the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement this paper has received in thoſe counties. In the ſpace of eight months the number of ſubſcribers to the Carliſle Gazette, have amounted to above 700. Henry the IVth of France, uſed to ſay, he hoped to live to ſee the time, when every peaſant in his kingdom would dine on a turkey every Sundays. I have not a wiſh for the extenſion of literature in the ſtate, that would not be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, by living to ſee a weekly news paper in every farm houſe in Pennſylvania. Part of the effects of this univerſal diffuſion of knowledge, would probably be, to produce turkies and poultry of all kinds on the tables of our farmers, not only on Sundays, but on every day of the week.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:019974_0011_0FAD48A544E97DF8"/>
By multiplying villages and county towns, we encreaſe the means of diffuſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Villages are favourble to ſchools and public worſhip, and county towns, beſides poſſeſſing theſe two advantages, are favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the propagation of political and legal information. The public officers of the county, by being obliged to maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the capital of the government, often become repoſitories and vehicles of news and uſeful publications, while the judges and lawyers, who attend the courts that are held in theſe towns, ſeldom fail of leaving a large portion of knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS UPON THE MODE OF EDUCATION PROPER IN A REPUBLIC.</head>
            <p>THE buſineſs of education has acquired a new complexion by the independence of our country. The form of government we have aſſumed, has created a new claſs of duties to every American. It becomes us, therefore, to examine our former habits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, and in laying the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for nurſeries of wiſe and good men, to adapt our modes of teaching to the peculiar form of our government.</p>
            <p>The firſt remark that I ſhall make upon this ſubject is, that an education in our own, is to be preferred to an education in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign country. The principle of patriotiſm ſtands in need of the reinforcement of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi> and it is well known that our ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt prejudices in favour of our country are
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019974_0013_0FAD48A8DD721218"/>
formed in the firſt one and twenty years of our lives. The policy of the Lacedamoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is well worthy of our imitation. When Antipater demanded fifty of their children as hoſtages for the fulfilment of a diſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, thoſe wiſe republicans refuſed to comply with his demand, but readily offered him double the number of their adult citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whoſe habits and prejudices could not be ſha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> by reſiding in a foreign country. Paſſing by, in this place, the advantages to the community from the early attachment of youth to the laws and conſtitution of their country, I ſhall only remark, that young men who have trodden the paths of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence together, or have joined in the ſame ſports, whether of ſwimming, ſcating, fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or hunting, generally feel, thro' life, ſuch ties to each other, as add greatly to the obligations of mutual benevolence.</p>
            <p>I conceive the education of our youth in this country to be peculiarly neceſſary in Pennſylvania, while our citizens are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the natives of ſo many different kingdoms in Europe. Our Schools of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by producing one general, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſyſtem of education, will render the maſs of the people more homogeneous, and thereby fit them more eaſily for uniform and peaceable government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:019974_0014_0FAD48AA08566E10"/>
I proceed, in the next place, to enquire, what mode of education we ſhall adopt ſo as to ſecure to the ſtate all the advantages that are to be derived from the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of youth; and here I beg leave to remark that the only foundation for a uſeful education in a republic is to be laid in RELIGION. Without this, there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.</p>
            <p>Such is my veneration for every religion that reveals the attributes of the Deity, or a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, that I had rather ſee the opinions of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius or Mahomed inculcated upon our youth, than ſee them grow up wholly devoid of a ſyſtem of religious principles. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I mean to recommend in this place, is the religion of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>It is foreign to my purpoſe to hint at the arguments which eſtabliſh the truth of the Chriſtian revelation. My only buſineſs is to declare, that all its doctrines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are calculated to promote the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſociety, and the ſafety and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of civil government. A Chriſtian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of being a republican. The hiſtory of the creation of man, and of the relation of our ſpecies to each other by birth, which is recorded in the Old Teſtament, is the beſt
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019974_0015_0FAD48AAAAF39B00"/>
refutation that can be given to the divine right of kings, and the ſtrongeſt argument that can be uſed in favour of the original and natural equality of all mankind. A Chriſtian, I ſay again, cannot fail of being a republican, for every precept of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel inculcates thoſe degrees of humility, ſelf-denial, and brotherly kindneſs, which are directly oppoſed to the pride of monarchy and the pageantry of a court. A Chriſtian cannot fail of being uſeful to the republic, for his religion teacheth him that no man "liveth to himſelf." And laſtly, a Chriſtian cannot fail of being wholly inoffenſive, for his religion teacheth him, in all things to do to others what he would wiſh, in like circumſtances, they ſhould do to him.</p>
            <p>I am aware that I diſſent from one of thoſe paradoxical opinions with which modern times abound; that it is improper to fill the minds of youth with religious prejudices of any kind, and that they ſhould be left to chooſe their own principles, after they have arrived at an age in which they are capable of judging for themſelves. Could we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the mind in childhood and youth a perfect blank, this plan of education would have more to recommend it; but this we know to be impoſſible. The human mind runs as naturally into principles as it does
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019974_0016_0FAD48AB55519888"/>
after facts. It ſubmits with difficulty to thoſe reſtraints or partial diſcoveries which are impoſed upon it in the infancy of reaſon. Hence the impatience of children to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon all ſubjects that relate to the inviſible world. But I beg leave to aſk, Why ſhould we purſue a different plan of education with reſpect to religion from that which we purſue in teaching the arts and ſciences? Do we leave our youth to acquire ſyſtems of geography, philoſophy, or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, till they have arrived at an age in which they are capable of judgeing for themſelves? We do not. I claim no more then for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than for the other ſciences, and I add further, that if our youth are diſpoſed after they are of age to think for themſelves, a knowledge of <hi>one</hi> ſyſtem will be the beſt means of conducting them in a free enquiry into other ſyſtems of religion, juſt as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with one ſyſtem of philoſophy is the beſt introduction to the ſtudy of all the other ſyſtems in the world.</p>
            <p>I muſt beg leave upon this ſubject to go one ſtep further. In order more effectually to ſecure to our youth the advantages of a religious education, it is neceſſary to impoſe upon them the doctrines and diſcipline of a particular church. Man is naturally an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable animal, and obſervations on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſocieties and countries will teach us,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019974_0017_0FAD48AC0CDCA9E0"/>
that when we add the reſtraints of ecleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, to thoſe of domeſtic and civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we produce, in him, the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of order and virtue. That faſhionable liberality which refuſes to aſſociate with any one ſect of Chriſtians is ſeldom uſeful to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or to ſociety, and may fitly be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the unprofitable bravery of a ſoldier, who waſtes his valour in ſolitary enterprizes, without the aid or effect of military aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Far be it from me to recommend the doctrines or modes of worſhip of any one denomination of Chriſtians. I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the perſons entruſted with the education of youth, to inculcate upon them a ſtrict conformity to that mode of worſhip which is moſt agreeable to their conſciences, or the inclinations of their parents.</p>
            <p>Under this head, I muſt be excuſed in not agreeing with thoſe modern writers who have oppoſed the uſe of the Bible as a ſchool book. The only objection I know to it is, its diviſion into chapters and verſes, and its improper punctuation, which render it a more difficult book to read <hi>well,</hi> than many others; but theſe defects may eaſily be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; and the diſadvantages of them are not to be mentioned with the immenſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of making children early, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with the means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring happineſs both here and hereafter.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019974_0018_0FAD48AD35ACE7E0"/>
How great is the difference between making young people acquainted with the intereſting and entertaining truths contained in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the fables of Moore and Croxall, or the doubtful hiſtories of antiquity! I maintain that there is no book of its ſize in the whole world, that contains half ſo much uſeful knowledge for the government of ſtates, or the direction of the affairs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals as the bible. To object to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of having it read in ſchools, becauſe it tends to deſtroy our veneration for it, is an argument that applies with equal force, againſt the frequency of public worſhip, and all other religious exerciſes. The firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon the mind are the moſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They ſurvive the wreck of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and exiſt in old age after the ideas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in middle life have been obliterated. Of how much conſequence then muſt it be to the human mind in the evening of life, to be able to recal thoſe ideas which are moſt eſſential to its happineſs; and theſe are to be found chiefly in the Bible. The great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which old people take in reading the Bible, I am perſuaded is derived chiefly from its hiſtories and precepts being <hi>aſſociated</hi> with the events of childhood and youth, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of which forms a material part of their pleaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:019974_0019_0FAD48AD93916E10"/>
I do not mean to exclude books of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, poetry or even fables from our ſchools. They may, and ſhould be read frequently by our young people, but if the Bible is made to give way to them altogether, I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that it will be read, in a ſhort time, only in churches, and in a few years will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be found only in the offices of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and in courts of juſtice.<note n="*" place="bottom">In a republic where all votes for public officers are given by <hi>ballot,</hi> ſhould not a knowledge of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing be conſidered as eſſential qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for an elector? and when a man, who is of a doubtful character, offers his vote, would it not be more conſiſtent with ſound policy and wiſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to oblige him to read a few verſes in the Bible to prove his qualifications, than ſimply to compel him to kiſs the <hi>outſide</hi> of it?</note>
            </p>
            <p>NEXT to the duty which young men owe to their Creator, I wiſh to ſee a SUPREME REGARD TO THEIR COUNTRY, inculcated upon them. When the Duke of Sully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came prime miniſter to Henry the IVth of France, the firſt thing he did, he tells us, "Was to ſubdue and forget his own heart." The ſame duty is incumbent upon every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of a republic. Our country includes family, friends and property, and ſhould be preferred to them all. Let our pupil be taught that he does not belong to himſelf, but that he is public property. Let him be taught to love his family, but let him be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019974_0020_0FAD48AE54D5D108"/>
taught, at the ſame time, that he muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and even forget them, when the welfare of his country requires it. He muſt watch for the ſtate as if its liberties depended upon his vigilance alone, but he muſt do this in ſuch a manner as not to defraud his creditors, or neglect his family. He muſt love private life, but he muſt decline no ſtation, however public or reſponſable it may be, when called to it by the ſuffrages of his fellow-citizens. He muſt love popularity, but he muſt deſpiſe it when ſet in competition with the dictates of his judgement, or the real intereſt of his country. He muſt love character, and have a due ſenſe of injuries, but he muſt be taught to appeal only to the laws of the ſtate, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the one, and puniſh the other. He muſt love family honour, but he muſt be taught that neither the rank nor antiquity of his anceſtors can command reſpect, without perſonal merit. He muſt avoid neutrality in all queſtions that divide the ſtate, but he muſt ſhun the rage, and acrimony of party ſpirit. He muſt be taught to love his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in every part of the world, but he muſt cheriſh with a more intenſe and peculiar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the citizens of Pennſylvania and of the United States. I do not wiſh to ſee our youth educated with a ſingle prejudice againſt any nation or country; but we impoſe a taſk upon human nature, repugnant alike to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019974_0021_0FAD48AF1CE92B38"/>
revelation and the ordinary dimenſions of the human heart, when we require him to embrace, with equal affection, the whole family of mankind. He muſt be taught to amaſs wealth, but it muſt be only to encreaſe his power of contributing to the wants and demands of the ſtate. He muſt be indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed occaſionally in amuſements, but he muſt be taught that ſtudy and buſineſs ſhould be his principal purſuits in life. Above all he muſt love life, and endeavour to acquire as many of its conveniences as poſſible by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and oeconomy, but he muſt be taught that this life "Is not his own," when the ſafety of his country requires it. Theſe are practicable leſſons, and the hiſtory of the commonwealths of Greece and Rome ſhow, that human nature, without the aids of Chriſtianity, has attained theſe degrees of perfection.</p>
            <p>While we inculcate theſe republican duties upon our pupil, we muſt not neglect, at the ſame time, to inſpire him with republican principles. He muſt be taught that there can be no durable liberty but in a republic, and that government, like all other ſciences, is of a progreſſive nature. The chains which have bound this ſcience in Europe are happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unlooſed in America. <hi>Here</hi> it is open to inveſtigation and improvement. While phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy has protected us by its diſcoveries
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019974_0022_0FAD48AFCBCD83D0"/>
from a thouſand natural evils, government has unhappily followed with an unequal pace. It would be to diſhonour human ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius only to name the many defects which ſtill exiſt in the beſt ſyſtems of legiſlation. We daily ſee matter of a periſhable nature rendered durable by certain chemical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In like manner, I conceive, that it is poſſible to analyze and combine power in ſuch a manner as not only to encreaſe the happineſs, but to promote the duration of republican forms of government far beyond the terms limited for them by hiſtory, or the common opinions of mankind.</p>
            <p>To aſſiſt in rendering religious, moral and political inſtruction more effectual upon the minds of our youth, it will be neceſſary to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their bodies to phyſical diſcipline. To obviate the inconveniences of their ſtudious and ſedantary mode of life, they ſhould live upon a temperate diet, conſiſting chiefly of broths, milk and vegetables. The black broth of Sparta, and the barley broth of Scotland, have been alike celebrated for their beneficial effects upon the minds of young people. They ſhould avoid taſting ſpirituous liquors. They ſhould alſo be accuſtomed occaſionally to work with their hands, in the intervals of ſtudy, and in the buſy ſeaſons of the year in the country. Moderate ſleep, ſilence, occaſional ſolitude,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019974_0023_0FAD48B0B036D1B8"/>
and cleanlineſs, ſhould be inculcated upon them, and the utmoſt advantage ſhould be taken of a proper direction of thoſe great principles in human conduct,—ſenſibility, habit, imitation, and aſſociation.</p>
            <p>The influence theſe phyſical cauſes will be powerful upon the intellects, as well as upon the principles and morals of young people.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who have ſtudied human nature, it will not appear paradoxical to recommend, in this eſſay, a particular attention to vocal muſic. Its mechanical effects in civilizing the mind, and thereby preparing it for the influence of religion and government, have been ſo often felt and recorded, that it will be unneceſſary to mention facts in favour of its uſefulneſs in order to excite a proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it.</p>
            <p>In the education of youth, let the authority of our maſters be as <hi>abſolute</hi> as poſſible. The government of ſchools like the government of private families, ſhould be <hi>arbitary,</hi> that it may not be <hi>ſevere.</hi> By this mode of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, we prepare our youth for the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of laws, and thereby qualify them for becoming good citizens of the republic. I am ſatisfied that the moſt uſeful citizens have been formed from thoſe youth who have never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age, and I have often thought that ſociety owes a great deal
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019974_0024_0FAD48B1644E2C98"/>
of its order and happineſs to the deficiencies of parental government, being ſupplied by thoſe habits of obedience and ſubordination which are contracted at ſchools.</p>
            <p>I cannot help bearing a teſtimony, in this place, againſt the cuſtom, which prevails in ſome parts of America, (but which is daily falling into diſuſe in Europe) of crouding boys together under one roof for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of education. The practice is the gloomy remains of monkiſh ignorance, and is as unfavourable to the improvements of the mind in uſeful learning, as monaſteries are to the ſpirit of religion. I grant this mode of ſecluding boys from the intercourſe of private families, has a tendency to make them ſcholars, but our buſineſs is to make them men, citizens and chriſtians. The vices of young people are generally learned from each other. The vices of adults ſeldom infect them. By ſeparating them from each other, therefore, in their hours of relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from ſtudy, we ſecure their morals from a principal ſource of corruption, while we improve their manners, by ſubjecting them to thoſe reſtraints, which the difference of age and ſex, naturally produce in private families.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto ſaid nothing of the AMUSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS that are proper for young people in a republic. Thoſe which promote health and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019974_0025_0FAD48B243B7B4B8"/>
good humour, will have a happy effect upon morals and government. To encreaſe this influence, let the perſons who direct theſe amuſements, be admitted into good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſubjected, by that means, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints in behaviour and moral conduct. Taverns which in moſt countries are expoſed to riot and vice, in Connecticut are places of buſineſs and innocent pleaſure, becauſe the tavern-keepers in that country are generally men of ſober and reſpectable characters. The theatre will never be perfectly reformed till players are treated with the ſame reſpect as perſons of other ornamental profeſſions. It is to no purpoſe to attempt to write or preach down an amuſement, which ſeizes ſo forcibly upon all the powers of the mind. Let mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preach <hi>to</hi> players, inſtead of <hi>againſt</hi> them; let them open their churches and the ordinances of religion to them and their families, and, I am perſuaded, we ſhall ſoon ſee ſuch a reformation in the theatre as can never be effected by all the means that have hitherto been employed for that purpoſe. It is poſſible to render the ſtage, by theſe means, ſubſurvient to the purpoſes of virtue and even religion. Why ſhould the miniſter of the goſpel exclude the player from his viſits, or from his public or private inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? The Author of Chriſtianity knew no difference in the occupations of men. He
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019974_0026_0FAD48B2D274CEC8"/>
eat and drank daily with publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>From the obſervations that have been made it is plain, that I conſider it as poſſible to convert men into republican machines. This muſt be done, if we expect them to perform their parts properly, in the great machine of the government of the ſtate. That republic is ſophiſticated with monarchy or ariſtocracy that does not revolve upon the wills of the people, and theſe muſt be fitted to each other by means of education before they can be made to produce regularity and uniſon in government.</p>
            <p>Having pointed out thoſe general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which ſhould be inculcated alike in all the ſchools of the ſtate, I proceed now to make a few remarks upon the method of conducting, what is commonly called, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral or learned education in a republic.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin this part of my ſubject by bearing a teſtimony againſt the common practice of attempting to teach boys the learned languages, and the arts and ſciences too early in life. The firſt twelve years of life are barely ſufficient to inſtruct a boy in reading, writing and arithmetic. With theſe, he may be taught thoſe modern languages which are neceſſary for him to <hi>ſpeak.</hi> The ſtate of the memory, in early life, is favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the acquiſition of languages, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019974_0027_0FAD48B3852598B0"/>
when they are conveyed to the mind through the ear. It is, moreover, in early life only, that the organs of ſpeech yield in ſuch a manner as to favour the juſt pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of foreign languages.</p>
            <p>I do not wiſh the LEARNED OR DEAD LAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUAGES, as they are commonly called, to be reduced below their preſent juſt rank in the univerſities of Europe, eſpecially as I conſider an acquaintance with them as the beſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a correct and extenſive knowledge of the language of our country. Too much pains cannot be taken to teach our youth to read and write our American language with propriety and elegance. The ſtudy of the Greek language conſtituted a material part of the literature of the Athenians, hence the ſublimity, purity and immortality of ſo many of their writings. The advantages of a perfect knowledge of our language to young men intended for the profeſſions of law, phyſic or divinity are too obvious to be mentioned, but in a ſtate which boaſts of the firſt commercial city in America, I wiſh to ſee it cultivated by young men, who are intended for the compting houſe, for many ſuch, I hope, will be educated in our col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. The time is paſt when an academical education was thought to be unneceſſary to qualify a young man for merchandize. I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019974_0028_0FAD48B4610E2498"/>
conceive no profeſſion is capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more embelliſhments from it.</p>
            <p>Connected with the ſtudy of our own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is the ſtudy of ELOQUENCE. It is well known how great a part it conſtituted of the Roman education. It is the firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in a republic, and often ſets the whole machine of government in motion. Let our youth, therefore, be inſtructed in this art. We do not extol it too highly when we attribute as much to the power of eloquence as to the ſword in bringing about the American revolution.</p>
            <p>With the uſual arts and ſciences that are taught in our American colleges, I wiſh to ſee a regular courſe of lectures given upon HISTORY and CHRONOLOGY. The ſcience of government, whether it relates to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions or laws, can only be advanced by a careful ſelection of facts, and theſe are to be found chiefly in hiſtory. Above all, let our youth be inſtructed in the hiſtory of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient republics, and the progreſs of liberty and tyranny in the different ſtates of Europe. I wiſh likewiſe to ſee the numerous facts that relate to the origin and preſent ſtate of COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERCE, together with the nature and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of MONEY, reduced to ſuch a ſyſtem as to be intelligible and agreeable to a young man. If we conſider the commerce of our metropolis only as the avenue of the wealth
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019974_0029_0FAD48B50D16EFD8"/>
of the ſtate, the ſtudy of it merits a place in a young man's education; but, I conſider commerce in a much higher light when I recommend the ſtudy of it in republican ſeminaries. I view it as the beſt ſecurity againſt the influence of heriditary monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of land, and, therefore, the ſureſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection againſt ariſtocracy. I conſider its effects as next to thoſe of religion in huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing mankind, and laſtly, I view it as the means of uniting the different nations of the world together by the ties of mutual wants and obligations.</p>
            <p>CHEMISTRY by unfolding to us the effects of heat and mixture, enlarges our acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the wonders of nature, and the myſteries of art, hence it has become, in moſt of the univerſities of Europe, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary branch of a gentleman's education. In a young country, where improvements in agriculture and manufactures are ſo much to be deſired, the cultivation of this ſcience, which explains the principles of both of them, ſhould be conſidered as an object of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance.</p>
            <p>In a ſtate where every citizen is liable to be a ſoldier and a legiſlator, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have ſome regular inſtruction given upon the ART OF WAR and upon PRACTICAL LEGISLATION. Theſe branches of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are of too much importance in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019974_0030_0FAD48B5C4A95C00"/>
to be truſted to ſolitary ſtudy, or to a fortuitous acquaintance with books. Let mathematical learning, therefore, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied, in our colleges, to gunnery and fortification, and let philoſophy be applied to the hiſtory of thoſe compoſitions which have been made uſe of for the terrible pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of deſtroying human life. Theſe branches of knowledge will be indiſpenſably neceſſary in our republic, if unfortunately war ſhould continue hereafter to be the unchriſtian mode of arbitrating diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſtian nations. Again, let our youth be inſtructed in all the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting national proſperity and independence, whether they relate to improvements in agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, manufactures, or inland navigation. Let him be inſtructed further in the general principles of legiſlation, whether they relate to revenue, or to the preſervation of life, liberty or property. Let him be directed frequently to attend the courts of juſtice, where he will have the beſt opportunities of acquiring habits of arranging and comparing his ideas by obſerving the ſecretion of truth, in the examination of witneſſes, and where he will hear the laws of the ſtate explained, with all the advantages of that ſpecies of eloquence which belongs to the bar. Of ſo much importance do I conceive it to be, to a young man, to attend occaſionally to the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019974_0031_0FAD48B68A5241F8"/>
deciſions of our courts of law, that I wiſh to ſee our colleges and academies eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, only in county towns.</p>
            <p>But further, conſidering the nature of our connection with the United States it will be neceſſary to make our pupil acquainted with all the prerogatives of the foederal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He muſt be inſtructed in the nature and variety of treaties. He muſt know the difference in the powers and duties of the ſeveral ſpecies of ambaſſadors. He muſt be taught wherein the obligations of individuals and of ſtates are the ſame, and wherein they differ. In ſhort, he muſt acquire a general knowledge of all thoſe laws and forms, which unite the ſovereigns of the earth, or ſeparate them from each other.</p>
            <p>I have only to add that it will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to adopt this, or any other mode of education, unleſs we make choice of ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maſters to carry our plans into execution. Let our teachers be diſtinguiſhed for their abilities and knowledge. Let them be grave in their manners,—gentle in their tempers,—exemplary in their morals, and of found principles in religion and government. Let us not leave their ſupport to the precarious reſources to be derived from their pupils, but let ſuch funds be provided for our ſchools and colleges as will enable us to allow them liberal ſalaries. By theſe means we ſhall
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019974_0032_0FAD48B7B17D3C38"/>
render the chairs,—the profeſſorſhips and rectorſhips of our colleges and academies objects of competition among learned men. By conferring upon our maſters that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which is the companion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, we ſhall, moreover, ſtrengthen their authority over the youth committed to their care. Let us remember that a great part of the divines, lawyers, phyſicians, legiſlators, ſoldiers, generals, delegates, counſellors, and governors of the ſtate will probably hereafter paſs through their hands. How great then ſhould be the wiſdom!—how honourable the rank! and how generous the reward of thoſe men who are to form theſe neceſſary and leading members of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public!</p>
            <p>I beg pardon for having delayed ſo long, to ſay any thing of the ſeparate and peculiar mode of education proper for WOMEN in a republic. I am ſenſible that they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in all our plans of education for young men, or no laws will ever render them effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. To qualify our women for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they ſhould not only be inſtructed in the uſual branches of female education, but they ſhould be inſtructed in the principles of liberty and government; and the obligations of patriotiſm, ſhould be inculcated upon them. The opinions and conduct of men are often regulated by the women in the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019974_0033_0FAD48B80A374BA0"/>
moſt arduous enterprizes of life; and their approbation is frequently the principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the hero's dangers, and the patriot's toils. Beſides, the <hi>firſt</hi> impreſſions upon the minds of children are generally derived from the women. Of how much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, therefore, is it in a republic, that they ſhould think juſtly upon the great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of liberty and government!</p>
            <p>The complaints that have been made againſt religion, liberty and learning, have been made againſt each of them in a <hi>ſeperate</hi> ſtate. Perhaps like certain liquors, they ſhould only be uſed in a ſtate of mixture. They mutually aſſiſt in correcting the abuſes, and in improving the good effects of each other. From the combined and reciprocal influence of religion, liberty and learning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the morals, manners and knowledge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, of theſe, upon government, and of government, upon individuals, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to meaſure the degrees of happineſs and perfection to which mankind may be raiſed. For my part, I can form no ideas of the golden age, ſo much celebrated by the poets, more delightful, than the contemplation of that happineſs which it is now in the power of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania to confer upon her citizens, by eſtabliſhing proper modes and places of education in every part of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:019974_0034_0FAD48B8CF6D3418"/>
The <hi>preſent time</hi> is peculiarly favourable to the eſtabliſhment of theſe benevolent and neceſſary inſtitutions in Pennſylvania. The minds of our people have not as yet loſt the yeilding texture they acquired by the heat of the late revolution. They will <hi>now</hi> receive more readily, than five or even three years hence, new impreſſions and habits of all kinds. The ſpirit of liberty <hi>now</hi> pervades every part of the ſtate. The influence of error and deception are <hi>now</hi> of ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Seven years hence, the affairs of our ſtate may aſſume a new complexion. We may be rivetted to a criminal indifference for the ſafety and happineſs of ourſelves and our poſterity. An ariſtocratic or democratic junto may ariſe, that ſhall find its deſpotic views connected with the prevalence of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and vice in the ſtate; or a few art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pedagogues who conſider learning as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful only in proportion as it favours their pride or avarice, may prevent all new literary eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments from taking place, by raiſing a hue and cry againſt them, as the offspring of improper rivalſhip, or the nurſeries of party ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But in vain ſhall we laviſh pains and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, in eſtabliſhing nurſeries of virtue and knowledge in every part of the ſtate. In vain ſhall we attempt to give the minds of our citizens a virtuous and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

early life, while the arms of our ſtate are opened alike to receive into its boſom, and to confer equal priviledges upon, the virtuous emigrant, and the annual refuſe of the jails of Britain, Ireland and our ſiſter ſtates. Of the many criminals that have been executed within theſe ſeven years, four out of five of them have been foreigners, who have arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here during the war and ſince the peace. We are yet, perhaps, to ſee, and deplore the tracks of the enormous vices and crimes theſe men have left behind them. Legiſlators of Pennſylvania!—Stewards of the juſtice and virtue of heaven!—Fathers of children, who may be corrupted and diſgraced by bad examples; ſay—can nothing be done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our morals, manners, and government, from the infection of European vices?</p>
