            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt all be ſenſible that there are bad and fooliſh People of all Nations, whom at Times the evil Spirit gets the better of, and tempts to murder their moſt intimate Friends, and even Relations, in order to diſturb the Peace and Tranquillity of their Neighbours—Theſe Accidents often happen amongſt yourſelves, as well as among us, but the imprudent Act of a few fooliſh People ſhould not diſturb the Peace of the many wiſe and innocent amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>The great Giver of life has given us a good Heart, and Tongues to ſpeak the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our Hearts to each other—And when any Misfortune happens of this Kind to either of us, we ſhould conſider well the Conſequences, and meet under the Tree of Peace, and ſmoke together as our Forefathers formerly did, and endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and ſettle any Diſputes that might formerly happen, that ſo no black Clouds might ariſe over our Heads, to prevent us from ſeeing the Sun riſe and ſet over us in the ſtricteſt Friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>This is the Method I propoſe to take on this unlucky Occaſion, and recommend to you my Brethren, and deſire you may reſt eaſy and ſatisfied till you hear from me again. The ſtricteſt Juſtice ſhall be done you, and I make no Doubt but you will be ſatisfied with my Conduct.</p>
                     <p>On firſt hearing of this unfortunate Affair, I iſſued a Proclamation, and had thoſe two Men apprehended and put into Priſon, and make no Doubt but to bring them to that Puniſhment ſo heinous a Crime deſerves, by the Laws of their Country.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> and informed him of this Accident; and as ſoon as my Expreſs returns, you may be ſure to hear from me and him farther on this Matter, and more to your Satisfaction, at you will be convinced of the Juſtice and upright Intentions of all His Majeſty's Subjects, towards your ſeveral Nations.</p>

               <p>The Grief and Concern which you have expreſſed to us, on Account of the late Miſchiefs committed on our People, we believe to be very ſincere, and that they were cauſed by the Evil Spirit.

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>

               <p>As the People, who have ſettled your Lands, came chiefly from <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of that Province likewiſe iſſued Proclamations and Orders to the ſame Purpoſe.

                  </note> that they had been encouraged by the <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to continue on thoſe Lands; that, however, they are determined to obey the Law, and move off without Delay. But, Brethren, we are ſorry to tell you, that as ſoon as the Men ſent by the Governor had prevailed on the Settlers to conſent to a Compliance with the Law, there came among them eight <hi>Indians,</hi> who live at the <hi>Mingo</hi> Town down this River, and deſired the People not to leave their Settlements, but to ſit quiet on them till the preſent Treaty at this Place ſhould be concluded. The People, on receiving this Advice and Encouragement, ſuddenly changed their Minds, and determined not to quit their Places, till they ſhould hear farther from the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> then delivered to the Men ſent by the Governor a String of Wampum, and a Speech, which they deſired them to carry to the Governor. The Speech was this:—<q>You are ſent here by your great Men to tell theſe People to go away from the Lands which you ſay is ours, and our great Men have ſent us, and we are glad to meet here the ſame Day. We tell you the white People muſt ſtop, and we ſtop them till the Treaty; and when <hi>George Croghan</hi> and our great Men ſhall ſpeak together, we will tell them what to do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Brethren, we cannot help expreſſing to you our great Concern at this Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> as it has abſolutely fruſtrated the Steps the Governor was taking to do you Juſtice, by the immediate Removal of thoſe People from your Lands. And we muſt tell you. Brethren, that the Conduct of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> appears to us very aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and we are much at a Loſs to account for the Reaſon of it at this Time, when the <hi>Six Nations</hi> are complaining of Encroachments being made on their Lands. You your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Brethren, muſt be very ſenſible that, while any of the <hi>Indians</hi> encourage the People to ſtay on your Lands, it will inevitably defeat all our Meaſures to remove them. But, Brethren, all that we have now to deſire of you is, that you will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſend off ſome of your prudent and wiſe Men with a Meſſage to the People ſettled at <hi>Redſtone, Youghoghainy,</hi> and <hi>Monongahela,</hi> to contradict the Advice of the eight <hi>Indians</hi> from the <hi>Mingo</hi> Town; and to acquaint them that you very much diſapprove of their continuing any longer on their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>If you agree to this, we will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

With Regard to theſe Things we can only ſay, it is not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing to us that you ſhould mention them at this Time, as we have always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that this Matter was ſettled with the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and all other <hi>Indians,</hi> ſeveral Years ago, and their full Conſent obtained for keeping Forts in your Country, as well as for going down this River to trade. But, Brethren, as we came here to confer with you on Subjects which only relate to the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> we have no Concern in this Buſineſs.

Mr. <hi>Steel,</hi> and the other Gentlemen whom the Governor ſent up to them in <hi>March</hi> laſt.</p>
                     <p>But ſhould you find any of thoſe inconſiderate People ſtill actuated by a lawleſs and obſtinate Spirit to bid Defiance to the civil Authority, you may let them know, that we were under no Neceſſity of ſending, in the Name of the Governor, any further Notice to them, or of being at the Pains of making them acquainted with the real Minds of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to induce them to quit their Settlements, for that the Powers of Government are ſufficient to compel them to pay due Obedience to the Laws; and they may depend upon it, they will be effectually exerted, if they perſiſt in their Obſtinacy.</p>
                     <p>You may likewiſe aſſure them, that they need not attempt to make an Offer of Terms with the Government reſpecting their Removal, as we hear ſome of them have vainly propoſed to do, by ſaying, they would go off the Lands immediately, on Condition that they ſhould be ſecured to them as ſoon as the Proprietary Purchaſe is made. It is a high Inſult on Government for thoſe People even to hint ſuch Things.</p>
                     <p>The only Motives, therefore, which excite us to make Uſe of the preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient of ſending you with Meſſengers from the <hi>Indians</hi> on this Occaſion, is the compaſſionate Concern we have for the dangerous Situation and Diſtreſſes of thoſe unhappy People, and the Hopes we have that, by this Means, they may be convinced it is their true and beſt Intereſt to pay a due Submiſſion to the Laws, by relinquiſhing their Settlements without Delay. If any of them ſhould talk of petitioning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor for a Preference in taking up the Lands they have improved, you may aſſure them from us, that it will be to no Manner of Purpoſe, till they have firſt complied with the Law.</p>
                     <p>We depend greatly on your Care and Prudence in executing this Buſineſs to our Satisfaction, and recommend it to you to be particularly careful that the <hi>Indian</hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers are treated with the greateſt Civility and Kindneſs. When you return to Fort <hi>Bedford,</hi> we beg you will write us an Account of your Proceedings. We wiſh you a ſafe Return to your Families, and are, with great Regard,</p>

               <p>Meſſrs. <hi>Frazer</hi> and <hi>Thompſon</hi> being in Readineſs with their Horſes and Proviſions, for their Journey to <hi>Redſtone</hi> Creek, the Commiſſioners ſent ſeveral Times for the <hi>Indian</hi> Meſſengers, who at laſt came to them to the Fort, and acquainted them that they had been ſeriouſly conſidering the Buſineſs they were going to be ſent on, and it now appeared to them ſo diſagreeable, that they could by no means conſent to undertake it, and immediately returned the Wampum which had been given them. Upon being interrogated, as to the Reaſons of their declining to perform what they had conſented to, they anſwered, that three of them were ſent as Deputies by the <hi>Six Nation</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to attend the Treaty here; and having received no Directions from them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further, they choſe to return Home, in order to make Report of what they had ſeen and heard at this Place. They further added, that the driving white People away from their Settlements was a Matter which no <hi>Indians</hi> could, with any Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, be concerned in, and they thought it moſt proper for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves to compel their own People to remove from the <hi>Indian</hi> Lands.</p>
               <p>After this Refuſal of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who had been appointed to carry the Meſſage from the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> the Commiſſioners in vain attempted to perſuade or procure others to execute the Buſineſs, though they uſed great Endeavours for that Purpoſe; and they thought it both uſeleſs and imprudent to continue to preſs a Matter on the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> which they found they were generally much averſe to; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſet out on their Return to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> without further Delay. But in a ſhort Time afterwards <hi>Kayaſhuta</hi> came with <hi>Arroas</hi> (a principal Warrior of the <hi>Six

                  <hi>Indian</hi> Meſſengers going to <hi>Redſtone,</hi> according to your Deſire, and our Agreement; and I am much afraid that you are now going away from us with a diſcontented Mind, on this Account. Believe me, Brethren, this Thought fills my Heart with the deepeſt Grief, and I could not ſuffer you to leave us without ſpeaking to you on this Subject, and endeavouring to make your Minds eaſy. We were all of us much diſpoſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with your Requeſt, and expected it could have been done without Difficulty, but I now find that not only the <hi>Indians</hi> appointed by us, but all our other young Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are very unwilling to carry a Meſſage from us to the white People, ordering them to remove from our Lands. They ſay they would not chooſe to incur the ill Will o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thoſe People, for, if they ſhould be now removed, they will hereafter return to thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Settlements, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have purchaſed the Country from us. And we ſhall be very unhappy, if, by our Conduct towards them at this Time, we ſhall give them Reaſon to diſlike us, and treat us in an unkind Manner when they again become our Neighbours. We therefore hope, Brethren, you will not be diſpleaſed with us for not performing our Agreement with you, for you may be aſſured that we have good Hearts towards all our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners returned <hi>Kayaſhuta</hi> many Thanks for his friendly Behaviour on this Occaſion; and aſſured him that they greatly approved of the Conduct of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> during the Treaty, and were now returning home with very eaſy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Minds. They further acquainted him that their Reaſon for urging them to ſend a Meſſage to the <hi>Redſtone</hi> Settlers proceeded intirely from the great Anxiety they had of contributing every Thing in their Power, that might expedite the Meaſures taken by the Government to do them Juſtice, and to redreſs every Injury they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of. Yet, as they found the Compliance of their Requeſt was diſagreeable to the <hi>Indians,</hi> they ſhould not preſs the Matter on them any further, though it appeared to be a Step very neceſſary to be taken at this Time.</p>
               <p>They then took Leave of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the moſt friendly Manner, and ſat out on their Return to <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
