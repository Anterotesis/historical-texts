            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Epiſtle to the Galatians, IV. 31.</bibl>
               <q>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE churches of Galatia conſiſted principally of Jewiſh converts, who were engaged to incorporate the Moſaic ritual with the Chriſtian profeſſion. They boaſted, at the ſame time, "We be Abraham's children, and were never in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age." With great addreſs and pertinency St. Paul reminds them, "Abraham had two ſons; one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman." Theſe were emblems of the <hi>two covenants.</hi> Iſhmael, by Hagar the bond-woman, repreſented the Sinai' co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; Iſaac, by Sarah the free-woman, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Abrahamic covenant. The former was local and temporary, founded in worldly promiſes, had burthenſome appendages, and only a ſhadow of heavenly things. The latter was univerſal and permanent, a covenant of better hopes, and ſtripped of that ceremonial which was a yoke of bondage.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle hath deſcribed the Chriſtian church in diſtinction from the Jewiſh thus: The Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moſes were like an heir in his minority, who is under tutors and governors. The law was a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to bring them to Chriſt. He came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them that were under the law; that they might be no longer ſervants, but ſons; heirs of full age, heirs of God through Chriſt. "Now we, brethren, are the children of promiſe, as was Iſaac," with whom the covenant of better hopes was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023308_0005_0FBEF003475FEC98"/>
               <hi>We are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The apoſtle proceeds: "Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age." The Sinai' covenant was ſubſervient to the Abrahamic, till the ſeed promiſed to Abraham came. When this ſeed came, that covenant had anſwered its purpoſe, and gave place to a more lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral one. The Jewiſh converts acknowledged that this ſeed was come: But they encroached on the liberty of their fellow-Chriſtians, by attempting to compel their obſervance of the abrogated ordinanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Moſes. This was <hi>falling from grace,</hi> cutting themſelves off from the privileges of the children of the free-woman, and deſiring again to be in bondage to weak and beggarly rudiments: It was returning to a ſtate of minority, after the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the father for their majority and freedom.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle further acquaints them, that "the bleſſing of Abraham was come on the GENTILES through Jeſus Chriſt." For the promiſe was thus expreſſed: "In thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed." There is therefore no difference, under the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an inſtitution, between Jews and other nations. The latter, though by nature in bondage, are made equally free of the family of Chriſt as the former. This is the fulfilment of the prediction, "I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. Where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people, there ſhall they be called the children of the living God." The text, though immediately addreſſed to Jewiſh believers, is equally applicable to believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. <hi>Theſe</hi> are not, any more than <hi>thoſe,</hi> children of the bond-woman, but of the free. They are "all one in Chriſt Jeſus—children of God, whether
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023308_0006_0FBEF004EFDEAB50"/>
Jew or Greek, bond or free, male or female—If Chriſt's, then Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe."</p>
            <p>Chriſtian freedom, being alike the privilege of converts from Judaiſm and heatheniſm, primarily intends, on the part of the former, the abolition of the encumbered ritual of Moſes; and, on the part of the latter, liberation from idolatrous ſuperſtition, to which they were in ſervile ſubjection: On the part of both it intends deliverance from the ſlavery of vicious paſſions.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt appeared, the whole world were ſunk in ignorance and wickedneſs. The Gentiles, <hi>profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, know not God,</hi> and worſhipped and ſerved the creature more than the Creator. They were vaſſals to the prince of the power of the air. The Chriſtian diſpenſation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven, called them out of darkneſs into marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light; they were turned from dumb idols, from the power of Satan, from worldly pollutions, to ſerve the living God. The Jewiſh church had corrupted and made void the law of God. Their guides taught for doctrines the commandments of men, perverted to a worldly ſenſe the promiſes of ſpiritual redemption, and impoſed a greater burthen of ceremonies than Moſes had enjoined. Chriſt removed the vail of Moſes, <hi>conſecrated a new and living way</hi> to God, reſcued the precepts of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue from the gloſſes of blind and intereſted guides, and diſburthened religion of that weight under which it had groaned. His <hi>yoke is eaſy,</hi> and <hi>his burthen light. Where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty</hi> in the higheſt ſenſe. The ſpirit of life in Chriſt removes the dominion of ſin. His diſciples, made free from ſin, <hi>walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. There is no condemnation
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023308_0007_0FBEF009908B4290"/>
to them.</hi> Thus emancipated, they "wait for the hope of righteouſneſs by faith—the redemption of the body." When made free of the kingdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them, ſin and the curſe, pain, ſorrow, death ſhall be no more. How glorious this liberty!</p>
            <p>Further: Chriſtianity is <hi>a reaſonable ſervice,</hi> and founded in perſonal perſuaſion. It permits us to "call no man maſter; for one is our maſter, even Chriſ" to whom alone every one muſt ſtand or fall. His religion is friendly to free enquiry: It directs us to "prove all things"—to claim the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of grounding our faith, not on the wiſdom of man, but the power of God; and to allow others the ſame. Our liberty may not be judged of their conſciences, nor their liberty of our conſcience. They who are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak; and ſhould take heed leſt by any means their liberty, their improved knowledge in Chriſtianity, ſhould be a ſtumbling block to unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed minds. "Uſe not liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another. There is one body, and one ſpirit, and we are called in one hope. One Lord, one faith, one baptiſm, one God and Father of all."</p>
            <p>How then ſhould different profeſſors, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent denominations, endeavour to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, with all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility and charity? The body of Chriſt is one, and hath many members. The members then "ſhould have the ſame care one for another. If one ſuffer, all the members ſhould ſuffer with it; or if one be honoured, all the members ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with it." Thoſe are <hi>carnal, and walk as men,</hi> who contend for the ſyſtem of this or that man, or body of men. The children of the bond-woman would exclude from the privileges of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an church, and doom to eternal chains, ſuch as do
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023308_0008_0FBEF00C6E9EFB78"/>
not embrace the faith or opinions they hold: But the children of the free-woman <hi>have not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi> The ſimplicity and perſpicuity of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inſtitution, deſigned to guide men of common underſtanding in the paths of ſalvation, can derive no aſſiſtance from ſpeculations too high for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind—too high alſo for thoſe who exerciſe themſelves therein.</p>
            <p>In going off from one extreme, let us ſhun the other. "We are called unto liberty:" Should it be an occaſion of infidelity and indifference to all religion, the guilt and ſhame muſt be aggravated. The real friends of liberty always diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween freedom and licentiouſneſs. They know that the mind cannot be free, while blinded by ſceptical pride, or immerſed in ſenſuality. Liberty conſiſts not in ſubverting the foundations of ſociety, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without law. Nor doth it conſiſt in reaſoning againſt God, and providence, and revelation. Nor in attempting to explain his nature, his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſecret things which belong to him.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian liberty ſuppoſeth that we receive the record which God hath given of his Son—that we be not the ſervants of ſin, but have our fruit unto holineſs—that we abide in our callings.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The ſpirit of Chriſtianity hath the beſt aſpect on general liberty and the rights of mankind. Would we perſuade men to <hi>look, not on</hi> their <hi>own things, but on the things of others,</hi> let us ſet before them the pattern of Chriſt. Was ever grace or liberality like his, "who though he was rich, for our ſakes become poor, that we through his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might be rich?" He was "in the form of God,—but took upon him the form of a ſervant." He "came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and gave his life" to purchaſe ſpiritual and eternal redemption for the ſlaves of Satan. Poſſibly for a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023308_0009_0FBEF00DD82F6FD0"/>
               <hi>friend,</hi> or a <hi>good</hi> man, ſome might dare to die. But HE died for <hi>enemies,</hi> for the <hi>ungodly.</hi> Is it glorious to die for one's <hi>country?</hi> HE died for all the <hi>world.</hi> Were the ſame mind in us, we ſhould love all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and do good to all as we have opportunity. They who hate and perſecute us would be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our good wiſhes and forgiveneſs. We ſhould pray, "Father, forgive them." We ſhould have compaſſion on them, as the good Samaritan had on the Jew whom he found helpleſs and ready to periſh. Every natural and friendly, every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and public affection is cheriſhed and improved by looking unto Jeſus. And if we ſpeak of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal philanthropy, how doth every example fade before his? He is not aſhamed to call mankind his brethren. His love to them was ſtronger than death, when they had forfeited the privileges of children, and might have been conſigned, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſpirits, to chains and blackneſs of darkneſs. They owe all the liberty they have or hope for to his friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Where the ſpirit of Chriſt is, there is no envy, ſtrife or confuſion; no diſcord and war; no inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the rights of others, either thoſe of individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, or of ſocieties and nations; but meekneſs, peace, and harmony, joy in the happineſs, and commiſeration of the diſtreſſes of others. This ſpirit doth no ill to others, but all poſſible good. Rulers, under its influence, are not oppreſſors, but benefactors. Subjects do not reſiſt lawful authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but render tribute, cuſtom, fear, honour to whom they are due, leading a quiet life in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty. When the ſpirit of Chriſtianity ſhall univerſally prevail, as our hope is that it will, nations will "learn war no more; they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all God's holy mountain."</p>
            <p>Our Lord undertook not to ſay what men's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023308_0010_0FBEF00F38E2E590"/>
and civil rights are—what the prerogatives of princes, or the ſovereign power of a nation, and what the privileges of ſubjects.

            <p>Revelation has not informed us, what form of government is beſt adapted to anſwer the ends of ſociety. Every from muſt be ſome abridgment of natural liberty.

            <p>A zeal for the diſcovery of new territory marked the fifteenth century. The firſt navigations of the Europeans for this purpoſe were concerted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by prince Henry, fourth ſon of John I. king of Portugal. He was born 1394. His valor in the aſſault and capture of the city <hi>Ceuta</hi> in Africa, A. D. 1415, preſaged the fame he afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. From this period he devoted himſelf to naval expeditions for the diſcovery of unknown countries. The ſhips he ſent out ſubjected divers parts of Africa, and the neighbouring iſlands, to the dominion of Portugal. After the ſucceſs in doubling cape <hi>Bojador,</hi> he gave to his father and his ſucceſſors all the lands he had diſcovered, or might diſcover, and applied to pope <hi>Martin</hi> V. to ratify the donation. He engaged, that in all their expeditions the Portugueſe ſhould have mainly in view the extenſion of the Roman church and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of its pontif. Martin granted the prince's requeſt. In his bull of ratification, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023308_0012_0FBEF017226DE760"/>
the year 1430, it is declared, that "whatever might be diſcovered from the ſaid cape to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>India,</hi> ſhould pertain to the Portugueſe' do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion." Edward, brother to prince Henry, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the throne of Portugal 1433, on the death of John I. Pope <hi>Eugene</hi> IV. by his bull in 1438, ratified to Edward the grant made by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin V. A bull of <hi>Nicholas</hi> V. dated January 8, 1454, refers to the aforeſaid bulls of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, Martin and Eugene. It recites the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prince Henry had made of his atchievements—"<hi>that for 25 years he had not ceaſed to ſend an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually almoſt an army</hi>" of Portugueſe, "with the greateſt dangers, labors and charges, in moſt ſwift ſhips, to <hi>ſearch out the ſea and maritime provinces towards the ſouthern parts and antarctic pole"</hi>—that theſe ſhips "came at length to the province of <hi>Guinea,</hi> and took poſſeſſion of ſome iſlands, havens and ſea adjoining"—that "ſailing further, war was waged for ſome years with the people of thoſe parts, and very many iſlands near thereunto were ſubdued and peaceably poſſeſſed, and ſtill were poſſeſſed, with the adjacent ſea"—that "many <hi>Guineans</hi> and other <hi>negroes</hi> were taken thence by <hi>force,</hi> and ſome by <hi>barter.</hi>" The bull deſcribes prince Henry as "a true ſoldier of Chriſt, a moſt courageous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender and intrepid champion of the faith, aſpiring from his early youth with his utmoſt might to have the glorious name of Chriſt publiſhed, extolled and revered throughout the world." It recogniſeth the excluſive right of Portugal to the acquiſitions and poſſeſſions aforeſaid, in virtue of the letters of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and Eugene, which granted to the king of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal and prince Henry "free and ample faculty to <hi>invade, ſearch out, expugn, vanquiſh</hi> and <hi>ſubdue</hi> all pagans and enemies of Chriſt whereſoever placed, <hi>and their perſons to reduce to perpetual ſlavery,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023308_0013_0FBEF01938C20F50"/>
all their kingdoms, poſſeſſions and goods to <hi>apply</hi> and <hi>appropriate,</hi>" &amp;c. Pope Nicholas's letter then goes on to "decree and declare, the acqueſts <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> made, and what <hi>hereafter</hi> ſhall happen to be acquired, after that they ſhall be acquired, have pertained, and forever of right do belong and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to the aforeſaid king and his ſucceſſors, and not to any others whatever." It forbids, on the ſevereſt penalties, all Chriſtian powers from ſettling in the countries diſcovered by the Portugueſe, or any way moleſting them in their expeditions for the diſcovery and conqueſt of unknown countries. It ſpeaks of prince Henry's plan and his proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it as "a moſt <hi>pious</hi> works, and moſt worthy of perpetual remembrance, wherein the glory of God, with the intereſt of the commonwealth of the univerſal church are concerned."</p>
            <p>Thus were prince Henry's views and operations ſanctioned by the higheſt authority at that time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in Chriſtendom. A right derived from a ſource ſo venerable was then undiſputed. The Roman pontif bound princes at his pleaſure; and, as vicar of Chriſt, was allowed to have at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal all the kingdoms of the earth. This grant of Nicholas was confirmed by his ſucceſſor, Calixtus III. Auguſt 6, 1458.</p>
            <p>On the death of Edward, his ſon Alphonſus, then in his minority, ſucceeded to the throne of Portugal 1438, and died 1481. Prince Henry died 1460, or 1463. At his death the ſpirit of diſcovery lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; but revived with the acceſſion of John II. ſon of Alphonſus. John, the year after his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, (1482) ſent an embaſſy to Edward IV. of England, to acquaint him with the title acquired, by the pope's bull, to the conqueſts in Guinea; and requeſted him to diſſolve a fleet which ſome Engliſh merchants were fitting for the Guinea trade.

Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than half this number have ſailed from Liverpool, and the remainder from London, Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol and Lancaſter. They have traded for 40,000 ſlaves." An average for each veſſel will be 205. Poſtlethwait informs us, that in 1752 eighty eight veſſels from Liverpool to Africa brought away 25,940 ſlaves.<note n="§" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 709, 710.

            <p>M. le Abbe Raynal ſaith, (probably without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient attention, Vol. IV. p. 99.) "The trade of Africa hath never furniſhed the French colonies more than 13 or 14,000 ſlaves annually." This importation, he grants, was "<hi>inſufficient</hi>" for her colonies. It doth not correſpond to the number of ſlaves in them. If the trade had not furniſhed a ſufficiency for themſelves, would they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to ſupply Spain with 4,000 ſlaves annually for ten ſucceſſive years? "<hi>Good judges,</hi>" ſaith Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlethwait, (Vol. I. p. 726.) "reckon that 30,000 negroes are annually imported into the French ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar iſlands."

one quarter are negro ſlaves. In the four ſtates next north of Maryland are 45,401 ſlaves. In New-England 3870. There may have been brought into all the Weſt-India-Iſlands, and into the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, from firſt to laſt, SEVEN MILLIONS. One million more muſt be allowed for mortality on the paſſage. How many have been deſtroyed in the collection of them in Africa, we cannot juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. It is judged that Great-Britain ſuſtain the loſs of twice as many ſeamen in this, as in all their other extenſive trade.</p>
            <p>We ſuppoſe, then, that eight millions of ſlaves have been ſhipped in Africa for the Weſt-India iſlands and the United States; ten millions for South-America; and, perhaps, two millions have been taken and held in ſlavery in Africa. Great-Britain and the United States have ſhipped about five millions, France two, Holland and other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one; though we undertake not to ſtate the proportion with exactneſs. The other twelve mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions we ſet to Portugal.

            <p>By whom hath this commerce been opened, and ſo long and ardently purſued?

Unprovoked, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pretended injury, <hi>theſe</hi> have kindled and kept alive the flame of war through three quarters of the continent of Africa; that is, all the interior as well as maritime parts ſouth of Senegal and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſinia. <hi>Theſe</hi> have taught the Africans to ſteal, ſell and murder one another.

the different tribes make priſoners of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the chiefs ſeize their own people, and drive them, as herds of cattle, to market. The natives are trepanned by one another, and by the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; forced from their flocks, and fields, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt connexions. This vile commerce hath depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated the ſea-coaſt: It muſt now be carried on in the inland parts.</p>
            <p>As though it were not ſufficient to force the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans from their country, and every thing dear to them, they are made to travel in irons hundreds of miles through their native ſoil, through ſands and moraſſes, down to the ſea ſhore; and there ſtowed, as lumber, for tranſportation. The cruelty of the captains of the Guinea ſhips, in many inſtances, is not inferior to that of <hi>Clive</hi> or <hi>Haſtings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſervitude of the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of the ſlaves after their arrival, the ſcantineſs of their proviſion and its bad quality, their tyrannical and mercileſs diſcipline, are well known, and too painful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect. It is a law in Barbadoes, "that if any ſlave, under puniſhment by his maſter or his order, ſuffer in <hi>life</hi> or <hi>limb,</hi> no perſon ſhall be liable to any fine for the ſame. But if any man ſhall wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly or cruelly kill his own ſlave, he ſhall pay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the treaſury £. 15."</p>
            <p>With what reaſon or truth is it urged, that the condition of the Africans is <hi>meliorated</hi> by their ſlavery? They, not their maſters, are the proper judges in this matter. Wretched as you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their condition was in Africa, the nefarious commerce of foreigners may have been the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cauſe of that wretchedneſs. Should foreigners deſiſt from this commerce, and the holders of ſlaves propoſe to tranſport them back to Africa, how would their <hi>mouth be filled with laughter, and their tongue with ſinging?</hi> Inſtead of thinking their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

meliorated by ſlavery, they moſt ſincerely join in that execration on their oppreſſors: <hi>Happy ſhall he be that taketh and daſheth thy little ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtones.</hi> The imaginary expectation that death may tranſport them to their own country is their chief conſolation. Under unlimited power, accuſtomed to the moſt inhuman uſage, no example of mercy relenting for them being exhibited, no marvel that the language of inſurgents is, <hi>Death or conqueſt.</hi> Their cries will ſooner or later reach the ears of him to whom vengeance belongeth.</p>
            <p>Will any one ſay, that their condition is melior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by their being taught the knowledge of GOD and CHRIST? How many of their maſters are in a ſtate of brutal ignorance in this reſpect? A pariſh miniſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Ramſay.</note> in the Weſt-Indies ſaith, that he "drew up plain and eaſy inſtructions for the ſlaves, invited them to attend at particular hours on Lord's-day, appointed hours at home, and exhorted their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to encourage their attendance. But inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was the liſtleſſneſs with which he was heard, and bitter the cenſure heaped on him in return. It was ſuggeſted, that he aimed to render them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being good ſlaves by making them Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians—Some who approved of the plan, did not think themſelves obliged to co-operate: I ſtood," ſays he, "a rebel convict againſt the intereſt and majeſty of planterſhip."</p>
            <p>When Archbiſhop <hi>Secker</hi> aſked what ſucceſs the miſſionaries "had in baptizing and converting ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro ſlaves? how the catechiſt at Coddrington col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in Barbadoes proceeded with thoſe ſlaves that belonged to the college eſtate," and whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed had been inſtructed in Chriſtianity? He was anſwered, "I found <hi>one</hi> old negro, who told me he could ſay all his catechiſm. I aſked him, if he did not find himſelf much happier and better ſince he

became a Chriſtian, than he was before? Why, Sir, ſaid he, I am old man, and as a driver am not put to common labour; but Chriſtian not made for negro in this country. How ſo? What is your duty towards God? He repeated it. What is your duty towards your neighbor?—Ah, maſter, I don't ſay that no more. Why ſo? Becauſe, maſter, I can't ſay it from my heart, if I think of white man."</p>
            <p>Had African ſlaves the means of Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, had they been treated with humanity, ſtill the making ſlaves of them hath been no more than <hi>doing evil that good may come.</hi> Chriſtianity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity would rather have dictated the ſending books and teachers into Africa, and endeavors for their civilization. Have they been treated as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame family with ourſelves? as having the ſame Father, whoſe <hi>tender mercies are over all his works?</hi> as having the ſame natural prerogatives with other nations?

                  <p>The committee of the ſociety in London, inſtituted in 1787, for the purpoſe of effecting the abolition of the ſlave trade, reported to the ſociety, January 15, 1788, "that ſundry ſpecimens evince that a trade of great national importance might be opened by once eſtabliſhing the confidence of the natives." The ſentiments and reaſoning of a great commercial writer on this ſubject are juſt and forcible.</p>
                  <p>"If once a turn for induſtry and the arts was introduced, [into Africa] a greater quantity of the European produce and manufactures might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thither, than to any other country in the whole world. No country is richer in gold and ſilver. Here is a prodigious number of elephants, which would not only facilitate the inland intercourſes of commerce, but alſo, in the teeth of theſe notable animals, afford a very beneficial branch of commerce. The fruitful rich lands, every where to be found upon the coaſts and within the country, upon the banks of the rivers near the gold-coaſt and the ſlave-coaſt, would produce all the richeſt articles of the Eaſt and Weſt-India commerce. It is melancholy to obſerve, that a country which has 10,000 miles ſea-coaſt, and noble, large, deep rivers, ſhould yet have no navigation; ſtreams penetrating into the very centre of the country, but of no benefit to it; innumerable people, without knowledge of each other, correſpondence, or commerce—Africa, ſtored with an inexhauſtible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and capable, under proper improvements, of producing ſo many things delightful as well as convenient, ſeems utterly neglected by thoſe who are civilized themſelves, and its own inhabitants quite unſolicitous of reaping the benefits which nature has provided for them. What it affords in its preſent rude, unimproved ſtate, is ſolely given up to the gain of others, as if not the people only were to be ſold for ſlaves to their fellow-creatures, but the whole country was captive, and produced its treaſures merely for the uſe and benefit of the reſt of the world, and not at all for their own. Inſtead of making ſlaves of theſe people, would it not rather become nations, who aſſume the name and character of Chriſtians, to give them a reliſh for the bleſſings of life, by extending traffic into their country in the largeſt extent it will admit of, and introducing among them the more civilized arts and cuſtoms? While the ſlaving trade continues to be the great object of" other nations, and theſe "promote the ſpirit of butchery and making ſlaves of each other among the negro princes and chiefs, their civilization, and the extenſion of trade into the bowels of the country, will be obſtructed."</p>

The Greeks and Romans, amidſt their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in philoſophy, arts and ſciences, eſtabliſhed ſlavery as far as they extended their conqueſts. Their rage for conqueſt had the world for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They made war without having received any injury. Captives taken in war were expoſed to ſale. And indeed all the ancient nations conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conqueſt as a juſt foundation for ſlavery. Some moderns have undertaken to defend the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. In an age and country ſo well acquainted with the rights of men, this kind of reaſoning me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits very little attention. It is, moreover, wholly inapplicable to the caſe of African ſlavery. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever juſt dominion conquerors may claim over the conquered muſt be founded in this, that the latter were the aggreſſors. Did the Africans firſt invade the rights of the nations who have carried on the ſlave trade? or give them a foundation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint? Were they ever conquered by their foreign invaders?</p>
            <p>But the reaſoning is not leſs unjuſt than inappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. The objects of a juſt war are the ſecurity of national rights, and indemnification for injuries. Superior force may enſlave, but gives no right. It is inglorious, ſavage and brutal to inſult a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemy, and reduce him to the loweſt ſervility.</p>
            <p>"But did not the Jews make ſlaves of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites by the expreſs command of God?" They did indeed. Thoſe nations had <hi>filled up their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of iniquity.</hi> The Supreme Sovereign devoted

them to deſtruction, and commiſſioned Iſrael to be the executioners of his juſtice. "Thou mayeſt not," ſaid God, "conſume them at once, leſt the land become deſolate, and the beaſts of the field increaſe againſt thee. By little and little will I drive them out from before thee." Of thoſe nations, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the land, they might purchaſe bond-ſervants, and tranſmit them as an inheritance to poſterity. The Gibeonites, one of theſe devoted nations, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a league of peace with Joſhua, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they were a very remote people. When their ſtratagem was detected, he ſaved them alive, becauſe of his league; but he made them all bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, hewers of wood, and drawers of water. (Lev. 25. 44, 45, 46. Joſhua chap. 9th) When a like warrant can be produced, it will authorize a like practice.</p>
            <p>"But Iſhmael was the ſon of a bond-woman. His poſterity therefore can have no claim to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom." This is not a juſt conſequence; nor is this objection ſupported by hiſtory. The prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Iſhmael was, "He will be a wild man; his hand will be againſt every man, and every man's hand againſt him." His poſterity, the Arabians, have lived in war with the world. The Egyptians, Aſſyrians, Perſians, Greeks, Romans, Tartars and Turks have in vain attempted to ſubjugate them. They have been and are free and independent.</p>
            <p>That the heathen have no right to any poſſeſſion on earth, is an article of the Roman faith. The charters of Britain to her late colonies held out the ſame language. But is this the language of HIM, whoſe is "the world, and they that dwell therein?" who "hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth; and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the bounds of their habitation?" In enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>pagans</hi> of Africa, have the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope

and America proceeded on this principle, that the Author of their religion, whoſe <hi>kingdom is not of this world,</hi> hath commiſſioned them to ſeize on the poſſeſſions, and, what is more, on the perſons, of thoſe heathen? Among the enumerated articles of commerce in myſtical Babylon in the day of her fall, <hi>ſlaves and ſouls of men</hi> cloſeth the account—intimating that this kind of commerce was the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation</hi> of her wickedneſs.

If we admit the Moſaic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we cannot ſuppoſe that the Africans are of a different ſpecies from us: If we reject it, we have no account whence they or we ſprang. Let us then receive the Moſaic hiſtory of the creation, till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and better appears. According to that, the Africans are our brethren. And, according to the principles of our religion, they are <hi>children of the free-woman as well as we.</hi> This inſtructs us, that <hi>God is no reſpecter of perſons, or of nations</hi>—<hi>hath put no difference between Jew and Greek, barbarian and Scythian.</hi> In Chriſt Jeſus, in whom it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told "all nations ſhall be bleſſed," thoſe "who ſometimes were far off, are brought nigh, and have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father." So that they "are no more ſtrangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſhold of God." The heathen will all be given him for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould we treat our African brethren as the elder ſon in the parable treated the younger, offended at the compaſſion of their common parent towards him? Why place them in a ſituation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of recovery from their loſt ſtate? their ſtate of moral death? Did Jeſus come to redeem us from the worſt bondage? Shall his diſciples then enſlave thoſe whom he came to redeem from ſlavery? who are the purchaſe of his blood? Is this <hi>doing to others,</hi> as he hath commanded, <hi>whatſoever we would that</hi> they <hi>ſhould do to</hi> us? Is it to <hi>love our neighbour as ourſelves?</hi>

On a view of the wretched ſervitude of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, ſome may ſuſpect, that they muſt have been <hi>ſinners above all men, becauſe they ſuffer ſuch things.</hi> This way of reaſoning, however common, our Lord has reproved—particularly in the inſtance of the blind man; of thoſe who were ſlain by the fall of the tower in Siloam; and of thoſe whoſe blood Pilate mingled with the public ſacrifices. All mankind are <hi>the offspring of God.</hi> His govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them is <hi>parental.</hi> Children may have the fulleſt proof that the government of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not capricious and tyrannic, but moſt wiſe and kind: At the ſame time, they cannot explain many parts of it; but unreſervedly ſubmit to his pleaſure, having the fulleſt confidence in his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior wiſdom, his paternal care and affection.</p>
            <p>That ſuch as have been educated in ſlaviſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, juſtify and practiſe ſlavery, may not ſeem ſtrange. Thoſe who profeſs to underſtand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the principles of liberty ſhould cheerfully u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite to aboliſh ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Our middle and northern ſtates have prohibited any further importation of ſlaves. South-Carolina paſſed a prohibitory act for a limited time. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the federal conſtitution the traffic may be ſtopped in ſeventeen years; and a duty often dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars may be laid on every ſlave now imported. By an act of the legiſlature of Connecticut, all blacks and mulattoes born within the ſtate from March 1784, will be manumitted at the age of 25 years. The act of Pennſylvania liberates them at the age of twenty eight years. Such proviſion hath been made for the gradual abolition of ſlavery in the United States. Could wiſdom and philanthropy have advanced further for the time?</p>
            <p>In the northern diviſion of the United States, the ſlaves live better than one quarter of the white
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023308_0030_0FBEF0423A41E8F0"/>
people. Their maſters are poſſeſſed of property; nor is harder labor required of the ſlaves, than a great part of the maſters perform themſelves. Might the eſtate of the maſters be exempt from the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their ſlaves, but very few would heſitate to manumit them.</p>
            <p>In co-operating with the wiſe meaſures and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent intentions of the legiſlature of Connecticut, we ſhall do as much as can be deſired to caſe the condition of ſlavery, and extinguiſh the odious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. Humane maſters, requiring no more than is juſt and equal, and affording to their ſervants the means of moral and religious inſtruction, take the only ſure courſe to make them faithful. Many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch kind treatment, and have ſuch affection to their maſters, that they wiſh to abide with them. Nor is it to be doubted but many others, who may wiſh to be manumitted, would ſoon repent their choice. Still the term <hi>ſlave</hi> is odious, be the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's yoke ever ſo light. And it is very queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able whether any ſervant can be <hi>profitable</hi> who is not a <hi>voluntary</hi> one.</p>
            <p>The revolution in the United States hath given free courſe to the principles of liberty. One anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kingdom, illuminated by theſe principles, and actuated by the ſpirit of liberty, hath eſtabliſhed a free conſtitution. The ſpirit will ſpread, and ſhake the throne of deſpotic princes. Neither an habit of ſubmiſſion to arbitrary rule in church and ſtate, nor the menaced interference of neighboring king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, could prevent, or counterwork, a revolution, propitious in its aſpect on the rights of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of mankind. No combination of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean potentates can impede the progreſs of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The time is haſtening, when their ſubjects will not endure to be told, that no government ſhall exiſt in any nation but ſuch as provides for the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023308_0031_0FBEF04556354998"/>
perpetuation of <hi>abſolute</hi> monarchy, and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it to the families in <hi>preſent</hi> poſſeſſion. The time is haſtening, when no monarch in Europe ſhall tell his ſubjects, <hi>Your ſilver and your gold are mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent occaſion will be well improved, if we ſet ourſelves to baniſh <hi>all</hi> ſlaviſh principles, and aſſert our liberty as men, citizens and Chriſtians. We have all one Father: He will have all his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring to be ſaved. We are diſciples of one maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: He will finally <hi>gather together in one the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> Let us unite in carrying into effect the purpoſe of the Saviour's appearance. This was to give <hi>peace and good will to man,</hi> and thus bring <hi>glory to God on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being "one body in Chriſt, and every one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another;" we ſhould take care "that there be no ſchiſm in the body." They who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves, or ſeparate others, without cauſe, are ſchiſmatics. Chriſt is not divided. A <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> party is of all others the moſt odious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The terms expreſs a palpable contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The dire effe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Whether ignorance or learning, weakneſs or craft, have bound the heavieſt burthens in religion, we need not enquire. Each of them hath done much in this way in ages paſt. Happily for the preſent age of light and liberty, the ſpirit of bigotry and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cannot encumber and debaſe Chriſtianity as heretofore. The exerciſe of private judgment, an appeal to the ſcriptures, and the cultivation of Chriſtian charity and philanthropy, will diſplay the excellency of our religion.</p>

To conclude: In vain do we aſſert our natural and civil liberty, or contend for the ſame liberty in behalf of any of our fellow-creatures, provided we ourſelves are not made free from the condemnation and dominion of ſin. If there is ſuch a thing as ſlavery, the ſervant of ſin is a ſlave—and <hi>ſelf-made.</hi> The captive, priſoner and ſlave, in an outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, may be free in Chriſt, free indeed; while he who enjoys full external liberty, may, in regard to his inward man, be under the power of wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Theſe enter and dwell in an heart garniſhed to receive them. Jeſus Chriſt, and no other, ſaveth from ſin and wrath. The ſpirit of life quickeneth thoſe who are dead in treſpaſſes, and looſeth thoſe whom Satan hath bound. "If we be dead with him, we believe that we ſhall alſo live with him."</p>
            <p>The new Jeruſalem is free in a more exalted ſenſe than the church on earth. True believers, "ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe, have the <hi>earneſt</hi> of their inheritance, until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion." In that day of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete redemption, of glorious liberty, may God of his infinite mercy grant that we may meet all the ranſomed of the Lord, with ſongs and everlaſting joy, ſaying: "Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne; and unto the lamb who was ſlain, and hath redeemed us to God by his blood, out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. AMEN."</p>
