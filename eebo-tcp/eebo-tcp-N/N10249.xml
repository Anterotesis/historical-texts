            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the poſſeſſion and preſervation of every bleſſing that is dear to you call for it: May I be permitted to obſerve that the happineſs of life, eſpecially to men free born, conſiſteth in the full enjoyment of their <hi>natural,</hi> civil and religious RIGHTS. Theſe are the nerves of health, the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of ſtrength, and pillars of peace: Upon this foundation ALONE, the happineſs and proſperity of the people ſtands. So dear is this bleſſing, that all life, power and ſacred argument, unite in ONE to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. <hi>Skin for ſkin, and all that a man hath will he give for his Life;</hi> for the very LIFE of LIFE is LIBERTY. What is life, without theſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013014_0004_0F8FB02A002012F0"/>
but a living death?—Nature breathes freedom through all the beauties of creation, from the meaneſt inſect that moves, to the fowl of the air, and the fiſh of the ſea. Freedom is that very breath of life that GOD <hi>breathed into man when he became a living ſoul:</hi> Therefore every man has the ſame natural and inherent right to every bleſſing of <hi>freedom</hi> and LIBERTY, as he has to his own, exiſtence, and whoever deprives him of the enjoyment of his NATURAL RIGHT, is, in ſcriptural language, a <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Joh. iii. 15.</note> For the inviolable preſervation of the RIGHTS of the people, is ſo happy in the <hi>Engliſh conſtitution,</hi> that no law can be made, but by the united power of the King, Lords, and Commons. The whole <hi>legiſlative</hi> authority is only a power of guardian-ſhip or high <hi>truſt</hi> committed to them by the PEOPLE for the ſecure preſervation and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their RIGHTS. And this deligated power is ſubject to be revoked whenever the truſt repoſed in them is <hi>violated,</hi> as they are no more than the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's <hi>Servants,</hi> in the high truſt of power, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the rights of their <hi>Charter;</hi> and whenever this end is not anſwered by them, the people have a right to turn them out of their <hi>ſtewardſhip,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it to thoſe whom they ſhall think fit guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of their RIGHTS; for the law of nature is <hi>ſelf preſervation,</hi> which will never be relinguiſh'd by a people of any ſoul or ſpirit.</p>
            <p>As the whole authority and power of the King, Lords, and Commons, as a legiſlative body, is <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> and <hi>authoritatively,</hi> the power and rights of the people, ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſting in them only by the people's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013014_0005_0F8FB02AB53E66D0"/>
and power, which right, and power will always remain in the people if government was diſſolved; and this makes it lawful in them to reſiſt whatever oppoſes their inherent RIGHTS, authority, and power.</p>
            <p>THE power of the King is ſo ſettled by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, that he is then, and only then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, great, and happy while he maintains the laws and rights of the ſubjects. The King can neither make, or ſuffer to be made, by any authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any breach upon the rights of the people, but at the ſame time HE makes the ſame breach upon his own rights, and thereby deſtroys the dignity and ſecurity of his CROWN: So that it remains a ſettled point, that the happineſs of the King, and the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the people intirely depends upon this, namely, the King's preſerving inviolable firm (according to his coronation oath) the laws, rights and previledges of the ſubjects; for if the King breaks this binding engagement, he thereby looſes his original right to REIGN; nay, every plea of right, and power of authority, by which he holds his CROWN, or aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Britiſh THRONE. For the right of the King to reign upon the throne of Great-Britain, lies in his being (by the happy revolution principles) ſettled by the choice of the people as their elect King, or guardian of their rights.</p>
            <p>BUT when theſe walls (which are the walls of ſalvation to the people) are broken down, either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Kingly, or Parliamentary power, then the King right to reign, and the obligations of the people to the King, or miniſtry, may juſtly ceaſe. For when the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013014_0006_0F8FB02B8715EB48"/>
rights of the people are violated, their affections not only become alienated, but their oath of allegiance to the K—himſelf becomes void.</p>
            <p>THEN you will ſay, why are all theſe complaints of a free election being controul'd?—A repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive denied?—Murderers protected?—Juries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held?—Magna Charta deſtroyed?—Remonſtrances unheard?—The laws and rights of the people vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated? For, if the ſupreme power of authority lies in the rights of the people, and theſe rights are held by the threefold cord of the King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who then can break them?</p>
            <p>THIS queſtion brings the matter to a point; and will ſhew the original cauſe of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, both of the Britons, and Americans. And the anſwer is, there is an overuling arbitrary power,<note n="*" place="bottom">Some term it an <hi>enormous upſtart</hi> power, or miniſterial reign, over the RIGHTS of the people.</note> which abſolutely controuls the King, Lords, and Commons:—This is the uſurped power that is the ſpring, and cauſe of all the diſtreſſeſs and complaints of the people in England, or in America; it is a kind of a fourth power, that the conſtitution knows nothing of, or has not provided againſt. It is true, the people have ſuffered, or admitted the King, to chooſe his privy counſel, miniſters and favourites, but they never intended they ſhould rule over them, in any reſpect, much leſs in the violation of their rights. This miniſterial <hi>throne,</hi> or arbitrary power, is what the people wiſh to ſee deſtroyed; becauſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their uſurped authority infinitely too far, either for the ſafety of the King, or the good of the people:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013014_0007_0F8FB02CA1B5DE18"/>
So that it is plain to the people, that nothing but a change of men, and meaſures, will ſave the nation from ruin: For the Britiſh Crown always totters when the rights of the people ſhake.</p>
            <p>THIS miniſterial power, are a union of gentlemen, both of Lords and Commons, who, it is to be feared, that few of them fear GOD, or regard Man. Theſe are (unhappy for the people) favoured to be around the King, as his council, favourites and flatterers; and they not acting as the guardians of the Britiſh Crown, and the <hi>rights of the people,</hi> but acting in the affairs of the nation by their diſpotic will, making it the rule of authority and power: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are juſtly alarmed at their actions, ſince they muſt intend thereby ſuch a change in government, that muſt effectually deſtroy their rights, if not produce an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire revolution of the whole State. For their power and intereſt is ſo great, that they can, and do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure whatever laws they pleaſe; having, (by power, intereſt, and the application of the people's money, to <hi>placemen,</hi> and <hi>penſioners,</hi>) the whole legiſlative authority at their command. So that it is plain, (not to ſay a word of a particular reigning arbitrary <hi>Stuarthal</hi> power among them) that the rights of the people are ruined, and deſtroyed by miniſterial <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> authority; and thereby, in a great meaſure, the people have loſt the grand intent of their royal char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are become a kind of ſlaves to the miniſters of State, the people having forgot the feeling ſenſation of their original right that it is ſtill remaining in them; yet, no doubt but their ſoul and ſentiment, their life and ſpirit, as Britons, will again rouſe, and recover the poſſeſſion of them; ſince now to remonſtrate to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013014_0008_0F8FB02D039582D0"/>
King (though they are oppreſſed) is deemed rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion!—To reaſon, is to revolt!—To complain, is to be factious!—To ſuffer patiently the loſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, is accounted loyalty!—Nay, thoſe who ſubmit and luffer the deſtruction of almoſt every right that is ſacred, ſolemn and binding upon the King; or ſecuring to their liberties, as a people. Theſe are called, (but falſly ſo called) <hi>friends to Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT will the ſpirits of Britons bear this? No! not long. Oh England, how near is thy ruin? whoſe prerogative it was to give laws to Kings, and power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Nations.</p>
            <p>WAS this all, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I would, with ſympathy of ſoul, be ſolemnly ſilent in tears, for the breaches, inrodes, and growing ruins of England: But as it is too notorious before GOD, and Man, that this is nearly thy caſe, Oh America, that the Britiſh miniſterial power, by an unjuſt ſovereignty, they claim over you, have already deſtroyed your rights!—Thrown down your liberties!—Deſpiſed your charter!—Depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you of your ſpirit of trade, nay, of your lives!!! But what is worſe, they are now aiming at the final overthrow of all your RIGHTS as a people; did I ſay <hi>aiming?</hi> Have they <hi>not already</hi> deſtroyed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rights of your <hi>forefathers,</hi> which was the life and glory of America? Namely, the power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own laws, and right of diſpoſing your own money? This natural right, the Britiſh miniſtry have violently attacked, and done their utmoſt to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>HAVE they not already engaged your GOVERNOR, and now aim to render you JUDGES independent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

you? And if the miniſtry ſhall think it neceſſary for their baſe purpoſe, may we not expect the COUNCIL, and all executive courts will be made independent alſo? Allow them this, and the golden key of the rights of America, is then in the hands of the real enemies of every bleſſing, and liberty that you poſſeſs, as a body politic. Your laws, (not to ſay your lives) are then no more your own, as Juries naturally follow Judges. Allow them an influence here, and you are not only born to bring your grey hairs, with ſorrow, to the grave,—but your children, (if you tamely ſubmit) inſtead of calling you bleſſed, will be ready to ſay with the prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 
               <q>Curſed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bear me be bleſſed: Curſed be the man that brought tidings to my father, ſaying, that a man child is born making him very glad; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came I forth out of the womb to ſee labour, and ſorrow; that my days ſhould be conſumed with ſhame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE, with all the tremendiouſneſs of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with all the ſolemnities of fear, with all the pathos of affection let me intreat you as men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and ready underſtanding, to ſee that your rights, your lives, your lands, are all in danger; your rights, as you are taxed without your conſent; your lives, as witneſs the bloody maſſacre in your ſtreets; witneſs the <hi>exile,</hi>

Aſk them in the name of the Moſt High, what right, either by the law of GOD, of nature, or of nations, they have to rule over you? Speak to them as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as peers, and as men of equal authority with themſelves: And aſk,</p>
            <p>WHAT right have they to tax you without your leave?—Or what right have they to deſtroy your freedom as a people? Know this, the King of England has no right to do it, it is beyond his authority, as King; nay, his attempt to do it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys at once his right to reign over you.—The houſe of Commons have no right to do it; they are not your repreſentatives, nor members of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity: And where they have no right (nor can they have any) of repreſentation, they can have none of taxation.—The houſe of Lords cannot do it; for they are Peers of England, and not of America. This, Lord CHATHAM, and Lord CAMDEN, have boldly, as true friends to the freedom of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, declared, "that the Britiſh Parliament has no
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013014_0011_0F8FB03163E97F28"/>
right to tax America; and that the miniſtry are rebels to GOD, and the laws and rights of nature, in their attempting to do it, and therefore ought to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch by every man of ſentiment, or ſpirit of liberty": For who would nor oppoſe, with his whole ſoul, ſuch conſummate tyranny, injuſtice, and robbery as this?—Tyranny to the laſt degree, to aſſume a power of diſtreſſing, taxing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Majeſty's American ſubjects: A pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which his Majeſty cannot give; nor can the Britiſh Parliament itſelf in juſtice aſſume it. And yet theſe men, contrary to law, and reaſon, will dare to do it in the face of their King, as to his ſafety, in the face of their country, as to their happineſs, and in the face of your rights, as Americans, at the expence of your liberties to enrich themſelves.</p>
            <p>AND will the Americans bear this? Have you not your own laws? Your own repreſentatives? Your own judges? And your own council? Why then ſhould they command you? Is it not enough for the Americans to feed and ſupport England with their trade? (And are willing ſo to do until the Engliſh ſtreets are paved with American gold) but muſt they give away their rights, their forefather's rights, and their children's rights to a ſet of Miniſterial Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?—Heaven forbid it.</p>
            <p>FOR be it known that the Americans, according to the ſpirit of their original compact with the King, are a perfect <hi>legiſlative</hi> within themſelves, and have no connection, as to government, but only with the King of England, as their King, to ſign and ratify
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013014_0012_0F8FB03175045788"/>
ſuch laws, and immunities as the Americans may conſent unto by their own repreſentatives. This is the pillar of thy ſtrength, the dignity of thy ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the walls of thy ſafety, On AMERICA! Looſe this power, and you are no longer <hi>free men,</hi> nor happy ſubjects, but <hi>American SLAVES.</hi> And why ſhould theſe people, who were never in bondage to any man, be in a ſtate of ſlavery to any power upon the earth? when you cannot but know, that your oath of allegiance, and obedience, to the King, is only due to him, and to be continued by you; as he acts upon his coronation oath to maintain, inviolable firm, your rights, laws and liberties, as the fulfilment of that ſovereign Kingly power, you have repoſed in him, as the royal truſtee of your rights; for if your rights are infringed, yet the power of rights, laws, and liberties, ſtill revolves in you as a people; then ſurely no man, but he who is contented, (like that animal called an ASS, to be born a fool, and die a ſlave) will be ſilent, if every thing valuable in life is taken from him by that PERSON, who ſtands engaged, in a ſacred oath, to defend him. What ſhould we ſay of a father who either oppreſſed his children, or his children's children, for his own emolument? What ſhould we call him? Or rather, what ſhould we not call him? For does not nature teach us that he ſhould rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his children, than ſtretch his authority?</p>
            <p>WILL not ſuch arbitary proceedings tend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to alienate the affections of his Majeſty's American ſons, and give them cauſe to look upon him as an enemy to their happineſs, and as one (by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013014_0013_0F8FB032834693C8"/>
whomſoever perſwaded) making war againſt the peace, proſperity, and comunity of the people? And therefore if the life of liberty, and the ſecurity of their rights call for it, no doubt (if the ſpirit of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers remain in them) but they will think that they have as juſt a right, before GOD and man, to oppoſe King, Miniſtry, Lords, and Commons of England, when they violate their rights, as Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, as they have to oppoſe any foreign enemy: and that this is no more, according to the law of nature, to be deemed rebellion, than it would be to oppoſe the King of France, ſuppoſing him now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent invading the land.</p>
            <p>YOUR right is founded in nature, and your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of liberty are ſealed by the blood of your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; and therefore, as they did, and proſpered, ſo do you.—Love your King, but revere your <hi>rights,</hi> and <hi>liberties,</hi> above your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign—It is ſaid the name of the King is <hi>ſacred:</hi> I hope it is meant a <hi>political</hi> ſacredneſs, not a <hi>divine;</hi> if ſo, who made his name ſacred? Why the people, in inveſting him with a truſt of power, above another man, to preſerve their laws, and rights inviolable: Therefore all ſacredneſs of the King ceaſes, together with obedience, and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when the truſt, which the people repoſed in him, is violated—But GOD forbid that I ſhould be thought to mention this, my dear Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, to alienate your affections from your King, or draw off the leaſt love, duty, or reverence to him; No! but only to ſhew how the dignity of the King, the ſecurity of his Crown, the ſacredneſs of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the authority of your laws, RIGHTS and LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES are all eſſentially from the power of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013014_0014_0F8FB032F3748FC8"/>
AND ſince you ſee that your own power is your ſecurity which you place in your Repreſentatives, as the guardians of your AUTHORITY and RIGHTS, in your <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> as the bulwarks of your ſtrength, and the walls of your defence from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.—That your rights, as a people; your bleſſings, as ſubjects; and your children's rights, as their inheritance, might be inviolable ſecured by the GARRISON of your own ſtrength, from all invading arbitrary power; and tranſmitted down, as the flower of life, and the beauty of bleſſings, to all riſing generations. Let me aſk,</p>
            <p>WILL the Americans loſe theſe RIGHTS? The rights their fore-fathers lived and died, fought and bled, to obtain for them? Will you not ſtruggle for them, with all the life, ſpirit and ſoul of Americans?—Or will you tamely ſubmit, by a ſpirit of cool indifferency, to looſe them ALL, and admit the key of all your previledges in the hands of an arbitrary enemy?</p>
            <p>IF the light of the morning is ſweet; if the bleſſings of the day is deſirable; if the happineſs of the object we love, is the ſoul of our thoughts, and the ardent wiſh of the mind:—But what is the light of the morning?—The bleſſings of the day? The ardent wiſh for happineſs, if we have not the liberty of enjoyment?—Let me therefore addreſs you with all feeling ſenſation, with all the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and affection of ONE, who eſteems your happineſs, as one of the higheſt bleſſings of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if there be any thing dear to you in life; dear to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013014_0015_0F8FB03427ABF5C8"/>
your children, or children children in the preſent ſtate; or in the view of ages yet unborn; may I now be ſo happy as to touch thoſe ſacred wheels, and make every heart burn, and every boſom glow, with fiery zeal, and ſpirit, for your LIBERTY? If the lives, if the death, if the blood of your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, who waded through ſeas of ſorrow, floods of tears, faced dangers, and fought and died for you with a becoming zeal, and fortitude, can inſpire you:</p>
            <p>NAY, if there be any of the noble ſpirit, life and ſentiment of your <hi>progenitors,</hi> remaining in you as the hereditary inheritance of your forefathers, ſhew yourſelves worthy of ſuch fathers, ſuch friends, ſuch patrons of LIBERTY: Nor ſuffer the fair TREE, with all her beautiful branches, bending with every bleſſing of peace and proſperity to you and your children, to be rooted up by a power which has no more right to alter your laws, deſtroy your liberties, or tax your properties, than they have to <hi>cut your throats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have I need now to ſay,</p>
            <p>ROUSE! STAND! <hi>And take the</hi> ALARM! You are now in eminent danger of loſing (after many other loſſes) the life, ſoul, and <hi>capitol</hi> of all your right and liberties: Namely, the power of not only <hi>making, placing,</hi> or <hi>paying,</hi> your own GOVERNOR, but now of paying your JUDGES, who are, or ſhould be, the <hi>guardians</hi> of your laws, and the <hi>pillars</hi> of your political life. The plan is laid, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fixed, to make them dependant for place and payment, upon the arbitrary will, and power of the Britiſh miniſtry; upon that power that has for years been ſeeking the deſtruction of your RIGHTS. If you
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013014_0016_0F8FB034875CDB70"/>
ſuffer this, then farewel the olive branch that has ſo ſweetly ſpread; and the peaceful Dove that has hovered ſo long over you; for then you and your children are <hi>Slaves</hi> at once. Then <hi>taxation</hi> on <hi>taxation</hi> will follow, until your lands become ſeizable by your TASKMASTERS, under pretence of LAW.</p>
            <p>BUT was this deſtructive arbitrary power exerted by the King, Lords, or Commons of England, as a <hi>legiſlative</hi> body, it might perſuade ſome FOOLS to die SLAVES. But when it plainly appears to be the baſe power of the miniſtry, dictated by L—D B—E, who, it is to be feared, loves not the King of Great-Britain; notwithſtanding he is ſo greatly in his favour. However this may be, we are ſure that he loves not the rights of the people; but that he has been aiming for years, both in the Houſe of LORDS and COMMONS, and more eſpecially in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial CABINET, to deſtroy the ancient rights of the Subjects. Has he not already ſo far turned the heart of the King againſt his own ſubjects, that he will not hear them, though they petition with thears at his feet? Has he not likewiſe turned the hearts of the beſt of ſubjects in too great a meaſure againſt their King?</p>
            <p>Is it any breach of charity to think that L—D B—E intends hereby the overthrow both of King and State; to bring on a revolution, and to place another whom he more rearly allied to upon the Throne, (for GOD knows his laſt errand abroad); but however this may be at preſent a ſecret, yet if he does not aim at the dethroning the King, yet ſuch proceedings will end in the deſtruction of the liberties of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013014_0017_0F8FB0353B3B0278"/>
people; and the one will certainly bring on the other. He thinks they have too much liberty, and therefore has long aimed to infringe their liberty, perſuading the King, that he has a divine right to be diſpotic; and that the people ought to ſubmit to his will and pleaſure as his ſubjects<note n="*" place="bottom">As ſpiritleſs SLAVES were uſed to do, in the reign of the family of the <hi>Steward'</hi>s.</note>.</p>
            <p>HENCE we ſee the ſame unfeeling ſpirit in the K—, againſt the cries and tears of his people, as there was in Rehoboam and in Charles the firſt, which brought upon him ſwift deſtruction, the fate he deſerved—the fate I wiſh ſays one, that every imitator of tyrannical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may feel. For, (ſays a late writer to the King) <q>the experiment has already been made by one tyrant, and the event proved fatal to his family; it is my ſincereſt wiſh, (ſays he) that every IMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATOR may ſhare his fate.</q> And ſure I am, it is loyalty to revere the laws and rights of the people, above the power of any Sovereign. How much more then is it the right, and previledge of a people, to deſpiſe the deſpotic power of any man, or men in union, who attempts by intereſt, power and bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to deſtroy the ancient rights of America, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King arbitrary, or the miniſtry deſpotic, and commanding their will, by a bloody military force? the truth thereof remains ſealed by a bloody MASSACRE in your own ſtreets.—Remember the voice is loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that which reached to heaven! For it is not bearly the voice of your brothers blood, which crieth to you from the ground, but it is the united voice of the blood of your brethren which ſpeaks. Reſiſt! Stand alarm'd! Your lives, and liberties,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013014_0018_0F8FB035F8CDA428"/>
are all at ſtake. And can an American not ſtand neuter, when every bleſſing that is dear and valuable calls him to exert his zeal? Though you cannot prevent the unconſtitutional deſign of the arbitrary power of the Britiſh miniſtry; yet you have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to reſiſt and prevent their reigning over you; or ruining you in the Violation of your laws and rights.</p>
            <p>WHAT, my dear Americans, will nothing but an immediate LAND-TAX alarm you? Will you wait until they do to you as they do in England, tax the light of heaven upon you<note n="*" place="bottom">Window lights to your houſes!</note>? The trees of the field? And every cup, and glaſs of mercy, that heaven beſtows upon you? Do you ſee no danger? Notwithſtanding your harbours are blockaded againſt you? Your caſtle ſecured from you?

            <p>FOR remember, my dear aſſociates in life, and friends of liberty, that as the natural body is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in health, and vigour, when every organ is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to act its part: So the body politic can only be in health, and proſper, when every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unites regularly, and ardently, to preſerve the previledges of the whole.—Surely then you cannot but have a high reliſh for your national felicity, and a due concern to maintain it againſt all encroachments.</p>
            <p>ONE would naturally think, that every inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of America, ſenſible of his own felicity, would, with a warm, and chearful heart, prevent every power that may oppoſe it. For if you can content yourſelves to think with any degree

Was not King Charles try'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem'd for breaking through the ſacred rights of the people, and ſome perſons are free enough to wiſh that every King and Governor that acts with the ſame principles, may ſhare the ſame fate; for is it not better that one Man ſhould die, than the whole nation ſhould periſh?—Therefore if there be any vein, any nerve, any ſoul, life or ſpirit of liberty in the ſons of America, ſhew your love for it—guard your freedom—prevent your chains—ſtand up for your rights: For as your late memorable orator de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clares "none but thoſe who ſet a juſt value upon the bleſſings of liberty, are worthy to enjoy HER".

            <p>IN ſhort it is more for America to loſe her liberties, than all the world beſides; inaſmuch as ſhe never was in bondage to any, and as her liberties were dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer bought, and harder obtained, than the liberties of any nation upon earth, and ought therefore in proportion, to be eſteemed the more precious.

            <p>PERMIT me, <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> to remind you of a free, a brave, a bold, affectionate and loyal people in America, who in one of their conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their rights and bleſſings of liberty, thus expreſs their loyalty and affection to your Majeſty: <q>Our worthy <hi>Annceſtors,</hi> in a rigorous reign, rather than contend to blood with their brethren, left their native country and every thing dear in life, croſs'd the wide Atlantic, and ſeated themſelves in this howling wilderneſs, that they might here quietly enjoy liberty, civil and religious, they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered almoſt every ſpecies of danger and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulties, and frequently watered the ground on
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013014_0036_0F8FB04601C191D8"/>
which we tread with their blood; they were faithful ſervants to the King of Kings, and ever loval ſubjects to their earthly ſovereign. They alſo had the promiſe of a King, for himſelf and Succeſſors, that they and theirs ſhould enjoy all the liberties and immunities of natural-born ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects within the Realm of England. Encouraged by ſuch a promiſe, which they looked upon as ſacred, they were ever ready, to the utmoſt of their ability, yea, and often beyond it, to aſſiſt the crown; never thinking their lives dear, when they could ſerve their King and country, even with the loſs of them. Such was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our pious fathers, who now ſleep in the duſt, who died with the pleaſing hope that we their children ſhould live free. (Let none then, as they will anſwer it another day, diſturb the aſhes of thoſe Heroes, by ſelling for a meſs of pottage, or for a leſs conſideration, their Birthright)</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>AND as our fathers could, ſo can we plead our loyalty; we ever have been, we now are ready, to ſpill our deareſt blood in defence of our King, religion, and conſtitutional laws; but we cannot but look upon it as a hard trial, yea greater than we can bear, if we cannot be ſaid to give full proof of our loyalty, otherwiſe than by ſacrificing thoſe rights and liberties, which we prize beyond life itſelf. Such a ſacrifice no Potentate on earth has a right to require, and ſuch a ſacrifice, voluntarily made, would be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferior to the ſin of ſelf-murder.</q>

THESE are, moſt gracious ſovereign, the people's, with their brethren, through every united town in the Province, who have been miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Majeſty as factious and rebellious, though they may juſtly vie with any Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for loyalty, love and affection to their King. The true ſtate of the caſe is, they are aggreived and diſtreſſed in the moſt render part, even to the apple of their eye; they are denied their natural rights as a people; their rights as Britiſh ſubjects; their charter rights which was their agreement and compact with the King of England.</p>
            <p>IN this caſe royal Sir, where can an affectionate, but <hi>afflicted</hi> people go, but to the boſom of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate <hi>Sovereign?</hi> where can children who are in danger of being diſinherited of their birth-right bleſſings flee to, but to the breaſt of their <hi>royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> their friend, their guardian, I had almoſt ſaid their <hi>brother,</hi> upon whole royal favor it <hi>much depends,</hi> whether your Majeſty's American ſubjects are to be <hi>freemen</hi> or <hi>ſlaves</hi>—whether their children, and their unborn poſterity, are to riſe the ſons of <hi>bondage,</hi> or ſons of that liberty, which the law of GOD and the law of nature has made them free.</p>
            <p>THEY only aſk their charter rights, and wiſh to enjoy the full poſſeſſion of them as engliſh ſubjects, and juſtly think that your Majeſty is bound by promiſe, by compact, and by oath to ſecure theſe rights, liberties and priviledges to them inviolably firm and free from the leaſt innovation; in the ſame manner that King David ſtood engaged by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

            <p>YOUR Excellency obſerves, <q>that you know of no <hi>line</hi> that can be drawn between the ſupreme authority of parliament, and the total indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the colonies.</q> Sir, you are quite right here, for it is impoſſible there ſhould be any <hi>line drawn</hi> between, for if the one is <hi>ſupreme,</hi> the other muſt be dependant. Your argument here, is clear, and convincing, and was this the point in diſpute the matter would ſoon be ſettled; but it is far from it. The point is, how came the parliament of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to have, or rather aſſume a ſupreme authority over the parliament of <hi>America?</hi> Has not the GOD
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013014_0044_0F8FB04E01906BD0"/>
of nature, the laws of ſelf-preſervation; nay the charter of England, given the ſame right, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power to the American parliament, and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſubjects; as to the Engliſh parliament and Engliſh ſubjects, to all intents and purpoſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? if ſo, then there is not, neither can there be, according to right and equity, any more ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or power (unleſs it be the unhappy military power) of one parliament more than another: Has the parliament of Great-Britain a right, by virtue of being the repreſentatives of the people, and from that right a power to make laws, and to call upon the King to ſign, confirm, and ratify thoſe laws? Has not the parliament of America, by virtue of being the repreſentatives of the people, the ſame right and power to make laws, and lay theſe laws before the King, for him to ſign and confirm—or to diſapprove the ſame, as the Britiſh parliament has? if ſo then your Excellency may be convinced, their is no ſupreme authority in the Britiſh parliament over the American parliament, and that one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament has from the law of GOD and nature, and from the charter itſelf (unleſs it can be proved, that the privileges of <hi>magna charta</hi> are a mere deceit,) as good a right, and as great authority as the other—if they have, why does the Britiſh parliament deny it them? If they have not, why is it not proved? Indeed it is impoſſible for that which deſtroys the right, power and authority of the American par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, could at the ſame time deſtroy the right and power of the Britiſh parliament, as they are both eſtabliſhed upon the ſame foundation, and therefore it is abſur'd, in the eyes of all ſenſible
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013014_0045_0F8FB04EBB7B5B20"/>
men, for one Britiſh parliament to aſſume a ſupreme authority over another.</p>
            <p>IT was a good remark, worthy the conſideration of every man who loves his God, his King, or his country, that a late author makes. <q>The people of both countries are united in the King, who is the head of the empire, the only coment of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical bodies, to preſerve <hi>union</hi> between the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the empire, and between them and their political head.</q> So then it is plain, that head and member, king and people are but one body, and are to be conſidered as ſuch; if ſo, then one part of theſe members have as juſt a right, power and authority as the other, for all unites in <hi>one.</hi> And this the Britiſh parliament were ſenſible of, even in the charter granted to this Province, they therefore deſired their american brethren ſo many years back, not to make any law repugnant to the laws of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Why was this included, if they had not a power to make their <hi>own</hi> laws? and if they had not a power to make their own laws, as much as the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh parliament, wherein do they enjoy the freedom of Engliſhmen—or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why does the compact or the charter expreſs it, if they are not to enjoy it? but if they have a right, the ſame as Engliſhmen have, then the King of England is under the ſame obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the parliament of America, or of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as he is to the Britiſh parliament, and as one well obſerves, <q>when the King wants the aſſiſtance of his american ſubjects, he muſt apply to their houſe of commons for grants,—in the ſame way he does now to his parliament in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013014_0046_0F8FB04F7346B580"/>
the colonies finding themſelves treated as freemen by their King, and fellow ſubjects in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and their rights eſtabliſhed upon a firm foundation; they will be animated to contribute the utmoſt in their power to promote the honor of the crown, and the ſupport of the kingdom. And as the colonies increaſe in wealth and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo will their aſſiſtance to their parent ſtate increaſe, until Britain flows with the riches of America—and by this union and harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two countries, founded on freedom and common intereſt, the Britiſh empire may continue firmly united, and flouriſh to the lateſt ages.</q>—I only add,—this is the only way to turn the wilderneſs ſtate of England into the garden of Eden.</p>
            <p>YOUR Excellency's obſervation that for a ſucceſſion of years, the general aſſembly, and our predeceſſors ſubmitted to the authority of the Engliſh parliament; and engaged to make no <q>laws, or acknowledged they had no power, (as you expreſs it) to make any law repugnant to the laws of England.</q> Was not this, SIR, a mutual compact between England and America, (though then in an infant ſtate) to ſettle and fix the bounds of each power and authority? Though America was by this charter, or agreement, to make no laws repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the laws of England.—Was not England bound (and did not our predeceſſors underſtand it ſo) by the ſame honour, to make no laws repugnant to the laws, and rights of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013014_0047_0F8FB05054A5CC10"/>
America? Strange to me if they did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> And if they did, their ſubmiſſion to it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and dutiful, while they looked upon the two powers as mutual in each others political intereſt, uniting in one ſole authority.</p>
            <p>WHAT do the Americans, even the moſt fervent ſons of liberty, aſk more than this? who are the aggreſſors? has the Americans made any law repugnant to the laws of England? if it has let England complain, and ſee if they will find the boſoms of the Americans calous—but if England has made laws repugnant to the laws and rights of Americans, and enforced them by military arms, and the power of death—ſhall not the Americans complain? have they not a right, by the laws of GOD and nature, and nations, to remonſtrate and ſet forth their grievances, and to uſe all the ſtrength and power; the God of Heaven has given them to remove the yoke which neither they nor their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were able to bear.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, Sir, With ſubmiſſive reverence I humbly think that the argument brought to prove, that becauſe our predeceſſors ſubmitted to acts, or the power of parliament for ſo long a time, that we ought to ſubmit likewiſe fails,—finally fails—for who has made the repugnant laws? Who is the cauſe of all this contention? Let England make no laws repugnant to the laws and rights of America, and all things will be mutually happy.</p>
            <p>YOUR Excellency's other arguments taken from Feudal right &amp;c. &amp;c. is very tedious and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013014_0048_0F8FB0530EA7F018"/>
prolix, and I humbly conceive far from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive: For the preſent diſpute is not, whether the King of England has a Feudal right to the lands of America—but whether the Americans have a right to make their own laws, diſpoſe of their own property, pay their own Governor and Judges, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their own immunities as granted by charter to them, "as free and natural ſubjects, to all intents, conſtructions, and purpoſes, without the controul of any ſupreme authority, of any government over them." If their right is good, they only aſk their own inheritance. But ſuppoſing it ſhould appear clear by thoſe who are more adept in law phraſes, that the King has a Feudal right to the lands of America; I think the argument taken therefrom would revert much in favour of the American ſubjects, but what right a few people who fled from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tyranny, who reſided in Holland, and came as ſtrangers to the wiles of America, to ſeek <hi>peace and liberty,</hi> amidſt the tribes of cruel ſavages, can give any parliament on earth authority or power to rule over them, I cannot ſee; they appear to me from the foundation of ſettling America, to have a double right to be <hi>perfectly free,</hi> not only a right by the law of GOD, but a far greater right, than Engliſhmen have to their liberties, inaſmuch as the Americans obtained them at a dearer rate; they fought, they bled, they died purely for <hi>Liberty,</hi> and ſhall not their children be free?</p>
            <p>THE love of liberty runs parrallel in the human breaſt with the love of life, and he that will dare to take away the one, is not fit to be truſted with the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013014_0049_0F8FB05585FF04D8"/>
other—your Excellency cannot but remember, and muſt allow the Americans fearleſs in every thought, that tremendous night, when the earth, air, and ſkies were ſtain'd with innocent blood.<note n="*" place="bottom">MARCH 5th. 1770.</note> A night that will finally be remembered, and annually bleed afreſh to the laſt generations, as a teſtimony againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>IT is no wonder then to ſee the Gentlemen of Boſton ſo zealous for liberty, who ſaw the guiltleſs victims of arbitrary authority expire before their eyes—no wonder their fire of liberty was kindled, to ſtand their ground, to maintain the ſpot their forefathers had bought, to command unarm'd their Governor to baniſh the bloody band of ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>NO wonder ſuch men as theſe unite as a <hi>band of brethren</hi> to ſtand up for, and take every prudent meaſure to maintain thoſe liberties free from all infringments, that they have a natural and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table right unto, and their happineſs is intereſted therein.</p>
            <p>GENERALLY the unhappineſs of Kings, Governors, and miniſters originally ariſes from a <hi>tyrannical thought,</hi> that the people are made for them, and not they for the people; let mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters conſider themſelves not the churches lords, but the churches ſervants, and only direct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the laws of GOD and they would be happy. Let but the King conſider himſelf, as the people's ſervant in high truſt, as their political head, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting their majeſtic power, they having inveſted him with the key of their authority to rule, but let him

            <p>AS your zeal, ſpirit, and love for the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable rights and liberties of your conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents, has pleaſingly exceeded their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and you have given full proof, that you carried their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and caſe upon your hearts to the Houſe, and have pleaded their cauſe, and laid their grievances before the King's repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, with reverence and ſubmiſſion, and yet at the ſame time with that SPIRIT, for the ſupport of the natural and charter rights and liberties of the people, that becomes the ſtewards of their rights, and the guardians of their liberties; this will enoble and immortalize your names in the <hi>annals</hi> yet unknown.</p>
            <p>BUT Gentlemen, there is a liberty of a more NOBLER NATURE, that you have forgot, which is <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience:</hi> What, and ſhall conſcience (under oppreſſion) bleed, faint, expire and die,

Where are the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of America? Why go they not forth in their lamentations? How are the mighty fallen! How is the gold become dim, and the moſt fine gold changed! Zion (ſays the prophet) ſpreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her; what, none among the ſons of liberty? Have they all forſook her and fled—and will ye alſo go away?</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, Have you not pleaded like men—like ſtewards, like gods,<note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. x. 34.</note> for the natural rights and liberties of the people, and maintained the majeſty of the people's power; ſhewing that no King, nor parliament, nor power upon earth, has any right to tax them, or appoint, or take away their property without their conſent. And yet will you dare to make, or enforce any law, to take away by force and power, the properties of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; not only contrary to their conſent, but contrary to their own conſciences, becauſe they will not worſhip the golden image, which you have ſet up? is not this rapine, robbery and tyranny, by the force of arbitrary power? Does not your con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſciences bluſh, when you plead for liberty, and bleed when you behold your brethren's property forced from them by violence, if not they muſt be as calouſe as <hi>Cain's was who ſlew his brother Abel:</hi> What do you think the King of England, the Houſe of Lord's, and the Britiſh Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons will ſay, when this matter comes to be laid before them?

who aſſume to tell us, that we have no right to tax them, or appoint any of their properties to any uſe without their conſent (which God Almighty knows we have not) yet they aſſume to tax their brethren, and take away by force and authority their perſons and properties, to ſupport a religion contrary to the people's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. The GOD of Heaven has made us rulers over the bodies and civil rights of men, but what god we wonder has made them rulers over the ſouls of men, that the people muſt attend upon, or ſupport by taxation, even that form of religion which they have choſe for them, and which they believe is not true; was ever ſuch tyranny ſince the days of NERO.</q>
            </p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, I hope none of you will be offended at this freedom of ſpeech, while the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation groans, being burdened with the weight of this oppreſſion. I do not mean to offend a worm, but feelingly to convince the good people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, that a true and real ſon of liberty is an <hi>heart of oak,</hi> firm and conſiſtent with himſelf, and has the ſame feeling regard to plead for, and preſerve free, <hi>inviolably free,</hi> the ſacred liberties of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of mankind, as well as to plead for and preſerve their civil liberties and properties. Here I am moved by that grandeur of ſoul, that only wiſhes to have the happineſs of millions in view, and thereby am conſcience bound—bound by the law of nature—by the law of GOD, and by all the bleſſings of liberty not to be ſilent, however little I may ſay. For what heart can bear, what ears

            <p>DOES not ſuch proceedings as theſe call for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, as much as Abel's blood, when it cried from the ground?</p>
            <p>GENTLMEN, I do not mean to make your conſciences bleed, but I mean to make them feel for your diſtreſſed brethren. The <hi>Apoſtle ſays, no man ever hated his own fleſh.</hi> But any one would think Paul did not mean the general court, when he takes a view of the diſtreſſes, and oppreſſions by law and tyranny, that your brethren have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at <hi>South-Hadley,</hi> at <hi>Montague,</hi> at <hi>Shurſbury,</hi> at <hi>Colrain,</hi> at <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> at <hi>Aſhfield,</hi>

            <p>IT is painful to me Gentlemen, but the warm affection that I have for liberty of conſcience, which is the ſole, the life and paradiſe of every bleſſing on earth, conſtrains me to tell you, that I have very lately received, ſigned, witneſſed and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated under the conſtable's own hands, the account of twenty five different perſons in <hi>Mendon</hi>—in <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>BUT however Gentlemen, theſe diſtreſſed perſons ſhall not (while I have a being or talent) never want a friend to plead their CAUSE, before GOD and Man, whether it be before the Governor, Council, or the general Court, or before the King and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at home, if the caſe require it; though many of the ſame denomination for whom I plead, have acted very <hi>ungrateful to me</hi>

            <p>IT was a noble anſwer, which the late Mr. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIS returned to the general Court a man of great underſtanding, and a friend to liberty of conſcience, who would not like ſome others be melted away with ſoft perſuaſion, and flee like a ſhadow, but told the general Court what favours the Baptiſts would have, that they had a right by the law of GOD, and by the law of nature, I add, and by the Charter, a juſt claim to be exempted from all oppreſſion or taxation to ſupport any man or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or form of religious worſhip, they did not believe A certain Gentleman then ſaid to him, "Sir, what, have we no power to tax them?" Mr. Davis anſwered him with that ſpirit the cauſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſaid, Sir, I deny your power, and ſo will every man of wiſdom, and common humanity;" however I boldly declare in the face of every frown, and care not if every tyrant on earth heard me; that you have no more right by the word of GOD, and by the law of nature to tax the Baptiſts, or any of the ſeperate congregations in the Province to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a religious worſhip, contrary to the dictates of their own conſcience, than you have to tax the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

that would make a moral heathen bluſh.</q> I reverence your right power and authority in civil government, and with every tie and duty of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will always honour it, nor have the Baptiſts ever deny'd paying their juſt rates; but your power to make laws to bind my conſcience, or take away my property by warrants, to ſupport your way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the unknown God, which you have ſet up, is unſupportable before GOD and man It is true, the votes of the town have in page 28 hinted, to the offence of many judicious minds, that the general Court have a power to make laws ſpiritual, as well as temporal, but this I humbly believe was a miſtake inadvertently overlooked by the Gentlemen; for if the general Court has a power to make <hi>laws ſpiritual</hi> and take away my property by force for the ſupport of theſe laws, then I declare freely, all that they have ſaid and pleaded for is finally at an end. For ſurely the Britiſh parliament and power have as good a right to act unjuſtly and arbitrary as any other, for if it be juſt in the general Court to take away my ſacred and ſpiritual rights and liberties of conſcience and my property with it, then it is ſurely right an I juſt in the Britiſh parliament ſo take away by power and force, my civil rights and property without my conſent; this reaſoning Gentlemen I think is plain: However, I am honeſt if I am miſtaken.</p>

I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay as Solomon did, "add thou not to his word leſt he reprove thee"—However, I am of Benjamin Hoadley's mind, (who was afterwards Biſhop of Wincheſter) when he was his Majeſty's chaplain, he told the King of England in his Sermon upon theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "My kingdom is not of this world", that it was not in the power right or authority of any, Pope, Prince or Potentate—of any King, lords or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, of any Biſhop, archbiſhops, Deacons, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends, of any vicar, clergy or curates of any ſynods, convocations or preſbyteries, to make any laws for the church of Chriſt, that the church of GOD, has no dependence upon the ſtate, nor any human pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or authority, but only on the power of GOD and his word, that it was a diſtinct kingdom from the world, and had nothing to do with any worldly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—though the King was called in a law ſenſe the head of the church of England, yet he had nothing to do, either by law or power with the church of Chriſt—that Chriſt as the King of glory, was head over all things to his church; that his laws—his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects—his immunities—his ordinances were ſpiritual, ſuch as no King nor lords, nor biſhops could give, and therefore they had nothing to do by way of law power, or authority in the church of Chriſt. For this the Biſhop of London being preſent got Mr. Hoadly indited for treaſon againſt church and ſtate,

            <p>IT is generally urged that there was a neceſſity for your making, and inforcing a Law, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of every new Townſhip ſhall ſettle, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſupport, by a miniſterial rate, or Taxation, an <hi>orthodox miniſter.</hi> An orthodox miniſter that they hold their <hi>lands</hi> by it.—The etemology of the word <hi>orthodox,</hi> I do not juſt remember, as it is made now a days ſo <hi>vague;</hi> but, if I remember right, it is <hi>one ſound in the faith</hi>—one that continues in the apoſtle's doctrine, in praying, preaching, baptizing, and adminiſtring the ordinances of the Lord's-ſupper. And has the <hi>General Court</hi> made this law? Yes! Then I would ſay to you, Gentlemen, in the language of ſcripture, who of you have kept this law?—Not one of you! nor one of your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers before you, for this hundred and fifty years! Not one <hi>orthodox</hi> miniſter, (though many others, whom I much eſteem) have you ſettled throughout the whole continent of America; I defy all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to prove the time when—the place where—or the <hi>perſon</hi> who.</p>
            <p>YOU muſt know there is a vaſt difference between good men, and great men, ſo called, and Paul's otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox preachers, who continue <hi>ſtedfaſtly in the apoſtle's doctrine; I ſay in the apoſtle's doctrine, and in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. For can you perſwade me, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that to hear of a GOD as a being of wrath,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013014_0062_0F8FB0630C8A5B90"/>
anger, and vengeance, whom I can neither love, truſt, praiſe nor adore? Was Paul's GOD, or the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's GOD, in Paul's days—do you think that this was the GOD of love mentioned, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 16. They tell us indeed that GOD was love to Adam, before he fell, but when he fell he hated him and all mankind in him. But that Jeſus Chriſt interceeded for them, and turn'd the wrath of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty into love, upon conditions of their repenting and being good, that Jeſus Chriſt died to purchaſe theſe conditions; nay, the holy ſpirit, and Heaven for them, if they will, but by prayer, and tears, live up to the terms of the Goſpel, (as they call it.) Then they call you to make a covenant, to own a covenant of their own making, to feal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your covenant; and if they ſpeak of Chriſt, and him crucified—of grace and righteouſneſs, yet you muſt obtain it all by the works of the law, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what Paul ſays to the contrary. Some own a half way covenant,—ſome a whole covenant, and that baptiſm is the ſeal of the covenant. What is all this, Gentlemen, but <hi>Prieſt cheating</hi>—or a ſolemn lie before GOD and the people—religious deceit—a devout way to the devil? But they are pretty ſhrines, and the people muſt have them, they cannot live without them, they pay their tax for them. Nor would they be ever contented to pay their miniſterial rates, if they had not theſe pretty ſilver ſhrines for it, I will only mention one inſtance, which lately happened—Mr. B—of D—r had a few days ago three little <hi>golden</hi> calves to make to pleaſe the people, he made two, and the people danced about them; another perſon held up a little
