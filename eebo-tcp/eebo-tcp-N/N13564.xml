            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

NUMEROUS as the deſcriptions are of primeval man, the reflective eye is not yet weary. We ſtill feel an intereſt in that Arcadian ſtate which ſo well imitated the world we are looking for. And we ſhall continue to feel it ſo long as Nature is pleaſing and the heart retains a feature of innocence. Like the gods,
<note n="*" place="bottom">It was repreſented of Marcus Aurelius, that in imitating the gods his ſtudy was to have as few wants as poſſible. Vid. Spectator No. 634.</note> our firſt fathers had but few deſires and thoſe to be ſatisfied by the works of virtue. Their paſſions were as the gales of their own Eden—enough to give a ſpring to <hi>good</hi> actions—to keep the waters of life in motion without inducing ſtorm and whirlwind.
<note n="§" place="bottom">The paſſions of every kind, under proper reſtraints, are the gentle breezes which keep life from ſtagnation; but, let looſe, they are the ſtorms and whirlwinds which tear up all before them. Mrs. Brooke.</note> Converſing with divinities, Liberty, ſent from above, was their peculiar inmate: that Liberty, whoſe ſpirit, mingling with the nature of man at his formation, taught him, unlike the other animals, to look upward and hope for a throne above the ſtars:
<note n="†" place="bottom">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017132_0006_0FA031D315776C20"/>ſame privilege.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">No man's ſocial liberty is leſſened by another's enjoying the ſame. Bollan.</note> When families and conſequently human wants were afterward multiplied, it was this ſame Liberty who, joined with Juſtice, led the patriarchs to ſome aged oak. There in the copious ſhade miſunderſtandings were explained and charity and peace kiſſed each other. Such was the morning of man.</p>
            <p>BUT miſunderſtandings are quarrels in embrio. Satisfaction of one want originated another. Depravity grew enraptured with ſtrife. The wind was up. Paſſion raged. Brother's blood then ſmoak'd from the ground and cried for vengeance. Nimrod commenced his prelude to tyranny, and Fame was clamorous with the deeds of death. Liberty heared and trembled—conſidered herſelf an outcaſt and has on many times ſince travelled up and down the world, forlorn, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, majeſty in rags. Nor will She, perhaps, until the millenium comes, if America does not now retain her, ever command that complete and permanent homage which is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her nature. The old republics may have been the moſt perfect ſeats of her reſidence while they laſted, and are often muſtered up from the tomb of empire to witneſs the adoration which they paid her. But even there ſhe received ſo frequent violence that the continuance of her reign was for the moſt part precarious; and when even at the ſummit of her glory, ſhe was only elevated that her fall might be more aſtoniſhing.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017132_0007_0FA031D33003E2A8"/>Having paſſed all the degrees of fortune, thank GOD She has found her way to theſe remote ſhores: and, if from effects we may judge, She is well pleaſed with her new abode. O cheriſh the divine inhabitant! O let her not return to the courts above with a ſtory that ſhall fire the heavens againſt us—that <hi>She</hi> had bleſſings for us; but that <hi>we</hi> were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them—that She could find among us no laſting habitation; but that, like the dove after the deluge, She was ſcarce favoured with the top of ſome friendly mountain for a melancholy moment.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY, my friends! is a palladium to the place of her dwelling, a rock and a ſure defence. Wherever She is, every man has ſomething to protect. He knows what are his riches, and that while he liveth himſelf ſhall gather them. He views with conſcious joy his circumſtance. His ſocial affections ſhoot out and flouriſh. Even his prejudices are a ſource of ſatisfaction, and among them local attachment, a fault which leans to the ſide of patriotiſm.
<note n="*" place="bottom">And even his failings lean'd to virtue's ſide. Goldſmith.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SUPPORTED by and tenacious of theſe fruits of Liberty, ſome little free ſtates, which the geographer in his map had <hi>otherways</hi> never noticed, have long ſtood uninjured by change and ſome of them inacceſſible by the greateſt efforts of Power. There is now in a diſtant quarter of the globe a living illuſtration of this remark. Situate upon a venerable pile of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017132_0008_0FA031D3FA1E0570"/>rocks in Italy ſtands the Commonwealth of St. Matino. It was founded by a holy man whoſe name it bears, and who fled to this romantick fairy-land to enjoy religion and free air, unpurſued by power and the reſtleſs ſpirit of the world. His example was followed by the pious, the humane and the lovers of freedom. And theſe, a favorite few, who were before ſcattered up and down thro' other parts of Italy; who had lived all their days under arbitrary rule and whom Nature had ſecretly taught that there was ſomewhere a happier inſtitution for man—theſe hurried away to the ſnowy top of St. Marino: And having there firſt taſted thoſe rights which come down from GOD, made it their <hi>life's labor</hi> to ſupport and hand them down in purity. There every man finds his proſperity in ſubmitting to thoſe laws which diffuſe equality. There every man feels himſelf happily liable to be called to the ſenate or the field: every man divides his day between alternate labor and the uſe of arms—on tip-toe, ready to ſtart for the prize, the mark of univerſal emulation—the Common-Weal; officious to promote that intereſt which is at once the publick's and his own. So ſtands a conſtitution informed with the very eſſence of Liberty. It has ſo ſtood, while other neighbouring ſtates have been blackened and defaced with frequent revolution. And we propheſy that 'till the approach of ſome unforeſeen vice—'till ſome degeneracy unknown to the ſires creep upon the ſons, St. Marino muſt ſtand admired: as, in its preſent circumſtance, no prince or potentate, after
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017132_0009_0FA031D4DF8B64C8"/>ſitting down and counting the coſt, will ever attempt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable union of ſo much prudence and virtue.

            </p>
            <p>THE name of Venice now occurs to memory as another modern example of genuine greatneſs. The aſcendency gained by that ſingle city over the whole Ottoman power—the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal panic that ſtruck and pervaded all orders of the Turks when routed at the Dardanelles, and the <hi>reaſonable fear</hi> of approaching diſſolution that reached even to the throne and blaſted the heart and withered the nerves of a deſpot: Theſe, amazing at firſt, nevertheleſs appear, when their ſprings are laid open, the natural iſſues of a conteſt between free agents and ſlaves.

            <p>I had cheriſhed ſome averſion to names grown trite by repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and had, on that account, evaded the ancient republicks. But I find the obſervation juſt that "half our learning is their epitaph." I conceive that the "moſs-grown" columns and broken arches of thoſe once renowned empires are full with inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as were the groves of Lycèum or the ſchool of Plato. Let Greece then be the ſubject of a moment's reflection. When Liberty fled from the gloom of Egypt, ſhe ſought out and ſettled at infant Greece—there diſſeminated the ſeeds of greatneſs; there laid the ground-work of Republican glory. Simplicity of manners, piety to the gods, generoſity and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage were her earlieſt character. "Human nature ſhot wild and free."

Frugality of living and an avarice of time were of the riches of Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.

When that inclination is gratified, the majority being ſlaves, the remains of freedom are ſhared among the great; like the triumphal bridge at the Archipelago, ſo ſtrangely dignified that, by a decree of ſenate, none of the vulgar were ſuffered to enjoy it. When that inclination is counterbalanced by the laws; when the

Not to wire-draw a ſentiment already graven upon the hearts of this audience, it is ſuch a Liberty, as that every man who has once taſted it, becomes a temporary ſoldier as ſoon as it is invaded and reſents any violence offered it, as an attack upon his life—Hence it is that in free ſtates <hi>as ſuch</hi> there is no ſuch thing as a perpetual ſtanding army. For the whole body of the people, ever ready, flock to the general ſtandard upon emergency, and ſo preclude the uſe of that infernal engine. I ſay <hi>infernal</hi> engine, for the tongue "<hi>labors,</hi> and is at a loſs to expreſs," the hideous and frightful conſequences that flow wherever the powers of hell have procured its introduction. Turkey and Algiers are the delight of its vengeance. Denmark, once over-ſwarmed with the brave inhabitants of the North, has ſuffered depopulation poverty and the heavieſt bondage, from the quartering troops amongſt their peaſants in time of peace: <hi>if it can be called peace,</hi> when robbery, conflagration and murder are let looſe upon the ſons of men. Indeed, it is ſaid that no nation ever kept up an army in time of peace that did not looſe its liberties. I believe it. Athens, Corinth, Syracuſe and Greece in general were all overturned by that tremendous power: and the ſame power has been long operating with other cauſes to humble the creſt of Britain. Let us hear a paſſage from Davenant! "If (ſays he, ſpeaking of ſtanding armies) if they who believed this
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017132_0015_0FA031D957808A60"/>eagle in the air frighted all motions towards Liberty; if they who heretofore tho't armies in time of peace and our freedom inconſiſtent; if the ſame men ſhould throw off a whig principle ſo fundamental, and thus come to clothe themſelves with the deteſted garments of the tories, and if all that has been here diſcourſed on ſhould happen, then will the conſtitution of this Country be utterly ſubverted."

            <p>THAT ſtanding mercenary troops muſt ſooner or later entail ſervitude and miſery upon their employers is an eternal truth that appears from the nature of things.

<note n="*" place="bottom">"That the yeomanry are the bulwark of a free people"—was, if memory ſerves, in a celebrated extempore ſpeech of the honorable Samuel Adams, made in the year 1773.

And ſuch, we doubt not, are the troops who beat the Britiſh Legions from the Jerſies and have ever ſince preſerved their country, under the conduct of that ſuperior man who combines in quality the unſhaken conſtancy of Cato, the triumphant delay of Fabius, and, <hi>upon proper occaſions,</hi> the enterprizing ſpirit of Hannibal.</p>

This is a hard ſaying. But does not all hiſtory preſs forward to aſſert it's juſtice? Do not the praetorian bands of tottering Rome now crowd upon the affrighted memory? Do not the embodied guards from Peterſburgh and Conſtantinople ſtalk horrid, the tools of revolution and murder? To come nearer home for an example—do we not ſee the darkened ſpring of 1770, like the moon in a thick atmoſphere, riſing in blood and uſhered in by the figure of Britain plunging her ponyard in the young boſom of America?

Time was when we could all affirm to this gloomy queſtion—when we were ready to cry out that our fathers had done a vain thing. I mean upon that unnatural night which we now commemorate; when the fire of Brutus was on many a heart—when the ſtrain of Gracchus was on many a tongue. "Wretch that I am, whither ſhall I retreat?

            <p>Such are the ſuggeſtions of fancy: And having given them their due ſcope; having deſcribed the memorable 5th of March as a ſeaſon of diſaſter; it would be an impiety not to conſider it in its other relation.

Strike that night out of Time, and we quench the firſt ardor of a reſentment which has been ever ſince increaſing and now accelerates the fall of Tyranny. The provocations of that night muſt be numbered among the maſter-ſprings which gave the firſt motion to a vaſt machinery, a noble and comprehenſive ſyſtem of national Independence. "The Independence of America, ſays the writer under the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Common Senſe, ſhould have been conſidered as dating it's Aera from the firſt muſquet that was fired againſt her." Be it ſo! But Maſſachuſetts may certainly date many of it's bleſſings from the Boſton Maſſacre—a dark hour in itſelf, but from which a marvellous light has ariſen. From that night Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became inevitable and the occaſion commenced of the preſent moſt beautiful form of Government. We often read of the original Contract, and of mankind, in the early ages,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017132_0020_0FA030D36D4F8490"/>paſſing from a ſtate of Nature to immediate Civililization.

            <p>AND yet the people of Maſſachuſetts have reduced to practice the wonderful theory. A numerous people have convened in a ſtate of Nature, and, like <hi>our ideas</hi> of the patriarchs, have deputed a few fathers of the land to draw up for them a glorious covenant. It has been drawn. The people have ſigned it with rapture, and have thereby bartered among themſelves an eaſy degree of obedience for the higheſt poſſible civil happineſs. To render that covenant eternal, patriotiſm and political virtue muſt forever blaze—muſt blaze at the <hi>preſent day</hi> with ſuperlative luſtre; being watch'd, from <hi>different motives,</hi> by the eyes of all mankind. Nor muſt that patriotiſm be contracted to a ſingle Commonwealth. A combination of the States is requiſite to ſupport them individually. "Unite or die" is our indiſpenſable motto. Every ſtep from it is a ſtep nearer
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017132_0021_0FA030D4B792DA38"/>to the region of Death. This idea was never more occaſional than at the preſent criſis—a criſis pregnant with Fate and ready to burſt with calamity. I aliude to that languor which, like a low hung cloud, overſhadows a great part of the thirteen States. That the young, enterprizing America, who ſtep'd out in the cauſe of humankind and, no other arm daring, lop'd the branches of wide deſpotic Empire—that the ſame America ſhould now ſuffer a few inſolent bands to ravage her borders with impunity—that her <hi>now tardy</hi> hand ſhould ſuſpend the finiſhing ſtroke of reſentment, and leave to her <hi>generous allies</hi> a labor which her own vigor ought to effect—this muſt diſturb thoſe, illuſtrious, who fell in her infant exertions—this muſt ſtab the peace of the dead, however it may affect the hearts of the living. Oh could I bear a part among the means of awakening virtue—Oh could I call ſtrength to theſe feeble lungs and borrow that note which ſhook the throne of Julius! Vain wiſh!
