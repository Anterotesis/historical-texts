            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S your Relation to the Legiſlature of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince (as an honourable Member of the Great and General Court or Aſſembly) gives you an Opportunity; ſo I am perſwaded, you are very ſenſible that you are under proportionable Obligations to ſtudy the Welfare of the People of this Province, not only by promoting and forwarding of ſuch Acts and Laws, as are or may be found neceſſary for the Encouragement of Virtue and true Religion, and ſuppreſſing of Vice and Immorality, but alſo by diſcountenancing and ſuppreſſing ſuch Oppreſſions as (under Colour of Law) are at any Time exerciſed, to Infringe the juſt Rights of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in Matters of Religion. And whereas an Opinion ſeems to have generally prevailed among the People of this Province, That in every Town and Precinct (except the Town of <hi>Boſton</hi>) All the Inhabitants, are by the Laws of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, obliged to pay to the Settlement and Support, of ſuch a Miniſter as the major Part agree upon, unleſs a minor Part (diſſenting) do profeſs themſelves to be of the Epiſcopal, Anabaptiſt, or Quakers Perſwaſion; I perſwade my ſelf, you will eaſily obſerve, that ſuch an Opinion (fathered on our
<pb facs="unknown:007037_0003_102AECD93AC29658"/>Province Laws) carries in it very undue Reflections upon our honourable Legiſlature, and repreſents our Laws, either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and partial, or inconſiſtent one with another; whereas if the Word <hi>All</hi> in our Laws, might be allowed to intend, no more than is commonly intended thereby, in ſacred Writ, there would be no Colour for ſuch a Pretence. And muſt it not be very abſurd to imagine, That our honourable Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intended any other by the Word <hi>All,</hi> than All who did, or ought to attend <hi>that</hi> Miniſtry, excluſive of ſuch as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly diſſent therefrom? Or that when they in very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms, enacted, that <q>each reſpective gathered Church in any Town or Precinct within this Province, that at any Time ſhall be in want of a Miniſter, ſuch Church ſhall have Power, according to the Directions given in the Word of GOD, to choſe their own Miniſter</q>? That, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Court intended thereby no greater Liberty to conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencious Diſſenters, than the Egyptian Monarch propoſed to grant to the Children of Iſrael, when he ſaid, <hi>Go ye, ſerve the Lord, only let your Flocks and your Herds be ſtayed.</hi> Or that they were influenced meerly from politick Motives, and not from a religious Regard to the Rights of Conſcience, and the Rules of commutative Juſtice, in freeing the Eſtates of the Members of Epiſcopal and Anabaptiſt Churches, and the People called Quakers, from ſupporting a Miniſtry in which their Conſciences do not acquiecs;e?</p>
            <p>Surely, ſuch a wiſe, religious and Proteſtant Legiſlature (being alſo themſelves Diſſenters) could neither thro' Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Nature of Religion, or the Nature and Office of Conſcience, be brought to ſuppoſe, that true Religion is to be propagated by external Force or Compulſion; or that Conſcience (even tho' it be erroneous) is in ſuch a Way, or by ſuch Means, to be regulated or rectified. Nor could they be ſo inadvertent as to determine, That <hi>all</hi> the Inhabitants of a Town or Precinct, where ſome are of the Calviniſtical and others of the Arminian or Latitudinarian Perſwaſion, might conſiſtent with a good Conſcience (that is, without ſinfully counteracting the Dictates of their own Conſciences) continue together as one Congregation: Or, that it can be poſſible, that any one Miniſter ſhould ſo diſpenſe the Word of God, in ſuch a mixed Aſſembly, as to Anſwer (in the Opinion of All) the great End of the Goſpel Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007037_0004_102AECD3A10C7EB8"/>
I am therefore perſwaded, that it never was the Intent of the Law, that all without Diſtinction, ſhould be taxed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Support of a Miniſtry in which the Conſciences of ſome cannot acquieſce; yet I earneſtly wiſh, that our Laws were rendered more plain and eaſy to be underſtood in their genuine Senſe and Meaning.</p>
            <p>I covet for my ſelf and mine, the Enjoyment of a learned, as well as pious and orthodox Miniſtry; and count it a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Favour of Heaven, which calls for great Admiration, as well as Thankfulneſs, that in our degenerate Age, there are any, and ſo many, faithful Goſpel Miniſters continued in our Land: And I wiſh they may ever be duly encouraged and ſupported; but I am not able to diſcover any Scripture-Foundation for any Act or Acts of the Civil Authority to compel any who conſcienciouſly and on the Account of a different underſtanding of the Meaning of the Scriptures, do diſſent even from the Miniſtry of ſuch as by the major Part are eſteemed to be the moſt eminent, to hear, or pay for, ſuch Preaching, as they apprehend to be diſagreable to the great End of the Goſpel Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Can ſuch Compulſion be reconciled to the Rules of Equity and Juſtice? Can it be founded on, yea, is it not directly contrary to, the Example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and to the Practiſe of the primitive Churches, who neither uſed themſelves, nor preſcribed to ſucceeding Ages, any compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Methods to bring Men to embrace the Goſpel? And are not perſwaſive and convictive Arguments for the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Mind, the only Scripture Method to promote ſincere Religion?</p>
            <p>It is indeed wonderful to me, That notwithſtanding the plain Evidence we have of the Spread of the Goſpel over the whole World, without the Aſſiſtance of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, that it ſhould now become ſo general an Opinion. That Churches muſt needs be brought into Confuſion and Diſorder, be crumbled to Pieces, their Foundation raz'd &amp;c. unleſs all the Inhabitants in each Town and Precinct (tho' conſiſting of a mixed Number of People of very different Perſwaſions in Points of Doctrine) be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to join in ſupporting ſuch as Miniſtry, as is agreeable to the Mind of a major Part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007037_0005_102AECDB961292E0"/>
But ſince there is a ſuch a Thing as a ſpiritual, as well as corporeal Senſation, can there be any Reaſon aſſigned, why the Choice of Food for our Souls, any more than for our Bodies, ſhould be refer'd to the Judgment (not to ſay Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours) of other Men? Yet I am perſwaded, that if it were but ſuſpected, that any Laws of the Province had put it in the Power of a major Part, to provide a coſtly Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the whole Town, once a Week, and to compel every one to pay his Part of the Coſt, it would raiſe a grievous Hubbub, and People would be apt to think it an Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their natural Rights, as Men, that other Men ſhould chuſe their Diet: and that it was unreaſonable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to pay for the Proviſion, if they found it ſo unſavoury that they could not eat it; and much more if they were aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſomething of a poiſonous Quality, or that had a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to breed Diſeaſes in the Body, was mixed with it. Now, in as much as the Care of every Man's own Soul is peculiarly belonging to himſelf, and is of infinitely greater Importance than the Concerns of the Body; and we are pathetically cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to take Heed both how, &amp; what we hear. To beware of falſe Teachers &amp; corrupt Doctrines, and are expreſly required to ceaſe from hearing the Inſtruction that cauſeth to err from the Words of Knowledge, it cannot be leſs reaſonable and neceſſary (but vaſtly more ſo) that every Man be left entirely free, to act according to the Dictates of his own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in the Choice of his ſpiritual Food, and to put himſelf under ſuch a Miniſtry as he apprehends to be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Mind of Chriſt, and conſequently moſt likely to ſubſerve his own Edification.</p>
            <p>And all Attempts to diſenable a minor Party in any Town or Precinct for, or with Reſpect to the Support of ſuch an agreeable Miniſtry for themſelves (by wreſting their Eſtates from them towards the Support of a Miniſtry, in which their Conſciences cannot acquieſce) are far from having a Tendency to promote Goſpel Order, or the Growth of Chriſtianity, and diſcovers more of an Anti-Chriſtian perſecuting Spirit and Temper, than a Deſire to advance the Intereſt of Peace Truth and Holineſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome object, That if ſuch a Freedom from Taxations for the Support of the ſtanding Miniſtry, be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a minor Party, that this would open a Door for Men,
<pb facs="unknown:007037_0006_102AECD52978BEB8"/>meerly out of Prejudice, yet under a Pretence of Conſcience, to ſet up ſeparate Aſſemblies: I would only inquire, Whether that Door be not already open for ſuch Separations as thoſe, by the Acts formerly made to free the Members of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and Anabaptiſt Churches, and the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and whether thoſe Acts do any more than only put them into actual Poſſeſſion of thoſe Rights of humane Nature, which juſtly belonged to them before thoſe Acts were paſſed, and which cannot be juſtly denied to any of His Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects of this Province.</p>
            <p>Another Objection which I have ſometimes heard is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That to oblige all to pay to the ſtanding Miniſtry, is agreeable to the Wiſdom of the Nation; Diſſenters, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Act of Toleration, are obliged to pay Tythes, by which the ſtanding Miniſtry is ſupported.</p>
            <p>I reply to this Objection, That our Predeceſſors in this Land diſclaimed any Pretence to a National or Provincial Conſtitution of Churches; and in as much as our Churches here are Congregational, and with Reſpect to their Ecceleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Conſtitution, and Mode of Worſhip, are very different from that of the National Church, I can ſee no Reaſon why the whole Regimen, Services and Ceremonies of the National Church, may not be urged for our Imitation, with as great Force and Strength of Argument, as thoſe National Acts, which oblige Diſſenters there, to bear a Part in the Charge of the Incumbents. And verily, if I thought (as it ſeems Multitudes do) that our Laws have veſted a Majority in each Town and Precinct, with a Power of impoſing miniſterial Rates or Taxes, at their Pleaſure, upon ſuch as diſſent from them in their Choice of a Miniſter, I could ſee no Grounds to hope that the Perſecution would ſtop here, but think that a Door is ſet open to proceed from this, to the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perſecution, and ſhould be ready to expect that in a ſhort Time Diſſenters will be favoured with at leaſt as much Freedom and Liberty of Conſcience, under the Government of LORD DIOCESAN, as under the popular Authority of LORD MAJORITY.</p>
            <p>And now (Honoured Sir,) Since our Laws are conſtrued by many to intend ſuch a Power, I refer to your ſuperiour Judgment, whether Reaſon and Religion, as well as the juſt Vindication of the Laws of this Province (relating to the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007037_0007_102AECDD871B6D70"/>Settlement and Support of Miniſters) from ſuch Aſperſions, does not require, that ſomething be done, in a very explicit Manner, to reſcue them from ſuch Miſconſtructions, and prevent their being abuſed to Injuſtice, Oppreſſion and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Tyranny? ſad Inſtances whereof, have already been, in ſeveral Places in our Land. So reſts,</p>
