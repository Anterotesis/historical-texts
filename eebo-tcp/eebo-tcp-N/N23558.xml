         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In this forlorn ſtroller I have diſcovered qualities that honour human nature, and accompliſhments that might grace a prince. My poor friend has often lent me his money, though he ſuppoſed me a poor needy devil, that could never be able to repay him. He ſhan't know who I am till it's in my power to ſerve him; only the rogue always marr'd the grand deſign of my frolic—I had no chance among the pretty women where he was; he had the knack of winning their hearts by his gaiety. Tho' ſo deviliſh pleaſant in his quotations, which on the moment he daſhes in a parody whimſically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to every occaſion as it happens, I hope he won't find the purſe I've hid in his pocket before we part. I dread the moment—but it's come.</p>

                        <p>Madam, the event has juſtified your cenſure, for my husband, not knowing himſelf really bound by any legal tie, abandoned me—I followed him to the Indies; diſtracted, till ſeeing him, I left my infant at one of our ſettlements; but after a fruitleſs ſearch, on my return, I found the friend, to whoſe care I committed my child, was compelled to retire from the ravages of war, but where I could not hear—rent with agonizing pangs, without a child or husband, I again ſaw England, and my brother, who wounded himſelf with remorſe for being the cauſe of my misfortunes, ſecluded himſelf from all joys of ſocial life, and invited me to partake the comforts of ſolitude in that aſylum, from whence we have both juſt now been driven.</p>

                     </gap>et with very great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in my productions of the muſical kind; when I wrote the following Opera, it was with unuſual care and attention; and it was the general opinion of all my friends, ſome of whom rank among the beſt judges, that of all my trifles, Lionel and Clariſſa was the moſt pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: a deciſion in its favour, which I was the prouder of, becauſe, to the beſt of my knowledge, through the whole, I had not borrowed an expreſſion, a ſentiment, or a character, from any dramatic writer extant.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. GARRICK thought of performing this piece at Drury-lane theatre, he had a new ſinger to bring out, and every thing poſſible for her advantage was to be done; this neceſſarily occaſioned ſome new ſongs and airs to be introduced; and other ſingers, with voices of a different compaſs from thoſe who originally acted the parts, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſtill more; by which means the greateſt part of the muſic unavoidably became new. This is the chief, and indeed the only alteration made in the Opera: and even to that, I ſhould in many places have been forced, much againſt my will, had it not given a freſh opportunity to Mr. <hi>Dibden</hi> to diſplay his admirable talents as a muſical compoſer. And I will be bold to ſay, that his airs, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and comic, in this Opera, will appear to no diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by being heard with thoſe of ſome of the greateſt maſters.</p>
                  <p>The SCHOOL FOR FATHERS is added to the title, becauſe the plot in evidently double; and that of Lionel and Clariſſa alluded to but one part of it, as the readers and ſpectators will eaſily perceive.</p>

To be ſure, madam, it's no buſineſs of mine; but, I believe, if the truth was known, there are thoſe in the houſe who would give more than ever I ſhall be worth, or any the likes of me, to prevent the marriage of a certain perſon that ſhall be nameleſs.</p>

There's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a man this day alive, but might be proud of it: for ſhe's the handſomeſt, ſweeteſt tempere'deſt!—And I am ſure, one of the beſt miſtreſſes ever a poor girl had.</p>

I am ſure, when ſhe called me into her dreſſing-room, before ſhe went down to dinner, there ſhe ſtood, with her eyes brim full of tears; and ſo I tell a crying, for company—and then ſhe ſaid ſhe could not abide the chap in the parlour; and, at the ſame time, ſhe bid me take an opportunity to ſpeak to you, and deſire you to meet her in the garden this evening, after tea; for ſhe has ſomething to ſay to you.</p>

ſo ſays my pocket-book; and chance directing me to this village, on the twentieth of the ſame month, I procured a recommendation to the worſhipful <hi>Juſtice Woodcock,</hi> to be the ſuperintendant of his pumpkins and cabbages, becauſe I would let my father ſee I choſe to run any lengths, rather than ſubmit to what his obſtinacy would have forced me, a marriage againſt my inclinations, with a woman I never ſaw. Here I have been three weeks, and in that time I am as much altered as if I changed my nature with my habit. 'Sdeath, to fall in love with a chambermaid!

Why was I uneaſy at his toying with another woman? what was it to me?— Then I dream of him almoſt every night—but that may proceed from his being generally uppermoſt in my thoughts all day; Oh! worſe and worſe!—Well, he is certainly a pretty lad; 'he has ſomething uncommon 'about him, conſidering his rank:'—And now let me only put the caſe, if he was not a ſervant—In ſhort, I'll aſk no more queſtions, for the further I examine, the leſs reaſon I ſhall have to be ſatisfied.</p>

                        <p>WELL, this is excellent, this is mighty good, this is mighty merry, faith; ha! ha! ha! was ever the like heard of? that my boy Tom, ſhould run away from me, for fear of being forced to marry a girl he never ſaw! that ſhe ſhould ſcamper from her father for fear of being forced to marry him! and that they ſhould run into one another's arms this way in diſguiſe, by mere accident; againſt their conſents, and without knowing it, as a body may ſay; maſter Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,

may I never do an ill turn, if it is not one of the oddeſt adventures, partly—</p>

                        <speaker>Hawth.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, Sir William, it is a romance, a novel, a pleaſanter hiſtory, by half, than the loves of Doraſtus and Faunia; we ſhall have bellads made of it within theſe two months, ſetting forth, how a young 'ſquire became a ſerving man of low degree; and it will be ſtuck up with Margaret's Ghoſt and the Spaniſh Lady, againſt the walls of every cottage in the country.</p>

                        <p>But what pleaſes me beſt of all, maſter Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, is the ingenuity of the girl. May I never do an ill turn, when I was called out of the room, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſaid ſhe wanted to ſpeak with me, if I knew what to make on't: but when the little gipſey took me aſide, and told me her name, and how matters ſtood, I was quite aſtoniſhed, as a body may ſay: and could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, partly; till her young friend, that ſhe is with here aſſured me of the truth on't: Indeed, at laſt, I began to recollect her face, though I have not ſet my eyes on her before ſince ſhe was the height of a full-grown grey-hound.</p>

                        <p>Well, Sir William, your ſon as yet knows nothing of what has happened, nor of your being come hither: and, if you'll follow my counſel, we'll have ſome ſport with him.—He and his miſtreſs were to meet in the garden this evening by appointment; ſhe's gone to dreſs herſelf in all her airs: will you let me direct your proceedings in this affair?</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>With all my heart, maſter Hawthorn, with all my heart, do what you will with me, ſay what you pleaſe for me; I am ſo overjoyed, and ſo happy—And may I never do an ill turn, but I am very glad to ſee you too: ay, and partly as much pleaſed at that as any thing elſe, for we have been merry together before now, when we were ſome years younger: well, and how has the world gone with you, maſter Hawthorn, ſince we ſaw one another laſt?</p>

                        <p>Why, pretty well, Sir William, I have no reaſon to complain: every one has a mixture of ſour with his ſweets; but, in the main, I believe, I have done in a degree as tolerably as my neighbours.</p>

                        <p>Sir William, I beg pardon for detaining you, but I have had ſo much difficulty in adjuſting my bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed plumes—</p>

                        <p>May I never do an ill turn, but they fit you to a T, and you look very well, ſo you do: Cockſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, how your father will cuckle when he comes to hear this!—Her father, maſter Hawthorn, is as worthy a man as lives by bread, and has been almoſt out of his ſenſes for the loſs of her—But tell me, huſſey, has not this been all a ſcheme, a piece of conjuration between you and my ſon? Faith, I am half perſuaded it has, it looks ſo like hocus-pocus, as a body may ſay.</p>

                        <p>Upon my word, Sir William, what has happened has been the mere effect of chance; I came hither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your ſon, and he unknown to me: I never in the leaſt ſuſpected that Thomas the gardener was other than his appearance ſpoke him; and leaſt of all, that he was a perſon with whom I had ſo cloſe a connection. Mr. Hawthorn can teſtify the aſtoniſhment I was in when he firſt informed me of it; but I thought it was my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come to an immediate explanation with you.</p>

                        <p>Is not ſhe a neat wench, maſter Hawthorn? May I never do an ill turn, but ſhe is.—But, you little plaguy devil, how came this love affair between you?</p>

Girls in my time had other employments; we worked at our needles, and kept ourſelves from idle thoughts: before I was your age, I had finiſhed with my own fingers, a complete ſet of chairs, and a fire-ſcreen, in tent-ſtitch; four counterpanes in Marſeilles quilting; and the creed and the ten commandments in the hair of our family: it was framed and glaz'd, and hung over the parlour chimney-piece, and your poor dear grandfather was prouder of it than of e'er a picture in his houſe. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looked into a book, but when I ſaid my prayers, except it was the Complete Houſewife, or the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily receipt book: whereas you are always at your ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies! Ah, I never knew a woman come to good, that was fond of reading.</p>

                     <l>WHILE other culprits brave it to the laſt;</l>
                     <l>Nor beg for mercy till the judgment's paſt:</l>
                     <l>Poets alone, as conſcious of their crimes,</l>
                     <l>Open their trials with imploring rhymes.</l>
                     <l>Thus cramm'd with flattery and low ſubmiſſion,</l>
                     <l>Each trite dull prologue is the bard's petition.</l>
                     <l>A ſtale device to calm the critic's fury,</l>
                     <l>And bribe at once the judges and the jury.</l>

                     <l>The whimp'ring ſcribbler ne'er can touch your hearts:</l>
                     <l>Nor ought an ill-tim'd pity to take place—</l>
                     <l>Faſt as they riſe, deſtroy th' increaſing race:</l>

                     <l>He aſks no friend his partial zeal to ſhow,</l>

                     <l>He knows no friendſhip can protect the fool,</l>
                     <l>Nor will an audience be a party's tool.</l>
                     <l>'Tis inconſiſtent with a free-born ſpirit,</l>
                     <l>To ſide with folly, or to injure merit.</l>

                     <l>Who needs muſt write—he did—and wrote a play.</l>
                     <l>The parts were caſt to various beaſts and fowl:</l>
                     <l>Their ſtage a barn;—the manager an owl!</l>
                     <l>The houſe was cramm'd at ſix, with friends and foes;</l>
                     <l>Rakes, wits, and critics, citizens and beaux.</l>
                     <l>Theſe characters appear'd in different ſhapes</l>
                     <l>Of tigers, foxes, horſes, bulls and apes;</l>
                     <l>With others too, of lower rank and ſtation:—</l>
                     <l>A perfect abſtract of the brute creation!</l>
                     <l>Each, as he felt, mark'd out the author's faults,</l>
                     <l>And thus the <hi>connoiſſeurs</hi> expreſs'd their thoughts.</l>
                     <l>The <hi>critic curs</hi> firſt ſnarl'd—the rules are broke!</l>
                     <l>Time, place, and action ſacrific'd to joke!</l>
                     <l>The <hi>goats</hi> cry'd out, 'twas formal, dull, and chaſte—</l>
                     <l>Not writ for beaſts of gallantry and taſte!</l>
                     <l>The <hi>horned-cattle</hi> were in piteous taking,</l>
                     <l>At fornification, rapes and cuckold making!</l>
                     <l>The <hi>tigers</hi> ſwore, he wanted fire and paſſion.</l>

                     <l>The generous <hi>ſteeds</hi> allow'd him proper merit:</l>
                     <l>Here mark'd his faults, and there approv'd his ſpirit.</l>
                     <l>While <hi>brother-bards</hi> bray'd forth with uſual ſpleen,</l>

I was perhaps too harſh, therefore do it in your own way. But let me ſee the houſe fairly rid of her.

                           <p>Oh! the greateſt of all inducements, curioſity. Let me aſſure you, a woman's ſureſt hold over a man is to keep him in uncertainty. As ſoon as ever you put him out of doubt, you put him out of your power: but when once a woman has awak'd his curioſity, ſhe may lead him a dance of many a troubleſome mile without the leaſt fear of loſing him at laſt.</p>

                           <p>I care not how ſoon. I long to meet with ſuch a fellow. Our modern beaux are ſuch jointed babies in love, they have no feeling. They are entirely inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible either of pain or pleaſure, but from their own dear perſons: and according as we flatter, or affront their beauty, they admire or forſake ours. They are not worthy even our diſpleaſure; and, in ſhort, abuſing them is but ſo much ill-nature merely thrown away. But the man of ſenſe, who values himſelf upon his high abilities: or the man of wit, who thinks a woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his converſation—to ſee ſuch the ſubjects of our power, the ſlaves of our frowns and ſmiles is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious indeed!</p>

                           <p>By too great confidence. When I got her to my chair, the chairmen were not to be found.—And ſafe, as I thought in our diſguiſe, I actually put her into the chair, when Mr. Strictland and his ſervants were in ſight; which I had no ſooner done, than they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded us, overpowered me, and carried her away.</p>

                           <p>I had deſigned it. But when I came to the door, I found the ladder removed; and hearing no noiſe, ſeeing no lights, nor being able to make any body anſwer, I concluded all attempts as impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as now I find them. Ha! I ſee Lucetta coming. Then they may be ſtill in town.
