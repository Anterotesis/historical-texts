            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My father muÅ¿t by this time have heard of my departure from the academy at PortÅ¿mouth; and tho' I was deluded away by my rage for acting, 'twas bad of me to give the gay old fellow any cauÅ¿e of uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s.</p>

<stage>(calls).</stage>
In this forlorn Å¿troller I have diÅ¿covered qualities that honour human nature, and accompliÅ¿hments that might grace a prince. My poor friend has often lent me his money, though he Å¿uppoÅ¿ed me a poor needy devil, that could never be able to repay him. He Å¿han't know who I am till it's in my power to Å¿erve him; only the rogue always marr'd the grand deÅ¿ign of my frolicâI had no chance among the pretty women where he was; he had the knack of winning their hearts by his gaiety. Tho' Å¿o deviliÅ¿h pleaÅ¿ant in his quotations, which on the moment he daÅ¿hes in a parody whimÅ¿ically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ite to every occaÅ¿ion as it happens, I hope he won't find the purÅ¿e I've hid in his pocket before we part. I dread the momentâbut it's come.</p>

                     </gap>et with very great Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿s in my productions of the muÅ¿ical kind; when I wrote the following Opera, it was with unuÅ¿ual care and attention; and it was the general opinion of all my friends, Å¿ome of whom rank among the beÅ¿t judges, that of all my trifles, Lionel and ClariÅ¿Å¿a was the moÅ¿t pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: a deciÅ¿ion in its favour, which I was the prouder of, becauÅ¿e, to the beÅ¿t of my knowledge, through the whole, I had not borrowed an expreÅ¿Å¿ion, a Å¿entiment, or a character, from any dramatic writer extant.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. GARRICK thought of performing this piece at Drury-lane theatre, he had a new Å¿inger to bring out, and every thing poÅ¿Å¿ible for her advantage was to be done; this neceÅ¿Å¿arily occaÅ¿ioned Å¿ome new Å¿ongs and airs to be introduced; and other Å¿ingers, with voices of a different compaÅ¿s from thoÅ¿e who originally acted the parts, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ioned Å¿till more; by which means the greateÅ¿t part of the muÅ¿ic unavoidably became new. This is the chief, and indeed the only alteration made in the Opera: and even to that, I Å¿hould in many places have been forced, much againÅ¿t my will, had it not given a freÅ¿h opportunity to Mr. <hi>Dibden</hi> to diÅ¿play his admirable talents as a muÅ¿ical compoÅ¿er. And I will be bold to Å¿ay, that his airs, Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and comic, in this Opera, will appear to no diÅ¿ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by being heard with thoÅ¿e of Å¿ome of the greateÅ¿t maÅ¿ters.</p>
                  <p>The SCHOOL FOR FATHERS is added to the title, becauÅ¿e the plot in evidently double; and that of Lionel and ClariÅ¿Å¿a alluded to but one part of it, as the readers and Å¿pectators will eaÅ¿ily perceive.</p>

                        <p>However, my particular diÅ¿appointment ought not to be detrimental to you, nor Å¿hall it: I well know how irkÅ¿ome it is to a generous mind to live in a Å¿tate of dependance, and have long had it in my thoughts to make you eaÅ¿y for life.</p>

                        <p>There is an eÅ¿tate in this county, which I purchaÅ¿ed Å¿ome years ago. By me it will never be miÅ¿Å¿ed, and whoever marries my daughter, will have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on to complain of my diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of Å¿uch a trifle for my own gratification. On the preÅ¿ent marriage, I intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a deed of gift in your favour, which has been for Å¿ome time prepared: my lawyer has this day completed it, and it is yours, my dear <hi>Lionel,</hi> with every good wiÅ¿h that the warmeÅ¿t friend can beÅ¿tow.</p>

                        <p>Your delicacy carries you too far. In this I confer a favour on myÅ¿elf: however, we'll talk no more on the Å¿ubject at preÅ¿entâLet us walk towards the houÅ¿e;

                        <p>Why, Sir William, it is a romance, a novel, a pleaÅ¿anter hiÅ¿tory, by half, than the loves of DoraÅ¿tus and Faunia; we Å¿hall have bellads made of it within theÅ¿e two months, Å¿etting forth, how a young 'Å¿quire became a Å¿erving man of low degree; and it will be Å¿tuck up with Margaret's GhoÅ¿t and the SpaniÅ¿h Lady, againÅ¿t the walls of every cottage in the country.</p>

                        <p>Upon my word, Sir William, what has happened has been the mere effect of chance; I came hither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your Å¿on, and he unknown to me: I never in the leaÅ¿t Å¿uÅ¿pected that Thomas the gardener was other than his appearance Å¿poke him; and leaÅ¿t of all, that he was a perÅ¿on with whom I had Å¿o cloÅ¿e a connection. Mr. Hawthorn can teÅ¿tify the aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment I was in when he firÅ¿t informed me of it; but I thought it was my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come to an immediate explanation with you.</p>

Girls in my time had other employments; we worked at our needles, and kept ourÅ¿elves from idle thoughts: before I was your age, I had finiÅ¿hed with my own fingers, a complete Å¿et of chairs, and a fire-Å¿creen, in tent-Å¿titch; four counterpanes in MarÅ¿eilles quilting; and the creed and the ten commandments in the hair of our family: it was framed and glaz'd, and hung over the parlour chimney-piece, and your poor dear grandfather was prouder of it than of e'er a picture in his houÅ¿e. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looked into a book, but when I Å¿aid my prayers, except it was the Complete HouÅ¿ewife, or the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily receipt book: whereas you are always at your Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies!

                           <p>It muÅ¿t be from a fine woman then: and not Å¿uch as are generally reputed Å¿oâand it muÅ¿t be a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough acquaintance with her too, that will ever make an impreÅ¿Å¿ion on my heart.</p>

                           <p>Would I could Å¿ee it once! for when a man has been all his life hoarding up a Å¿tock, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himÅ¿elf common neceÅ¿Å¿aries, it tickles me to the Å¿oul to Å¿ee him lay it all out upon a wrong bottom, and become a bankrupt at laÅ¿t.</p>

                           <p>Well, I don't care how Å¿oon you Å¿ee it. For the minute I find a woman capable of friendÅ¿hip, love, and tenderneÅ¿s, with good Å¿enÅ¿e enough to be always eaÅ¿y, and good nature enough to like me, I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put it to the trial, which of us Å¿hall have the greateÅ¿t Å¿hare of happineÅ¿s from the Å¿ex, you or I.</p>

                           <p>By marrying her, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e! Capable of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, love, and tenderneÅ¿s, ha, ha, ha! That a man of your Å¿enÅ¿e Å¿hould talk Å¿o. If Å¿he be capable of love 'tis all I require of my miÅ¿treÅ¿s; and as every woman, who is young, is capable of love, I am very reaÅ¿onably in love with every young woman I meet.âMy Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in a caÅ¿e I read this very morning, Å¿peaks my very Å¿enÅ¿e.</p>

They are not worthy even our diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure; and, in Å¿hort, abuÅ¿ing them is but Å¿o much ill-nature merely thrown away. But the man of Å¿enÅ¿e, who values himÅ¿elf upon his high abilities: or the man of wit, who thinks a woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his converÅ¿ationâto Å¿ee Å¿uch the Å¿ubjects of our power, the Å¿laves of our frowns and Å¿miles is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious indeed!</p>

                           <p>The novel, as you call it, is not Å¿o Å¿hort as you may imagine. I and my Å¿park have been long acquainted. As he was continually with my father, I Å¿oon perceived that he loved me, and the manner of his expreÅ¿Å¿ing that love was what pleas'd and won me moÅ¿t.</p>

                           <p>Would I were once well Å¿ettled with my young lady; for at preÅ¿ent, this is but an odd Å¿ort of a queer family. LaÅ¿t night's affair puzzles me. A hat there was that belong'd to none of us, that's certain. Madam was in a fright, that is as certain; and I brought all off. <hi>Jacintha</hi> eÅ¿cap'd, no one of us knows how. The good man's jealouÅ¿y was yeÅ¿terday groundleÅ¿s; yet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in my mind, he is very much in the right. Mighty odd, all this! Somebody knocks! If this Å¿hould be <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s Å¿park, I have an odd meÅ¿Å¿age for him too.</p>
