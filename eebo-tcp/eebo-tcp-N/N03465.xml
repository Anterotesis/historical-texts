            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A new Paradox! The Wrath and Curse of God is due to every Child, born into the World, for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin: And yet it is impossible, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Posterity should be the Subjects of God's Wrath and Curse, but for their own <hi>personal</hi> Guilt and Wickedness.

               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is establish'd upon a Hierarchy, consisting of <hi>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Deans, Prebendaries, Rectors, Curates</hi> &amp;c. to whom may be added a List of <hi>Lay</hi>-Officers, such as <hi>Chancellors, Commissaries, Proctors, Apparitors</hi> &amp;c. None of whom (as established in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) do we find once mention'd in the Scriptures. The inferior Clergy must, upon their Admission to Orders, swear to perform true and canonical Obedience to the Bishop, and to his Successors; tho' required to <hi>call no Man Master, but Christ.</hi> When ordain'd to the Ministry, and by the awful Bonds of that sacred Character, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach the Gospel, to be <hi>instant in Season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of Season,</hi> they are not allowed to preach without the Bishop's Licence. That an unlicenced Minister is bound by his Office to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but by this Order of your Church forbid to preach, till he has paid for a Liberty to do his Duty. You tell us, that Christ has committed the Government of his Church only to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; and yet a considerable Part of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is exempt from episcopal Jurisdiction. Of this Dr <hi>Whithy</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Upon <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV 6.</note> complains, that
<q>the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions settled by the papal Authority, do put many Parts of this Church into a very disjointed State; while in some Places the Laity, and in many others the Presbyters, exercise episcopal

Jurisdiction, independent on the Bishops, in Contradiction to their Principles.</q>
In these Exemptions, it's certain, the Bishop has no Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction at all. And the Case is not much better any where else: For tho' the <hi>spiritual Courts</hi> be held in the Name of the Bishop; yet the Power of Excommunication and Absolution belongs to meer <hi>Laymen,</hi> who proceed without the Bishop's Direction; and can legally proceed most contrary to his Will.

<q>Discipline (says one of your own Authors) is lost; and will not be permitted by the State, which by vertue of <hi>Conge d'estires, Quare Impedits,</hi> Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp;c. have made themselves the sole and ultimate Judges, not only of all Bishops and Churches; but of their Excommunications, and every Exercise of their spiritual Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>And what Sort of <hi>Discipline</hi> is exercised in these spiritual Courts in the Bishop's Name, but meerly <hi>civil</hi> Penalties? If the excommunicate Person does not satisfy the Court in forty Days, there comes out a Writ against him, which commits him to <hi>Prison,</hi> where he must lie, till he pays the Fees of the Court; and makes such Submission as is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd him. This he cannot escape, but by a good round Sum of Money, which commonly will answer the End And how agreeable this is to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline Christ has appointed in his Church, the World must judge. But whether agreeable or not, every Minister of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to publish to his Congregation, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004237_0020_100428E0271AD958"/>
of Excommunication pronounced by these Laymen, tho' upon never so trivial Occasions. They must act by an implicit Faith; and submit to this, if never so contrary to their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Such is the boasted Government of your Episcopal Church.</p>
               <p>And it is much the same Case, with Respect to the <hi>Admission</hi> of Ministers to their <hi>special Charge.</hi> The People are not only deprived of their natural Right of chusing their Minister; but the Bishop himself, it seems, cannot refuse the Clergym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the <hi>Patron,</hi> how insufficient so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for the Charge. And even this Right of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage is often bought and sold. It's common to buy the Right of the next Presentation to a Living, for any Expectant, who will have a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Claim to it, as soon as it becomes void. He will enjoy the Benefits of it, how unqualified so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The Bishop cannot prevent it. And there are some Ministers that have the Income of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parishes, which they never take any Pastoral Care of at all. It's enough if they commit the Work to such a <hi>Curate</hi> as they can hire cheapest, while they themselves live in Splendor upon the rich Revenues; and never so much as reside in their Parish.</p>
               <p>Each Minister of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to admit to the <hi>Lord's-Supper</hi> all Officers that hold Commissions in the State, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so profane; or else he may incur great Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if sued for refusing such an one that holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.

Assertions? — We do indeed teach our People, that when our Governours command us to do</hi> lawful <hi>Things, it is our Duty to obey, and that in Obedience to God, than which Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture, and</hi> Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> xx.23. <hi>But if our Rulers command what God has forbidden, or forbid what God has commanded, we must die rather than obey them; and every Man must judge for himself, whether the Rulers Command be repugnant to God's, or not.</hi> (p. 11.)</p>

               <p>You should first have proved (what we deny) that God has given a <hi>legislative Power</hi> to your Church, in the Affairs of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi>; or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized any Men upon Earth, to make Laws and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions in Matters of his <hi>Worship,</hi> and in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Conscience and Salvation. Tho' we are bound to obey our lawful and rightful Rulers, in all those Things wherein God has given them Power to command us; yet we are not bound to obey all them that call themselves our Rulers, nor even our lawful Rulers themselves in those Things wherein God has not given them Power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us. Be pleased therefore to shew us, whence this Authority is derived; and to whom it belongs: Whether to the Rulers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> or to the Rulers of the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, or to the Rulers of the <hi>reformed</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es abroad, of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or of the Churches of this <hi>Country,</hi> or to all of these: If to <hi>all</hi> of these, how can you justify the Reformation, in Disobedience to the Rulers in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>? If to the Rulers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> only, let them produce their Commission, whereby they have this Power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of others; and we will obey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. But I think, you will allow, that if this Authority is
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004237_0031_100429008A693110"/>
given to the Rulers of <hi>any</hi> Church, it is given to the Rulers of <hi>every</hi> Church. This Claim must be every where equal And as the Authority of every Church is equal, so their Decrees must be equally binding by vertue of that Authority. The Decrees of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> must be as Obligatory upon our Consciences, as the <hi>Canons</hi> of an <hi>english Convocation.</hi>

               <p>Nor will it at all help the Case, to qualify this Assertion by limiting this imaginary Power to <hi>lawful Things.</hi> For who must be Judge in the Case, whether these Things are lawful, or not? If the <hi>Church of England</hi> may determine this Case, and we must stand to her Determination, her Power is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, and we are under an Obligation to blind O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and absolute Subjection. And if your Church is Judge whether her Injunctions are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or not, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is also Judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Injunctions are Iawful or not: And those that live under her Government, are by the same Reason bound to obey in whatever she determine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We do judge for our selves, that Christ has given Power to no Man upon Earth, to make any such Injunctions, to ordain any such Impositions, or to vex our Consciences with any such Inventions of Men. We do judge for our selves, that Christ only is King in his Church; that here we have <hi>but one Lawgiver, who is able to save or destroy,</hi> Jam. iv.12. And so by your own Confession, we are under no Obligation to Obedience in the debated Points. — If you enquire, In
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004237_0032_1004290906888BE0"/>
what then are we to <hi>obey them, who rule over us in the Lord</hi>? I answer, In their <hi>teaching us what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Christ has commanded</hi>; and in Nothing else. It's Authority enough, to represent Christ's Person in explaining his Will to us; and we are bound to obey them when they can convince us, that what they teach is agreable to his Will; and no further. That our Obedience to them must always terminate in Christ's Authority; and not in theirs. For we may <hi>call no Man Master,</hi> since <hi>one is our Master, even Christ.</hi> Mat. xxiii.8, 10.</p>
               <p>Thus I am prepared to hear you upon the main Question debated between us, Whether the Injunctions and Impositions in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are not <hi>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</hi> contrary to <hi>Mark</hi> vii.7.</p>

                  <hi>I am to prove, that the Thing reproved by our Saviour was not barely the enjoining that innocent Rite of</hi> washing Hands; <hi>but the teaching that this was a Thing necessary to avoid that</hi> Defilement, <hi>that would render them displeasing and unacceptable to God.</hi> (p. 12.)</p>

               <p>It seems, the Question between us is a very slippery Thing, that gets easily out of Hand, and indeed quite out of Sight. In my <hi>Sermon</hi> on this Text I endeavour'd to shew, that proposing and requiring as a religious Duty what God has not proposed as such nor required of us, the enjoining Terms of Communion which God has not enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the imposing any Terms of Communion by penal Sanctions, is <hi>teaching for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men</hi> In Opposition to which, you in your <hi>Vindication</hi> assert, <hi>That to teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, is no more nor less, than to teach that That is a divine Law or Ordinance, which is really but an human Appointment; When Men father

those Practices on God which have only an human O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal. — That what our blessed Saviour means by teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, is to teach that human Customs are divine Laws.</hi> p. 5, 7.</p>
               <p>In my <hi>Defence,</hi> I endeavour'd to vindicate my own Sense of this Text, and to refute yours. Your Sense of my Performance may be conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this, that you are pleased not only wholy to overlook all my Arguments; but entirely to change the Question, and to put the Debate upon a new Foot.</p>
               <p>How, I beseech you, came it the Matter for you to prove, that the Thing reproved by our Saviour was not barely enjoining that innocent Rite of washing Hands; when that which was before as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by you, and should now be defended, was, that <hi>what our blessed Saviour meant, was their bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, adding to his Law, and teaching that he has commanded what he has not commanded, or forbidden that which he has no where forbidden,</hi> p. 7 Have you now given up that Case?

               <p>Besides, you know that this is what I never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.

               <p>And how does this acquit the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the same Charge here laid against the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees? Don't they also teach, that Conformity to their Institutions is <hi>necessary to avoid that Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that would render us displeasing and unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God</hi>? And don't you your self also teach us the same Thing? What mean these hideous Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries of damning Schism, with which we are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked from every Quarter, for our Nonconformity to the Church's Institutions? Is there no Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Schism, that renders Men displeasing to God? How came we all to be excommunicated by your Canons?

                  <hi>Primarily and of it self the Law of God only obliges the Conscience; because God only has a direct Power over the Conscience; but ecclesiastical Laws in directly and by Vertue of God's Law When therefore in such Cases we obey the Commands of our Rulers, we don't so properly obey them as God.</hi> (p. 16.) <hi>When these Circumstantials are once determined by human Authority, they cease to be indifferent to Subjects, tho'

               <p>Well then, I hope we shall hear no more of these Things being indifferent, since you own that <hi>they cease to be indifferent to Subjects, when once they are determined by human Authority</hi> Are not all the contested Rites and Institutions of your Church, determined by human Authority? And therefore, whatever they were originally in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do they not by this Conclusion of yours cease to be indifferent now they are determined? I hope you won't pretend, that they are indifferent and not indifferent at the same Time. — I hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so you will no longer pretend, that you place no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in these Things, since you tell us, <hi>when in such Cases we obey the Commands of our Rulers, we don't so properly obey them as God</hi> For all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consists in Nothing else but Obedience to him.</p>
               <p>And to apply this to the present Question. If these Things, being determined by human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are become necessary to Subjects, is there no Defilement in the Neglect of necessary Duties, that will render us displeasing and unacceptable to God? If these Institutions are to be observed in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, is there no Defilement in Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, that will render us displeasing and unacceptable to him? Thus you see; that all your Pains upon this Subject might have been well spared, unless your Reasonings had been more to the Purpose.— It would be but a trifling Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Time, to take any Notice of your imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent evading the Point in Debate; and your artful changing the Question between us.</p>

               <p>You charge it as my Position, that we must not submit to the most innocent and indifferent Rite when enjoin'd by lawful Authority; and if you had added, when the lawful Authority enjoin such Rite as a Part of the Worship of God, make it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duty, or impose it upon Men's Consciences, I own it to be my Position.

And it's more than an innocent Thing, to eat Victuals when hungry: What hurt then canit be to eat well dressed Food, when one is hungry, in an <hi>Idol's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> if it be required by lawful Authority? And yet the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was so scrupulous, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it; and to call it a <hi>partaking of the Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> 1. Cor. x.21 — What say you to these Things? Do you scruple any of them? Won't you obey the Authority that requires these innocent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Rites!

And therefore you must by this Rule, be bound to observe all these Things I have newly mention'd; or at least they must all be thus bound, that live under Popish and Pagan Government.</p>
               <p>Besides, for you to say, that the Things in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between you and me are innocent and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent after they are imposed, would be a bare-faced begging the Question. The very Thing you opposed, and what you ought to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, was, that there are no human Institutions in religious Worship, no Impositions upon Men's Consciences, innocent and indifferent after their Imposition, how innocent and indifferent soever originally and of themselves. This was what I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove; and it was your Business to have answered my Arguments: but this you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted. It does not therefore make a very good Appearance, for you now to take this for granted, without any Proof.</p>
               <p>But if you were allowed this Limitation, it won't at all help your Cause. For who must be Judges, whether these religious Injunctions are innocent and indifferent, in all their Circumstances, after they are imposed? Must the Imposers judge? If so, they'll be sure to judge in their own Favour. The Papists themselves will never plead Guilty. They'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if we must judge for ourselves, there are none of 'em inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and indifferent when once they are imposed; and so we are not bound to Obedience to any of 'em, to one religious Injunction more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>Well, then it ceases to be indifferent as soon as it is commanded; for it is not indifferent whether Duty be perform'd or not. If it by this Means becomes a Duty, then there must be no Limitation to our Obedience in this Case. All Things that are indifferent in themselves, lose their Indifferency as soon as commanded. They become a Duty; and must be observed as soon as requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enjoin'd by the lawful Authority in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any where else, as well as when enjoin'd by the lawful Authority of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But how does this become a Duty? Is it by Virtue of the Authority that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it? If so, it is the Duty of all under the papal Government, to obey all their Injunctions before considered For they are all innocent and indifferent in themselves; are all commanded; and they have determin'd of 'em all, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent after their Injunction. I hope you won't pretend to that Authority in your Church, that you will allow no where else. If you pretend to found this Duty of Obedience upon God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that requires Subjection to Rulers, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so brings all the same Consequences upon you.

our Actions; and upon which they depend Now it can be no Imposition upon Men's Consciences, no Infringement of their Freedom and Liberty, to perform the Duties, which God has required of us, some Way or other; nor to determine which of those necessary Circumstances are most agreeable to the Solemnity of the Duty, or the State of our Churches. Thus much we are obliged to, by the Precept which enjoins the Duty upon us; and by the very Law of Nature, which is the Law of God. And whatever, more than this, you can find enjoin'd in our Churches, I freely give up to you. For I acknowledge that Impositions are at least as bad among us, as among you.</p>
               <p>These Things being premised, let your Instances be considered You demand why I oblige you to receive the Sacrament at Noon, in leaven'd Bread, at the Hands of a Layman? To which I answer as before, that Christ has required us to observe this Ordinance; but has not determin'd whether at Noon or at Night, whether in leaven'd or unleaven'd Bread, whether it shall be handed about, after Consecration, by the Minister or some other. And it's absolutely necessary, that in each of these Cases it be done some Way or other; and here <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is profitable to direct.</hi> But if you scruple this Method of partaking of the Ordinance; and can find a sufficient Number to join with you, I will administer it to you at Evening, in unleaven'd Bread; and carry about the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired us to acknowledge <hi>no Master but Christ,</hi> Matth. xxiii.8. as I have shewed you before.

               <p>But suppose we are <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> in these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated Points, and make wrong Inferences from Scripture and the Nature of Things; This I must acknowledge possible; for we are but fallible Men: How should we then be treated by you, if this be the Case; or which is all one, if you imagine this to be the Case? The Apostle answers this Question particularly. <hi>Take heed</hi> (says he) <hi>left by any Means, this Liberty of yours prove a Stumbling-Block to them that are weak. Through thy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge shall thy weak Brother Perish, for whom Christ dyed?

Who are thou that judgest another Man's Servant, to his own Master he standeth or falleth. For Meats destroy not the Work of God. All Things indeed are pure; but it's Evil for that Man who eateth with Offence.</hi> Rom. xiv.1, 4, 20.</p>
               <p>Nay let us further suppose, that we are in a <hi>Mistake</hi> in our consciencious Scruples of those Things, that are in themselves innocent and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, &amp; no where forbidden in Scripture: Yet This is a Mistake which we sincerely profess we cannot help.

               <p>To sum up all in a Word.

               <p>But let us consider the Case a little; and see whether this Answer ben't as unjust, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. — You your self will allow, that we are commanded to pray in the publick Worship of God, to <hi>pray with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit</hi>: that we are particularly directed as to the Manner of performing this Duty.

Whence I argue, that the Command to pray, does either require us to pray with or without imposed Forms of human Composure; or else leaves it to our Choice, to do in that Case, as we think best. If with such Forms, shew me either Precept or Example in the whole Bible to warrant it; and I submit. But if no such Thing can be found, it must be without such Forms: or else it must be left to our own Choice, to act in that Affair as we think best.

It's plain, they cannot; and therefore it's to be presumed they were not designed to be the Methods of performing this Duty; which ought to be accommodated to all the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a holy Providence towards us. To exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify this: we have lately had terrible Displays of the divine Displeasure, by fearful Sights in the Heavens, accompany'd with a terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi>: and our People are generally stupid, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate of these Prognosticks of our Lord's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.

               <p>We are taught, Rom. viii.16. <hi>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our Infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought</hi> &amp;c. But how can this be true, that we know not what we should pray for, if we pray by a Form; and are always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Matter of our Prayers? You pretend indeed, that <hi>what the Spirit helps Man to, is not the Words of Prayer; but such Groanings that cannot be uttered.</hi> But the Text assures us, that he helps in the Matter of Prayer, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it's in vain here to dispute against the Letter of the Text.</p>
               <p>In a Word, we that use conceived Prayers in God's publick Worship, have at least this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of you. We have Scripture-Patterns and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to warrant our Conduct. We have the

Examples of the whole Church under the legal Dispensation. We have the Examples of Christ himself and his Apostles. And you are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring one Example from Scripture, of one Form of human Composition, being made the Matter of constant publick Worship; or one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the Church, to compose or use, much less to impose, any Form of Prayer for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant publick Worship of God.

Let such therefore, that complain of the Indecency and want of Affection in the Use of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayers, consider where this Charge will terminate; and whether they don't equally fix this Charge upon all the holy Men of God, whose Prayers are recorded in the Bible, as upon us.</p>

               <p>We cannot think the Common <hi>Prayer-Book</hi> a good Thing as imposed upon us for our constant publick Worship, either as to its Form, which is so very confused and immethodical; or as to its Matter, which is not only very defective, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains so many Things justly exceptionable. And I think the World has seen, that it has not prov'd a very good Thing in it's Consequences; and in the sad Confusion it has occasioned in our Nation. But then we don't argue against it because the Papists have used it; but because it had no other Foundation but <hi>papal Use.</hi> We can't think very well of a Protestant Church's going to <hi>Rome</hi> to learn to pray. This can be exemplified in no Protestant Church but yours; and we see no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it should be so in yours.

nor are these numerous Repetitions at all calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to raise either our Affections or Devotion; but to take off the Edge of both, by keeping the Mind so constantly intent to the very same Thing, without any Variation.</p>
               <p>You tell us, that when you repeat the same Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition twenty Times, it's in the Conclusion of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty different Prayers. But the same Answer may with equal Justice be given to any Charge of vain Repetitions, that can possibly be imagined. It may be alledged, that they are all different Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, upon the same Grounds. The State of the Case is this: In one continued Service, the People by Way of Response must say, <hi>Good Lord deliver us,</hi> eight Times; and, <hi>We beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</hi> one and twenty Times successively, without saying any Thing else. It's true, that there are as many short Petitions offered by the Minister, to which these Responses are made; but it's also as true, that if all these Petitions were used by the Minister in one continued Prayer, and <hi>good Lord deliver us,</hi> or <hi>we beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</hi> once pronounced by the People, (if they must bear a vocal Part in your Prayers) it would be full as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; and I think, much more Devout. And what Reason can possibly be given, why they must be thus often repeated? I may add, that this same continued Service begins with eight distinct Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of these Words, <hi>Have Mercy upon us miserable Sinners,</hi> between the Minister and People, without any other Petition intervening; or any Thing else to diversify this Address, but the bare naming the glorious God in his several personal Relations. And the same Service ends with the Repetition of these Words, <hi>Have Mercy upon us,</hi> seven Times, and <hi>Hear us,</hi> four Times; tho' the former had been repeated eight Times, and the latter above twenty
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004237_0079_100429A387CBDD68"/>
Times before, in the same continued Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there is no less than Forty eight Repetitions, in one short Prayer. And to all this I may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join, that besides the several Instances of the like Kind in the Liturgy, you always use what you call the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> (tho' as observ'd before, it is a new Form of your own making) several Time in the same Service; and upon some Occasions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Very fine, then according to you it's no Matter how many</hi> Tautologies <hi>or</hi> Repetitions <hi>are used, if they are but sung.

               <speaker>D.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but won't the <hi>Repetitions</hi> in the 136th Psalm, at least as well justify the Papist's <hi>Repetitions</hi> in singing, as your so numerous <hi>Repetitions</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How can it be urged with more Propriety for you than for them? Pray, Sir, shew me the Difference. They have at least this Advantage of you, that they imitate the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in making a Song of their <hi>Repetitions,</hi> which you do not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in your Cathedral Worship As for your Charge of their crying <hi>Iesu, Iesu,</hi> an Hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is unjust; but were it true, what Reason can be given for forty eight (if not fifty four) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,</hi> in the same Service; that won't justify ever so many more?</p>
               <p>But the worst of it is, that your Instance of the 136th Psalm don't come up to your Case. For there is no Prayer at all in that Psalm. If it be allowed you, that some of the Psalms are properly Prayers; yet that Psalm is not. Nor can you find any Example of such numerous <hi>Repetitions</hi> in any Prayers in the Bible, either in the <hi>Psalter</hi> or any
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004237_0081_1004040E83BD6D90"/>
where else. So that the whole of your Argument can amount to no more than this, that because <hi>David</hi> did use many <hi>Repetitions</hi> in making a <hi>Burden</hi> to a sacred Song, which was not a Prayer; therefore you may use many more Repetitions than he did in your Prayers; and impose them upon us as necessary Terms of Communion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Essence of a</hi> Sacrament <hi>lies in this, that the visible Sign is appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a</hi> Means <hi>whereby the invisible Grace is convey'd from God to Man; and as a</hi> Pledge <hi>to assure us, that God will give it to us, upon our duly using that outward Sign But the</hi> Sign <hi>of the</hi> Cross <hi>is not pretended to be a</hi> Pledge <hi>from God to us to give us Assurance of any Thing he will do for us.</hi> (p. 55.)</p>

               <p>But if the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not only pretend, but in express Words determine, that this <hi>Sign</hi> is also a <hi>Pledge</hi> of Christ's Merits, will you then own, that she gives it the Honour of a <hi>Sacrament</hi>? Be pleased then to read your 30th <hi>Canon,</hi> in the latin Edition; and there you'll find it called <hi>Tessara et Signum meritorum Christi.</hi> A <hi>Pledge</hi> and Sign of the Merits of Christ. I think you'll own that the latin Edition of your <hi>Canons,</hi> was the first and authentick Edition.</p>
               <p>If you still object, that this does not prove that this <hi>Sign</hi> is appointed as <hi>a Means whereby the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grace is convey'd from God to Man</hi>: Let us see

whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> has not her self determin'd that Cause also. Read then the same <hi>Canon,</hi> where you'll find, that Children were sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Sign when they were christned, <hi>to dedicate them by that Badge to his Service, whose Benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon them in Baptism, the Name of the Cross did represent.</hi> I think it must be allowed, if this <hi>Sign</hi> dedicates Children to Christ, and if it be a Badge of his Service; it is as much a Means to convey Grace as Baptism it self; and by this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, as much a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution only excepted. It's true, that the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> is not a <hi>Sacrament</hi> instituted by Christ himself; nor was I so stupid as to object against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the appointing a new Sacrament insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Christ himself. But what I objected was, that they have brought in by their own Authority, and imposed upon us this Rite, without any Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, to which they ascribe the same Virtue and Properties, as to the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And for ought I can see to the contrary, I have fully justified my Objection. — I have shewn that the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi>

I do indeed make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles that Night to eat but one Supper, and your groundless Imagination of two or three Suppers, flows from a sufficient Ignorance of the Subject you are treating of. We have no Account of their eating any Supper distinct from the <hi>Passover Supper,</hi> Part of which our Lord consecrated as a Memorial of his Death, to be kept in constant Use in the chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church. "The Bread and Wine which our Saviour distributed at his last <hi>Passover,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to signify and represent his Body and Blood, were not without the Extent of the paschal Supper; but within the Compass of it, and Rites belonging to it, only applied by him now, to a new evangelical Use and Signification" That this may be set in a cleared View, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give you a few brief Hints, of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their celebrating the <hi>Passover</hi> Solemnity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Passover</hi> Table was furnished with Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of several Sorts, viz.

he taketh the bitter Herbs, and blesseth them, dips them in the Sauce or Sop before mention'd; and eats about the Quantity of an Olive, in which all the rest of the Company imitate him; and this was the Sop of which the Evangelists speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he takes the second Cup of Wine; and the rest imitate him in drinking of it. Then they cut up the paschal Lamb and eat it, with the Bread that was laid by for that Purpose, Part of which Bread our Saviour consecrated as a Memorial of his Body; not after they were rise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this third Cup after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with which they concluded that Solemnity, our Saviour applied to a New spiritual Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and thus graffed this Gospel-Festival of the Lord's Supper, upon the Jewish Passover. <note n="*" place="bottom">

long Discourse with them upon that Occasion, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down again; and then administring the Lord's Supper. For it's certain from the sacred Story, that this Ordinance was administred <hi>as they were eating,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> expresseth it; and <hi>as they did eat,</hi> according to <hi>Mark</hi>; or <hi>while they were eating,</hi> as the Original in both Places should be rendred. And there is no Account that they ever rose up at all, till the whole Solemnity was over.</p>
               <p>And if we look into the thirteenth Chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> there is no such Thing there as you pretend. Not a Word of our Saviour's sitting down to any other Supper, after washing his Disciples Feet; or any Thing that implies it: But only his sitting down as usual, in his ordinary Conversation. In the first Part of this Chapter, the Evangelist gives us the Narrative of our Lord's Conduct after that sacred Feast was ended, and they were risen up from Supper, which Narrative continues to the End of the 17 Verse. He then proceeds without any Connection with what went before, to give us another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Now this <hi>Prolepsis</hi> or Anticipation being allowed, there is a good Agreement between St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and the other Evangelists: But according to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of it, there is a plain and palpable Contradiction, which must by no Means be suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Your Mistake is founded upon the Supposition of an immediate Connection between the 17th and 18th Verses of this Chapter. But be pleased to

read them, and see if they are at all united. <hi>If ye know these Things, happy are ye if ye do them, I speak not of you all, I know whom I have chosen &amp;c.</hi> Did not Christ speak of all his Disciples, that they would be happy, if they did those Things that he had commanded them? — Could this be the Meaning of these Verses? No, certainly it could not. Whence it's evident, that since the <hi>Sense</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be connected, the <hi>Verses</hi> ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected; and therefore, that all your Reasoning from this Supposition comes to Nothing.</p>
               <p>In a Word, certain it is that our Lord with his Disciples did sit down at the <hi>Passover</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued sitting at that Solemnity. How else did <hi>Iohn</hi> lean on <hi>Iesus</hi>'s Bosom? It is also certain that while they were eating the <hi>Passover,</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did consecrate the Elements in the <hi>Lord's-Supper</hi>; and that he did rise from the Table after Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is not the least Insinuation in all the Evangelist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A wonderful Assertion! An adoring Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon our Knees, is more like sitting at Table a little leaning, than sitting upright at Table, is like it. Was Kneeling ever used as a Table-Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or ever proposed in Scripture as a proper Posture at any eucharistical Feast? Whereas on the contrary, sitting at Table in such Feasts is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by God himself, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xvi.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xliv.3. And exemplified in the Case before us by our blessed Lord. And is not this sufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for our Conduct?</p>
               <p>To sum up this Debate; <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was brought in by the <hi>Papists,</hi> by Way of <hi>Adoration</hi> to the Elements, which they suppose <hi>transubstantiated</hi> into the very Body and Blood of Christ: and as used by them, is a most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to be abhorred by all good Men.

               <p>I said no such Thing; but you are forced thus to turn my Words, to make 'em suit your Purpose. I did say, and do still say, <hi>How came the Sureties to be the Child's Proxies without his Leave,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and promise in his Name what he gave them no Power or Authority to promise for him? For tho' the <hi>Parent</hi> hath in himself a natural Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and is obliged by the Command of Christ, to dedicate his Child to God in Baptism: Yet the <hi>Child</hi> has not given, nor is capable of giving Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to any Man, <hi>in his Name,</hi> to declare what his <hi>Faith</hi> is, what his <hi>Desires, Purposes,</hi> and <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are. This yet appears to me an Affair most ludicrous and trifling.</p>
               <p>I think, on a Review of the Case, you'll find that you have gain'd Nothing by forcing me upon a distinct Consideration of this Plea of yours; for it nothing at all affects what I had before urged in this Case: I did justly complain, that the Sureties promise what it's God's Prerogative to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. For tho' they do speak in the Name of the Child, yet the Church does understand it as their own Vow on the Behalf of the Child, and expresly
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:004237_0103_100429F6C74B5710"/>
declares in the Catechism, that THEY PROMISE and VOW three Things in it's Name, That it SHOULD renounce the Devil and all his Works, That it SHOULD believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith, That it SHOULD keep God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Will and Commandments <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Case must be thus understood; or else (which is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation worth your minding) there is no Promise at all for the Child's religious <hi>Education,</hi> either by Parents or Sureties. The Sureties are obliged to this; or they are obliged to Nothing at all, on the Child's Behalf. This is their Covenant; or they are under no Covenant on Behalf of the Child: and consequently the Child has no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Right at all, either from its Parents or Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and therefore no Claim at all to the Seal of the Covenant. Answer this consistently, if you can. It yet therefore appears, that what the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties promise, is beyond human Power to perform: And their speaking impertinently in the Name of the Child, will never give them Ability to do it.</p>

my <hi>Defence,</hi> as it does in your <hi>Vindication</hi>; but the Clause it belongs to is very exactly cited.

Such a consecrating stated periodical Returns of Time to special Services, is what I mean't, and what the Scripture always means, by making Time ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus under the levitical Dispensation, their Sabbaths were holy, their New-Moons, their stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Feasts and Fasts were holy, only on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Consecration of a stated Return of Time for these holy Services. Upon the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count also, the Church of <hi>England</hi> calls her Feasts and Fasts <hi>holy Days</hi>; because of their Designation in an annual Return, to the peculiar Purposes for which they are appointed. It's remarkable, that

All the Story in your Books, of Christ's coming many Miles to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate this Feast, and the like, is meerly your own Imagination.

It is not easily understood, why the Evangelist there mentions it's being Winter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to insinuate the Reason of Christ's walking there. Accordingly Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> so understands this Text. <hi>He walked there because it was Winter, that he might get and keep himself warm.</hi>

               <p>I have taken some Pains to inquire into this Case; and have the following Account of the Matter of Fact, from a Gentleman whose Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Capacity I can depend upon.
<q>Whatever certainly Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> may pretend to in this Case, he is manifestly under a great Mistake. For tho' it be allowed, that there were in <hi>New-England</hi> two or three Lay-Ordinations (and more I never heard of) yet they don't at all affect the present Ministry, in that it can't (I think) be proved, that any now in the Ministry, derived their <hi>Commissions</hi> (as he expresses it) from such, and only such, as were so ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As to himself, he was ordained by Mr. <hi>Shove,</hi> and others of equal Authority; Mr. <hi>Shove</hi> was ordained by Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> and others; Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> by Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and others; Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> by Mr. <hi>Warham</hi> and others; and Mr. <hi>Warham</hi> was episcopally ordained in <hi>England.</hi> Besides there's no Doubt but that a Succession might be found for Mr. <hi>Beach,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Blackman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Denton,</hi> who were both settled in <hi>New-haven</hi> Colony, and both before their coming to <hi>America</hi> legal Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> the one at <hi>Hallifa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Surprizing! For that Gentleman gives me this further Account.
<q>I have been well inform'd, that Mr <hi>Beach,</hi> since he embraced the episcopal Persuasion, has solemnly declared in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of sundry Ministers, who he designed should
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:004237_0127_10042A30E4C63328"/>
be Witnesses for him, and who took a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of that Declaration in his Presence, which was approv'd by himself, That <hi>he did firmly believe, that the Ministers of our Persuasion in</hi> New-England <hi>are true Ministers of Iesus Christ, and will be accepted of him accordingly.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is well known to have been on the Side of Nonconformity, both by his Writings and Practice. He has written largely against many of these very Things, that I am impleading. And with what Justice you so often drag him into your Service, I cannot judge, without a Sight of the Books you refer to. Indeed I place but little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon any Man's Authority in a Case of this Kind: and Dr. <hi>Rule</hi> observes,
"For Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Authority, we lay little Weight on it; he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>How often must you be told, that <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Singing</hi> are two very different Parts of publick Worship, to be perform'd for different Purposes, and in a different Manner, that there is no just arguing from the one to the other? <hi>Singing</hi> does from it's very Nature imply an audible lifting up the Voice; and they that do not <hi>sing</hi> with an audible Voice, don't sing at all. Whereas <hi>Praying</hi> does not absolutely imply any more, than the lifting our Hearts and Desires to God; and may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd acceptably without any Voice at all. And the whole Congregation may unite in <hi>Prayer,</hi> when there is but one Voice heard; but none of the Congregation can join in <hi>Singing,</hi> without united Voices as well as Affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which I may

add, that publick <hi>Singing</hi> is every where exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Scripture as being perform'd with the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Voices of the Congregation; but we have not one Example of publick <hi>Prayer</hi> thus performed.

               <p>The second of these Texts, as it is rendred in our Translation, does indeed seem to favour your Cause. But if the Original be viewed, it will be found to be as impertinently urged as the other was. In the Original it is, <hi>They lifted up a Voice to

God with one Heart.</hi> The Relative (<hi>Their</hi>) which gives the wrong Turn to our Thoughts, is not found in the Greek Text; nor has it any Claim to stand in the English, but from the Authority of the <hi>Translators</hi> All that can be prov'd from this Text is, that they were heartily united in their Address to God: but there is not a Word of their using united Voices in their making that Address; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of there being more than one Voice used in it. Much less is there any Thing of <hi>ALL lifting up their Voices,</hi> as you are pleased to represent it, very different both from the Original and our Translation. — Upon the whole, I even chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you to find any Thing in Scripture, like your <hi>Responses</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> or any such unintelligible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of praying to God as is found among you, when you all lift up your Voices together.</p>
