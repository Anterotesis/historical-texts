            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN HISTORICAL NARRATIVE, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT came to paſs in the Year 1740-41 that the Work of God, called the GREAT REFORMATION, took Place in New England, and ſome of the Southern Colonies (now States) with ſurprizing Power and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity: Vaſt Numbers of People in a few Months Time were awakened out of Security. Ignorance and Formality, as to Matters of Religion, to ſeek ſpiritual Knowledge, and to obtain an Intereſt in Chriſt. This Concern ſoon became general, and very preſſing on the Minds of Multitudes, and became the great Topic of Converſation and Enquiry.</p>
            <p>THE Diverſions and Vanities of People were in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral laid aſide, ſuch as Tavern-haunting, Gaming, Dancing, Horſe-racing, Chambering and Wantonneſs, with all foppiſh Parade of extravagant Dreſs, and gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, wanton Appearance, were forſook; and People in general, in a plain, modeſt Habit, devoted themſelves to attend all public Meetings, where it was expected that thoſe who were called powerful Preachers would perform divine Service: So that going Five or Six Miles on Foot to ſuch Meetings was thought feaſible. Private Meetings alſo, for Prayer, ſinging Pſalms, and Spiritual Songs, and for Exhortation, and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were frequently attended by Crouds of People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:017115_0003_0FA02EEEF021EE10"/>
THE chief Inſtruments in leading on this Work, were Meſſrs. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> the <hi>Tenants, Belamy, Pomroy, Wheelock, Edwards, Buill, Croſwell, Jewit, Lord, Davinport, Finly, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE, with great Numbers more, went through all Parts of our Land, preaching the glad Tidings of the Goſpel; and where they were not received into Meeting Houſes, they preached in the Fields. They preached as Meſſengers ſent from God, that felt, and believed the Importance of their Meſſage to our ſinful, periſhing World.</p>
            <p>SUBORDINATE Means were various, beſides Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bible, and other good Books, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attended to; Exhortation by Miniſters, and private Brethren was much practiſed. Solemn and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Prayers were going up publicly, and privately: Elevated and devout ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns, not only in public, but in private Houſes; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when Numbers were travelling on the Road; the Converſation People had one with another, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into each others Knowledge, Experience and Chriſtian Hope: Together with the Freedom and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, with which they communicated their Opinion, and Judgment, concerning themſelves, and thoſe they converſed with, had a powerful Tendency to awaken, convince, inſtruct, or comfort one another.</p>
            <p>THE Cries and Lamentations which ſome, and not a few, were making, being pricked in the Heart, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and awakened Beholders; and alſo the Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Praiſe to God, which ſome that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017115_0003_0FA02EEEF021EE10"/>Comfort; their Raptures of Joy and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Love of God, and the exceeding Riches of his Grace towards Sinners; their Hope in Him, and their earneſt Longings, that others ſhould <hi>"taſte and ſee how Good the Lord is;"</hi> was greatly alarming to others. Only the ſight of the Multitude flocking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to hear the Word preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſolemn Countenance, the Tears, the Sighs, the earneſt Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome, the grave and joyful Countenances of others, indicating their Complacency, and Delight in the Worſhip, and Work of God; was enough to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on the Minds of Beholders ſome Idea of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Judgment Day.</p>
            <p>IN the Space of Two or Three Years, it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that Thirty or Forty Thouſand were converted in New England.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, the Work met with Oppoſition; and the Oppoſers were proportionably Zealous, in their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to the Zeal with which its Friends endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to promote and carry it on.—The Controverſy was managed by all Orders of Men; every public Board, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, were racking their Invention to find out Ways and Means to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs and hinder the Work's going on; at leaſt to check the Diſorder, as they call it.</p>
            <p>WHILST the major Part were deviſing, and uſing ſevere Meaſures, the minor Part, being friendly to the Work, were uſing their Influence to pacify the Oppoſition; and to obtain Liberty of Conſcience, and the Right of private Judgment, in Matters of Religion, but with little Succeſs.</p>

WITH Reſpect to the Work itſelf, and the Errors that attended it, both among its Friends and Foes, we refer the Reader to Preſident <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Book, in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Work of God in thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>HAVING hinted what Manner of Times the Great Reformation produced: We now proceed to point out the Conſtitution and Practice of the eſtabliſhed Churches, of the Colony (now State) of Connecticut, as they were in thoſe Days.</p>
            <p>THEIR Heads of Agreement, and Articles for the Adminiſtration of Church Diſcipline, may be ſeen in their printed Platform, agreed upon by the Elders, and Meſſengers of the Churches, met by Delegation, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aybrook, September 9, 1708: Which Platform was preſented to the General Aſſembly of ſaid State; and by them approved and eſtabliſhed by Law. And to make it a practicable Syſtem, the General Aſſembly divided the whole Colony (now State) into eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bodies, according to the Diſtricts of the Towns, or Societies; and Enacted, That ſuch eccleſiaſtical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, qualifying themſelves according to Law, were empowered to manage and controul the Choice of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Miniſters, and the Supporting of them; and the Building of Meeting Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Church's Liberty of Conſcience, or Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Divine Service, but left them bound by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws.</p>
            <p>THE Churches were inſeperably connected with the World, in this Conſtitution, under a Prohibition of having any other Meeting, or Miniſters in ſaid Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but ſuch as were expreſsly allowed by Law. See old Law Book, Page 153—154.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017115_0004_0FA02EEFA6AF9850"/>
THE Churches in general had tamely ſubmitted to this Conſtitution; and had generally fallen into the Practice of admitting their Members, without requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a credible Profeſſion of their Faith, whereby they might be looked upon, in a Judgment of Charity, to be viſible Saints.
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See the printed Letter of the Aſſociation of Windham County, Page</hi> 23. <hi>"It is the Will of Chriſt, that all who make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, credible Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſhould be admitted into the Church, though unconverted:—That they may be under proper Ordinances for their Converſion."</hi>
               </note> To which was added, a Cuſtom of admitting Perſons to own a Covenant, and become half way Members (without any Profeſſion of gracious Sincerity) that they and their Children might be baptiſed.</p>
            <p>IN this Situation the Churches in general carried on all Parts of external Worſhip, Order, and Ordinances, according to Law, and Cuſtom aforeſaid: Whilſt at the ſame Time the Government of the Churches in all Matters of Diſcipline (that were not by civil Law put into the Hands of the ſaid Societies) were managed by the conſociated Miniſters, in the Manner preſcribed in the aforeſaid Saybrook Regulation, authoriſed by civil Law:—So that the Churches of Chriſt, as ſuch, had no Place, Liberty, or Prerogative left.—And if the Churches had not been included in the Societies afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, one would have thought, that the Church of Chriſt had been conſidered as not of the World, but left at Liberty to worſhip, and ſerve God, according to the Chriſtian Law.—This was the general State of the Churches when the Great Reformation began.</p>

WHEN ſome Miniſters began, not only to be very zealous in their Preaching; but to travel from Place to Place, preaching the Word with Power, and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes flocking to hear them; which together with the Effects their Preaching had on the People, ſoon alarmed the Attention of ſome, and the Envy of others; and became an Object of great Speculation, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, as hath been deſcribed.</p>
            <p>IN thoſe Times the General Aſſembly of this State, made Laws to reſtrict, and reſtrain the Liberties uſed by Miniſters, and People, in Matters of Religion.— To prevent Pariſh Miniſters preaching out of their own Pariſhes, it was Enacted, That if any Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhould preach in another Pariſh, without firſt obtaining Liberty of the Miniſter, and Two-Thirds of the Pariſh, he ſhould be liable to looſe his Salary for Two Years.</p>
            <p>To prevent Miniſters from other States travelling and Preaching in this, it was Enacted, That they ſhould be taken up as Vagabonds, and tranſported out of the State.

                  <hi>In Conſequence of this Act, Mr. Finly, afterwards Preſident of Jerſey College, was taken up near New Haven, and tranſported; but returned, and was taken up a ſecond Time, together with Mr. Davenport, and baniſhed by Water to New York.</hi>

            <p>THE Aſſociations of the Counties, at leaſt ſome of them, were making Reſolves, that no Diſcentions, or Seperations from the eſtabliſhed Order, as deſcribed by the Laws of the State, and the Aſſociations, ſhould be allowed or tolerated. In this they acted conſiſtent with their Conſtitution. See old Law Book, Page 29.

            <p>THE Aſſociations remonſtrated againſt thoſe, that emerged out of the Labyrinth, of the declined, and adulterated State of Religion among us; and were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meaſures to obtain Reformation, and to reſtore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Purity, pleading Liberty of Conſcience, and the Right of private Judgment, in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>THE reforming Miniſters, and Churches, were treated as departing from the Faith, and Order of the Goſpel: As corrupting the Word, and perverting the Truth, and turning the World up ſide down; and therefore rendered themſelves unfit for Communion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, or Toleration.</p>

            <head>Some OBSERVATIONS on the SEPARATION; and the SEPARATE, or STRICT CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES.</head>
            <p>THE Conſtitution, and Practice of the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, being as has been deſcribed; Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in various Parts of this State, did diſcent, and ſeperate themſelves from the Communion of the ſaid ſtanding Churches, and gathered themſelves into Churches, to carry on the Worſhip of God, and Church Diſcipline, according as they underſtood the Word of God: Acknowledging no other but God alone, to have Right to preſcribe Rules for Divine Worſhip; or ordering the Diſcipline of his Church.</p>
            <p>We according to our Judgment, looked upon the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution of this State, and the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, to be a great Departure from the Order of the Apoſtolick Churches, as well as from the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of our Fore Father's in this Land. And although they were called, and importuned to take ſome Step for Reformation, they refuſed, and juſtified themſelves in their Conſtitution, and Practice. Here we judged it neceſſary, and become our Duty to withdraw from their Fellowſhip, and Communion; ſo far as they had departed from the Rule of God's Word.</p>

THE Church in Canterbury, that had been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational-Church from its firſt beginning, after a long and tedious Labour, in oppoſing the Society, with a minor Part of the Church, from ſettling Mr. Cogſwell among them; withdrew from the Socities Meeting-Houſe, and ſet up the Worſhip of God in a private Houſe. This was ſome time in the Year 1744. And on the 9th of October, 1745, a new Seperate, or Strict Congregational Church, was gathered in Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, in the County of Windham, conſiſting of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers collected from ſeveral adjacent Towns. The Manner, in which they formed themſelves into a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, was this; they gave a verbal Relation to each other, of their Experience, of a Work of Grace upon their Souls, to the Satisfaction of each other; a ſpecial Reſpect being had to the Fruits of Grace, that diſcover themſelves in the Lives and Converſation of ſuch as are truly godly, or gracious Perſons: And alſo ſubſcribed to Articles of Faith, and Practice, and in Church Covenant, that had been previouſly drawn up, and in their Opinion, agreeable to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Church was thus gathered, and covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, they proceeded to the Choice of Mr. Thomas Marſh for their Paſtor; who had ſuſtained the Office of a Deacon, for many Years, in the Church in the Second Society, in Windham: And appointed his Ordination to be on June 6th, 1746. But Mr. Marſh was ſeized by an Officer, the Day before he was to have been ordained, for Preaching the Goſpel ſome Time before, without Licence from the eſtabliſhed Miniſters of the Conſtitution, and confined in Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017115_0007_0FA02EF275220D00"/>Gaol, where he was confined in Priſon, until the Sitting of the County Court in June following. The Church, therefore, by the Advice of Mr. Marſh, choſe, and <hi>ordained</hi> Mr. <hi>John Hovey,</hi> to be their Paſtor, or teaching Elder, in the Month of February, 1746; a Man of approved Abilities among them. This was the <hi>firſt Ordination,</hi> among the Strict Congregational Churches,—and was performed in the following Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, viz. The Church choſe Three Brethren, out of their own Number:
<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Note,—One of the Three, Mr. Thomas Deniſon, had been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couced, and recommended by ſome of the ſtanding Miniſters, as a man qualified to preach the Goſpel: Had alſo been ordained Paſtor of a Baptiſt Church in Aſhford, by the Rev.

            <p>THUS the Cauſe of our Separation, and the Manner how it firſt began, may be ſeen. But before we paſs on we would here take Notice of ſome Errors, and Miſtakes, that attended our firſt Separation.</p>
            <p>OUR firſt withdraw from the eſtabliſhed Churches, was much like Iſrael's coming out of Egypt, a mixed Multitude came out alſo; and ſerved to anſwer the ſame Purpoſe, i. e. to be a Trouble and Vexation to us, and to bring a Reproach and Scandal upon the Work of God.—There was much raſh and party Zeal that appeared in many, which occaſioned ſharp and unchriſtian Contentions; whereby the Cauſe of Truth and Meekneſs ſuffered greatly. We lament the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017115_0007_0FA02EF275220D00"/>in Doctrine, and Practice, that marked our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in many Inſtances, while we were aiming, (in our infant State) to know and walk in the right Way of the Lord. Many that appeared forward in the Seperation fell into notorious, ſcandalous Sins:— Others there were that ran into Errors and Extremes, in Matters of Religion; holding to an abſolute Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Brethren, upon an inviſible Evidence, as they called it.—Others there were that made <hi>Faith, Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Good Feeling</hi> in Religion, their Rule of Duty, and did not pay that Honor to the revealed Will of God, in his Word, as they ought to have done.— Some there were that held that Church Diſcipline might be proceeded in without viſible Evidence to prove Facts alledged.—Some held that Miniſters ought to have no previous Study before Preaching; but that they ought to have their Sermons immediately from God.—Others there were that ſeemed to ſtrike at the Foundation of civil Government, to overthrow it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; and were for deſtroying human Learning, and even human Reaſon itſelf, as uſeleſs in Religion; and were for introducing unqualified Perſons into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, upon the Belief, that their Qualifications were in Heaven, and would be ſent down when they needed them.</p>
            <p>WE have ſeen the Miſchiefs that have taken Place among the Churches of our Profeſſion and Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; where they have thought their Knowledge, and Diſcernment of ſpiritual Things, was great, and infallible, being the Dictates of the Spirit of God, by Impulſes or Suggeſtions (whether by a Medium or not) which is a Kind of Evidence, or Knowledge, too
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017115_0008_0FA02EF2AE5E25D0"/>Spiritual and certain, to be ſubject to moral Evidence, Reaſon, or Scripture.

                  <hi>We are ſenſible that Retractions of this Nature are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the Path is attended with Danger.—Mankind are ſo apt, from one Extream to haſten into another. However, it is made our Duty to confeſs our Faults one to another.

THE Preaching and Printing concerning the Nature of Chriſt's Church and Kingdom; that it is not of this World, and that civil Magiſtracy hath no Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the Church of Chriſt as ſuch; together with what has taken Place, by Means of the National Diſputes, about the natural and civil Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of Mankind; hath ſo convinced the Minds and Conſciences of People in general, that civil Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion, and coercive Meaſures can be no Advantage to the Building of Chriſt's Kingdom, but the contrary.—The Effects and Conſequences of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and Force to compel to Uniformity, upon the Plan of the eſtabliſhed Conſtitution, abundently ſhews thoſe Meaſures to be utterly inconſiſtent with that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and brotherly Love which is abſolutely Neceſſary to the Being of Chriſt's Church.</p>
            <p>UPON Trial it hath been found that where Miniſters have been ſettled by the Power of the eſtabliſhed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, in many Inſtances it hath occaſioned warm Debates, Diviſions, and Seperations unavoidably.— And where the Settlement, and Salary of Societies Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have been deſtrained by Law, it hath occaſioned great and grevious Complaints of Injuſtice, of Cruelty, and Oppreſſion: And the Miniſters have been reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Hirelings, and unmerciful: And hence all Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and brotherly Love is no more.—And where People have been fined, and impriſoned, for not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or attending upon the Preaching of the Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, on the Sabbath; or attending a religious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Seperate Aſſembly; or Miniſters for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to worſhipping Aſſemblies, without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, according to the eſtabliſhed Conſtitution,

            <p>THOSE Debates and Labours aboveſaid, have plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Societies and Churches into ſuch Diviſions and Confuſion, with Regard to exerciſing the Power of the Eſtabliſhment, as rendered it utterly impracticable. The Body of the People being convinced that it was inconſiſtent with Righteouſneſs and Peace, civil or religious; have refuſed to carry it into Execution; which has providentially opened a way for Reformation: The Churches being diſunited with the World, are at Liberty to manage the Affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom, according to his Law. A goodly Number of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have not only renounced and turned away from following the Laws of the Conſtitution; but the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Churches alſo;

                  <hi>The traditional Cuſtom of admitting Church Members, without requiring a credible Profaſſion of their Faith, is laid aſide; and they practice according to Mr. Edwards, and others, who maintain</hi> viſible Saintſhip, <hi>neceſſary for Communion; neither do they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Perſons to be only half way Members, nor baptize any but viſible Believers, and their Houſholds.</hi>

            <p>THUS we have given a brief hiſtorical Relation of Events, of a religious Nature, that have taken place in the State of Connecticut, in particular, as well as thoſe that have been of a more general Nature, abroad
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017115_0009_0FA02EF3A9FB6FC0"/>in our Land. And here we would take Occaſion, to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> our Sentiment in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Things, wherein we have been wrongfully repreſented, to our great Injury. And</p>
            <p>FIRST. It hath been generally received among Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that we have embraced ſome new Opinions, both with Reſpect to Faith and Practice. But that the World of Mankind may be undeceived in this Affair, we ſay, that notwithſtanding, there hath been many Errors, among thoſe that have been called Seperates, as hath been before related; yet as Churches, we have ever acknowledged Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith; and Cambridge Platform of Church Diſcipline, as to the Subſtance of them (ſome few Things excepted) to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Syſtems of Faith, and Practice, as in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may appear. Yet after all, we hold no Creeds, or Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Faith, to be binding upon us, any farther than they agree with the Word of God, contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtaments.</p>
            <p>SECOND. We have been repreſented, as holding to an abſolute Knowledge of the Brethren; and that we admit none into our Churches, but ſuch as we know to be real Saints. Therefore we ſay, notwithſtanding there has been Perſons of our Profeſſion, that have held to abſolute Knowledge of the Brethren, as hath been related: Yet as Churches we are ſo far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to know the good Eſtate of one another's Souls <hi>abſolutely,</hi> that we do not ſuppoſe it even Neceſſary, in the Admiſſion of Members to our Communion, that we muſt certainly know, that they are truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or gracious Perſons. Yet it hath ever been our Opinion, that unconverted, or unregenerate Perſons,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017115_0010_0FA02EF44A927B60"/>have no Right to Memberſhip in the Church of Chriſt ſo as to be admitted to the ſpecial Ordinances of the Goſpel. That for a Perſon to feel in himſelf, a Right before God, to Memberſhip in his viſible Church, it is neceſſary, that he be well ſatisfied in his own Mind, that his Heart is diſpoſed to <hi>Love, Fear,</hi> and <hi>ſerve God.</hi> That upon the beſt Evidence, or Judgment he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of himſelf, he hath been made a Partaker of this <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that the Word of God holds forth as Neceſſary to Salvation. That theſe Things are what he is to make Profeſſion, or Confeſſion of, before the Church; as well as a general Belief of the Goſpel, and a Subjection to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>NOW in order for a Church to receive a Perſon into Memberſhip, it is Neceſſary, that they be well ſatisfied of the Truth and Reality of what he profeſſes to have; and the moſt proper Means to be attended to, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain a Satisfaction, is to examine the Perſon, into his Knowledge of his loſt and undone Eſtate by Nature; and of the Way of Salvation through a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and of the Exerciſes of his Heart towards God: And alſo to conſider and view the Life, and Converſation of the Perſon in the World. In which Things, if the Church be ſatisfied, they have good Right to extend their Charity to ſuch an One, as a real Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, without pretending to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Knowledge, of the good Eſtate of his Soul.</p>
            <p>THIRD. It hath been generally received, that we hold, that every Brother in the Church, hath a Right to <hi>preach, pray,</hi> and <hi>exhort</hi> publickly in the Church.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017115_0010_0FA02EF44A927B60"/>Now to ſet this Affair in a true Light, we ſay, that we believe it to be the Duty of all profeſſing Chriſtians, to let their Light ſhine in the World, ſo that their Life, and Converſation, might be one continued Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others: But that every Brother hath a Right to ſet up to be a Publick Teacher, or Exhorter in the Church, we deny. It is our Opinion, that all thoſe Brethren in a Church, that have Gifts given them, that are for the Edification of the Church, ought to be improved in the Church, in their proper Place; and to be ſubject to the Government and Direction of the Church. And in order that a Church may know the Gifts they have amongſt them, it is neceſſary that there be an open Door for the Proof, and Trial of thoſe Gifts that they have; and when the Church has made Proof and Trial of the Gifts, and Abilities of any one Brother, and find them to be for the Edification of the Church; then the Church ought to approve of them, by giving them their Fellowſhip, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to improve their Giſts among them, and to recommend them to the Acceptance of others. —And this we apprehend is a ſufficient Licence, for any Man to preach, as a Candidate for the Goſpel Miniſtry. And as to our Opinion of the Ordination of Church Officers, ſee our Heads of Agreement.</p>
            <p>FOURTH. We have been traduced, as being a Sect of Profeſſors, that ſay to all other Denominations of Chriſtian Profeſſors, <hi>ſtand by yourſelves, for we are more Holy than you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE, to ſet this Matter in a true Light, we ſay, that in order for Communion among Churches,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017115_0011_0FA02EF4E142A9E8"/>as Churches of Chriſt, it is neceſſary, that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſo communing, ought to make the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; without which no Body, or Society of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, can properly be ſaid to be a viſible Church of Chriſt. That the Chriſtian Profeſſion principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, <hi>in a profeſſed Heart Subjection to Jeſus Chriſt, as their rightful Lord and Sovereign, to be ruled, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Law preſcribed in his Word.</hi> Now we conclude, that a Profeſſion of Heart Subjection to Jeſus Chriſt, and his Law, includes in it, a Profeſſion of being Friends to Jeſus Chriſt; and a Profeſſion of being Friends to Jeſus Chriſt, includes in it a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being <hi>regenerated or born again.</hi> Therefore all ſuch as call themſelves Churches of Chriſt, and do not make the above Profeſſion, cannot properly be ſaid to be viſible Churches of Chriſt. Neither is it poſſible in the Nature of Things, to make a Perſon, a viſible Member of a viſible Church of Chriſt, ſo long as he, or ſhe, profeſs themſelves to be in a State of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy. Therefore, we ſuppoſe, that we have no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Warrant, to hold Communion in ſpecial Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with ſuch Churches, as profeſs that Faith, and Repentance, are not abſolutely neceſſary to qualify Perſons for Memberſhip in Chriſt's Church; and a Profeſſion of the ſame neceſſary, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted, as Members in his viſible Church.</p>
            <p>BUT as their is a Number of Churches in this State, that we have before mentioned, that are called Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches, that are diſintangled from the Law eſtabliſhed Conſtitution; and make the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as above ſaid, and practice accordingly; with all ſuch Churches we could freely hold Communion,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017115_0011_0FA02EF4E142A9E8"/>although they may differ from us in ſome Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Church Diſcipline, that are of a leſſer Moment. And as there has been of late, a Pamphlet, publiſhed by the Preſbytery of <hi>Morris County,</hi> intitled "A View of a Chriſtian Church, and Church Government." We take this Method to declare our Approbation of ſaid Book, in all thoſe Things that are eſſential to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a viſible Church; though there are ſome Things in ſaid Book, reſpecting Church Government, that are of a ſubordinate Nature, that we are not ſo well agreed in; yet we ſee no juſt Cauſe, why we could not freely hold Communion, with Churches formed on ſuch a Plan, as is therein deſcribed.</p>
            <p>AND as to our Baptiſt Brethren, we are free to hold occaſional Communion, with ſuch as are regular Churches, and make the Chriſtian Profeſſion as above ſaid; and acknowledge us to be Baptiſed Churches, and own the Morality of the Ten Commands of the Decalogue.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="description_of_motives">
            <head>Our MOTIVES for publiſhing the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going HISTORICAL NARRATIVE, And DECLARATION, are as follow, viz.</head>
            <p>THE Overtures, Alterations, and Reformations, that have taken Place in the Churches, ſince the Great Reformation, and of our Seperation, with reſpect to Exertions to ſupport, and maintain the Eſtabliſhed Conſtitution, are ſuch, that the <hi>young</hi> and <hi>riſing Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> could form no juſt Idea of the Reaſons we had,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017115_0012_0FA02EF5AB153490"/>for our diſſenting from the Eſtabliſhed Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſuch Means of Knowledge; nor what Series of Events, hath brought ſo many of the Miniſters, and Churches, from ſo wide a Breach, to be ſo unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and agreed, both in Doctrine and Practice, as they now appear to be. It may be juſtly ſaid, it is the Lord's Doings, and it is marvelous in our Eyes; how the Lord hath wrought to make Breaches in the ſtrong Holds of Tradition, formed by Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical Powers, joining to eſtabliſhed Uniformity in Religion, and to eſtabliſh it by Power. And on the other Hand, how he hath defeated the Wiles of the Devil, who came forth as an Angel of Light, declaring for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Spirituality, caſting out a Flood of Deluſions, and damnable Hereſies, by which many have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and the Way of Truth, evil ſpoken of, and the honeſt Inquirer at a loſs to know what to think, or which Way to walk.</p>
            <p>MANY of us yet alive, having been Eye Witneſſes of theſe Things, have thought it our Duty to declare them, for the Glory of God, for the Comfort and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of the Church; and for the Inſtruction, and Improvement of the preſent and riſing Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>WE offer in Vindication of our Conduct, in ſeperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Eſtabliſhed Churches, as followeth, viz. The Grounds of our having Scruples of Conſcience, to continue in their Fellowſhip, and Communion, hath been already declared, in the Deſcription given of the Conſtitution, and Practice of the Eſtabliſhed Churches in thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:017115_0012_0FA02EF5AB153490"/>
FOR any One to withdraw, from the Communion of a Church he had covenanted with, when there was no ſufficient Grounds for Scruples of Conſcience in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing:—Or to ſeparate abruptly, without uſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means to have his Scruples removed, or Cauſes of Grief redreſſed:—Or from a contentious, ſchiſmatical Spirit, would be ſinful and diſorderly Walking.</p>
            <p>BUT when there are juſt Cauſes for Scruples; and due Pains have been taken to remove them; and it cannot be obtained, withdrawing becomes prudent, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for Two Reaſons:—<hi>Firſt,</hi> By continuing he muſt give Fellowſhip to an Act of Worſhip, which in his own View is contrary to the Will of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his Conſcience be defiled:—<hi>Second,</hi> It would be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neglect of ſerving God, in the Manner he in his own Conſcience believes he ought to do.</p>
            <p>FOR a more full Explication, and to ſhow that our Separation was not a new and unjuſtifiable Proceedure, we would refer the Reader to the Preface of Cambridge Platform:—The whole Spirit and Argument of which juſtifies our Conduct. They, under a Fifth Particular <hi>cite</hi> a Paſſage from Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in his 4th Book, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Chap. 14, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 16.—"If any Man (ſaith he) wronged with unjuſt Vexation, or providing for his own Edification, or in Teſtimony againſt Sin, depart from a Church where ſome Evils are tolerated, and join himſelf to another more Pure, yet without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Church he leaveth; he is not therefore to be held as a Schiſmatick, or as guilty of any other Sin." The Preface explains him, and ſays, "When either through wearineſs of unjuſt Vexation, or in Way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017115_0013_0FA02EF667AAB190"/>for his own Edification, or in Teſtimony againſt Sin, he joineth himſelf to another Congregation more reformed: Any one of theſe he judgeth a lawful Cauſe of Departure, though all of them do not concur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether," <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to our publiſhing Heads of Agreement, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prerogatives, and Diſcipline of Chriſt's Church; we look upon it both Uſeful and Neceſſary, in order to the Fellowſhip of Churches, that they may exerciſe Charity, and Acts of Fellowſhip, one towards another, as Occaſion may ſerve, with better Judgment, Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Comfort. It alſo may be uſeful to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, for their greater Agreement in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding uniform and harmonious Proceedings, with reſpect to Order, Ordinances, Worſhip, and Diſcipline in the Church. Notwithſtanding it can make nothing right, or binding, but what is made ſo by the Word of God. Hence it can Amount to no more, and is only an Expreſſion of our Judgment of the Rule of God's Word.</p>
            <p>OUR acknowledging the Confeſſion of Faith, agreed upon by the Synod at Boſton, May 12, 1680, and the longer, and ſhorter Chatechiſms, agreed upon by the Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter; ſhows that we are of the ſame Faith of our Proteſtant Brethren. And as Unity in the Faith of Jeſus, is honorary to him; ſo Unity in the Profeſſion of it declares his Glory, and is a Means of Chriſtian Charity, Fellowſhip, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Edification. We therefore chearfully join with our Brethren, in confeſſing our Faith in the Doctrines of Chriſt, agreeable to the Syſtems above referred to.</p>

            <head>HEADS OF AGREEMENT, Entered into by a Number of STRICT CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES, convened, by Delegation, at KILLINGLY, Sept. 19, 1781.</head>
            <p n="1">I. Of a Confeſſion of Faith.</p>
            <p>WE agree to the Confeſſion of Faith, agreed upon by the Synod at Boſton, May 12, 1680, and to the longer and ſhorter Catechiſms, agreed upon by the Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter, as orthodox Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, as to the Subſtance of them. Ever holding the Word of God, contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtaments, to be the only perfect Rule of Faith and Practice.</p>
            <p n="2">II. OF the Church in general,</p>
            <p>THAT the Word Church, is uſed to ſignify the whole Body of the Elect, or Saints, both in Heaven, and Earth, who are united in Chriſt as their Head, and by one Spirit baptiſed into one Body, that is the Body of Chriſt, Heb. 12, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">III. OF the Catholic viſible Church.</p>
            <p>THERE is a Catholic viſible Church, viz. The Company of thoſe who profeſs the Chriſtian Faith, whether in Church Order or not; but there is no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Catholic Church, the State of the Members of the viſible Church, ſince the coming of Chriſt, being only Congregational.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:017115_0014_0FA02EF74E221290"/>
IV. OF a particular Congregational Church.</p>
            <p>A Congregational Church is a Part of the viſible Church, conſiſting of a Company of Saints, by Calling, making a credible Profeſſion of their Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; united in one Body by an holy Covenant, for the Worſhip of God, and an Obedience to him in all his Ordinances and Inſtitutions; and for the mutual Edification one of another, in the Fellowſhip of the Lord Jeſus: As to its Quantity it ought not to be of greater Number than may ordinarily meet together conveniently in one Place, nor fewer than may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently carry on Church Work. Any One that joins to ſuch a Church, muſt be baptiſed, profeſs Religion, ſatisfy the Church of the Credibility of their Profeſſion; and covenant to walk with the Church, in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of all Goſpel Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="5">V. OF the Power or Privilege of a Congregational Church.</p>
            <p>THAT a Church regularly gathered, and covenanted together, have good Right, full Power, and lawful Authority, delegated to them by Chriſt their rightful King, and Law giver, to act and tranſact every Thing within themſelves, that is Neceſſary to their Well-being as a Church of Chriſt.—That there is no Juriſdiction, to which particular Churches are or ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by Way of authoritative Cenſure; nor any other Church Power, extrinſical to ſuch Churches, which they ought to depend on any other Sort of Men for the Exerciſe of.

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:017115_0014_0FA02EF74E221290"/>
VI. OF the Exerciſe of Church Power.</p>
            <p>THE Church of Chriſt exerciſeth her Power or Privilege. 1ſt. By admitting her own Members. 2dly. By admoniſhing her Members in Caſe of Sin, and by excommunicating them in Caſe they become incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in their Wickedneſs. 3dly. By chuſing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining her own Officers (Need ſo requiring) and in removing them from their Offices, in Caſe of Forſeiture.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. OF Church Officers.</p>
            <p>THAT there is two Offices appointed by Chriſt in his Church, viz. Biſhops, and Deacons. The Words Biſhop, Elder, Paſtor, or Teacher, we underſtand to be ſo many Names for the ſame Office. In the Choice of Paſtors, or Teachers, ſpecial Reſpect ought to be had to their Qualifications, as deſcribed in the Word of God, viz. Thoſe Gifts and Virtues which the Scriptures requireth in Men that are to be elected into ſuch Places. That Elders muſt be blameleſs, ſober, apt to Teach, and endued with ſuch other Qualifications as are laid down, 1 Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.6—9. Deacons to be qualified as directed Acts 6.3.1 Tim. 3 8—11.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. OF the Ordination of Church Officers.</p>
            <p>ORDINATION is the putting a Perſon into the Place that he had a Right to before, by Election. In the Ordination of Paſtors, or Elders, we judge it expedient that Impoſition of Hands be performed by ordained El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, if it can be obtained: But if not, it may be done by ſome of the Brethren, appointed thereunto by the Church.
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>This was the Opinion of our Fore-Fathers. See Hutchinſon's Hiſtory, Page</hi> 433, <hi>and alſo their Practice, Page</hi> 425.</note> Deacons alſo ought to be put into Office
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017115_0015_0FA02EF7E0146700"/>by Prayer, and ſome public Teſtimony given by the Church.</p>
            <p>AFTER all the Debates that has been about the Right of Ordination, we can freely join with the Opinion of the Preſbytery of Morris County, viz. "When we conſider the Nature of Ordination, and the Right each Church has to chooſe their own Officers, it will appear, that it is not eſſential by whom they are introduced, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are elected, and have accepted the Call of the Church."</p>
            <p n="9">IX. How Churches ſhould proceed in Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>THAT in Order to a Church's exerciſing that Power, or Privilege, that is radically in them as a Church, it is Neceſſary in Churches not furniſhed with proper Officers, that they appoint ſome proper Perſon to preſide in Church Meetings, as Moderator, to lead the Church in thoſe Affairs that may lye before them; but when a Church hath ſupplied itſelf with proper Officers, ſuch as Paſtor, or Deacon, or Deacons, it is the proper Work of a Paſtor to lead in the Church, in all Matters of Church Government: But if the Paſtor be diſabled through Sickneſs or otherwiſe, from attending to his Duty in this Reſpect; or willfully refuſe when deſired by the Church, it appears moſt reaſonable that it is the Deacon's Duty to lead as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator in Matters of Church Government. But that any Officer in the Church, or all its Officers, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Office, have a Right to negative the Church in Matters of Church Government, we entirely diſapprove.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:017115_0015_0FA02EF7E0146700"/>
X. OF the Work and Duty of Paſtors and Deacons.</p>
            <p>FIRST, Of the Paſtors Work and Duty.—It appears that it is not only the Paſtors Work and Duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in Matters of Church Government; but alſo to feed the Flock with Knowledge and Underſtanding: This appears of great Importance in the Diſcharge of their Duty, that they rightly divide the Word of Truth, and give to every one a Portion in due Seaſon. The Teaching and Preaching the Word of God is an Ordinance of his own appointing; and is a ſpecial Means in the Hand of the Spirit, for the Conviction and Converſion of Sinners; and of building up the Saints, in their moſt holy Faith. Therefore, the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gives it in Charge to Timothy, 2 Epiſ. c. 4. v. 2. "Preach the Word." Tit. 2.1. "But ſpeak thou the Things, which become ſound Doctrine." Wherefore, it appears to us eſſential to the Well-being of a Church that they be well provided with a ſound, orthodox Miniſtry, among them.—Paſtors ſhould guide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the Flock, in the Paths of Truth and Duty.— Paſtors ſhould watch for and over the Flock, Heb. 13.17. —Paſtors ſhould warn the Flock of Danger from the World, from Satan, and from the Corruptions of their own Hearts.—Paſtors ſhould adminiſter the Seals unto the Flock, ſuch as Baptiſm, and the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.—Paſtors ſhould pray for the Flock, and bleſs the Flock in the Name of the Lord.—Paſtors ſhould pity the Flock, and carry it gently and meekly towards them.—Paſtors ſhould keep up a good Opinion of, and have an high Eſteem of the Flock; and ſhould ſuit their Diſcourſes to the ſeveral. Circumſtances and Capacities of the Flock.—In a Word, Paſtors ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017115_0016_0FA02EFBD9671510"/>in all Things approve themſelves the Miniſters of God, 2 Cor 3.2.</p>
            <p>SECOND, Of the Work and Duty of Deacons.— The Work and Duty of Deacons in the Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt plain to us in the Scriptures, to be an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to the Miniſtry; and that it is not altogether confined to the Temporalities of the Church, but may as Occaſion and Neceſſity may require, be improved in Spiritual Services in the Church, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Gifts, and Abilities beſtowed upon them.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. SEVERAL Articles of Agreement, reſpecting the Conduct and Behaviour of our Church, one towards another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE agree that particular Churches ought not to walk ſo diſtinct, and ſeparate from each other, as not to have Care and Tenderneſs one towards the other; but ought by mutual Advice and brotherly Intercourſe, to ſtrengthen and encourage each others Hearts and Hands in the Ways of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT none of our Churches ſhall be ſubordinate to one another; each being endued with Equality of Power from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT known Members of particular Churches, that we have already declared we are willing to hold Communion with, as well as thoſe who are of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches; may have occaſional Communion in the Ordinances of the Goſpel, unleſs there be ſome juſt Objection.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:017115_0016_0FA02EFBD9671510"/>
4. THAT we will not admit any one to be a Member of our particular Churches, that hath joined himſelf to another; without Endeavours of mutual Satisfaction of the Church concerned.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THAT we will be moſt willing and ready to give an Account of our Church Proceedings to each other when deſired; for preventing, or removing, any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences that may ariſe among us. Likewiſe we ſhall be ready to give the right Hand of Fellowſhip, and walk together, according to the Goſpel Rules of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Churches; and alſo to aſſiſt each other, by our Advice and Counſel, when deſired, or called thereunto.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THAT in order to maintain Fellowſhip and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among the Churches, and for the Aſſiſtance of each other, in ſome difficult Caſes, it is expedient that Churches meet together by their Delegates, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, to conſult, and adviſe with each other about ſuch Things, as ſhall be for their general Good and Benefit.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THAT when any of our Churches, ſhall in the Providence of God, be deſtitute of Ordained Paſtors among them, that thoſe who are favoured with Paſtors, will be moſt ready upon their Deſire, to afford them Help, and Aſſiſtance, by giving our Paſtors Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to adminiſter the Word, and Sacrements to them occaſionally.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THAT it is agreeable to the Scriptures, that a Church may (Need ſo requiring) have more than one Paſtor ordained over them, at one and the ſame Time.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:017115_0017_0FA02EFCF1BA54D8"/>
9. THAT we will be known among ourſelves, and others, by the Name of <hi>Strict Congregational</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p n="10">10. THAT we will have a General Meeting of our ſeveral Churches, by Delegation, annually on the Third Wedneſday of September, for the Purpoſe aboveſaid; the Firſt to be at Plainfield, September next.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. OF the Support of the Goſpel Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>IT is our Opinion, that the Support of the Goſpel Miniſtry, is a Duty enjoined upon thoſe who are favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Goſpel; that all who are taught in the Word, ought (according to their ſeveral Abilities) to communicate to him that teacheth in all good Things; and can no more be diſpenſed with, than any other Duty required in the Word of God: That this Duty ought to be diſcharged, by thoſe upon whom it lyeth, in the moſt juſt and equitable Way, according as God hath proſpered them in the Things of this Life; and can never be diſcharged acceptable to God, but by the free, voluntary Act of him that doth it. Therefore we wholly diſapprove of all Uſe of Civil Law, in forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons to ſupport the Goſpel Miniſtry; nor do we think that the Exerciſe of Church Cenſures upon its Members, will ever anſwer any good Purpoſe in this Affair, except when Church Members, have laid themſelves under a perſonal, voluntary Obligation, in which Caſe, if they refuſe to fulfil their Engagements (without juſt Cauſe) they may be proceeded againſt, as in any other Breaches of Promiſe. We apprehend that God hath reſerved the Puniſhment of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Sin in his own Hand, as in many other Caſes, and he doth it various Ways; ſometimes by ſending a Curſe upon
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017115_0017_0FA02EFCF1BA54D8"/>People in their Perſons, Families, or Eſtates; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſuffering the Goſpel to become a Savour of Death to them; ſometimes by leaving them deſtitute of any Deſire to hear the Goſpel; ſometimes by ſending a Famine of hearing the Word; and finally if dying in Impenitency, they muſt expect to meet the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Goſpel, with this ſolemn Charge, "I was an hungry, and ye fed me not, naked and ye cloathed me not," therefore "depart from me ye Curſed," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some Queſtions naturally ariſe. Queſt. 1ſt. What if People are able to ſupport the Goſpel Miniſtry, but are not diſpoſed to do it, and ſo neglect it? Anſ. Their want of Diſpoſition is their Sin, and their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is the Fruit and Evidence of their Sin. Queſt. 2d. What ſhall a Miniſter do, that is ordained over ſuch a Church? Anſ. After due Labour with them, ſhake off the Duſt off his Feet for a Teſtimony againſt them, and depart from them. Queſt. 3d. What if a Church, and Society, be willing to ſupport the Goſpel Miniſtry, but are poor, and unable to do it? Anſ. It is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to what a Man hath, and not according to what he hath not, if there be firſt a willing Mind. And it is one of the Excellencies of the Goſpel, that the Poor have it preached to them, while on the other Hand, <hi>the Rich will be ſent empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY Church, ought to adopt ſuch Modes of ſupporting the Goſpel Miniſtry among them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt agreeable to the Word of God, and to their own Circumſtances.</p>

And how the Lord hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined many of the eſtabliſhed Miniſters, and Churches, to adopt the ſame Principles, and Practice in Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that firſt influenced us.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider theſe Things, it ſeems we muſt be guilty of the greateſt Ingratitude to God, if we do not offer a Tribute of Praiſe to him, and live to his Glory.</p>
            <p>WE earneſtly recommend to you, to make the Word of God your Rule, and to put away every Thing from your Faith, and Practice, that wont bear the Teſt by that Standard of Truth. We recommend to you to put away all raſh, and party Zeal, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; and to be cloathed with an humble, meek, and quiet Spirit, which is in the Sight of God of great Price. To ſpeak Evil of no Man, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially not to traduce any Sect of Proteſtant Profeſſors, by the hard harſh Names of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> knowing that others have as good a Right, to think and act for themſelves as we have. But let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in Meekneſs, to inſtruct thoſe that we think are out of the Way. We would put you in mind of the Sin of ſpeaking Evil of Civil Rulers, a Sin that is too much prevailing at this Day we live in: It is a ſpecial Command of God, not to revile the Gods, nor ſpeak Evil of the Ruler of thy People. We ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they are but Men, and the many Embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that attend their Adminiſtration, in this Day of Trouble, and Perplexity, and to pray for them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Direction given in the Goſpel.</p>

            <p>WE recommend to you Carefulneſs in Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, according to the Word of God, that all Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages may be corrected: That all Practices that have the leaſt Tendency to weaken the Union, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Churches, one with another be carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That mutual Help, and Aſſiſtance, be afforded to each other in a ſiſterly Way, ſo that we may be like a Fountain of Gardens, or like Ezekiel's Chambers, Door againſt Door, denoting their Fellowſhip, and Communion one with another.</p>
            <p>WE would alſo recommend to your particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and Attention, the Duty that lyeth upon Parents, and Churches, towards baptiſed Children. It is with the greateſt Sorrow, and Pain, that we ſee ſo many of our baptiſed Children, indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Sins of theſe Times; ſome in Taverns, drinking with the Drunkards, others chanting to the Sound of the <hi>Viol,</hi> others perhaps curſing and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and blaſpheming the God that made them; others indulging themſelves in the vain, fooliſh Cuſtoms, and Faſhions of the World; Zion's Children with their ſtretched forth Necks, and wanton gaudy Dreſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing more like Babel's Sons, and Daughters, than like the Children of the Church of Chriſt, and little or
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017115_0020_0FA02EFEC27228E0"/>no Pains taken by their Parents, or Church, to reſtrain them. Beloved Brethren, you cannot be inſenſible of the Covenant Obligations you are under, to train up your Children, in the Nurture, and Admonition of the Lord, and how much there is depending upon the Diſcharge of your Duty in this Reſpect, as it has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the declarative Glory of God, your own Peace and Comfort in this World; and the Welfare and Happineſs of your Children in the World to come. Therefore we pray God, to impreſs your Duty upon you, and enable you to diſcharge the ſame faithfully.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, Brethren, we would earneſtly recommend to you practical Piety, and Godlineſs, in all the Branches of it, as it reſpects your Duty to God, to yourſelves, and to Mankind in general; practical Godlineſs is the final, and laſt Evidence you can give of your being the chaſte Spouſe, or true Church of Chriſt: And we earneſtly pray, that God would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed you in reforming every Thing that is amiſs among you, and cleanſe you from all Sin, and bring you to poſſeſs that Reſt, that remains for the People of God. Which may God haſten in his own Time.</p>
            <closer>AMEN.</closer>

            <head>A LETTER from a Gentleman, on the Subject of ORDINATION.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been informed, that you are one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appointed by the Strict Congregational Churches, to prepare a Draught for publick Print, deſigned to ſhew in what Light they view themſelves, and ought to be viewed by others, with Reſpect to their religious Sentiments, and Practice.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS there is no one Point, that you will have Occaſion to declare any Thing about, that muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch a critical Examination, and be ſo liable to Cenſure, as that of the Ordination of Miniſters. For it is very obvious, that whenever the Chriſtian Religion hath been eſtabliſhed by Civil Law, whether Papiſt, or Proteſtant, it hath been made an Engine of Cruelty, and Oppreſſion; and when Numbers have diſſented, and ſeparated from the Communion of the Eſtabliſhed Order, profeſſing to be reformed, the Standing Order never fails to object againſt the Miniſters, improved by the Diſſenters; and the Objection chiefly relied upon to bear all down before it is, "that their Ordinations are invalid, they were not ordained by Apoſtolick, or Preſbyterian Authority; by which all Miniſterial Power, and Right for official Adminiſtrations are given, and conveyed." Therefore, they act without Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and their Adminiſtrations empty, and uſeleſs, preſumptuous, and wicked. Thus the eſtabliſhed Clergy clamour at the Ordinations of the Diſſenters, and no marvel, for their own Honour, and Intereſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017115_0021_0FA02EFF77237A80"/>ſuch Circumſtances makes it neceſſary for their own Support. And the diſſenting Party have as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead, that the Church hath Right to chooſe, and ordain her own Officers, eſteeming Scripture Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, holy and ſpiritual Adminiſtrations, more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial than any particular Mode of Ordination; which they eſteem a Work of Order, not of Office.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, it may be obſerved, that when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters Circumſtances admit of it, they invariably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Miniſters, in the Ordination of Miniſters, as others has done before, and ſo their Sentiments, and Practice, keep Pace with their Circumſtances: And when they have obtained a Civil Eſtabliſhment, they have become oppreſſive, and cruel; and ſo another Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration becomes neceſſary: And when it hath taken Place, the old Diſpute about Ordination, is diſputed over again; each Party maintaining agreeable to their preſent Circumſtances, and thus the Diſpute has gone round, and round again, as though it was the great Axis, upon which all revealed Religion turned: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Bible no where mentions ſuch Ordination, as the Criterion by which Chriſt's Miniſters ſhould be known, or neceſſary to make their Adminiſtration valid.</p>
            <p>YET it is very evident, from the Bible, that Men deſigned for, and employed in any public Branch of Miniſtry, in the Church, were for the moſt Part or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, ſooner or later, ſomehow or other, by whole Congregations, or by particular Officers, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a Preſbytery. For a more clear View of this Matter, I will point you out a Number of Scripture
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017115_0021_0FA02EFF77237A80"/>Inſtances, Numb. 8.10, The whole Congregation laid their Hands upon the Levites, in their Inſtall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Service of the Tabernacle. Numb. 11.25.26, The Seventy Elders were ordained, or put into Office, by a ſolemn Aſſembly, when there was no laying on of Hands. Numb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7.18.19, Moſes laid his Hands upon Joſhua, and gave him a Charge to eſtabliſh him in Office as his Succeſſor. 1ſt. Chron. 9.22, David, and Samuel, ordained a Number of Porters, and no Ceremony mentioned. Heb. 5.1, It is ſaid, every High Prieſt taken from among Men, is ordained for Men, in Things pertaining to God. The High Prieſt's Ordination was performed, by the pouring on, or anointing him with the Holy Oil, ſee Exod. 30.30.</p>
            <p>NEW Teſtament Ordinations alſo, were variouſly performed. The Ordination of an Apoſtle in Judah's room, Acts 1.22, and 26. was done by a ſolemn Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. The Ordination of the Seven, Acts 6.6. was by Prayer, and the laying on of the Apoſtle's Hands. Acts 13.3. The Ordination of Paul, and Barnabas, for a Tour of Miniſtration among the Heathen, was by Faſting, Prayer, and the laying on of Hands. Acts 14.23, It is ſaid they ordained them Elders in every Church; the Manner was (ſaith Mr. Bragg) by lifting up the Hands, by which they were publickly choſen: They alſo faſted, and prayed, and commended them to the Lord. Tit. 1.5, Titus was left at Crete to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders; the Manner how is not declared, but their Qualifications are expreſſed, which muſt refer to their being choſen, which might be no ſmall Part of their Ordination. Tim. 4.14, Timothy was ordained by the laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017115_0022_0FA02F004FFCFCB0"/>the only Inſtance of Ordination by their Hands men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Bible.</p>
            <p>IN thoſe Inſtances above quoted, it is evident, that there were divers Modes, and Forms, uſed by Men of divers Characters and Stations in the Church; and probably with Reference to the Diverſity of Gifts, and Office-Work, they were deſigned for.</p>
            <p>UPON the Whole we may learn, it is certain, the Church in Order to its Well-Being, muſt be furniſhed with able Officers; and they are promiſed, but the Manner how they ſhall be ordained, or by whoſe Hands, is not aſſertained in the Bible. Therefore, Chriſtian Prudence ought to be uſed, and the Buſineſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the moſt rational, Chriſtian Manner Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit.</p>
            <p>NOW, Sir, I will declare what, in my Judgment, is a ſcriptural, rational Proceedure, in the Ordination of a Goſpel Miniſter, with Reference to his Connections and Work. The Ordination of a Church Officer, is putting him into, or declaring him to be in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in and over one Church, for the Work of the Miniſtry; and if it may be, in the Fellowſhip of other Churches, for occaſional Services. The Ordination, or Inſtallment of Church Officers, ordinarily implies a public recommending them to God, and the Word of his Grace, for the Work they are deſigned for, in the Fellowſhip of the Church, or Churches. Faſting and Prayer, the Word of God preached upon the Occaſion, are with great Propriety.</p>
            <p>WE may lay on Hands in Ordination, but ſhould mean no more, than a religious, ſolemn Geſture, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017115_0022_0FA02F004FFCFCB0"/>uſed by good Men, in pronouncing their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and giving their Charges, and Advice, to their Children, as well as Miniſters, and others: And we ſhould repeat, and lay before them the Rule of their Duty, and the Charge to be faithful, as it ſtands in the New Teſtament, with a Declaration of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Engagements of Aſſiſtance, in the great Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>ORDINATION implieth, a religious declaring, and recognizing the Spiritual Union, and Agreement, which had before taken Place, between the Paſtor, and Flock. Ordination in the ordinary Way, doth not give miniſterial Gifts, or Grace; and therefore cannot be the Baſis of that Union, which is eſſentially neceſſary in that Relation. But where that Union hath taken Place, if the Fellowſhip, and Aſſiſtance of neighbouring Churches, and Miniſters, cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it is the Church's Duty, by ſome choſen from amongſt themſelves to perform ſuch Religious Service as they are able, ſuitable to the Occaſion; in order, publickly to eſtabliſh their Miniſter's Character among themſelves; and may properly be called a private Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. Yet upon the Plan of Catholic Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Fellowſhip among all the Churches of the Saints, their Miniſters ought to be eſtabliſhed in the Fellowſhip of all the Churches in the Vicinity, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter occaſionally amongſt them.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE with regard to Order, and a rational Foundation for miniſterial Uſefulneſs among the Churches in general, they ſhould be ordained in the Preſence, and by the Aſſiſtance and Fellowſhip of neighbouring Churches and Miniſters. Nevertheleſs, if any one Church call and ordain a Miniſter duly
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017115_0023_0FA02F0101721E00"/>qualified and in a decent Manner without any Aſſiſtance of other Churches, there is no Objection juſtly to be made againſt his having Office-Right to adminiſter in that Church. But he cannot from hence adminiſter occaſionally, as an Officer, in Fellowſhip in any other Church; becauſe the Juriſdiction of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, was circumſcribed to one Church only.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding ſuch Deficiency in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever the Cauſe might be, if other Churches and Miniſters become acquainted with ſuch Church and Miniſter, and find them walking according to Truth of the Goſpel; and willing to have their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's Ordination compleated, ſo as to eſtabliſh his Character in the Fellowſhip of all the Churches, it is their Duty to take Order by common Conſent, in convenient Time, to give Fellowſhip to his Ordination by his own Church; and ſo eſtabliſh his Character, as a Miniſter of Chriſt, in the Fellowſhip of the Churches in general: And ſo the Work is finiſhed, which might have been as well done, and more conveniently all at once, if neighbouring Churches and Miniſters had been preſent at his firſt Inſtallment. The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Goſpel Miniſter, in Fellowſhip of the Churches, implies the joint Act of two diſtinct Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: One is the Church, where he is ſpecially ſixed, which is an entire Juriſdiction by itſelf: The other is the catholic, occaſional Communion and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Churches in general: Each Juriſdiction managing the Parts of Ordination belonging to their Deparments, will make a uniform Syſtem of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Profeſſion and Practice of Chriſtianity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the Ordination of Goſpel Miniſters, and the great Diſpute come to an End.</p>
