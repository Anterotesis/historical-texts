            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And if we run over the Annals of the Church and obſerve the ſeveral Periods wherein God has remembred it in, and rais'd it up from, its low Eſtate; we ſhall find that it bears no little Reſemblance to Jeruſalem in the fall and riſe thereof, which our Text nextly refers to.</p>

In the Mount of their difficulties he was ſeen, working deliverance &amp; ſalvation for them; and brought them at length to the border of his Sanctuary, even to the Mountain which his right Hand had purchaſed.

of our text are <hi>words fitly ſpoken, like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi> Words taken in their alluſive &amp; metaphorical or figurative Senſe, very ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant &amp; expreſſive of divers things relating to the Church of God reſpecting both the <hi>Eſſe</hi> &amp; the <hi>Bene Eſſe</hi> of it; which are to be attributed and aſcribed to none but Him who <hi>worketh all things according to the Counſel of his own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Church is fitly flyl'd Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, appears in that,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Jeruſalem (which was built up as a City that is Compact together) was a lively Emblem or Picture of the Church's Unity and Peace.</hi> The Name ſignifies <hi>Peace:</hi> Which Name was given it after David took the Fort of <hi>Zion</hi> from the <hi>Jebuſites.</hi> For before that it was called <hi>Jebus</hi>; a Noun of a quite contrary ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification: Which being interpreted, is, <hi>The Fire of God.</hi> Agreeable to which myſtical Name, the Inhabitants (who were a People <hi>hated &amp; accurſed by God,</hi> againſt whom he had <hi>had indignation a long time,</hi> and that <hi>fire kindled in his anger burnt to the loweſt Hell</hi>) perhaps were ſuffered (as a juſt Judgment of heaven upon them) to live in the fire of Contention, Variance &amp; Strife, in Malice and Envy, Hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Hating one another.)</p>
            <p>It was not now diſtinct and oppoſite, but united and uniform both in its Government
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005066_0018_1016B5F307F1DBF8"/>
and Religion. In a reſembling manner there is (at leaſt there ought to be) Unity, Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Peace and Harmony maintained &amp; cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated among Chriſtians. <hi>That they all may be one,</hi> agreeable to our Saviour's Prayer, and to the inſpired Apoſtle's deſcription of the Church, <hi>Fpb</hi> 4.1,—6 <hi>&amp;</hi> 12,—16. Peace and Love and Unity is the great and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law and Character of the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. A divided Church is (in a very ill ſenſe) <hi>terrible as an Army with Banner</hi>; and as <hi>the Company of Two Armies,</hi> — Indeed the phraſe (in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech) is a Solaeciſm, and a Contradiction in terms.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Jeruſalem was a very pleaſant &amp; beautiful City.</hi> Beautiful for Situation and for its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buildings; particularly the Temple, which was the moſt magnifical, curious &amp; ſplendid Edifice that ever human Art contriv'd, Hands Erected or mortal Eyes beheld. On account of which, men call'd that City, <hi>the perfection of Beauty, the Joy of the whole Earth.</hi> In like manner, the Church is exceeding Beautiful; eſpecially in the Eyes of him <hi>who ſeeth not as ruin ſeeth,</hi> but <hi>looketh on the heart.</hi> Pſal. 45.13. <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her Cloathing</hi> alſo <hi>is of wrought Gold.</hi> Ezek. 16.13.— <hi>Thou waſt exceeding beautiful: Thy beauty was perfect through my Comlineſs, which I had put upon thee, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> See alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.8,—

With what lively &amp; ſignificant flowers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Rhetorick does the heavenly Bridegroom ſet forth the excelling Beauties of his Spouſe, the Church, in that <hi>Song of Songs which is Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's? Thou art beautiful, O my Love as Tirza, comly as Jeruſalem. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thou haſt raviſh'd my heart, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, with one of thine Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who is</hi> ſhe <hi>that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, and clear as the Sun? How fair and how pleaſant art thou, O Love, for Delights? Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple. Thy neck is as a tower of Ivory. How beautiful are thy feet with ſhoes, O princes Daughter! Thy ſtature is like to a palm-tree. Behold thou art fair my love, behold thou art fair: Thou art all fair my love, there is no ſpot in thee,</hi>—</p>
            <p>Thus do all true Believers (who are the conſtituent parts of this Building of God, this Temple in which the Holy Ghoſt dwells) ſhine with a diſtinguiſhing Luſtre, and reflect a Divine, God-like Beauty; inſomuch that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> yea even <hi>Solomon's Temple in all its glory was not adorn'd &amp; beautify'd like one of theſe.</hi>

            <p>Tis true, the Viſible Church (collectively taken) ſomtimes reſembles one <hi>that has lain among the Pots</hi>; and may ſay as in Cart. 1. 5, 6. <hi>I am black as the tents of Kedar. Look not upon me, &amp;c.</hi> But then again there are times when

it reſembles <hi>a dove whoſe wings are covered over with Silver, and her feathers with yellow Gold.</hi> The Daughter of Zion was cover'd with a dark Cloud, the beauty of Iſrael was greatly marr'd; her gold was become dim, her moſt fine gold was changed, when thoſe miſeries &amp; calamities ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel</hi> were brought upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the remainder of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, and afterwards by the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, about the time of our Saviour's Nativity, eſpecially at the time of the Deſtruction brought upon the City and Temple &amp; Nation by <hi>Titus.</hi>

3, 11. The Church is built on the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-ſtone. This is the Lord's doing and it is marvellous in our Eyes. Iſa. 28.16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious Corner-ſtone, a ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> &amp;c. As the Temple (that illuſtrious Type of the Chriſtian Church) was founded on a Rock, <hi>viz.</hi> Mount-<hi>Moriah</hi>; ſo on this Rock of Ages the Church is built, whence it is that the gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt it. This Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure: Tis an everlaſting Foundation.

Man.</hi> Civil Rulers frequently find themſelves obliged to tread <hi>Antipodes</hi> to ſome who lift up the Heel againſt them, and even kick againſt the pricks: <hi>Thorns there are that muſt be thruſt away, becauſe they cannot be taken with hands; But the man that ſhall touch them muſt be fenced with Iron and the ſtaff of a Spear.</hi>

of mens Hearts &amp; determine their State Godward, to Cenſure &amp; Condemn even thoſe as Unconverted &amp; Hypocrites, <hi>of whom the world is not worthy.</hi> What is this better than that?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further,</hi> I beſeech you, Brethren, <hi>Mark them which cauſe Diviſions &amp; Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them: For they that are ſuch ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Belly; and by good words and fair ſpeaches deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the Wiſdom that is from above. The Kingdom of God is not Meat &amp; Drink, but Righteouſneſs &amp; Peace; for he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God &amp; approv'd of men. Where as diviſive, ſeparating Principles &amp; Practiſes are Condemn'd in Scripture as Works of the Fleſh, and an Argument of a Carnal Mind. See 1 Cor. 3 2 4 <hi>For whereas there is among you Envying &amp; Strife &amp; Diviſions, are ye not Carnal &amp; walk as men? For while one ſaith, I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollos, are ye not Carnal</hi>? See alſo <hi>Jam.</hi> 3 14, 16. A Church-rending, Unpeaceable, Party Spirit, is certainly a bid Spirit.

ſays, <hi>He came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword.</hi> But what Sword? Why not the Sword of Friends, but of Enemies to Chriſtianity. For Chriſtians to Hate, Perſecute and Wound one another, this is like plunging a Spear into Chriſt's Sacred Side (whoſe <hi>Myſtical Body</hi> the Churh is) 'tis Crucifying the Son of God afreſh and putting of him to an open ſhame Alas! that the Bleſſed JESUS, the Prince of Peace, ſhould be thus Wounded in the Houſe of his Proſeſſed Friends!

To me it plainly appears (and therefore I am neither afraid nor aſham'd to declare it as my Opinion) that diverſe things relating to, and tranſacted in, theſe Separate Meetings, are a great Blemiſh to the Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion, directly contrary to the Religion of the Bible: particularly to that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Rule, 1 Cor. 14.40 <hi>Let all things be done Decently &amp; in Order.</hi> That they are ſubverſive of <hi>Peace, Diſcipline &amp; Government</hi>: Lay open the Sluices &amp; make a Gap to let in a Flood of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion &amp; Diſorder; and very awfully portend the Ruin of theſe Churches, unleſs a Stop be put to them.

us not be high minded but fear.</hi> And, Oh! let us befiege the Throne of grace, that God would lead us into all Truth, &amp; not ſcatter Darkneſs in our Paths, nor ſuffer us to err from this ways.</p>

               <hi>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God &amp; to the Word of his grace, which is able to build you up</hi>; and ſhall now ſhut up all with thoſe words of the Holy Ghoſt in the Epiſtle of Jude,-<hi>Behold the Lord cometh with Ten thouſands of his Saints, to excute Judgement upon all,&amp; to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him. Theſe are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own luſts, and their mouth ſpeaking great ſwelling words of vanity, having mens perſons in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration becauſe of advantage. But beloved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words which were ſpoken before of the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, how that they told you that there ſhould be meckers in the laſt time, who ſhould walk after their own ungodly luſts: Theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the Spirit. But ye beloved, builing up your ſelves on your moſt holy Faith, Praying in the Holy Ghoſt, Keep your ſelves in the Love of God. Looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal Life. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to preſent you faultleſs before the Preſence of his glory with exceeding Joy. To the Only Wiſe God our Saviour, be Glory and Majeſty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever.</hi> AMEN.</p>
