            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS treatiſe preſcribes plain, ſafe, and eaſy means for perſons in every capacity, and to cure themſelves of moſt, if not all the moſt grievous and dangerous diſorders our country is incident to, and with very little charge; the medicine being chiefly this country growth, and on every man's plantation; and thoſe that are imported are cheap, and may be had from almoſt every Doctor and Apothecary's ſhop, ſo that every man may get and keep the imported ones by him, and ſend his ſon or ſervant and get and prepare them of our own growth; by which means he may be cured, if cura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le,</p>
            <p>"But many ſhapes of death, and many are the ways that leads to his grim cave; diſmal, yet to ſenſe more terrible at the entrance than within, ſome as thou ſayeſt by violent ſtroke ſhall die. By fire, flood, famine; by intemperance more in meats and drinks which on the earth ſhall bring diſeaſes dire! And Doctors ſtill more terrible." Milton.</p>
            <p>The moſt acceptable ſervice we can render to God, is beneficience to man. There are three ways of benefitting our fellow-creatures; we may be uſeful to their ſouls by good inſtruction and example; we may be helpful to their bodies by feeding the hungry, and cloathing the naked; we can aid them in their fortunes by encouraging induſtry, and preſcribing eaſy remedies to the ſick; and in this we ſhall relieve the diſtreſſed;
<pb facs="unknown:048490_0003_10254c224fbd6b40"/>
which in a word is doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures. Theſe are the ways of improving our talents, which God has entruſted us with; and we muſt expect hereafter to give an account how we have employed them.</p>
            <p>I wiſh it were in my power to ſerve mankind more than I do, but alas! Vain wiſh: how often did I publiſh in the Virginia Gazatte in the time of the great diſtreſs of the Flux, (I believe in the year 1773) and two hundred and ſixty-four receipts I had printed, and gave out in the year 1774; from which inſtructions numbers have teſtified of the good received, both in being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from catching, as well as well as being reſtored to perfect health, when beyond all hopes of recovery, which gave me great encouragement to write; but the troubles of the late war, and being in an unſettled ſituation, has prevented one, though it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has laid long and heavy on my mind: yet I have put it off till now, I pray God it may be accepted and bleſt of him, of which I make no doubt as he ſo graciouſly accepted the widows mite. I publiſh this treatiſe to lead the poor in the pleaſant path of health, and when they have the misfortune to be ſick, to ſhew them the cheapeſt, eaſieſt, ſafeſt, and beſt way to get well again.</p>
            <p>The lower part of our country are ſubject to more diſorders than the upland, there being ſo many ſwamps, marſhes, bogs, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of freſh water rivers, from which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds fogs, a damp air, with loathſome and bad ſcents, from which proceed agues, and followed with long inward fevers, dropſies, coughs, pleuraſy, conſumptions, and with many others which the upland is not ſo ſubject to; yet our upland is not exempt from all diſorders; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſwearing, the Land mourneth, ſayeth
<pb facs="unknown:048490_0004_10254c26e6685620"/>
the good old prophet Jeremiah many hundred years ago: ſo our upland is afflicted as well as the low, and with the rheumatiſm, fluxes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and with a diſmal train of other diſorders which make a ſad havock all over our ſtates. Is it poſſible to ſee theſe calamities rage without the tendereſt compaſſion? Surely, what can be more melancholy than to have ſo many poor people periſh for want of uſing timely means for their preſervation? They neglect to take any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy till their caſe is grown deſperate, and death begins to ſtare them in the face. They conſider not that a moderate ſkill may recover them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a diſtemper while he has ſtrength to go through all the neceſſary operations, but when the whole college ſhould not be able to ſave him after his ſpirits are ſunk, and all the principles of life are nearly extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>This unhappy diſtemper occaſions a great deal of mortality, and what makes the misfortune the greater, is, that it falls heavier on the younger ſort who are moſt liable to harringing diſtempers. Indeed ſome would be glad of aſſiſtance if they did not think the remedy nearly as had as the diſorder; for our doctors are ſo exorbitant in their fees whether they kill or cure, that the patient had rather truſt to his conſtitution than run the riſque of beggaring his family:</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations made me, count it a work of charity, and public ſpirit to communicate to theſe extenſive ſtates, and particularly the poor the method of curing themſelves when they ſhall fall into any of our common diſorders. For their great encouragement, the remedies I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe may be procured at little trouble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, being for the moſt part ſuch as grow on their own plantations, or may be eaſily procured.</p>
            <p>Providence has been ſo good as to furniſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb facs="unknown:048490_0005_10254c28697aaed0"/>
every country with medicines proper for the diſtempers incident to the climate, and ſuch domeſtic remedies are always ſufficient for the cures of ſuch diſorders, if a right uſe be made, with the bleſſing of God. Their caſes are ſeldom compleated, but proceed for the moſt part from cold, or ſuch ſlight tranſgreſſions in ſuch ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the ſymptoms cannot eaſily be miſtaken, nor is the cure difficult: all the ſecret lies in taking the diſtemper in time, and this will be the moſt neceſſary, becauſe moſt diſorders that happen from cold, are exceedingly violent, and call aloud for ſpeedy aſſiſtance. Always remember, that the ſooner any diſorder is taken in hand, the eaſier the cure; becauſe nature is ſtrong and able to co-operate with the medicines they take—nor can we hope, that Heaven will aſſiſt us in our calamities unleſs we endeavour at the ſame time to aſſiſt ourſelves.</p>
            <p>In ſetting down the following preſcriptions, I have been cautions of not talking like an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, that is, of uſing hard words that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps neither my patient nor I my ſelf underſtands, not have I taken them lightly upon truſt, but I am able to recommend moſt of them upon more than thirteen years experience; for the reſt I have creditable authority for. In the mean time, I hope none will object like Noeman, the Syrian, to the eaſineſs of any of theſe remedies; but rather rejoice that any can have ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo very cheap; and in truth people muſt love difficulty extreemly well to ſlight health for being gained with little for my own body, being ſickly brought me eaſily into a capacity to know that health was the greateſt of all earthly bleſſings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and truly he was never ſick that doth not believe it than firſt I ſtudied the human body, and ſecondly, I conſidered that all medicines
<pb facs="unknown:048490_0006_10254c2c5de774e0"/>
were compounded of herbs, roots, barks, flower, and ſeeds and this firſt let me to work in ſtudying the nature of ſimples; moſt of which I knew by ſight before. Then I conſulted with my two brothers, Doctor Reaſon, and Doctor Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and took a voy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge to viſit my mother Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by whoſe advice, together with the help of Doctor Diligence, and the bleſſing of the God. I at laſt gained my deſire, and being warned by Mr. Honeſty, a ſtranger in the preſent days, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it to the world, I have done it.</p>
            <p>But, you will ſay, what need had I to have wrote on this ſubject when ſo many famous and learned men have wrote ſo much already. To this I anſwer of a truth; much have been wrote, but in ſo high a ſtyle, that the poor could not underſtand it; and I write for the poor, yet I make no doubt but the rich will be glad to make uſe of this treatiſe for many of the diſorders that are herein mentioned, the Doctors call incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and beſides, if the rich ſend for the Doctor very time a child or a ſervant is ſick, it will take their whole income: and what then will pay their taxes, and cloath them? Secondly, before the Doctor could be got, perhaps the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient might die, and if not he might ſuffer greatly.</p>
            <p>There are many parts that there is no Doctor to be got at all; now you ſee a reaſon for it: a reaſon it is ſaid, makes a man differ from a beaſt, becauſe out of thy thoughts God ſhould not paſs his image ſtamped, is on every weed and graſs if you pleaſe to make uſe of this little treatiſe. I make no doubt but it will anſwer your deſired effect; and then I am ſure you will not think your money thrown away, nor ſpent in vain; but I hope you will give all the praiſe to God, which is the ardent wiſh of the public's friend and humble ſervant.</p>

               <p>It is good for every perſon ſtrictly to watch their children when they are getting well of the flax when it draws near the full or change of the moon, for the worms are apt to riſe and kill the child, perhaps when thought out of all danger, which may be known by a hacking cough, or the child often putting the hand to his throat, or complaining of ſomething choking them. In this caſe, give the child without delay, a tea-ſpoonfull of the juice of ſage, or the ſame of the juice of tauſey or wormwood eight or ten times a day, till the danger is over; for I have cauſe to believe that as many children die by the worms in the flux, or on the firſt full or changing of the moon is die by the flux.</p>
