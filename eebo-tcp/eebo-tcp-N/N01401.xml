         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPON your ſo earneſtly repeating your Deſire to me, to give you my Thoughts, or the Thoughts of the Gentlemen of this Town, relating to the Bank of Credit Projected; and to a Letter directed to the Speaker of the Houſe of Repreſentatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and the Objections made againſt it with no common Applauſe, cryed up by the Court Intereſt as Unanſwerable; tho' I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge my ſelf as unfit a Perſon, as you could have Writ to about it, being not concerned with the Gentlemen in the Projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and but little converſant with them, and in that I pretend to little or no acquaintance in State Affairs, or in Trade; yet when I ſat my ſelf down to Read that Letters, it appeared to me ſo trifling, and below the Character of the Gentleman that Subſcribed it; that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in my thoughts that the Cauſe was not ſo good, as ſome Others he has plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and invited me in a few Remarks to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with your Requeſt.</p>
            <p>I frankly acknowledge, that I have been ſometime of the Opinion, that a Bank of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001663_0003_0fb4d85c06159a18"/>
well Founded and well Regulated, would be of the greateſt Advantage imaginable to this Country; and therefore it was a real pleaſure to me, when I firſt underſtood that a Number of Valuable Gentlemen were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing proper meaſures to accompliſh ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an end. But I muſt confeſs my ſelf to have been at a Loſs when they had given the finiſhing ſtroke to their firſt Scheme, wherein I apprehend they had left the foundation too fluctuating and changeable for a Land Bank, and that, tho' the Poſſeſſor of the Bills Emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had good Security, yet it ſeemed to me that they had not ſecured it well againſt one another, but had left it too precarious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the Caprice of every Accident, and the Probity and Juſtice of they knew not who, which might come after them, yet I am very ready to excuſe them that they did not arrive to the beſt method in their firſt Eſſay; but ſince this great Miſtake is Corrected in their laſt Model, <hi>viz.</hi> by every ones Mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a Real Eſtate in proportion to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt he is to have in the Bank, and ſo to abide during its Continuance; hereby there is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proviſion made not only for the Credit of their Bills and Notes, but a ſufficient Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them to do Juſtice to each other, &amp; to every man that ſhall be concerned with them, in caſe the Bank or Partnerſhip ſhall come to an end; which the Author of the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001663_0004_0fb4d85d8647f8a0"/>
Letter himſelf allows to be good; which in my Opinion before was not: All that I have to do is to blow off the Cloud of Duſt and Smoke, which the Author of the Letter has covered the Bank with; that when it comes to ſtand in its native light, we may be the better able to paſs a Judgment upon it; and that I may have the advantage of ſtanding on my own grou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, (and be freed from the incumbrance of making good any of his) it will not be improper to tell you, how far I can agree with the Author of that Letter, <hi>viz. That the People as to their Trade and Buſineſs, cannot well carry on their neceſſary Affairs much longer, without a further Supply of Money, or Bills of Credit,</hi> page 30. <hi>But there is a neceſſity of ſupplying the People with a further convenient quantity of Bills of Credit,</hi> page 26. The Queſtion then is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Publick ſhall Emit theſe Bills of Credit; or whether it had not better be done by a Company of men in the nature of a Private Bank of Credit. I agree with the Author alſo in this, <hi>That I am not a-againſt a Bank of Credit in general, were it well founded, well regulated,</hi> page 26. I leave out the words (by the Government,) becauſe the Conſideration, whether by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwiſe comes under the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quaery; ſo that the Queſtion here is, <hi>Whether or no this Projection for a Bank of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001663_0005_0fb4d8625814f678"/>
Credit be well Founded, well Limited, and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated?</hi> And here I cannot avoid doing the Gentlemen that Juſtice to ſay what ſome of their Number have informed me, namely that when they firſt waited on his Excellency with their firſt Scheme, they were deſired to leave the Limitation to the General Court, that it was a proper Compliment to pay them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to ſet the Sum, which was one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why there was no Limitation; but this by the way.</p>
            <p>We agree thirdly, <hi>That the Projection of a Bank of Credit, very much imports the Prerogative of the Crown, the Conſtitution and Laws of the Province, the Eſtates and Liberties of the People; and that not only for the preſent, but Succeeding Generations,</hi> page 4. For I take it, that the word import when ſo uſed, generally means to be of advantage; however to deal fairly, it ſhall be the queſtion, <hi>Whether it imports to their advantage or diſadvantage, and which does most of all import them, the Publick or the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bank</hi>? I agree with him alſo, <hi>That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves the Government and General Aſſembly of the Province, and really concerns every man, that has any Interest in the Country, with great appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to enquire into, and ſeriouſly conſider the Nature and Conſequences of this Bank or Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip,</hi> page 4. And ſo Sir, I am ſufficiently warranted to make my Enquiry, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſet things in a true light; but to find
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001663_0006_0fb4d864cf4af678"/>
theſe things wherein we agree to confuſedly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umbled together as they are in Mr. <hi>Attorneys</hi> Letter, that they might appear a ſort of dark Arguments againſt a Bank of Credit, is ſuch a fine Amuſement to the Ignorant and Injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, and ſuch an odd way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we could have expected it from none, but he that had loſt his own eyes, or thought every body elſe was blind. And to be plain, when I heard of ſuch a Letter publiſhed in Mr. <hi>Attorneys</hi> Name, I expected to find the ſtrongeſt Arguments, and the faireſt Pleadings that could be, againſt the Private Bank of Credit, from a Gentleman of ſo bright Parts, and ſo Learned in the Law, as is his general Character: Yet I muſt aſſure you, that I had not read over the firſt page, before I had alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my mind, and received this ſettled Idea of the whole Piece; that I ſhould find nothing in it but Evaſions, Doublings and Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, and ſome few amuſements; for I was aſtoniſhed to ſee ſo fair (not to ſay falſe) a light given to the Order of the Governour and Council, which being Publick, every one has the opportunity to ſee and judge of the fallacy. He tells us, page 3. <hi>That the Project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors were directed to proceed no further in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, till the next Seſſions of the General Aſſembly; notwithſtanding all which (I am loth to ſay in contempt of it) the perſons concerned are openly carrying on their Bank with utmost Vigour and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001663_0007_0fb4d865c6d24ac8"/>
Expedition.</hi> How could he Sir, ſo openly give us this wrong Account of the matter? My News-Letter Printed by Authority, <hi>August</hi> 23. tells me, that upon Reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That the Projectors or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers of any ſuch Bank, do not proceed to Print the Scheme, or put the ſame on Publick Record, Make or Emit any of their Notes or Bills, until they have laid their Propoſals before the General Aſſembly of this Her Majesties Province, who are always ready to Encourage and Countenance any Propoſals,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I. A.</hi> Secr. Which Order, as it was far from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding their proceeding any further in that Affair; as to the digeſting their thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and filling up their Number, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but rather ſuppos'd they ought to wade through all the difficulties, and bring their Scheme to its perfection, that it might be fit to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the General Aſſembly; ſo was it, as I have been well informed, in every Article complied with, in Duty to the Government; and even to this day have neither Printed their Scheme, Put it on Publick Record, Made, nor Emitted any of their Notes or Bills; ſo that really Sir, what has been done by the Projectors, won't bear ſo much, as a, <hi>notwithstanding,</hi> much leſs, <hi>a, loth to ſay in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi> Indeed, I have heard it whiſpered, that they have thought the Order very hard, in that they were denied the benefit of the Preſs, and the benefit of Public Records,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001663_0008_0fb4d86745cb8158"/>
which I ſhall leave: And now Sir, after ſo plain, and publickly known, a falſe Comment, upon the Order of the Governour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the Actions of the Projectors in the very Entrance of the Letter; what can be lookt for, but Arguments of the ſame Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thro' the whole: And I Confeſs when I had Read the Letter out, I ſhould verily have thought it had been Calculated to Lull the Government into a profound Sleep, if I had not remembred that he ſaid page 5. <hi>his deſign was to Awaken it</hi>; ſo eaſily do we miſtake things till we are informed better. But not to give you or my ſelf any further trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the deſign of it, believing it is not laid ſo deep, but your penetration without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the Wreck will fathom it. I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the firſt Enquiry, ſince 'tis agreed there is a neceſſity of a certain number of Bills of Credit, or Notes to be Emitted, as a Medium in Trade, <hi>viz. Who ſhall Emit theſe Bills?</hi> Had the Government of the Country beſt take it on themſelves? or would it not be ſafer to permit particular Perſons in Partnerſhip to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out, and give a Currency to their own Notes, founded on their Lands, under the name of a Bank of Credit? This is the main Enquiry which now falls under every Bodies Examination, and becomes the debate of the Town this Winter Seaſon; and that I may give you my thoughts upon it freely, I ſay
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001663_0009_0fb4d86a16443200"/>
with all due Deference to Government, by all means let the Governments Notes, Emitted to pay the Publick Dues, and called in by Taxes granted as a Fund for them, have all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Honour and Credit amongſt us; and if in their great wiſdom they ſhould ſee meet to make it a Publick Charge, to Emit a certain number of their Notes in Erecting a Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Charles</hi>-River, and make it a Toll Bridge, with ſuitable Allowances to the Colledge at preſent; and ſuppoſe that <hi>Forty Thouſand Pounds</hi> were Iſſued out to make it a ſubſtantial and firm Bridge; and that a Toll upon every thing paſſing and carried over, ſhould be a Fund to Call them in gradually; and after that it had cleared it ſelf, it ſhould be taken off from Paſſengers, and left only for Carts, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Colledge have the Income for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or any ſuch Publick Charge, as Fortifying the principal Town by Sea, Erecting Stone Forti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

per</hi> Head were given for all Male White Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that ſhall be Imported into this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and Bound out from the Age of Ten to Eighteen Years; the Reward to continue the Term of Twenty Years; and this would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with Sailors, with Labourers in Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry &amp; Fiſhery, &amp; Soldiers for our Defence, whoſe Polls in a few years would pay it in: And whereas now they are Sold for a Term of years, for <hi>Fifteen</hi> and <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> a Head; ſuch a certain Reward would induce men to bring in ſuch Numbers, that they would be Sold for <hi>Five Pounds,</hi> as they are in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and other Places, where ſuch certain Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements have been given. The Debts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by theſe Emiſſions would be the real Credit of the Country, both Serviceable and Honourable, the Strength, Support, &amp; Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory of a Country; and whereas the Trade wants a Medium to Circulate it, there would be no neceſſity of Laying heavy Taxes, &amp; the Funds might be carried forwards as the Government would ſee cauſe; for I believe by this time moſt men of thought may ſee, that ſince Paper Notes are our only Medium, that Day we are out of Debt, we are out of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and muſt unavoidably ſink, unleſs there ſhould be found out ſome other way to ſave us from Ruin.

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:001663_0011_0fb4d86ec68f7180"/>I ſhall therefore in the next Place, give you thoſe Reaſons that are of weight with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Publick Bank, and Reſcue the Private from the Authors Objections: For theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may not the Publick Bank be Objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt? May there not be a danger if the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſhould go on to Emit Bills on Intereſt, that it will be too great an Invaſion of the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Crown: For I am apt to think e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body will grant, that the Stamping of Money is a Royalty inveſted in the Crown; and I am prone to imagine, that Bills Emitted by Publick Authority to Lend at Intereſt, will carry with them many ſignatures of Money; eſpecially ſince the Act of this Province makes them a Legal Tender, ſo far as no man may be Impriſon'd for Debt that Tenders them; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if we Conſider the difference in the Emiſſion of theſe Bank Bills, that they are not paid out of the Treaſury, as the Notes Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Government to thoſe they were Indebted unto, with the Publick Faith, plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Call them in by Taxes; and ſo tho' they are of the ſame Tenour, yet the manner of the Emiſſion, with that Law cited, gives them the character of real Money; for I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf to ſay with Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> that nothing can be Money properly, but Silver and Gold, becauſe that both Copper &amp; Braſs have had the Royal Stamp, and Copper paſſes in ſmall Payments, as other Money in

               <hi>Great Britain</hi> at this day; and I have alſo heard, that Leather was once the current Coin of <hi>Rome:</hi> And I am very much inclined to think, if the Crown of <hi>England</hi> ſaw cauſe, they could make Paper Bills, ſo ſtamped, as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Money, as any Money whatſoever. Now is there not ground to fear, when the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign has been pleaſed to indulge us with the Priviledges of Emitting Publick Notes for the defraying the neceſſary Charge in the Defence and Support of the Government, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine us to thoſe Occaſions in the Taxes and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsments allowed to be made on the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; would it not be looked on as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment in very deed on the Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative for us to exceed, and what the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that will be, you are a much better Judge than I am; (and I have been informed that the Gentlemen concerned, have had Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from their Friends at Home, adviſing that by no means the Government would be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in ſuch a Fund) but if it ſhould not in all the ſignatures of Money be a direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Prerogative, on the account of its being really Money, yet would it not be a going beyond our Laſt? and a doing what we had no power or warrant for; for I look upon it a weak &amp; fooliſh plea, ſome peoples mouths are filled with, <hi>viz.</hi> That we ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about the Power of the Government, that it tends to weaken us, and that there are
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001663_0013_0fb4d8728578e4e8"/>
enough that do that, and the like. I think the way to have our Powers rendred ſtrong &amp; durable, would be to Conſider what they are, and uſe them, and not go to the brink, or one hairs breadth beyond them: And truly I fear there is ſome deſign in raiſing all this ſmother, to blindfold is, and lead us whence we cannot ſo eaſily return. I take it that our Charter ſets us the bounds of our Power, and tells us how far we may go, and all without that is forbidden ground; now it is a plain thing, that the Governments Emitting Bills of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Credit on Intereſt, is not to be found, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granted or warranted by the Charter, the boundaries thereof are <hi>Aſſeſsments and Taxes, in the neceſſary defence and ſupport of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the protection and preſervation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants there.</hi>—Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> has given it us, <hi>page</hi> 29. He was ſo well apprized of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that he lays out his ſtrength to remove it; tho' I think he has not been able to make it ſtir one inch. He tells us, <hi>there is nothing in the Charter repugnant to the Governments Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing a further ſupply of Bills,</hi> page 29. It is very true upon the Foot or Fund of Aſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they have been hitherto Emitted, for Paying the Debts, and Defraying the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Charges of the Province; but once for all, the Charter may well be allow'd to be repugnant to all that is not fairly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. He ſays ſecondly, <hi>That it has
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001663_0014_0fb4d87405c15bb0"/>
been done once and again, on great Occaſions, and the Government not blamed for it.</hi> The Government has Emitted their Bills to pay their Debts, but never to Lend at Intereſt, before his Letter was written, which is the matter in Controverſy. The Bills the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Tent to the Treaſury, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury in Return, Lent the Merchants by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Government on that great Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, were for the paying Her Majeſties Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and would not have been Emitted, but in ſuch an Extraordinary Caſe, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that bottom, ſo that it can never be made the preſident to Lett out Bills at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: and then he would perſwade us (not himſelf) that the words the neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Government, protection and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the People, will allow it, and ſo forſooth with an (if) it is <hi>&amp; cra,</hi> then it comes within the Charter; and I am verily perſwaded (if) he were of Councel againſt us, he would with all imaginable Juſtice declare, as every reaſonable man elſe (eſpecially a Gentleman of the Law) would, that the evident meaning of theſe words are, the Charges of the Government and the War, even all ſuch Charge as the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ſhall be Aſſeſſed and Taxed for, and that they have not the leaſt aſpect upon a Fund for Trade, or the ſupplying the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a Medium of Exchange, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

his thruſting the word, Government, and into a parentheſis, <hi>as to their Trade and Buſineſs,</hi> into the Sentence at <hi>page</hi> 30. is as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a piece of Sophiſtry as can be, akin to his fore-mentioned Arguments, and what I told you at firſt you muſt look for; I readily grant the General Court here muſt be Judges of their own Power; and there is no Doubt but that it is poſſible alſo they may have been, by this Letter under the Attorney Generals Hand, induced to believe that they have more than really they have. I am informed, that in <hi>May</hi> Seſſions, the Sufferers by the late dreadful Fire applied to them for Relief to Lend them Money on their Lands, they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it in their prudent Power ſo to do; &amp; ſome of as good Councel as any in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, have declared it as their Opinion, that the Country had not the Power to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a Publick Bank, and Emit Money at Intereſt, and how the Wiſdom of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly came to be of that ſide, I cannot ſay whether it is hard or eaſy to gueſs.</p>
            <p>I cannot help reciting the words of the Charter here: <hi>We do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Give, Grant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To Make, Ordain, and Establiſh all manner of Wholeſome and Reaſonable Orders, Laws, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and Ordinances, Directions and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either with Penalties or without, ſo as the ſame be not repugnant or contrary to the Laws of

this our Realm of</hi> England, <hi>as they ſhall judge to be for the Good and Welfare of our ſaid Province or Territory—And for the Welfare, Support, and Defence of the Government thereof.</hi> And a little after this General Clauſe, comes the Power of Impoſing Taxes. <hi>To Impoſe and Levy proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and reaſonable Aſſeſsments, Rates and Taxes upon the Estates, and Perſons, of all, and every the Proprietors, or Inhabitants of our ſaid Province or Territory, to be Iſſued and Diſpoſed of by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, under the Hand of the Governour of our ſaid Province, for the time being, with the Advice and Conſent of the Council, for our Service in the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Defence and Support of our Government, of our ſaid Province or Territory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which, and the Publicks Emitting Bills of Publick Credit upon Intereſt, we may make a few Remarks, for the Inveſtigating of Truth, ſo much embarraſſed by the Letter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place then, I would Remark, That by the Charter we have a Power to impoſe reaſonable Taxes, to be diſpoſed of by Warrant under the Hand of the Governour, with Conſent of the Council, for Defence and Support of the Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This being our Power and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, no Act of ours can alter the Power of Diſpoſing: for the following words according to ſuch Acts, can be underſtood I preſume, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than for the Uſes Raiſed, yet no ways alters the foregoing Clauſe of the Governours and Councils Powers of Judging &amp; Diſpoſing of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Clauſe for Impoſing and Levying
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001663_0017_0fb4d87b86fe2940"/>
Taxes coming after the General Power of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws in the Charter; can be I think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in no other ſenſe than a Limitation of the foregoing power, and the path of our Duty, in that of Taxing the People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Credit of every Freeholder is as much his Property as his Lands. Suppoſe a man gives his Obligatory Bill or Note to pay an <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds</hi> on Demand, or to take again in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho' he does it to ſerve a Friend in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, yet ſo paſſing his Bill in his own Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the principal Debtor, and the Poſſeſſor can look for no other, though the Perſon takes private Security for himſelf.</p>
            <p>If the General Court Emit Bills Obligatory upon the Province, whether they are not bound in Juſtice and Honour to make them good as much as private men; and whether it is not creating a Debt upon the Province for ſuch Sums as ſhall be ſo Emitted, which they muſt make good to the Poſſeſſor, which is a burden, and may be called a Tax with a Witneſs. Now it may well be Quaeried, How far a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Body or Free State has a power over, &amp; a right in the Credit, and the Properties of the Principals they repreſent? Whether a free People ſubmit their Eſtates any further to their Deputies, than to pay the Proportion of the Charge that ariſes for their mutual ſupport and Defence? Whether it would not be entring in ſuch a State on the Properties of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon, who is Lord of his Penny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

only has a right of Diſpoſing of his own. It is true, that the Repreſentative Body are ſaid to be the Keepers of the Peoples Purſe; but that can be underſtood by any Freeman I believe in no other ſence, than for what is, or ſhould be a common Charge; and to ſtate the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it is queſtionable, in a free State: May it not be much more ſo in a depending Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whoſe Powers are Limited by Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and are accountable for Uſurped Powers; but ſome ſay the Province runs no riſque, for they are to have the Profits, which are four &amp; an half <hi>per Cent.</hi> for all Emitted, which will pay all the Charge of the Government, and the People be ſet free in their Taxes, and that they may gain a Stock in the Treaſury—A Golden Bait. As for the Riſque the Province runs in the Principal and Intereſt, it is not yet determined; it is judged by ſome, and thoſe not the moſt unthinking, that it is great; in that the Security taken by the Truſtees if it comes to be ſued out, would be claimed for the Crown; for in our Charter we have not; as Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> had in his, the grant of that priviledge of the Forfeitures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of Lands; beſides the Colluſion that may be introduced, by ſuffering Lands to be forfeited and redeemed at half price; that as to the Profits and Income which is for His Majeſties Service in the Support of the Government, it being a Revenue to the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001663_0019_0fb4d87e856a46b8"/>
Crown; how natural does it ly inſtead of a Salary for a Governour to ask at Home, in a Line or two of Inſtructions for himſelf and all his Officers, as <hi>Lieutenant Governour, Secretary, Judges, Attorney General, Captain of the Castle, Surveyor General,</hi> &amp;c. which is not I hope the end intended, or the moſt grateful: Other difficulties referring to the Borrower, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be mentioned may ariſe; the Crown will not want Occaſions of Diſpoſing of their Revenues, which may ſeem on due reflection to over-ballance the gains propoſed: May it not be thought an hazard, if they ſhould go on to Emit greater Sums on ſuch a foundation, that the Crown may be invited to take away the Charter, and that for the ſake of the Money Emitted as forfeited? And may not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion be better thought on than expreſſed on ſuch en event? May not the old Maxim be of uſe to us here? that in doubtful Caſes the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is the ſafer. I am in duty bound, to ſuppoſe what has been done, was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by the Government in their diſtreſs; unto whom I am ſenſible we owe all poſſible deference and reſpect; and I aſſure you, none is more ready to pay it than I am; yet in ſuch a weighty caſe, truth ſtands the clearer in view, on a free, modeſt and rational enquiry: And ſince the Intereſt ariſing from thoſe Bills they ſay will be for the ſupport of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they will take the Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's

Opinion; he has given it, page 28. <hi>That this Government neither can, nor ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in any other Method, than by the Charter, and Instructions from the Crown,</hi> and I preſume this method is neither. And to Conclude this Argument, we have heard Sir, of Informations in the nature of <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi>; and this very Country has felt the weight of one, and upon the very ſcore of Invading the Prerogative, in the Article of Money, and doing what was ſaid we had no warrant from Charter to do; and certainly no Lover of this Country can wiſh them to take ſuch methods as may be tho't to put it in any hazard of a ſecond <hi>Quo warranto</hi>; no, none but ſuch as have not ſcope enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to get Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> extending Law Suits, to the enriching none but themſelves. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you Sir, I am the plainer on theſe Heads, in that I value the Liberties of my Country ſo dearly, as never to eſteem ſuch its beſt Friends, that are willing to part with them; and yet does not the diſputableneſs of this Power, if we ſhould go on in ſuch a method, ſhew that at leaſt we run the riſque of a ſecond; which if it ſhould take place, would not the Country (and with juſt cauſe) cry out, Ah! why did the Government hearken to Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi>'s Letter? Ah! Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> why did you ſo amuſe and ſlily argue them into it? And by the way, the very notion of a ſecond <hi>Quo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto,</hi> confirms what I ground much of this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001663_0021_0fb4d88245606b48"/>
Argument upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that what is not within the Grant of the Charter, is forbidden to us, and to be avoided. If after all that has been ſaid to the Power and Safety of the Publicks going on to Emit Bills Obligatory on the Country, which is making the Country Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Debtor, and to Let 'em out on Land Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, where is the Limitation of the Power? the Gentleman would do well to explain it; if the paying the Publick Charge and its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be not the boundaries and limitation, why may they not Emit <hi>Five Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> as a Fund of Trade, &amp; appoint Factors for the Government, that they may have the Profit? the difference ſeems only to be in the prudence, not in the power; how ſafe then is it Living in a Community where the Eſtates may be charged to anſwer more than the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon ſuch Projects, does not ſuch a Power render mens properties in their Eſtates very precarious? eſpecially ſince it is hinted, that the Repreſentatives may be kept by the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as long as a Prince lives; we may open a door wide enough for the getting Eſtates; it is but dividing a number of Bills amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and call it for the ſupport of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, according to that argument, and it is done. We have always looked upon it, That an empty Treaſury is very much our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; This Government thought it ſo when they appointed a Committee to burn the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

Thus Sir, I have given you ſome of the thoughts of the Town, and the Reaſons in particular, that ſway with me againſt a Publick Bank. The Reaſons why I prefer a Private Bank, are ſuch as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there will be no Invaſion of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; for every body as well as Mr. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi> will readily accknowledge that, <hi>they are not Money,</hi> page 11. And they may have the face and ſignature of Money, as much as the Bank Bills of <hi>England,</hi> that is none at all; for they carry nothing of Authority with them, but are only Notes on the Bank, paſſing from one to another, for ſo much value as is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them; which value being depoſited in the Bank, either in Lands or other imperiſhable Eſtate as the Original Fund, and the Obligation of the ſeveral Partners, to take 'em in all Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except Specialties, under a great penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gives Credit to the ſeveral Bills or Notes iſſued from the Bank.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor will a Private Bank open a door of Arbitrary Power to invade the Liberties of the People, by a Governours handling at his own pleaſure ſuch Sums as he has occaſion to make uſe of, to promote his own ends.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor is there any infringment of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the People, there is no Tax requiſite to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001663_0025_0fb4d88d10d24e10"/>
make good the fall of the Bank, no Publick Warrantee to ſecure it, but only the Eſtates of ſuch Gentlemen as are willing of their own accord to Mortgage 'm; that by the Security given, and their mutual agreement, their Notes ſhould have a Currency, that they might ſerve the Country, and themſelves in promoting the Trade of it; ſo that if the Bank be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it would hazard only their particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It may be Carried on as other Merchant-like Affairs, by Factors or Truſtees, without offence to the Crown, or Government; This being the head of Argument that bears the Countenance of reaſoning in Mr. <hi>Attorneys</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I ſhall Remark: I take it for granted, that it is the Natural Right of <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Trade, and to carry it on in ſuch Methods, as they ſhall conceive to be moſt advantageous to them; and that in order thereto, they have a right to take one anothers Word, Note or Bond, as the Caſe may require, with due regard had to Juſtice, and the power of the Legiſlature, to enlarge and limit this Trade, as ſhall be tho't moſt ſuitable to the Honour of the Crown, &amp; the Publick Weal: It is in the liberty of any in Trade, to enter into a Covenant, to take one anothers Notes, and that they might be better known, they may agree upon ſome perſons to form thoſe Notes under their hands for them; &amp; on their making over ſuch Security as there

Thus the Private Bankers in <hi>Lumbard-street</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Notes, and that on Intereſt too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being tho't ſo; Our Fathers about Twenty eight years ago, entred into a Partnerſhip to Circulate their Notes founded on Land Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtamped on Paper, as our Province Bills, which gave no offence to the Government then, and that at a time, when the Prerogative of the Crown was extended further than ever has been ſince; What Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> ſays of the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> that they obtained an Act of Parliament for their Support is true, yet proves nothing to his purpoſe; for altho' a Company can manage their Affairs better, and in a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er method, for their mutual Security by a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or Charter of Incorporation, and with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. It appears plain, that the Limitation of the Act is to <hi>England,</hi> and that during the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Bank; and ſo is of no force in the Plantations or <hi>Ireland.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. It implies that the Law of <hi>England</hi> does not look on every number of Partners to be a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration purely for their being Partners; and Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> quoting my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s deſcription of a Corporation, and his applying it to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen concerned in the Projection, is nothing but an amuſement, and deſerves no Anſwer, in that none of the Eſſentials to ſuch a Body was pretended to by them: for a Pattent from the Crown, which gives the Form and Being to a Corporation, was but hoped for.</p>

On the contrary, the Projection for a Private Fund of Credit, which ſince I began this Letter, I hear is coming out in Print, that all may judge of it, and no doubt will be acceptable to the Country; is ſo well founded and ſecured, that were they permitted to proceed and Emit their Notes, would furniſh us with a Medium of Exchange; the Landed man might either be Concerned in the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or might borrow Credit without any fear of a ſudden or ſurprizing demand, to the prejudice of his Affairs, might Stock his Farm, and be able to leſſen his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, as his Product would enable him; it would be a certain reſort for men to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Credit on any Emergency; it gives the Induſtrious an opportunity of improving their Lands to greater advantage, which would increaſe the Export of the Country, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
