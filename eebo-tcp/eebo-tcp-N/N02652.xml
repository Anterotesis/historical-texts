            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE Pſalm immediately under our view is of this character, in which the Royal Prophet undertakes to vindicate the diſpenſations of Divine Providence, from every objection of injuſtice, unfaithfulneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, with which the ſons of profaneſs might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and blaſpheme them. From the conſideration of the righteouſneſs and equity in the dealings of GOD moſt high, to men upon the earth, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> perſwades to the exerciſe of patience and holineſs, and directs us where to look for that real felicity, after which our eyes wander, and our hearts inceſſantly pant. The inſpired reaſoner concludes with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, exciting all the ſincerely pious, that they by no means be diſcouraged from the ſervice of their Lord, and enforces the exhortation by ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and arguments. The laſt of theſe is, the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ENDS</hi> of the <hi>righteous</hi> and the <hi>wicked.</hi> Both the righteous and the wicked muſt <hi>come to an end;</hi> For <hi>it is appointed unto all men once to die,</hi> and <hi>what man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> But how <hi>wide</hi> and <hi>diſtant</hi> are the ends of theſe two very different parties of men? <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the END of that man is peace. But the tranſgreſſors ſhall be deſtroyed together, the END of the wicked ſhall be cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the words of my Text, there are three evident diviſions, which I ſhall diſtinguiſh into <hi>deſcriptive, doctrinal,</hi> and <hi>practical.</hi> Theſe I ſhall conſider in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE <hi>deſcriptive;</hi> in which, we have the <hi>CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACTER of the good man: PERFECT and UP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGHT. Mark the perfect man, &amp; behold the upright.</hi> Theſe two terms, <hi>Perfection &amp; Uprightneſs,</hi> are a ſhort, but a moſt comprehenſive character of an heir to caeleſtial and unfading glories. They are a very compendious and brief epitomie of the heart and life of a ſincere chriſtian: The fair lines of his character are here drawn, but in miniature, exact, and elegant. PERFECT and UPRIGHT: Perhaps, on the one hand, ſome would confine the meaning too cloſe, and take both the words to ſignify the ſame
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003144_0005_0FF07E28E2A6C210"/>thing. Like <hi>Pharoah's</hi> dreams, they will ſay, <hi>the words are one, and the interpretation is one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OTHERS may perhaps ſtrain them too far, and be willing to make a devout remark, which however it may entertain the Fancy, and be true in it ſelf, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may not have the weight of a demonſtration with the judgment, as being otherwiſe than <hi>prettily</hi> deduced from this immediate text. PERFECT, ſay they, that is <hi>internally</hi> holy; UPRIGHT, that is <hi>externally</hi> religious. It is, without doubt a true character of a ſervant of GOD, that he is holy both in heart and life; but whether the two branches of my Text point moſt accurately at theſe two parts of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I ſhall not here pretend to determine.</p>
            <p>BUT that I may conſider the words in a ſuitable latitude and clearneſs, I ſhall ſhow how they appear to me, in a more particular anſwer to the queſtion, <hi>WHAT is the PERFECTION which good men attain to in this life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN diſcuſſing this enquiry I ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">I. Negatively. <hi>BY the word PERFECT in the text we are not to underſtand SINLESS Perfection.</hi> This is a degree of felicity not attainable by men, while they dwell in <hi>this preſent evil world.</hi> Of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> men, it is ſtrictly true, what we read, in Pſal. XIV. 3. <hi>They are ALL gone aſide, they are ALTOGETHER become filthy; There is NONE that doth good, no NOT ONE.</hi> And even of thoſe <hi>renewed by the SPIRIT of our GOD,</hi> it is as infallibly certain, I. Joh. i. 8. <hi>If we ſay we have NO SIN, we deceive our ſelves, &amp; the truth is not in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED if we take perfection in the <hi>rigid ſenſe</hi> of the word, it means ſomething beyond what any <hi>created Being</hi> may aſſume to it ſelf; <hi>ſupremely and divinely good.</hi> And in this reſpect, ſurely <hi>there is none good but one, that is, GOD,</hi> Mat. XIX. 17.</p>
            <p>BUT in a <hi>larger ſenſe,</hi> moral perfection is applied to <hi>Creatures,</hi> and ſignifies <hi>a ſtate entirely free from all ſin.</hi> Such is the bleſſedneſs of the holy Angels, theſe ſons of perfection, and poſſeſſors of unſullied purity: And ſuch is the <hi>honour of all the Saints,</hi> in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003144_0006_0FF07E2C0EA7C908"/>the conſecrated manſions above. There, in a moſt exalted ſenſe, they <hi>ſtand PERFECT and compleat in ALL the will of</hi> GOD; and are moſt emphatically called, <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made PERFECT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, in this world, alas, it is far otherwiſe: For <hi>there is not a juſt man upon earth, that doeth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. vii. 10. This is a truth very eaſy to be proved from <hi>reaſon,</hi> from <hi>ſcripture,</hi> from <hi>example,</hi> and from our own unhappy <hi>experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WAS there ever a <hi>meer man,</hi> upon earth, ſince the fall of ADAM, that had a perfect <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the Law of GOD. It reaches to <hi>every action</hi> of life; to <hi>every word</hi> we ſpeak or <hi>ought</hi> to ſpeak; to <hi>every thought</hi> in our minds, or that <hi>ſhould</hi> be there. It <hi>forbids</hi> ſin at <hi>all times,</hi> and there is <hi>no ſeaſon</hi> but there is ſome <hi>particular duty</hi> which it commands and exacts. In a word, <hi>the commandment is exceeding broad:</hi> ſo <hi>broad,</hi> that the mind of no man, weakned and obſcured by the fall, can ever ſo much as fully <hi>underſtand</hi> it. It is plain then, if no man can have a compleat underſtanding of the divine law, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully <hi>practiſe</hi> it: For it is firſt neceſſary to <hi>know</hi> in order to <hi>do</hi> our duty. Thus DAVID admires, Pſal. xix. 7. <hi>The Law of the LORD is PERFECT</hi>—and no wonder then, he exclaims, ver. 12. <hi>Who can UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERSTAND his Errors? cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi> Thus we ſee <hi>reaſon</hi> gives it, that as the law of GOD is of too wide a compaſs to be <hi>fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended</hi> by ſinful man; ſo, by conſequence, it cannot be <hi>compleatly practiſed,</hi> any more than <hi>ignorance</hi> can be the <hi>mother</hi> of rational <hi>devotion.</hi> To this we may ſubjoyn <hi>another</hi> argument, namely, that did we fully underſtand the moral commands, yet <hi>no man perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes up to what he knows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHO among the preſuming ſons of men, after he has performed <hi>one</hi> ſingle duty, dares look back on it and appeal to GOD, that he ſees no <hi>ſinful defect</hi> in it, for which he deſires a pardon? Not one among the deluded mortals, that boaſt a perfection in this life, dares venture upon this tryal; and truly if they did, what would it prove, but their impudence and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003144_0007_0FF08599023FA730"/>vain conceit? <hi>GOD I thank thee,</hi> ſaid the proud Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, while he ſtood and careſſed himſelf, and run the inſolent diſparity, <hi>GOD I thank thee, that I am not as other men, — or even as this publican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SURELY if any mortal might have aſſerted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this life, who would have been more likely than the admirable <hi>PAUL,</hi> who was the holieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt holy, and <hi>came not behind the very chief of the Apoſtles.</hi> Yet this is the very man, whom the HOLY GHOST ſelects out, to inſpire his moving lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with thoſe pathetick and mournful ſentiments, which flow through the vii. Chap. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſee from the 14. ver. <hi>For we know that the law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal, ſold under ſin. For that which I do, I allow not; for what I would that I do not; but what I hate, that do I.—For I know, that in me (that is in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is preſent with me, but to perform that which is good I find not. For the good which I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.—I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me. — I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the law of ſin, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> And is this indeed PAUL? the devout, the laborious, the moſt excellent PAUL! the very ſame who could tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in thoſe harmonious and gallant periods of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, II. Cor. xi. from the 21 ver.—<hi>Where in ſoever any is bold, I am bold alſo. Are they Hebrews? ſo am I: are they Iſraelites? ſo am I: are they the ſeed of Abraham? ſo am I: are they miniſters of CHRIST? I am more: in labours more abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I ſtoned, thrice I ſuffered ſhipwrack; a night and a day have I been in the deep: In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in

Beſides thoſe things which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</hi> Who would imagine that theſe two, are the deſcriptions of the ſame perſon! That he who <hi>was</hi> ſo excellent, and <hi>did</hi> ſo much, ſhould cry out, <hi>Oh! the body of death!</hi> Yet, this is he; the great <hi>Paul,</hi> the renowned doctor of the <hi>Gentibes.</hi> By chooſing out this diſtinguiſhed Hero of Chriſtianity, to fill his tongue with the lamentation of ſin polluting all his duties, the HOLY SPIRIT ſeems to have pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the fitteſt perſon in the world, to ſtop the mouth of gainſayers. For when a character ſo great and exalted as that of the Apoſtle PAUL, owns the blemiſhes of ſin, what petty mortal preſumes to ſtand up, and boaſt his ſuperiour attainments? The Man, who drove on unrivalled through the race of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and flung even the Apoſtles themſelves at an humble diſtance; to hear his confeſſions of defect and ſin: with what pity, and contempt, and indignation muſt we hear a grovelling ſet of Enthuſiaſts, pour out their abſurdities and nonſenſe, in ſelf-applauſes at their own more untarniſhed Holineſs? None of them ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſay, <hi>He himſelf</hi> has attained Perfection; but they all it ſeems agree together, that it is ſcattered, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly, ſomewhere among their conceited numbers.—<hi>No doubt they are the people, and</hi> Perfection <hi>ſhall die with them.</hi>—</p>
            <p>As there has been enough ſaid to confute this vain and arogant opinion, of a ſinleſs perfection attainable in this life, ſo the objections and cavils againſt the true Doctrine in this reſpect, may be as eaſily obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and overthrown. It happens very uncomfortably for the aſſerters of Perfection, that all the texts they bring to eſtabliſh their error, lie ſo near other texts which explain them in a different ſenſe, that a man muſt be very ſenſibly <hi>given up to ſtrong deluſions</hi> before he can <hi>believe</hi> ſo evident <hi>a lie.</hi>

Do the <hi>Scriptures call ſome men perfect?</hi> it happens very well for our doctrine, that there is not one meer man called ſo, but ſome ſin of his is alſo recorded, to prevent miſtakes about the matter. Was <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. vi. 9.</note> NOAH <hi>a juſt man, &amp; PERFECT in his generations?</hi> This ſame NOAH, we are informed, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. ix. 20, 21.</note> lay <hi>drunk</hi> and <hi>uncovered in his tent.</hi> Was ASA'S <hi>heart PERFECT with the Lord all his days.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">2. Chron. xv. 17.</note> In the very next Chapter four of his Crimes are tranſmitted down to poſterity. Did HEZEKIAH <hi>walk before GOD with a PERFECT heart,</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">2 Kin. xx. 3.</note> yet did the ſin of HEZEKIAH <hi>bring wrath upon him and upon Judah, and upon Jeruſalem.</hi> Even our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ABRAHAM himſelf, to whom the command was given, <hi>walk before me and be thou PERFECT,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xvii. 1.</note> even HE, the faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> failed in that very grace wherein lay his chiefeſt excellency. He was twice over reproved by a heathen, for a crime into which he was betrayed through diffidence and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. See <hi>Gen.</hi> xii.12—. xx.—. In a word, let the pretenders to perfection, look over the Scriptures, and produce from thence their meer man without ſin.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS they will give up their argument from example, and lie intrenched rather under ſome <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> which commands perfection. They will frame their plea thus: Are we not plainly <hi>commanded to be perfect?</hi> Now is it reaſonable to imagine that we ſhould be required to perform an impracticable duty? There needs no other anſwer to the objection, than to cite the very text they allude to, Mat. v. 48. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</hi> No man can underſtand this literally; or take it otherwiſe, than as a command to endeavour after perfection, as much as ever he can. And that this ſhould be our <hi>endeavour</hi> is agreed by all: But that ever it will be our attainment in this World, ſtill remains to be proved.</p>
            <p>THE laſt argument I ſhall take notice of, urged by the aſſerters of perfect holineſs in this Life, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003144_0010_0FF085A1961A5340"/>from ſome texts, which ſeem to a careleſs eye, to look that way: But theſe too, all lie near ſuch places, as very effectually explain their meaning. In the Epiſtle of <hi>James,</hi> Chap. iii. 2. we are told, <hi>If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man.</hi> It is well however that the very words before are, <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> So that there can be no difficulty in this text. But the moſt noted paſſages which theſe men produce, are in the 1ſt. Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> particularly, Chap. iii. 9. <hi>He that is born of GOD ſinneth not.</hi> Methinks this Epiſtle of all others, ſhould be the moſt unlikely to find favour with theſe men. The firſt chapter of it, is directly armed to overthrow their tottering foundation. See 8 and 10. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us. If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</hi> To conclude, There is no way for theſe men to prove their point out of this Epiſtle without making the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired author contradict himſelf. I ſhall here diſmiſs this point, and make ſome <hi>poſitive anſwer</hi> to the Queſtion. <hi>What is that perfection good men attain to in this life,</hi> ſpoken of in the Text?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>IT implies INTENTIONAL Perfection.</hi> In this particular the text explains it ſelf, and <hi>perfection</hi> means <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> and ſincerity. <hi>Mark the PERFECT man, and behold the UPRIGHT.</hi> If good men are not <hi>poſitively</hi> perfect, yet they are <hi>intentionally</hi> ſo; and though they can never in this life fully <hi>acquire</hi> this felicity, yet they are always <hi>endeavouring</hi> after it. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> at the ſame time calls himſelf <hi>perfect,</hi> and yet ſays he <hi>has not attained</hi> to perfection. Phil. iii. 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>NOT as though I had already AT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINED, or were already PERFECT, but I follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.—Brethren, I COUNT NOT my ſelf to have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. But this one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind; and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſs forward toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of GOD in CHRIST Jeſus. Let US therefore, as many as be PERFECT, be THUS MINDED.</hi> This was the Goſpel preached by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003144_0011_0FF07DB14C83EF08"/>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> that though he had <hi>not arrived</hi> to perfection in the <hi>ſtrict ſenſe</hi> of the Word, yet, while he <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> after it, he might in the ſenſe of the Goſpel come into the number of <hi>as many as were perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the ſame concluſion rears it ſelf, on a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Job</hi> i. 1. with <hi>Job.</hi> ix. 20. In the firſt of theſe <hi>Job</hi> is called a <hi>PERFECT and UPRIGHT man, one that feared GOD, and eſchewed evil.</hi> And in the other <hi>Job</hi> himſelf pronounces, <hi>If I juſtify my ſelf, my own mouth ſhall condemn me; if I ſay I am 'PERFECT', it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> Hence it plainly follows, that <hi>Job's perfection</hi> was only <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> and ſignified no more than that he <hi>feared GOD,</hi> and <hi>eſchewed evil;</hi> that is, <hi>endeavoured after perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this is a perfection which belongs to all good men. They DESIRE to be perfect; their <hi>deſire</hi> forms itſelf into a ſettled PURPOSE to purſue it; their <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> produces an ENDEAVOUR; their <hi>endeavour</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates their SINCERITY, and their <hi>ſincerity</hi> is a <hi>Goſpel</hi> PERFECTION.</p>
            <p>INDEED if we conſider how ſincerity operates in a good man, we ſhall obſerve ſome <hi>reſemblance</hi> of a <hi>real perfection</hi> in it. The regards of a holy Man to the new Covenant, flame with the pureſt ardor, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with a direct integrity. He is entirely for GOD, and aims at his glory, with a ſingle eye, and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart. Though he obeys the Law of GOD <hi>but in part,</hi> yet he obeys <hi>every part</hi> of it: That is; tho' he cannot <hi>fully</hi> come up to <hi>any</hi> ſingle precept of it, yet, there is <hi>no</hi> ſingle precept, which he does not <hi>endeavour</hi> to come up to. So that though the <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith</hi> is not <hi>ſinleſs,</hi> yet it is <hi>univerſal;</hi> and this both in regard to the <hi>perſon</hi> obeying, and the <hi>law</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
            <p>IT is univerſal in reſpect of the <hi>perſon obeying;</hi> becauſe he obſerves it with his whole ſpirit, ſoul, and body, and ſubmits it both <hi>externally</hi> and <hi>internally.</hi> Thus runs the exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> iv. 8. <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purify your hearts ye double-minded.</hi> The <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> here ſpecified, have a plain reference to the two conſtituant parts of man, <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul.</hi>

IT is the care of the man of GOD, to preſent his BODY as well as <hi>his ſpirit a living ſacrifice to GOD;</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>members</hi> that ſupport and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn it, he improves as the members of his LORD JESUS CHRIST. The ſeveral <hi>ſenſes</hi> of his Body too, the holy man dedicates to the GOD who contrived their curious conſtitution, and maintains their various powers of action and delight. His <hi>EYES diſcover</hi> the image of the Deity clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from the glaſs of nature, and the will of GOD more clearly revealed in the mirrour of his word; and are then <hi>lifted up</hi> to heaven, in admiration and praiſe. His <hi>EARS</hi> catch the glad tydings of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and attend devoutly at the ſacred place of thunder; and not only ſo, but they endeavour to learn ſomething forGOD in the moſt trifling or vain <hi>Company.</hi> His Food reliſhes upon his <hi>PALATE</hi> with a finer flavour, and a ſtronger guſt, when <hi>he eats to the glory of GOD,</hi> and therein <hi>taſtes that the LORD is gracious.</hi> The Fields do not breathe their odors upon him, and render the air about him a perfume, without his articulating the <hi>ſcented</hi> breath in ſounds of gratitude and thanksgiving. He does with his might, what his <hi>HANDS</hi> find to do, and his <hi>FEET</hi> are directed in right paths, while, like his JESUS upon Earth, he <hi>walks about</hi> conſtantly <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good.</hi> He calls upon his <hi>TONGUE, awake my glory</hi> to praiſe the <hi>LORD:</hi> And to what end, <hi>ſays he,</hi> have I my <hi>voice,</hi> but to praiſe thee <hi>aloud with joyful LIPS.</hi> In fine, the whole <hi>body</hi> of the good man, and all the <hi>members</hi> and <hi>ſenſes</hi> of it, are dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of GOD, and employed in the ſacred exerciſe.</p>
            <p>AND not only does he <hi>ſerve GOD in his body,</hi> but with <hi>his SPIRIT alſo which belongs to GOD.</hi> The HEART is the <hi>principalthing,</hi> &amp; to this both the pious man, and his GOD have a principal regard. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant watch over his own heart, is <hi>eſſential</hi> in the character of the holy man. Wherever he <hi>walks,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he <hi>does,</hi> this is his care, and the ſerious bent of his thoughts. This is a ſecret and ſilent, but a great work, and makes the upright heart, conſcious to many <hi>joys which a ſtranger intermedles not with;</hi> and alſo
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003144_0013_0FF085A9E0A9E0A0"/>to <hi>know its own bitterneſs,</hi> and <hi>feel its own plague,</hi> which none elſe can be a witneſs to. Hence we read of the <hi>hidden life of a chriſtian,</hi> Col. iii. 3. and of the <hi>hidden man of the heart,</hi> I. Pet. iii. 4. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every <hi>power</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> of the pious ſoul is conſecrated to the glory of GOD. This ſacred em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment forever furniſhes its <hi>invention</hi> with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing labour; renews its <hi>memory</hi> to a ſweet recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; exerciſes its <hi>judgment</hi> in a rational debate; and kindles its <hi>affections</hi> with a holy rapture. Thus we ſee the obedience of the chriſtian to the divine Law, is univerſal in reſpect of the PERSON <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> that is, both parts of the man yield obedience, even every <hi>faculty</hi> of his SOUL, and every <hi>member</hi> of his BODY.</p>
            <p>AND if we conſider the <hi>LAW obeyed,</hi> the obedience is <hi>univerſal</hi> in regard to that too. The ſincere chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an endeavours a conformity to the <hi>whole</hi> moral law, without any exception, and <hi>counts none of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments grievous.</hi> Both tables of the decalogue make but one ſyſtem of rules for the direction of his life. His <hi>GOD,</hi> his <hi>neighbour,</hi> and <hi>himſelf,</hi> are all the objects of his becoming care and ſolicitude. That nicely-drawn Scheme of practical religion, <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 12. is but a regular ſketch of his life, <hi>Denying all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and every worldly luſt, he lives ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godiily, in this preſent world; looking for the</hi> glorious rewards of another. Here is contained both the <hi>negative</hi> and <hi>poſitive epitome</hi> of his <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> He <hi>forbears</hi> to do what the law <hi>forbids, denying all ungodlineſs, and every worldly luſt:</hi> and as it <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> he lives <hi>ſoberly</hi> with regard to <hi>himſelf; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly</hi> with reſpect to his <hi>neighbour;</hi> and <hi>godlily</hi> with reference to his <hi>Maker;</hi> while at the ſame time the <hi>internal</hi> principle is declated <hi>looking</hi> to future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. So his bleſſed LORD upon Earth, was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeperate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. vii. 26. <hi>Holy</hi> before <hi>GOD, harmleſs</hi> towards <hi>men,</hi> and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in <hi>himſelf;</hi> while, in a <hi>negative</hi> character, he was <hi>ſeparate from ſinners.</hi>

THIS is the picture of the <hi>PERFECT</hi> and <hi>UP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGHT man,</hi> ſpoken of in our Text; and indeed none but he, is <hi>univerſal</hi> in his obedience to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law. The <hi>bypocrite</hi> is quite of <hi>another character,</hi> forever <hi>partial</hi> in his obedience, and ſtill rolls ſome beloved luſt as a ſweet morſel under his tongue, which he will by no means part with. Nor can the moſt painted among that unhappy generation be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed any further than he, Mar. vi. 20. <hi>He did MANY things. Many</hi> things; not <hi>all.</hi> But ſo much for the firſt thing, that the good man is <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> perfect. To proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>HE is perfect by IMPUTATION.</hi> And in this ſenſe, the believer is perfect in the <hi>ſtricteſt</hi> ſenſe of the word, as it can be applied to <hi>creatures: Fully,</hi> and <hi>completely</hi> perfect. The imputation of CHRIST'S righteouſneſs, gives the faithful a claim to a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without ſpot or blemiſh. The true Chriſtian, holy as he <hi>is,</hi> and perfect as he <hi>endeavours to be,</hi> forever renounces <hi>his own righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſtands <hi>perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD</hi> in the <hi>imputed righteouſneſs</hi> of the Mediator. This is moſt emphatically expreſſed in that humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and ardor of our Apoſtle, Phil. iii. 7, 8, 9. <hi>What things are gain to me I count loſs for CHRIST. Yea, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of CHRIST JESUS my Lord — and do count them but dung that I may win CHRIST, and be found in him, not having my OWN righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but THAT which is THROUGH FAITH in CHRIST, the RIGHTEOUSNESS which is of GOD BY FAITH.</hi> In like manner the ignorance and vain-conceit of thoſe who go about to eſtabliſh a <hi>righteouſneſs of their own,</hi> are detected by the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. x. 4. <hi>For CHRIST is the end of the law for RIGHTEOUSNESS to every one that believeth.</hi> But it is not eaſy to expreſs any thing more plainly than this matter is declared in the <hi>fifth</hi> chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi> See from the 12 verſe, where the Apoſtle treats this ſubject at large. I am not concerned to know what ſubtilties the <hi>unlearned and unſtable</hi> may uſe to <hi>wreſt</hi> this paſſage of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtle:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003144_0015_0FF085B0C51813C0"/>But ſure they will at leaſt keep from contradicting the Dictrine as <hi>we</hi> here lay it down; for the ſame <hi>Trick</hi> which will evade the <hi>Apoſile's Argument,</hi> will alſo ſerve to explain all that <hi>we aſſert</hi> according to their own Scheme. I do not ſee how it is poſſible to deliver this Doctrine in plainer and fewer words than thoſe, <hi>As by one man's DISOBEDIENCE many were made SINNERS; ſo, by the OBEDIENCE of one, ſhall many be made RIGHTEOUS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, this <hi>Juſtification</hi> by the <hi>imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST, is ſo evidently aſſerted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the holy writings, that a man muſt be more cunning than ordinary; who can perſwade them to a different confeſſion. No doubt the various <hi>Racks</hi> of the <hi>Critick,</hi> or the <hi>Commentator</hi> (men who have a wonderful knack to <hi>illuſtrate away the meaning</hi> of the cleareſt texts, and <hi>explain them into nonſenſe</hi>) no doubt, but the <hi>artificial engines</hi> of theſe men may pervert the plaineſt words, and extort half a dozen contradictions from every verſe in the New Teſtament: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their ingenuity may pleaſe themſelves, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a few Gentlemen of their own opinions, yet they will never be able to convince the ſerious inquirer after truth, or weaken the authority of the inſpired oracles; to a mind at the ſame time devout and rational.</p>
            <p>IF then the Scriptures declare the <hi>rightcouſneſs of CHRIST imputed to the true believer,</hi> no wonder he is called the <hi>PERFECT MAN.</hi> This is the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing glory of the ſons of GOD among men; and this honour have all the ſaints. The radiant attire of his <hi>Saviour's righteouſneſs</hi> ſhines over the <hi>juſtified</hi> ſoul of the <hi>perfect man.</hi> This untarniſhed and dazling robe, renders it approved and beauteous in the eyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Not the ſtrict and impartial juſtice of GOD can charge it with the leaſt defect, adorned ſo illuſtrious and magnificent. Not an angel in the imperial city above ſparkles in the circle of ſo divine a ſplendour; nor does the whole conſtellation of morning ſtars blend their beams in an equal glory.</p>
            <p>STAND ſtill then, <hi>Mark the PERFECT man! and behold the UPRIGHT! Take notice</hi> and <hi>obſerve</hi> his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003144_0016_0FF085B2AE56C718"/>Character. <hi>PERFECT;</hi> that is, <hi>JUSTIFIED</hi> by the <hi>imputation</hi> of a <hi>perfect righteouſneſs,</hi> even <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s. <hi>UPRIGHT;</hi> that is, <hi>SANCTIFIED</hi> by the <hi>HOLY SPIRIT.</hi> Thus is the good man <hi>PERFECT as he who has called him is PERFECT;</hi> and he walks in the <hi>ſhining path of the juſt, which riſes more and more unto the PERFECT day!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE come now to the SECOND main thing in the Text, which may properly enough be called the DOCTRINAL <hi>part</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THE perfect and upright man has PEACE in his END.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a great miſtake to imagine that there is no peace in the <hi>way</hi> of a true Believer; for certainly his <hi>WAYS are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all</hi> his <hi>paths are peace;</hi> Prov. iii. 17. But it is ſurely a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er error to ſuppoſe that the <hi>end</hi> of his way is not peaceful and happy. Nay, <hi>the END of that man is PEACE;</hi> a <hi>PEACE paſſing all underſtanding,</hi> and a <hi>peace</hi> without any <hi>end</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>BUT for the clearer illuſtration of this matter; we may here make a <hi>conceſſion,</hi> and acknowledge that <hi>the death of believers may ſometimes be attended with uneaſy and grievous circumſtances.</hi> When we aſſert the peaceful end of the good man, we do not always mean to baniſh from his death-bed, every thing of a frightful and ghaſtly aſpect; and ſpread ſun-ſhine and ſerenity over the gloomy vale. No; the pious man may die in ſuch a manner, as to wear quite a <hi>different face</hi> from that of <hi>peace,</hi> in the unſanctified eye. All may ſeem to end in a tragedy; his ſun may ſet in a cloud; and the grave may open a hideous mouth, and gape upon him black and diſmal. The righteous and unerring Providence of GOD in this World, makes no diſtinguiſhing and conſtant difference between the holy and impious. <hi>For we ſee that WISE MEN DIE, likewiſe the FOOL and the BRUITISH PERSON periſh. And HOW dieth the WISE MAN? as the FOOL,</hi> Eccl. ii. 14, 15, 16. <hi>The WISE MAN—and the FOOL—I my ſelf perceived that ONE EVENT happened to them all. Then ſaid I to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003144_0017_0FF085B475A801F8"/>my ſelf, as it happeneth to the FOOL, ſo it happeneth unto ME; and why was I then more WISE?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE equal diſtributious of providence, in regard to the juſt and the unjuſt, for ever check the daring pride of the men who would judge of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours uprightneſs, by the events that befall them. It is a vain arrogance to judge a man's eſtate in the <hi>other world,</hi> by the manner of his expiration <hi>here:</hi> And it is a vain preſumption to expect that all good men ſhould die with the <hi>outward ſigns of peace,</hi> and basking in the viſible dawn of a future bleſſedneſs. Our bleſſed Saviour has warned us againſt theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and uncharitable cenſures, Luk. xiii. 1-5. <hi>There were preſent at that ſeaſon, ſome that told him of the Galileans, whoſe blood Pilate had mingled with the ſacrifices: And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto them, ſuppoſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you, NAY: — Or thoſe eighteen, upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and ſlew them, think ye that they were ſinners above all men which dwelt in Jeruſalem? I tell you, NAY:</hi>— Thus the death of good men may ſometimes look with an awful and ſurprizing aſpect; far from peace and calm. They may <hi>die</hi> by <hi>caſualties;</hi> like thoſe ſlain of <hi>Siloam:</hi> They may be <hi>afflicted</hi> with <hi>grievous diſeaſes;</hi> like the upright <hi>Job:</hi> they may be <hi>murdered</hi> by the <hi>cruelties of martyrdom;</hi> as the righteous <hi>Abel:</hi> or they may be <hi>ſtruck</hi> by the <hi>immediate hand of heaven;</hi> as the too-zealous <hi>Uzziah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NAY, what is moſt of all dreadful, a good man may die in great dejection of mind: and inſtead of peace, his whole ſoul may be in a tumult; and the ſound of war, may alarm his laſt moments. GOD may hide his face from him; and withdraw the ſenſe of his love. The <hi>Devil</hi> may be let looſe, and urge his onſets with redoubled <hi>ſury, becauſe be knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> In a word, the good man may die with all poſſible circumſtances of horror and anguiſh, except an <hi>abſolute deſpair.</hi>

BUT is this any objection to the truth of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <hi>The END of that man is PEACE?</hi> Surely no: even amidſt all the ſhuddering of this agony, and though the thundering tempeſt beat with the utmoſt outrage upon the departing ſaint; yet is there peace and calm in it all. Faith ſhews the heavenly calm of paradiſe, far-diſtant, behind this momentary tumult: and let the winds riſe, the waves roar, and the ſtorm thicken and grow black in the cloudy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere below: Yet above does the ether ſhine ever clear and ſerene; and the climate is eternally pure, and ſoft, and indulgent. There the ſun-beams play about without the leaſt ſtain or obſtruction; but the whole ample ſpace, ſeems but one unbounded ocean of flame and glory. Nay, even all the preſent afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the grief of ſoul, and the pangs of death; it is all intended for the advantage of the good man; and ſhall only promote his flight to the ſmiling regions, <hi>where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the weary are at reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING made this <hi>conceſſion,</hi> and conſidered the <hi>objection</hi> which might ariſe from it, I ſhall now ſhow, <hi>HOW the END of the perfect and upright man is PEACE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A good man dies in a STATE of PEACE and reconciliation to GOD.</hi> Sin has made a terrible controverſy between GOD and man; while man is become the rebel, and GOD the avenger. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition in which the fallen race of <hi>Adam</hi> ſtand with relation to the holy GOD, is like that, Zach. xi. 8. — <hi>My ſoul loathed them, and their ſoul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT though the ſtate of the unregenerate is thus unhappy and diſmal, while <hi>GOD holds them for his enemies:</hi> Yet it is much otherwiſe with true believers. The difference between GOD and them is made up. GOD is at <hi>peace</hi> with <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are <hi>reconciled</hi> to GOD. Rom. v. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have PEACE with GOD, through our Lord Jeſus CHRIST.</hi> That bleſſed <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> has <hi>made</hi> peace for us; He has <hi>bought</hi> it with his <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> it to us by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003144_0019_0FF085BC818EC208"/>his <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> He has drawn up the <hi>articles</hi> of it, in his <hi>new and everlaſting Covenant;</hi> and ſettled it upon ſtrong foundations, forever fixed and immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There it ſtands like a mighty city, of the fineſt ſymmetry and proportion: <hi>divine wiſdom</hi> is the <hi>archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect; divine truth</hi> the <hi>baſis,</hi> and it is <hi>ſupported</hi> upon the <hi>pillars of omnipotence.</hi> Surely the death thus defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſecured, cannot but be <hi>really</hi> peaceable and bleſſed. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE is not only a <hi>real</hi> peace in the death of believers, but it is very often attended with a <hi>SENSE of that happy and glorious PEACE.</hi> They have frequently a <hi>taſte</hi> of peace, as well as always a <hi>ſtate</hi> of peace, when they come to die. <hi>TO DYE!</hi> alas, how improper the phraſe for our purpoſe here! Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is a <hi>ſleeping in JESUS;</hi> an entrance into reſt, and into glory. A ſoft tranſition to the upper World; a ſhort ſtep to a full reward of our labours. <hi>DEATH!</hi> Tis but the opening of the gates of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; and though they may ſometimes ſeem to grate upon their hinges, and affright the ſoul with a jarring ſound; yet how often do they, on the contrary, move ſmooth and eaſy, and ring their golden harmony in the ears of the dying ſaint. <hi>Open, ye gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. Thou wilt keep him in PERFECT PEACE, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee: becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> Iſai. xxvi. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>OH! happy condition of the expiring good man! O peace divinely ſweet, and divinely full! Death if ſelf is no longer an <hi>enemy,</hi> but a <hi>friend</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion welcome to a triumphing ſoul. <hi>O death,</hi> he ſhouts aloud, <hi>O DEATH! where is thy ſting? O GRAVE where is thy victory?</hi> His <hi>conſcience</hi> now when he has oſt need of it, appears for him, and anticipates the ſentence of his Judge. It pronounces, <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervant, thou ſhalt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently enter into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> His SAVIOUR now ſpeaks peace to him, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.</hi> GOD his FATHER, with ſmiling lips, and an enlightened countenance, tells him, <hi>SON, be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> The HOLY
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003144_0020_0FF085BE1046F630"/>SPIRIT becomes in him, a ſpirit of <hi>adoption,</hi> and of <hi>conſolation;</hi> inſpires him with a noble courage, and tranſports him with a full aſſurance. The attending <hi>Angels</hi> that hover round his curtains, to receive the diſ-united ſoul, are buſy to ſtrengthen him in his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. They ſay, <hi>Fear not, our friend, for thou haſt found favour with GOD: Hail! thou that art highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, the Lord is with thee, bleſſed</hi> ſhalt thou be for ever: And as for us, <hi>we alſo are thy fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and thy brethren.</hi> Nay, the <hi>believer himſelf</hi> how can he chooſe but ſing, divinely raiſed! <hi>I am now ready to be offered up, and my departure is at hand; I have ſought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith. Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which CHRIST the righteous judge will give me on that day.</hi> Ah, vain <hi>world, ſays be,</hi> no more ſhall your gilded vanities mock my eyes: I am going to a world of ſubſtantial and unfading de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights! Ah, vile <hi>ſin,</hi> no more ſhall you moleſt and perplex me: I am juſt entring into the city, where <hi>nothing entreth that defileth, or worketh abomination.</hi> Ah, tempting <hi>devil, yet a little while and I am with you, and then I go to</hi> my father: <hi>and whither I go, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you cannot come.</hi> Theſe elevated flights, this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant language, is often heard from the quivering lips of the expiring Believer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MARK</hi> now, <hi>the perfect man, and behold the upright;</hi> and ſay, <hi>ye wiſe obſervers,</hi> ſay, is not the <hi>end of that man peace? BEHOLD,</hi> his eyes ſtrive with departing light, and hang upon the ebbing day; anon, they fix, they darken, they go out: But ſay, <hi>O FAITH!</hi> what are the joys which the ſoul, the immortal part, ſees, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with, while the mortal eyes are languiſhing in death! What viſions of endleſs glory riſe up to the ſmiling ſpirit! How is it cheer'd, how tranſported, by the ruſhing beams of a future bleſſedneſs, that break the clouds of the awful valley! <hi>MARK,</hi> his breaſt heaves, and his heart ſeems to labour in the final ſtruggle: But, oh! does the pale boſom really pant with agony? or rather, does not the heart leap and bound with a joy unfelt till this bleſſed moment;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003144_0021_0FF085C01C966BA0"/>and is not the breaſt ſwell'd and extended only by the raviſhing beginnings, of the extaſy without limits, and without end.</p>
            <p>THERE is not a more noble ſight in nature, than a good man amidſt all the confuſions and horrors of death, relying on his bleſſed Redeemer with ſuch an unruffled and heavenly calm of mind. The very heathen paid this complement to virtue, as <hi>certain alſo of their own poets</hi> have expreſs'd it: <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Hor.</hi> Lib. III. Ode. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The man reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in goodneſs hears regardleſs the clamours of the deſpicable rabble, and mocks the frown of the threatning tyrant. Nor ſtorms, nor the thunder of God, can ſhake the ſolid peace of his mind. Should the orbs of heaven fall cruſhing about him, fearleſs would he ſtand, and hear a world ſhatter to ruins.</hi> If the <hi>Poet of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> can ſing thus, what ſtrains ſhall the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles</hi> raiſe, for the lips of the dying chriſtian. Rom. viii. 35, 37, 38, 39. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Theſe may well be the notes, the halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs, which the Saint giving up his ſoul, may ſend to paradiſe before him. Aſſured that nothing ſhall ſeparate him from the love of CHRIST; and aſſured that his maker is his friend, HE, the GOD who manages all the wheels of Nature and Providence, what has he to fear. GOD, may he ſay, is my <hi>father; Heaven</hi> is my <hi>home; Death</hi> is my <hi>friend; Angels</hi> are my <hi>guardians; all things</hi> are <hi>inſtruments of my good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He may demonſtrate to all about him, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in religion able to ſupport, and bear him up, under all the confuſions &amp; ſhipwrecks of nature. The uproar of a <hi>diſſolving univerſe</hi> cannot diſturb the ſoft and ſettled
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003144_0022_0FF085C2FA57FD48"/>tranquility of his mind, while the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD breathes and operates there. He attends the <hi>Thunder</hi> as it ſhakes the skies over him, and he ſhouts to the noble ſound. <hi>O,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I hear my father ſpeak here; it is his dear voice that breaks the clouds; and bends the poles!</hi> And as the <hi>Lightnings</hi> flouriſh the power of his GOD, in flaming characters, thro' the gloomy ſheets of midnight, <hi>There,</hi> he ſings, <hi>there behold the glory of my inheritance in light, ſtream down the skies, in every blaze, and every gleam.</hi> If death ruſhes to meet him, upon the wings of a <hi>whirlwind,</hi> undaunted, unappall'd; he ſmiles upon the welcome angel, and hears the blaſts of the hurricane, as the trumpet of the herald to proclaim his aſcent to paradiſe. He ſays <note n="*" place="bottom">Job. xxxix. 25.22.</note> among the trumpets, <hi>ha, ha;</hi> he defies the tempeſt afar off, the thunder of the winds, and the roaring. He mocks at fear, and is not affrighted, neither turns he back from the blaſt, the ſhaft, that hiſles along towards him, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with death, and commiſſioned for his ſoul. Even in an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> when all things about him look wild in a general ſhudder, compoſed and eaſy, he may ſet ſtill, and <hi>ſing;</hi> and not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> tune the air to more melodious ſounds.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, what a glorious peace runs like a golden thread through the whole chriſtian life; while the end of it is in a more particular manner blazon'd with the glittering fringe, like the ſplendid garments of <hi>Aaron?</hi>

Being now made free from ſin, and becoming ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to GOD, ye have your ſruit unto holineſs, and the END everlaſting life.</hi> No ſooner is the laſt gaſp over, but the ſpirit of the believer wings away for paradiſe, the realms of immortal peace and triumph. A flight of Angels, watch unſeen, round his dying curtains, to be the convoys of the fleeting ſoul: And ſoon as the vital thred ſnaps aſunder, they receive it with a glad careſs, and ſpread their pinions and ſoar away.

Juſt ſinking down into the place of torment, the fathomleſs pit of perdition, and the lake which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and brimſtone, from whence the ſmoke rolls up for ever and ever! How does the amazed ſpirit, recoil, and ſhrink back into the body, at the diſmal proſpect before it! How does it ſhudder upon the edges of the vaſt duration, which ſtretches from its eyes in an endleſs ſucceſſion of ages! that eternity, which waits to overwhelm and ſwallow it up! But, alas, vain are all its tears, and out-cries; it looks wild about for any way to eſcape in vain. The proſpect of life is wholly over; the door of mercy is for ever ſhut; the holy angels are all drawn off, and will no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; the devils ſtand all hiſſing around, and wait to ruſh in upon it; hell opens its voracious jaws, and flames of fire leap out; the ſoul begins to feel the unſufferable ſcorches, and finds, that let it ſhriek and ſtrive ever ſo much, <hi>IN IT MUST!</hi> To ſum up all in a word, <hi>GOD holds it for an enemy!</hi> The GREAT GOD is engaged againſt it; dooms it to ſuffer his almighty vengeance: and <hi>who knows the power of his anger! even as his fear ſo is his wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT this is only the ſtate of the death-bed; and the picture of the ſpirit ſhivering on the borders; what are the ſcenes which open behind? <hi>Is thers any PEACE TO COME?</hi> any hope of hereafter? alas, no. Where is the language to declare the <hi>ſtrange
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003144_0028_0FF085D42FCF2E78"/>plagues,</hi> which will continue for ever to torment the ruined ſinner? Not the howlings of hell it ſelf can expreſs its torments; not the horrid imagination of a devil can paint his future and eternal miſery. This is the END of <hi>all that forget GOD.</hi> The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that now flatter them, will be <hi>bitterneſs in the LATTER END;</hi> will <hi>at LAST bite like a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſting like an adder.</hi> They ſhall <hi>mourn at the LAST:</hi> and find <hi>the END of thoſe ways</hi> to be <hi>the ways of death.</hi> He who purſues his ſinful pleaſures, in ſuch an open defiance of heaven, <hi>ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and at his END ſhall be a fool.</hi> Numb. xxiv. 20. <hi>His LATTER END ſhall be that he PERISH FOREVER.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SURE, it can be no indecency to ſpeak with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſis here: for who can think of theſe things unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? who can let his mind looſe upon theſe awful myſteries of damnation, and not be moved at the dire idea? who can look down into this horrible furnace, and talk of the devouring and unquenchable fire, in cool blood? For my own part, <hi>when</hi> I meditate, <hi>my</hi> fleſh <hi>trembles; my lips quiver at the</hi> thoughts; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors enter into my heart; and <hi>I tremble in my ſelf, that I may find PEACE in the day of trouble</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hab. 3.16.</note> the hour of death.</p>
            <p>AND is this indeed the END of <hi>all that forget GOD?</hi> and on the other hand, Is the <hi>End</hi> of the good man ſo divine and glorious as we have heard? who would not pray with him, Numb. xxiii. 10. <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my LAST END be like his!</hi> Would we be thus <hi>happy</hi> in our <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> the <hi>peaceful death</hi> of the <hi>righteous?</hi> Let us be thus <hi>ſincere</hi> in our <hi>beginning,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> the <hi>holy life</hi> of the <hi>righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us all be at laſt perſwaded to ſue for <hi>peace with GOD,</hi> that we may have <hi>peace in our latter end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WAS there ever more affecting words uttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, than thoſe, II. Cor. v. 20. <hi>We are ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for CHRIST, as tho' GOD did beſeech you by
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003144_0029_0FF085D7047305D8"/>us: we pray you in CHRIST's ſtead, be ye RECON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CILED TO GOD?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH what pathetick language did our bleſſed Saviour mourn over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had outſtood tis day of grace; and had an eternal bar fixed to its peace with GOD! Luk. xix. 41, 42. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, ſaying, if thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy PEACE! but now they are hidden from thy eyes!</hi> O let us not <hi>delay</hi> our endeavours after a peace with GOD, leaſt <hi>This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> alſo <hi>become ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT in our tranſactions about this great affair, let us by no means forget our Lord Jeſus CHRIST; but do all <hi>through</hi> him, <hi>depending upon</hi> him, and <hi>aſcribing all to him.</hi> Of him it is declared, Mich. v. 5. <hi>THIS MAN IS THE PEACE.</hi> Having ſecured a part in his friendſhip and mediation, we are happy for ever: nothing can hurt us; all things will work together for our good.</p>
            <p>LET the <hi>end of our lives</hi> come now as ſoon as they will, the <hi>day of our death,</hi> will prove better than the <hi>day of our birth.</hi> Then ſhall unmoleſted,—ſmiling, immortal <hi>peace</hi> ſpread her heavenly wings over us. We may throw our ſelves upon the bed of death, and ſing, in the notes of the pſalmiſt, Pſal. iv. 8. <hi>I will lay me down in PEACE and ſleep, for thou LORD makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi>
