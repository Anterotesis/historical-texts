            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>CIVIL government is an inſtitution appointed by God, for the good and well-being of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The neceſſity and importance of this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution may be inferred from the wiſdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The divine being has ſeen fit to eſtabliſh his law, as a perfect, unerring rule for men to walk by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a due regard to which is the foundation of all true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And were every one diſpoſed to walk agreeably to this rule, it would ſuperſede the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of any civil eſtabliſhment; for then every one would do to others as he would have them do unto him. But ſuch is the unhappy ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſince the apoſtacy, that they are diſpoſed, every man to ſeek his own, and not the thing of another. And if there is nothing to prevent their covetous deſires, and wicked purſuits, but their own conſciences, and the divine law, the penalty of which none can inflict but God only, they will lie, and ſteal, and deſtroy both themſelves and others. Hence ariſes the neceſſity of civil government, which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021401_0004_0FB38475CD6B0730"/>
God, in his infinite wiſdom, has ſeen fit to eſtabliſh, and which, duly adminiſtered, is the foundation of the peace, order and happineſs of civil ſociety; and is one excellent mean to advance the peace, order and happineſs of chriſtian ſociety; ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writer (ſpeaking of civil government) ſays, <hi>If the foundation be deſtroyed, what can the righteous do,</hi> Pſal. x. 3.

               </gap>eat in the civil department, but alſo to fill a more important one in the religious department<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be a type and forerunner of Chriſt, the great head of the church. And as the faithful admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of government in theſe two different branches, is of vaſt importance to mankind, ſo he earneſtly prays for each; <hi>Let thy prieſts be clothed with righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. cxxxii. 9. <hi>Give to the king thy judgments, and thy righteouſneſs unto the king's ſon; that he may judge the poor, and ſave the needy, and break in pieces the oppreſſor,</hi> Pſal. lxxii. 1. 4. David was now old and ſtricken in age; his long improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judgment, which was ripened with the experience of many years, qualified him to give the beſt advice in matters of the greateſt importance: <hi>For days ſhall ſpeak, and the multitude of years ſhall teach wiſdom,</hi> Job xxxii. 7. The words of the text come with peculiar weight and ſolemnity, as they are the laſt words of a dying prince, giving advice to his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving kingdom; and are therefore worthy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the object of our ſerious attention and diligent enquiry at this time, which will be in the following manner.</p>

            <p>Moſes was called immediately by God to take the rule and government of his people Iſrael. Saul, David, and many others, received their royal crowns by ſpecial direction from heaven. Not only kings but thoſe who fill ſtations of leſs importance in civil government, are equally appointed by God, as may be ſeen, Prov. viii. 13. <hi>By me kings reign, and princes decree juſtice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</hi> Our Saviour was ſubject to their authority, and paid tribute, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And in that we are forbid to ſpeak evil of rulers: <hi>for it is written, thou ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

God has made of them in days paſt, and the uſe which he ſays he will make of them in time to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he will pour out his ſpirit, and cauſe his church to increaſe, and become univerſal; even then <hi>kings ſhall be their nurſing fathers, and queens thy nurſing mothers;</hi> Iſa. xlix. 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo ſuck the breaſts of kings, and thou ſhalt know that I the Lord, am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer;</hi> Iſa. lx. 16. Theſe paſſages, from the many that might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, are ſufficient to ſhow, that it is the will of Heaven, that there ſhould be civil rulers. I now paſs on to ſhow in the</p>
            <p>II. Place, that it is required of thoſe who rule, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they be juſt men. And this will appear, if we conſider the nature and importance of the buſineſs aſſigned them to do:—as they are appointed to uſe their power to ſuppreſs iniquity, and all acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. It is exceedingly natural for the human heart to break forth into thoſe acts of wickedneſs and impiety, which are diſhonorable to God, and deſtructive to the happineſs of human ſociety. The hearts of the ſons of men are full of evil, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not ſpeedily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, their hearts are fully ſet within them to do evil;</hi> Eccle. viii. 11: and madneſs is in their hearts while they live. Notwithſtanding Heaven is continually uſing the moſt powerful means to curb thoſe wicked paſſions, and prevent the outbreaking of injuſtice—ſuch as the various calamities and ſorrows of life, which fill the world with pain and diſtreſs; the terrors of death, the alluring proſpects of a heavenly paradiſe, and the fearful glooms of eternal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet mankind will break over theſe reſtraints, as if they were but ſhadows, or mere cyphers of no avail: and if there was nothing more, the earth
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021401_0007_0FB3847A4DDE3F48"/>
would be filled with violence. But God has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pleaſed to appoint other means:—even civil rulers, who by the bleſſing of Heaven, have oftentimes curbed thoſe wicked paſſions, and prevented their breaking out into open acts of injuſtice.</p>
            <p>Rulers are appointed to ſtand in the gap, and draw the ſword of civil juſtice againſt all open of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and ſo to become a terror to evil doers: and the nature of their buſineſs, and deſign of their office is ſuch, that no one can act in the character of a faithful ruler, but he who is juſt:—there is no way to prevent the growth of injuſtice, but only in a way of juſtice. The prevalency of ſome things may be prevented many ways, but the prevalency of injuſtice can be prevented only in one way, viz. in a way of juſtice: therefore it is required of thoſe who are appointed to ſuppreſs acts of injuſtice, that they be juſt men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will further appear, if we conſider that the ruler is appointed to defend the liberty and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſubjects. Liberty and property have ever been the objects of lawleſs ambition and avarice. An unbounded deſire to have dominion over theſe, has been that great ſpring which has moved thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wheels, which have brought on thoſe revolutions which have taken place in the riſing and falling of kingdoms and empires. What inſpired Alexander, the Ceſars, and other mighty conquerors, but the proſpect of obtaining dominion over their fellow-creatures, and having their liberty and property at their diſpoſe? What moved antient Pharaoh to purſue, with his numerous hoſts, the children of Iſrael, with ſuch intrepid zeal, but the proſpects of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021401_0008_0FB3847BCD4A9680"/>
making them his ſervants for ever? And what has actuated ſo many of our brethren, in a Chriſtian land, to counteract their own profeſſion of liberty, to brave the dangers of the ſea, and hazard their lives among the African tribes, but a thirſt after riches, obtained at the expenſe of the liberty and property of their fellow-creatures? And how ready were we to take the alarm, when our Britiſh rulers called for ſome of our intereſt? They touched then the apple of our eye—and the univerſal cry was, "Liberty and property are invaded; the king and parliament are unjuſt in government; they muſt be reſiſted even unto blood:" And by the bleſſing of Heaven, we maintained our liberties, and ſome part of our properties, though at the expenſe of much treaſure, at the hazard of a long and ſore war, and the loſs of many thouſand lives. Yet our liberties and property were a treaſure ſo rich, that we thought the conqueſt great, and the victory glorious. This treaſure we commit to the care of our civil rulers; we hold our property under the civil power; we enjoy our liberty from their friendly aid and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Let this eſtabliſhment be removed, and we have nothing that we can call our own. Our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and property would lie at the mercy of thoſe, who have no bounds to their luſts and avarice.—Therefore, rulers who are appointed to defend theſe, ought to be juſt; for there is nothing that endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers them, but injuſtice: but when rulers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, the intereſt and liberty of the people become an eaſy prey to them, and the yoke of bondage is laid on by thoſe hands which are appointed to keep it off. As when an honeſt traveller, having fifty
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021401_0009_0FB3847D4EE67400"/>
pounds in caſh for his ſupport, and fearing leſt he fall into the hands of wicked men, who will rob him of his treaſure, commits it to the care of his landlord, to keep ſafe; who takes the advantage of this betruſtment, and keeps the whole, and leaves the traveller to earn his paſſage by conſtant labour: thus, when the wicked rule, the righteous mourn; but the juſt ruler will ſave the needy, and break in pieces the oppreſſor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is required of civil rulers, that they be juſt, as they are raiſed up and appointed by God, to be the miniſters of his kingdom for good to the people, and to act in concert with the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and be co-workers with God. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being never inveſted any of his miniſters with power to act in oppoſition to his juſt and righteous laws, but agreeably thereto: and therefore, not only the ſafety of the people, but the honor of God, requires, that thoſe who rule, be juſt men. So far as we can diſcover, through the medium of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, the adminiſtrations of government in the other world, it is perfectly juſt; God renders to every one according to his juſt deſerts: but the civil ruler is not to pattern after the examples of government in that world; but after Chriſt, who is our pattern in all things, who never inflicts pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment upon any of his creatures in this world above what they deſerve, but often far leſs than what they deſerve. Rulers may lay that meaſure of puniſhment upon offenders, which will ſecure the honour of government, and the good of the people, and yet diſplay their lenity and goodneſs, in making it much leſs than their crimes deſerve. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent

with public juſtice, and agreeable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Saviour, <hi>who does good to the evil and unthankful, and ſendeth rain upon the unjust as well as the juſt.</hi> It is conceded by all, that miniſters of the goſpel muſt be juſt, and exemplary, both in a public &amp; private capacity: it is equally required of civil ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that they be juſt, both in their public and private capacity. Since they are both appointed by God, as his miniſters for good to the people, they are both called to labour in the ſame field, to carry on the ſame important cauſe, to ſupport truth and righteouſneſs; though they are called to miniſter in two different ways, yet they are to carry on the ſame work. Every thing that the civil power is called to do, is with a direct view to build up the kingdom of Chriſt, and to advance his cauſe and intereſt in the world. Any thing more or leſs is not required by him, who is given to be head over all things to his church. Therefore, thoſe who rule, muſt be juſt.</p>
            <p>III. I come now, in the next place, to ſhow, why thoſe who rule, ſhould rule in the fear of God.</p>
            <p>And the firſt reaſon, which comes under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is, that they are accountable to God for all they do.</p>
            <p>As they are dependent upon God for every degree of that power and authority, with which they are inveſted, and for all thoſe abilities and advantages, with which they are favoured; ſo they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God for the improvement of them: and if they are juſt &amp; faithful in their ſtation, their rewards will be proportionably great. Their reward will be great in this world, their characters will ſhine as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021401_0011_0FB384804D44D9C0"/>
lights on the earth, they will have the beſt wiſhes and fervent prayers of the juſt and wiſe, and the teſtimony of every man's conſcience in their favour. Above all, they will have inward peace, ariſing from a conſideration of their being juſt &amp; faithful, which will give them moſt ſenſible joy, upon every turn of ſerious thought and inquiry, which will remove the fearful glooms of decripped age, brighten the dark proſpects of death and the grave, and open to their view an inexhauſtible treaſure of good in the world beyond, where they ſhall reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their works ſhall follow them; where they ſhall receive their full reward, even life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another weighty reaſon may ariſe from the fearful ſtate of thoſe, who do not rule in the fear of God. Theſe are alſo accountable, and muſt receive a juſt recompence of reward. Their titles, pompous names, and dignified ſtations, among men, will be no defence for them in the fight of God; <hi>"for he bringeth princes to nothing, and maketh the judges of the earth as vanity;"</hi> Iſa. xl. 23. Proud Pharaoh, with all his chariots and horſes, finds no more relief from the raging waves, than the meaneſt of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Belſhazzar, that mighty prince of Babylon, when he ſaw the handwriting upon the wall, was filled with ſore ſurprize; the joints of his loins were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another.—Wicked rulers are not only expoſed to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God here, but to a more fearful doom hereafter: for, <hi>when the Heavens depart as a ſcroll, when it is rolled together, and every mountain &amp; iſland moved out of their places; then the kings of the earth,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021401_0012_0FB38481CD64F480"/>
and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, will hide themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and will ſay to the rocks and mountains, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that ſitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand.</hi> Rev. vi. 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Reaſon 3. God will be glorified hereby. If ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers rule in the fear of God, it will give a viſible diſplay of God's glory.—The ſun which rules the day, the moon and ſtars which rule the night, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play God's glory in the natural world. Rulers are like ſuns and ſtars, in the moral world; and when they rule in the fear of God, divine grace and glory appear in them, as it did in Moſes, when he had been with God in the mount, or in our Saviour, on mount Tabor, when his face did ſhine as the light.</p>
            <p>Reaſon 4. Great good will not only ariſe to them, but to their ſubjects, and perhaps to generations yet unborn, if they rule in the fear of God. In ancient times, holy kings and juſt rulers were a great bleſſing to the people: things went well with the nation for their ſakes; their holy example, and pious walk with God, were a continual teſtimony of the truth and reality of religion, and had an excellent tendency to preſerve the morals, and guide the minds of thoſe who were young and tender. Time would fail me to tell of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, David, Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> thoſe juſt men, who ruled in the fear of God; what bleſſings they received, what deliverances were wrought for them and their people. Time would alſo fail, to ſpeak of <hi>Saul, Reoboam, Jeroboam, Ahab,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021401_0013_0FB3848473FBADA0"/>
Herod,</hi> and many other wicked rulers, and relate what judgments fell upon them and their people, for their unholy examples and wicked practices. Nothing but eternity can unfold to the view of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, the happineſs of the one, and the miſeries of the other.</p>
            <p>But it is now time to cloſe this ſubject with ſome improvement.</p>
            <p>And 1. We learn from whence rulers have their appointment; it is from God. Though they are ſaid to be choſen of men, yet they are ordained of God. This conſideration gives great weight to their office. It is a ſmall thing to be choſen by men; but to be appointed by God, gives ſuch honor and dignity to their appointment, that ſatan himſelf durſt not bring againſt them a railing accuſation. How careful ſhould rulers then be to obey and glorify God, who has thus honored and dignified them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We learn from what has been ſaid, how great the work and buſineſs of rulers is. They are to ſtand as pillars to ſupport truth, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fall in the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; and to ſtop thoſe innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtreams of wickedneſs which would otherwiſe overſpread the land, and bring on a deluge far more dreadful than that which deſtroyed the old world. They are the ſhields of the earth, which belong unto God. Though weak in themſelves, yet in God they are mighty: he is their refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in a time of trouble. Therefore they need not fear; he breaketh the bow, and cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpear in ſunder; he burneth the chariots in the fire; the Lord of hoſts is with them, the God of Jacob is their refuge; Pſal. xl. 1, 9, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:021401_0014_0FB384858D99E730"/>
Their work is great, as the liberty and property of thouſands are committed to their care; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, they are reputed as fathers of the people. It is a great charge to ſtand in the relation of a father to a ſmall family; how much more to ſtand in that relation to a whole nation? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural for a father to ſacrifice the intereſt and liberty of his children, and bring them into bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? How much more for rulers to ſacrifice the intereſt and liberties of their ſubjects, and bring into bondage and diſtreſs that people, who confided in them, as their fathers, to defend and protect their rights? Rulers need be very careful: a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, which does not ſeem to affect the community now, may be as a leaven, which may break forth hereafter, and bring diſtreſs on many.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We learn how much the good of generations to come depends upon the wiſe adminiſtrations, and pious examples, of civil rulers, who lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for future peace and glory. If our rulers, at this day, like <hi>David,</hi> ſhould lay the foundations of this riſing empire, in the wiſdom and fear of God, we might expect the building would become exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing magnificial of fame and of glory throughout all countries. Schools and colleges eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt footing, enriched with every advantage poſſible, adorned with the beſt maſters, and moſt able profeſſors; and churches ſupplied with faithful miniſters, government with juſt rulers, and the field with excellent officers, would not only ſtrengthen the cords of government, and make ſtrong the bonds of union; but adorn the empire with ſuch inconceivable glory and beauty, as to become the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021401_0015_0FB38488696A43B0"/>
envy of nations, the wonder of angels, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We learn the duty of ſubjects to their rulers, to treat them with all that reſpect and reverence, which their ſtation requires, to encourage their hearts, and ſtrengthen their hands, by paying due regard to their juſt and righteous laws. As we are favored with the privilege of chooſing our rulers, we ſhould highly prize the privilege, and always be ready to give in our voice agreeably to the advice which <hi>Jethro</hi> gave to Moſes:—<hi>Chooſe ye out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear God; men of truth, hating covetouſneſs</hi>—And after we have thus choſen our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, we ſhould receive the exhortation of the apoſtle, <hi>That firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority,</hi> and then we may hope to <hi>lead peaceable and quiet lives, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now cloſe with a brief addreſs to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous characters which compoſe this aſſembly: and I ſhall firſt ſpeak to his Excellency the Governor.</p>
            <p>HONORED SIR, Permit me to addreſs you with that reſpect and reverence which is due to one in your exalted ſtation. You have been raiſed up by the providence of God to preſide over the people of this ſtate.—This day completes the round of ſeveral years, in which you have filled the chief ſeat in the civil department. Many anxious cares, perplexing thoughts, and gloomy ſcenes, have doubtleſs marked your various ſteps; while reviving hopes, and gladning rays, have inſpired your breaſt with the moſt pleaſing proſpects, which have been like pillars to ſupport you; and

ever will be a ſource of unſpeakable joy and peace, if you are juſt and rule in the fear of God. Great, yea, very great, is the truſt which the people have committed to your charge! and very important are the labours which Heaven calls you to perform. On your wiſe and pious counſels, juſt and prudent meaſures, depends, in ſome degree, the weal and tranquility of the people through this ſtate. If you are wiſe and faithful, if you are juſt and righteous, generations to come will riſe up and call you bleſſed.

            <p>Honored ſir, we wiſh you all the bleſſings that time can beſtow! and when you are called to reſign all by the bold demands of death, we wiſh a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of angels to conduct you to higher courts, where you may hear the voice of your enthroned Redeemer, ſaying, Come thou bleſſed of my Father, thou haſt been faithful in a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of my Lord!</p>
            <p>In the next place I would addreſs myſelf to his Honor the Deputy-Governor, the Council, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

MUCH RESPECTED SIRS, The power and authority which you have over this people, render you worthy of their higheſt eſteem and regard; ſince to you is committed the care of that political ſhip, in which our property, liberty, lives and earthly all are embarked. If you are juſt and faithful, if you rule in the fear of God, we ſhall ride ſafe through all the winds and ſtorms which the kingdoms of this world can raiſe. Yea, the powers of hell cannot prevail againſt us, for then the Lord Jehovah will be on our ſide. But if you are unjuſt, the ſhip may overſet, and the whole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go be loſt: the people may fall a ſacrifice to the rage and violence of thoſe men whoſe tender mercies are cruel. However, we hope better things; we look up to you as the guardians and protectors of our rights and privileges, which we have maintained at the expenſe of a long war, in which we have ſhed much blood, loſt many lives, and expended vaſt ſums of treaſure; which we conſider as ſmall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to thoſe liberties which we now enjoy, and which we commit to your care, as to the care of wiſe and faithful men. This ſtate is now beginning; the foundations of it are now laying; the wheels of government now begin to roll: and how much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon what is done in this early period, the good or evil effects of which will extend to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come? The glory and felicity of this ſtate in future time, depends upon your wiſe and prudent meaſures. You may now provide for the ſupport of ſchools; you may do much for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the goſpel, and for the good of the church; you are ſet up for lights in the world, that you may
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021401_0018_0FB3848C4D723320"/>
be eyes to the blind, feet to the lame; and that the bleſſing of thoſe who are ready to periſh, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend and reſt upon you. We look up to you as our leaders; if you are juſt, and walk in the fear of God, and we do not follow you, our guilt will be upon our own heads, and you will deliver your own ſouls;—but, if your examples are unholy, and we follow you, our blood will be required at your hands. Chriſt pronounces the wo upon you; wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, for ye ſhut up the kingdom of Heaven againſt men; for ye neither go in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſuffer them that are entering to go in; Mat. xxiii. 13. As examples in rulers have a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing influence upon ſubjects, we wiſh to ſee you ready to every good word and work! And whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things; Phil. iv. 8. And may Chriſt, who will erelong call you to give an account of your ſtewardſhip, ſay unto you, Well done good and faithful ſervants, becauſe you have been faithful in a few things, I will make you rulers over many things, enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</p>
            <p>The miniſters of the goſpel deſerve our notice upon this occaſion, and to whom I would now pay my reſpects.</p>
            <p>Reverend Sirs, Permit me, as one of your brethren and compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions in the kingdom and patience of our Lord, to addreſs you in the ſacred character of Ambaſſadors for Jeſus Chriſt. We are called to preach the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Though we are not called to take any active part in the civil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, yet we are to help them by our prayers and preaching; and while they uſe the weapons of their warfare, and draw the ſword of civil juſtice againſt open offenders, we are to uſe the weapons of our warfare, and proclaim the terrors of the Lord againſt the guilty ſinner. Let us never grow faint nor weary in well doing, but be faithful until the death. The employment we have engaged in is noble and important: the rewards of thoſe who are faithful, are great and glorious; and the maſter whom we ſerve, is no leſs than the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who will at laſt bring forth the many which ſleep in the duſt; and they that are wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and thoſe who have turned many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars forever and ever.</p>
            <p>I will now cloſe this diſcourſe with a word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to this whole aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Permit me to remind you of the bonds of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude we are under to God, for the ſmiles of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which are this day upon us. We are not aſſembled in arms, to oppoſe an invading foe. Our ears are not aſſailed with the alarms of war, nor our hearts ſtruck with fear and ſurprize at the ſounding
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021401_0020_0FB3848F4D579A88"/>
of trumpets and roaring of cannon. Our eyes do not ſee the garments of our brethren rolled in blood, nor their bodies wounded and torn with the cruel weapons of death; but we ſee our land in peace, and hear the voice of joy and gladneſs. We are called to chooſe our rulers, to make our laws, and govern ourſelves, according to our wiſh and deſire. O how different the ſcene, and how much happier are our proſpects, than they were a few years ago, when we were involved in all the horrors of war. This place was then the ſeat of diſtreſs and confuſion! How often did we hear the alarms of war, and bend our courſe with haſty ſpeed to this and other places, to defend our houſes and families, and all that was dear unto us, from the ſword of our enemies, and from thoſe ſavages whoſe tender mercies are cruel!</p>
            <p>How long did the important cauſe lie in ſuſpenſe, when we ſtood as fair to loſe our all, as to win the day? But Heaven gave the deciſion in our favour: our enemies were brought to ſhame and confuſion. Princes wandered in the wilderneſs unpitied &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn, and their hands were not able to perform their enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Captain of our ſalvation bowed the Heavens and come down; darkneſs was under his feet; he rode upon a cherub and did fly; yea he did fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wings of the wind; he brought ſalvation to us in a very acceptable time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now we dwell in our houſes, and there is none to make us afraid: we aſſemble for the purpoſe of eſtabliſhing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſupporting peace, order, &amp; harmony, among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:021401_0021_0FB3849104441A20"/>
Such late and wonderful deliverances, which we have been made to experience, ſhould lead our minds, when we are thus aſſembled, to that great and ſolemn day, when the univerſe ſhall be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before the Judge of all worlds; when the juſt ruler, the faithful ſubject, the wiſe parent, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful child, and every pious Chriſtian, ſhall obtain a complete victory over all their enemies; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with a glorious triumph to their everlaſting abodes in the New Jeruſalem; be crowned with immortal honours, and reign as kings and prieſts unto God and his Father forever. Then ſhall theſe happy ones behold this world, which has been the ſeat of confuſion and diſcord, in her laſt convulſions; the rocks rending, the mountains &amp; hills departing, the earth opening to her deep foundations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents and oceans mingling together into their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient chaotic ſtate;—while pillars of ſmoke, &amp; peals of thunder, and ſtreams of lightning, fill the teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air, and cauſe the elements to melt with fervent hear. Then hell will enlarge herſelf, and open her mouth without meaſure; and wicked kings, and unjuſt rulers, with all their pomp and glory, ſhall deſcend into it. Let this aſſembly remember, that this day is approaching, and not forget thoſe ſolemn and eternal realities, while we are attending to the affairs of this world: but let thoſe who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, obey their rulers in the Lord, for this is right; and thoſe who rule, let them be juſt, ruling in the fear of the Lord. Amen.</p>
