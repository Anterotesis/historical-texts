            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Chriſtian Reader;</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of this year there came a <hi>Dove</hi> flying about, made in the form of an <hi>Almanack,</hi> and ſent (under pretence) from <hi>Noah,</hi> to ſee if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; which taking in my hand and ſearching her body, I found her to be rather a <hi>Raven</hi> than a <hi>Dove,</hi> becauſe ſhe had under the Dove-feathers a very black skin; whereupon the old News was writen, <hi>ſent forth to bring Chriſtian-people from their freedom in Chriſt back again under Bondage of the terrible Law.</hi> He the work man of this Dove <hi>I. A. S.</hi> hath taken, it ſeems, his advantage and opportunity of the Circumſtances and Conditions of this Country, wherein, as in a Wilderneſs, moſt part of the Inhabitants being ſimple and ignorant, are ſoon perſwaded this way or that, for want of true and faithful Guiders and Teachers, as well as neceſſary Books, eſpecially in this his buſineſs.</p>
            <p>His excuſe, p. 2. <hi>That he under taketh not to be poſitive in any thing,</hi> will not clear him; for is he not poſitive? how then cometh it, that he himſelf not only doth keep the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> but by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and countenancing that party, yea, publick Writings troubleth, as much as in him is, others with the ſame?

I ingenouſly confeſs that the <hi>Loat</hi> is not cut out ſo well, as a natural <hi>Engliſh</hi> hand could have done it, and a more accute and judicious Wit fram'd it, but I hope the Chriſtian Reader will remember, that all cannot offer Gold, Silver and precious Stones, Scarlet and Shittin Wood to the Tabernacle; it is enough for ſome, that have no better (of a willing heart) to give linnin, yea, Goats hair, Ram-skin and Badgers-skins, <hi>Exod. 35.</hi> till you can have a fairer ſtile &amp; a more penetrant Judgment, make uſe then of this my diſcourſe, in <hi>brotherly love,</hi> with prayers to God, to keep his Church together, and us all, one with another in love and Unity for Chriſt Jeſus his ſake, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>By thy glorious Reſurrection, good Lord, deliver us, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 1. The plaineſt way for me to go to work in this matter. I have thought, as I do ſtill think, will be to examine the Author of the Almanack according to his own method propoſed in Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, to the end, that by all <hi>I</hi> may the better be underſtood, and his Obſervations (conferred with my Remarks) may give more light to the Reader. And becauſe the chiefeſt ſcope of his matter he aimeth at, is to bring in the <hi>Jews Sabbath,</hi> therefore I will paſs by ſome of his firſt Obſervations, for fear I ſhould be too large; But before my coming to the very matter, I cannot but con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs that there is ſomething ſtrangely ſet down, as in his Obſervation 11. there it ſeems to me as if <hi>Time</hi> were that Choas where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the World in created; I think ſuch an Axiom is againſt not
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001165_0005_0FB0964A6637B8D0"/>only the Chiefeſt Philoſephers, who ſay that <hi>Time</hi> and Place were not before the World was created, but alſo againſt Gods Word. becauſe <hi>Time</hi> could not be before things were created, much leſs the very eſſential nature of every thing.</p>
            <p>What ſucceſſion of Time(if we may improperly ſo term it) there was and ſhall be in the Eternity, we hope to ſee, but we do not yet know; but to make <hi>Time</hi> more ancient then the world, is to plead for the God-head of Time, in the ſame manner as St. <hi>John</hi> did for our Saviour in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of his Goſpel, for whatſoever was in the beginning, was before the beginning, and what was before, was Eternal, and God himſelf. To make the Time co-equal with the World, but wholly of a different nature from what God made the whole World of, is non-ſenſe. No Philoſepher hath yet diſowned Time to be an Accident, and conſequently as the Modification of the Subſtance, inſeperably inherent in it.</p>
            <p>Hence can but from all theſe his aſſertions (which I leave as not worthy any anſwer) conclude, that the author hath a mind to make the <hi>Jewiſh ſeventh day</hi> of ſuch a natural Holineſs, that the very Time, as the ſubſtance, and the Holineſs as a natural perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; inſeparable accident, are concomitant, &amp; never to be ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>ſpectatum admiſſi reſumteneat is amics.</hi> A new Logick Canon inded! never heard of before. Why may I not as well argue, The Cloth adorning our bodies is the ſubſtance, the whit Colour is its natural perfection and inſeparable accident, <hi>Ergo</hi> none muſt wear other colour beſides White; or if you will have a ſacred inſtance, the Covenant between God and the earth, <hi>Never to be deſtroyed by Water,</hi> Gen. 9 13. <hi>ſeq.</hi> is the nature or ſubſtance of the <hi>Rain-bow.</hi> All what the <hi>Sabbatharians</hi> can reply &amp; the beſt argument they can have, is, That the fourth Commandment is a <hi>moral Law, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.</hi> To give a ſhort anſwer to it, I ſay, that we muſt needs make a diſtinction between <hi>a natural or ſimply moral Law,</hi> and <hi>a poſitive moral Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Natural moral Law is of it ſelf in the nature without any poſitive Law, or external Conſtitution, and therefore imprinted in mens hearts at the very Creation, is univerſal to all perſons, and their perpetual obligation.</p>
            <p>Put poſitive moral Laws are not imprinted in the heart, neither by Nature or Grace, are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

White,</hi> in his book, called, <hi>A Treatiſe of the Sabbath-day, againſt Sabbatharian-novelty,</hi> in this matter very plainly doth declare more at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arge. Let now the <hi>Sabbatharians</hi> remonſtrate, that the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment concerning the very time of the day is properly, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſimply and perpetually Moral, and that it is equal in that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to the reſt in that Commandment and the other nine; which before they can, let them not preſume ſo raſhly to affirm, that the ſame is the part, jot or tittle of that eternal Law, which Chriſt commanded to be obſerved in the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> to the worlds end, <hi>Math</hi> 5.19.</p>

§ 4. <hi>Obſerva.</hi> 13.14. I grant that it was a Day, and alſo that it was a <hi>Time</hi> called by the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Firſt</hi> of <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> as the Author ſaith, but never in a ſuch ſenſe, as he will have it. The word <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Scripture is never uſed <hi>only</hi> for that ſpace of time between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and Pentecoſt, or for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath that ſeventh day, but often times for an <hi>whole week,</hi> one after the other the year round, as <hi>Luk</hi> 18.12. where the Original Tongue hath that word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which no other way, but by <hi>Week</hi> can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and ſo conſequently every day in the beginning of the week, is by that reckoning called the <hi>Firſt Day.</hi>

            <p>Further, we are to obſerve, that the moſt Holy Author ſpeaketh of the ſame now in ſingular <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and now again in the plural <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> as appeareth in the Original from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. and 9.

            <p>Neither can it be proved that the firſt day of ſabbaths is ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God to be accounted in the reſpect of the <hi>50th</hi> day, but in reſpect to every week of them ſeven; in ſhort, as ſoon as one time ſeven was paſt, they ſhould begin again another, till they have nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>§. 6. <hi>Obſervation</hi> 16. Concerning this, there can be no queſtion, but that the day will be changed by the date, I mean, a day of a Feaſt, which muſt be unmoveable, cannot but go from one day to the other, and ſo as to the day of Wave-offering, ordinarily kept on the 16 of <hi>Nican,</hi> becauſe it ſhould be obſerved the day next the firſt day of that great feaſt of unleavened Bread conſtantly kept on the 15. of <hi>Nican;</hi> the date muſt ſtand, but the day did alter every year. Now I will not trouble my ſelf to gainſay the Authors account about the falling in of ſuch a date upon a <hi>Saturday</hi> this year 1704. fince <hi>Joſeph l. Antiq. c. 5.</hi> plainly cleareth the matter, ſaying, that the 50. day uſed to fall in not upon the <hi>6th</hi> day of <hi>Sivan,</hi> but upon the <hi>7th</hi> day of that month, which is this year ours, and not his or a <hi>Jews Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let this be how it will, we know and are aſſured that the year when Chriſt was crucified and roſe from the dead, this date tell upon the firſt day of the week, and alſo the Holy Ghoſt coming down, which through Gods providence was in all probability, yea, certainty, for the ſanctifying of the Firſt Day.</p>

So if an humired years hence, more or leſs, (we not having a full account of this matter) any one ſhould bring this as an argument againſt keeping our Sunday, <hi>vic.</hi> That in time paſt this Day was not duly kept here in this part of <hi>America,</hi> &amp;c. will be as much miſtaken in that, as this Author is in the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſte.</hi> And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Scots have done ſo, it doth hun very little good in this matter, becauſe if a little ſpot here and there in the Chriſtian World, for want of one thing or another belonging to the matter, could not juſt preſently have underſtanding of all things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this or that, muſt it there fore follow that other Churches, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, Kingdoms or Countries do not underſtand, keep and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it? Or, ſuppoſe a company of ſimple and unleirned People (as for example, the <hi>Sweeds, Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Duch</hi> that firſt came into this Country) might not have the remembrance when ſuch or ſuch a Day was to be kept, and knew not how to calculate it, muſt we therefore conclude, that it is unlawful to keep ſuch a Day, or that all other Chriſtian Countries and Kingdoms were ignorant alſo in calculating, keeping and obſerving the ſame? Surely nay. And of as little conſequence is his proof for his Aſſertion of the Lords Day only once in the year; by People ſtanding in Prayer, &amp;c. becauſe ſuch was not only done that day, but every ſuch Day until Penticoſt. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is plain in his <hi>Corona M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning his firſt, 2d and 3d, we have nothing to ſay againſt them (at leaſt I have not at preſent) becauſe belonging only to the Old Teſtament, where they ought ſo to do, during that time, in order to procure the bleſſing of God. But now under the New-Teſtament, we have got a New Example of Chriſt (our Captain and Leader) to follow, and which we muſt obſerve, if we obtain his Bleſſing. As for the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of keeping the ſeventh day, it is only for them under the old Teſtament; the Commandment whereof is ſo plain, that nothing can be plainer, <hi>Fxod,</hi> 31.13 <hi>

If he is not willing to ſubmit to that, let him take further Notice of theſe words [<hi>Throughout your Generation</hi>] (which are annexed only to the 4th Commandment (concerning the Day) and not to any other of the Nine) as a fair limitation of the word Perpetuity; and therefore for a while this Author ought to ſit at his <hi>Gamali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We are no more bound to the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath for the remembrance of the Creation and Gods reſting, than as if I will argue thus, They in the Old Teſtament could not be ſaved, except by Faith on Chriſt (as he was to come) upon condition of uſing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and the Paſſover: Neither can we under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſaved without Faith on the ſame Chriſt (as he is come:) Therefore it is neceſſary for us too to obſerve the ſame Sacraments as under the Old Teſtament. An Argument of no Conſequence; as, nor is his concerning the Jews Sabbath.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a Type of Chriſts Church Militant and Triumphant, where to meet; Muſt we therefore be bound to go thither too? I think not, becauſe that City, and all its Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (among which the Sabbath was one) are gone; but Chriſts Church remaineth ſtill upon the Earth, as militant, and in Heaven as triumphant. All what is ſaid to bring this matter to a head, is to convince the Author, that the Jewiſh Sabbath was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For further confirmation of it, add the compariſon of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.3, &amp;c. his defending of his Apoſtles for plucking ears of Corn on the Sabbath; and his own Example of curing many Diſeaſes on the Sabbath day (which was not allowed under the Law) defending himſelf, That he was the Lord of the Sabbath, having power to diſpence with moral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Precepts, for the uſe and good of man, as Works of Charity, which are part of the moral eternal Law.</p>
            <p>If the Author asks for an expreſs and diſtinct Text in the Goſpel for Chriſts abrogating the Judaical Sabbath? I anſwer, with the famous Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> That there is no more reaſon to expect it, than there is to expect it for Sacrifices or Circumciſion, or the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical Prieſt-hood; for the Subſtance being come, and the Temple and that People deſtroyed, the Ceremonies or Shadows (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17.) as far as they were ſuch, ceaſed of their own accord, and no further are they now abrogated, having never been Obligatory to any but that People.</p>

            </p>
            <p>His <hi>4th Argument</hi> doth but hurt his diſcourſe about the ſeventh Day. Its true, that Day had its beginning in the ſtate of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; neither do I deny but that, if that ſtate had continued, that Day had continued alſo; but by reaſon of the alteration of that bleſſed ſtate, GOD (in whoſe ſight all Creatures are manifeſt, and all things naked and open unto his Eyes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. and ſo are the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> too, and all what ſhould happen unto them in Time, determined in his infinite Wiſdom to reduce and ſave unto himſelf a peculiar People, who ſhould enjoy eternal Glory with him) found by his Wiſdom, that, beſides other things, this 7th Day appointed for his Worſhip, (made known to the <hi>Jews</hi> for a Token between him and them) ſhould in a certain time after be altered; the chiefeſt reaſon, without doubt, is that great work of the Reſurrection, which is many times greater than the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; for what benefit is it for me, or any others, to be created or born into this World, if by the Reſurrection of Chriſt I was not aſſured of my Redemption from Gods Wrath and the eternal Fire?

            <p>From what has been ſaid it is plain. That the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the ſeventh Day, did only reach the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Teſtament, and Not Us under the New-Teſtament; yea, I will ſay, That the 7th Day, under the Old Teſtament, did more

His <hi>6th Argument</hi> is a weak one, becauſe Chriſt knowing very well the time of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s deſtruction, and how within that time ſuch an eſtabliſh't old Polity, as the Judaical was, could not ſo ſoon, as to all its circumſtances, be abrogated, but by little and little decay, he exhorts his Diſciples (who, after his Reſurrection, ſhould oft have occaſion to meet with the <hi>Jews</hi> upon this their Sabbath) to pray that they might enjoy the ſame with them, for their edification among them. The <hi>2d Reaſon</hi> is this, That not only many believing <hi>Jews</hi> adhered ſtifly to many legal Obſervations, &amp;c eſpecially to the Law of the Sabbath, but the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were moſt rigid and zealous Obſervers of their Elders Traditions, eſteeming it an intollerable Prophanation to travel, labour or flee, or to do ſuch like upon their Sabbath Day. Now, if the Diſciples or Chriſtian Believers ſhould have been compelled to flee on the Sabbath Day (which was no Tranſgreſſion, in caſe of neceſſity, eſpecially becauſe that Law concerning the Sabbath day, as well as other ceremonial Laws, ceaſed at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> they would have been in danger to be grievouſly moleſted and perſecuted by their own ſuperſtitious Nation, (ſee Dr. <hi>Fr. White's Treatiſe of the Sabbath Day.</hi>) And I queſtion not but that Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.20.) did underſtand the Sabbath of <hi>Eaſter-Time</hi> (called by St. <hi>John,</hi> an high or great Sabbath-Day, cap. 19.31.) for as Hiſtory tells us, the City was beſieged at the time when many thouſands of People from afar off were gathered thither to celebrate <hi>Easter</hi> (from which its plain, that forty years after Chriſts Reſurrection that ceremony was not left off; which contradicts <hi>I. A. S's</hi> aſſertion, <hi>That all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were then done away)</hi> being his exhortation, not only to his Diſciples, who were preſent, but by them, to all lovers of Chriſt, that they might eſcape that great Calamity, and I cannot but be perſwaded, that many, by their Prayers, did obtain it (<hi>James</hi> 5.16) ſaving themſelves by flight to another little Town called <hi>Pella.</hi> In ſhort, Chriſt underſtood the Sabbath-Day and Winter to be times very inconvenient, troubleſom, dangerous and difficult to travel in or flee away.</p>
            <p>His <hi>7th Argument</hi> is weaker, becauſe how could the Women (<hi>Luke</hi> 23.56) do otherwiſe, Chriſt being that Sabbath, yet in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> due was that time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>8th Argument</hi> is no ſtronger, but rather weaker (ſee <hi>Levit.</hi>

            <p>His <hi>9th Argument</hi> is the weakeſt of all, becauſe what he talketh there of them in the Old Teſtament, was no more than what they were bound to do that time. Chriſt, during the time of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, obſerved duly not only the Sabbath of the 4th Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but all other legal Rites and Obſervances, becauſe he was then under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. from whence you will wrongly ſo conclude, That becauſe Chriſt obſerved the other Laws, as well as the Sabbath, ſo long as he was under the Law, therefore we muſt obſerve all thoſe Laws and the Sabbath too. But on the other hand, may we not rather argue thus. That becauſe after the time of Humiliation Chriſt never uſed the Saturday Sabbath (ſee §. 7.) or any other legal Rites, ſo neither are we to obſerve them. As to what he ſpeaketh about the Apoſtles, every one that that hath common Reaſon, and will not abuſe it, muſt underſtand, that it was at the beginning of the Churches ſettling, when the Apoſtles could not get better opportunity to inſtruct them in the Chriſtian Faith (but by little and little to teach them concerning the Ceſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old Law) than to be preſent upon the <hi>Judaical Sabbath,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> (a great <hi>Sabbatharian</hi>) doth confeſs, <hi>That it was not for the Days ſake.</hi> (that the Apoſtles ſo met with the <hi>Jews) but for the Peoples ſake, to do them good.</hi> Nay, this Dove-maker <hi>I.A.S.</hi> (who ſtands upon the <hi>Sabbatharians</hi> ſide) will think that himſelf can hardly find a better convenience to draw or (rather to) ſeduce others to come to him, than to come upon our Sundays to the Church, and make his Preachments? St. <hi>Paul</hi> did uſe Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, purified himſelf, ſhaved his head for his vow, &amp;c. But muſt we do ſo now? I think not. The reaſon why St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, was, <hi>That he might gain ſome,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20. and the ſame reaſon is ſufficient for the Apoſtles meeting with the <hi>Jews</hi> upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday.</hi> Beſides, it will appear from the Scripture, That as the Apoſtles did meet with the Jews upon the <hi>7th Day,</hi> ſo with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> they did keep the <hi>1ſt Day,</hi> which we now call <hi>Sunday:</hi> This is plain from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.42.

            <p>His <hi>11th Argument</hi> doth not want much anſwer neither; for we remember the 4th Commandment, ſo much as belongeth to us: And we are careful to avoid Idolatry; but we do not think the Day to be an eſſential part in the Worſhip of God, as if none could be ſaved except they kept the very 7th Day: This is contrary to all Scripture; yea, it is contrary to the love of Chriſt towards his Church, and the guiding of the holy Ghoſt; all which were but Wind, if Gods Church ſhould have run aſtray ſo many hundred years; the thing being of no leſs concern than Curſe and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe the Author is very bold and proud in his Judgment concerning the Council of <hi>Laodecea,</hi> which always was reputed Orthodox, maintaining no other Doctrine in this matter of the Sabbath than <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullion, Origine, &amp;c.</hi> have in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance delivered concerning the ſame. Surely they who were then gathered together ſo near to Chriſts and the Apoſtles time did know much better than any of us how the Jews Sabbath was kept, and how this our Sabbath was kept. The learned Dr. <hi>White</hi> brings in a Teſtimony from <hi>Juſt. Martyr</hi> his <hi>Dialogue c. Tryph. p.</hi> 266. (and he lived about 150 years before this Synod) who relates that there was a Queſtion made in his time, <q>Whether a Chriſtian which obſerved the Sabbath might be admitted to the holy Myſteries, or not?</q> A very good Proof that the Council of <hi>Laodecea</hi> did not firſt of all condemn the Religious Obſervance of the old Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. If this <hi>I. A S</hi> had taken counſel, and done according to the advice given him in my Preface, (ſeeing ſuch Old Hiſtories are ſcarce to be got here, but eaſie to be found in the old Countries) I think he would not ſo unadviſedly have ſet his Pen to Paper againſt our Sunday. I have ſeen ſome of them Canons, but find not that there is Perſecution or Excommunication in any of them, Only that they ſhould prefer that Day before the ſeventh. And if that Council had ſet a Puniſhment (which its like they have) upon Tranſgreſſors and Diſturbers, I am ſure they had Power and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to do, and this Author, if then living, would not have eſcaped their Cenſure.</p>
            <p>His <hi>12th</hi> and <hi>laſt Argument</hi> is of no concern to us; We have now a better Day to reſt upon than ever that 7th was, in Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of that moſt glorious and fruitful Reſurrection. What reſt could our poor Souls have only of reſting upon the 7th Day, which is only a remembrance of the Creation, if by the Reſurrection upon the firſt Day, we were not ſure of that eternal Reſt in the World to come?</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, <hi>Why might not our Souls have reſt now in the New-Teſtament, as well as they in the Old Teſtament had reſt in the ſeventh Day?</hi>

               <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> That what was enough for them at that time, is not now enough for us: Chriſt was then at that time only <hi>Promiſed to Come,</hi> but now <hi>He is Come:</hi> If he had not been riſen, our grief and trouble had been many fold greater, becauſe many fearful Doubts would ſurround us, as, Was he not that Promiſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah? Was he not able to riſe? Then are we of all men moſt miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14, &amp;c. but now, becauſe he is riſen, and by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ours is made ſure, therefore is our Joy much greater, and that Day worthy to be kept by us (in Commemoration of Victory over Death, Hell and the Grave) rather than the 7th Day.</p>
            <p>This the Firſt Day is the Day whereupon was made known the beſt News that ever was or can be told; 'twas ſuch News many had a long time waited and longed for. Its apparent that the Apoſtles of Chriſt had no reſt in their minds or ſouls all that time (during the Jews Sabbath) Chriſt was dead, but were very ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. But how glad did this Firſt Day make them, when they had the certainty of the Reſurrection of their deareſt Lord and Maſter! Never was <hi>Noah</hi> ſo glad when the Dove brought the Olive Leaf as a token that the Waters were abated; But this was ſtill a better Olive Leaf to the Diſciples, and us all, That Chriſt was Riſen, giving them Life and Courage, with a joyful PEACE BE UNTO YOU: A certain Evidence that the whole Deluge of Gods Anger for our ſins was dryed up. It is therefore a ſhame, an unthankful and undutiful thing for any to celebrate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of other Peoples Benefits, and neglect and forget their own, which is infinitely better.</p>
            <p>That benefit which the <hi>Jews</hi> had is nothing to us, but what we have got is much to them. If <hi>David,</hi> by the ſpirit of Prophecy ſaw the Reſurrection of our Saviour, and was glad (as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.) how much more ought we to rejoyce, and forever to celebrate that bleſſed Day, who know it now in the very deed to be done? We have, indeed, our ſhare in the Creation, but that work, by the Reſurrection (which is much greater) is ſwallowed up, it I may ſo ſay; ſo that a true Chriſtian, who underſtands the Reſurrection, can never ſo remember that, but be will thereby be mindful of the Creation, giving many humble Thanks to God who hath made him, not to be a Stone, Tree, Ox or Horſe, &amp;c. but a reaſonable Creature, capable to enjoy the great benefit of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this Author is ſo much for the 7th Day both here
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001165_0026_0FB0967A97E11D08"/>and in his Inquiries, only <hi>for the Remembrance of the Creation, and Gods reſting thereupon,</hi> I do kindly deſire of him one Scripture out of the New Teſtament to ſhew, that we for the remembrance of our Creation are bound to keep the 7th Day Holy; but this <hi>I</hi> think he cannot do. But then on the contrary, I will ſhew him one thing of great Moment for our Sunday, <hi>viz.</hi> That as they in the Old Teſtament were bound to remember the Creation and Gods reſting, by keeping the 7th Day Holy; ſo are we now in the New Teſtament bound to remember the Reſurrection of Chriſt by keeping the Firſt Day, becauſe there is nothing in all the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament to be found in any of the Apoſtles Preachings, that we are now to remember the Creation and Gods Reſting, by keeping a certain Day, but ALL (I ſay, All) their Preaching is moſt upon Chriſts Reſurrection; All what they aim at, is to ſhew that Chriſt is riſen: Read and conſider <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22. <hi>One muſt be ordained to be a Witneſs with us of his Reſurrection;</hi> chap. 2.22. ch. 3.15. c. 4 2, 33. c. 10.41. c. 13.30. c. 26.23. Every place ſheweth, That they only ſhould be Witneſſes unto Chriſt, chiefly of his Reſurrection; ſee more 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. a remarkable place is <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, &amp;c. and eſpecially <hi>I</hi> need to bring in St. <hi>Paul</hi> s Exhortation to <hi>Timothy, 2d.

            <p>The following three Obſervations 23, 24, 25. are moſt about one thing, viz. <hi>That liberly we have by Chriſt to change this day.</hi> Which liberty is of ſuch a nature, as to chuſe one of two or more things, <hi>E. G. Eccleſ.</hi> 15.16.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 21.8. There is liberty to take what a body reaſonably liketh; but not ſuch a liberty, as to chuſe none; which rather is licentiouſneſs and lawleſneſs, than liberty. Alſo, by Chriſt we have got a choice, as in many other things, ſo in days of worſhipping God; we may keep the 7th day, we may chuſe another, which in reaſon we think beſt; one of them ſeven we muſt chuſe, having no liberty to diſpenſe in it as concerning our homage and duty to God, but what day Preciſely is in the Churches liberty. Now for wighty reaſons the firſt is choſen of infallible men, whom our duty is to follow, and not out of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, high mind or vain glory preſume to leave, traduce and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, they knowing the reaſons why they did it, far beter than this <hi>Dove-maker,</hi> or any of us all; And it is our honour to follow them in ſimplicity, it being enough for us, if we had no more reaſon; for the Apoſtles did nothing in the Church for her ſettling but by a divine authority, and ruled by the true Sprit. But <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore it cannot but be high Contempt of the Apoſtles and all their ſucceſſors, yea, in a meaſure a blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, to ſay, that this day was brought in <hi>by Deceits and Triels.</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001165_0029_0FB0967F092AC570"/>coming into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but another Reſt we ought, by Faith, to ſtrive for, namely, that eternal Reſt in Heaven: In which place we have much more of that comfortable Reſurrection than of the Creation, for the Creation (by which we all come into this World in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Condition, guilty to the eternal Fire) giveth us no great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to love God more than the Devils, who are alſo crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fallen, as we are; but the Reſurrection of Chriſt, by which we are in a ſure hope <hi>(poſitis ponendis)</hi> of a gracious God and a joyful Reſurrection to Life Eternal, is the greateſt comfort of all, well worthy to be remembred every Firſt Day, yea, and every day and minute of our Life. St. <hi>Peter</hi> giveth us here in his own Example, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant Mercy hath begotten us again into a lively H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The certainty of this will make us not only to love God and Men, but conſtantly to ſuffer any thing in this World, becauſe by Chriſts Reſurrection we are aſſured of our Reſurrection to that heavenly joy, which by our Creation only we could never be partakers of.</p>
            <p>What ground we have for keeping the Firſt Day in the place of the 7th, is, I hope, made plain enough. If ſome People in ſome places of the world have been ſometimes out of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So is the matter concerning our <hi>Sunday,</hi> which from the very Time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, always the greateſt part of the World conſtantly agreed to keep and obſerve: It is therefore an unanſwerable Raſhneſs and Preſumption to oppoſe Chriſts Church, as if ſhe had been ſo many hundred years without a true Shepherd or a faithful Guide in ſo weighty a matter, whereon, if we will believe this Author, no leſs than eternal Damnation hangs. Leave off therefor, I pray you <hi>(S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
