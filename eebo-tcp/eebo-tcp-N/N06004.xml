            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE chief occaſion of publiſhing the following diſcourſe, is becauſe of what is ſaid therein about the ſubjects of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> which is a point that has been long controverted among the greateſt and beſt of men. But ſince there has been ſo many volumes written upon it, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> many will be ready to object againſt any more's being added now, eſpecially from one that ſome are pleas'd to call <hi>a young upſtart,</hi> and diſdain to be taught by him. But without regard to ſuch flings, I ſhall beg leave in anſwer to this objection to tell the reader a little of my own experience.—I was educated from a child in the contrary principles to what I now imbrace concerning baptiſm; and my education had this to inforce it, that it came from progenitors who were ſundry of them eminently godly, whoſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions godly examples and prayers, I truſt I ſhall bleſs God for to eternity. And after I truſt my ſoul was brought to the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, I made a publick profeſſion in that way: to which may be added that I have ſince been called (though moſt unworthy) to preach the goſpel, and to take the charge of a flock, in which I practiſed <hi>Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> my ſelf: all theſe, and ſome other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to bind me in that way; but the irreſiſtable evidence of divine truth broke through them all. Though when this point was firſt brought in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among us, I labour'd under ſome peculiar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, having my mind heavily burdened with a ſenſe of paſt neglect of duty in things of another nature, which at times made me afraid of looking
<pb facs="unknown:007613_0004_102BA93E9BBE62F0"/>
into theſe matters, leaſt I ſhould be left of God to imbrace an error; and this, together with the hot diſputes, and vehement urgings that we then had among us on both ſides, occaſion'd ſuch toſſings in my mind as ſeemed, as if they would have <hi>ſifted</hi> and ſhaken me (as it were) to pieces; after which I was much overwhelmed with melancholy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements for a great while. Yet having ſince obtain'd through divine mercy ſweet deliverance and eſtabliſhment, them words have often born with weight upon my mind, <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren:</hi> And being ſenſible that many of my brethren are labouring under ſome of the ſame difficulties that I did, and having ſome clear view of ſeveral things in this affair, that I have not lit of in any human writings, theſe and ſome other conſiderations have inclined me to yield to the requeſt of thoſe who have deſired that this ſermon might be publiſhed. I don't expect in this little piece to pleaſe the <hi>Curious;</hi> much leſs a <hi>vain</hi> carping world: but if it may benefit, or be any help to ſerious inquiring minds, I have my end.—Of ſuch I aſk this one requeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that when you get near to God, you would remember your unworthy brother and Servant in the goſpel.</p>

               <p>N. B. <hi>The reaſon why I have ſaid nothing in this tract upon the</hi> mode <hi>of baptiſm, is not for want of clearneſs therein in my own mind; but becauſe this ſubject more naturally led to ſhew who might partake of this ordinance, than how it ſhould be adminiſtred. And alſo, I ſcarce ever meet with any that deny immerſion's being a goſpel mode: and I believe that when men ſhall have done bringing</hi> infants <hi>to baptiſm, they'll generally have done with</hi> ſprinkling <hi>therein likewiſe.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOUGH mankind are aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inclined to diſregard God's law when in a careleſs ſtate, yet when they are wounded by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, inſtead of coming to Chriſt, they fly to the law and their own works for relief. And though (as one obſerves) man's legal diſpoſition has little need of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by legal preaching; yet ſome will teach people in this way: which it ſeems was the caſe among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that occaſion'd the writing of this epiſtle. Some teachers (it appears) had zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly brought in the ſame doctrine among them, which before was preached to the diſciples at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> viz. That <hi>except they were circumciſed and kept the law of</hi> Moſes <hi>they could not be ſaved.</hi> Which then was called a <hi>ſubverting their ſouls.</hi> (Act. xv. 24.) And now 'tis called a <hi>perverting the goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> (chap. i. 7.). Therefore the apoſtle warns them ſharply againſt ſuch ſnares: and he intimates that the reaſon why men cleave ſo cloſe to the law, is becauſe they don't hear the law, nor underſtand its true nature and ſtrictneſs,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007613_0006_102BA94099707F38"/>
(context ver. 21.) And in order to make this matter more plain, he ſets before them the inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s two ſons that he had, one by a <hi>Bond-maid,</hi> the other by a <hi>Free-woman,</hi> which things he ſhews to be an allegorical repreſentation of the two covenants:—and after ſome diſcourſe upon each, he concludes with theſe words;—<hi>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which expreſſions naturally lead us to enquire who each of theſe women are; and alſo to look into the characters, and conditions of their children.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Who is this Bond-woman? <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. The moral law, as it was firſt given to men, commonly called the covenant of works; the tenor of which is, <hi>Do this and thou ſhalt live,</hi> but <hi>in the day that thou ſinneſt thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Gen. ii. 17. <hi>Lev.</hi> xviii. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 12. which ſhews that in order to enjoy the bleſſing promis'd, we muſt perfectly, and conſtantly live in a conformity to this law without the leaſt failure; for if we don't <hi>continue to do all things that are written in the law,</hi> we are immediately bound under the curſe, (<hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10.) and ſo ſtand expoſed to eternal damnation; from which nothing can deliver but a complete ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to divine juſtice for the offences committed, (<hi>and without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion.</hi> Heb. ix. 22.)—This law, and covenant of works was evidently given to, and made with our Father <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, though we have it not ſo fully expreſt, and recorded till <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time. Then as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>The law entered,</hi> (Rom. v. 20) or was publiſhed and proclaimed to the congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> out of the midſt of the fire and ſmoke, even the ten commandments.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007613_0007_102BA90F0504CA40"/>
Hence the apoſtle ſays here (ver. 25.) that this <hi>Agor</hi> is mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> i. e. 'tis the law that was deliver'd from thence, which gendereth to bondage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This bond-woman includes alſo the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law, which likewiſe was given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from him to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod. xxv. &amp;c. I know indeed that the ceremonial law, as it was a <hi>ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified Jeſus Chriſt, and the bleſſings of his grace, brought very joyful news to periſhing Souls; and thoſe who were enabled by faith to look through them ſigns to the things ſignified, enjoy'd great bleſſings therein. But then thoſe rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in themſelves could never take away ſin: and they ſeem to be given much after the tenor of the old covenant. If any man had ſinned, then he muſt provide his own offering, and bring it for his ſin that he had ſinned: <hi>Lev.</hi> iv.—And ſo for any uncleanneſs—what a long train of ceremonial labours muſt they do in order for cleanſing? <hi>Lev.</hi> xivth and xvth chapters. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Sinai</hi> covenant ſays,
<q>Some perſons indeed, call it a legal diſpenſation of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, (with whom I will not contend) but it is more agreable to the language of Scripture, to call it a diſtinct covenant, or, a covenant and law of works, as a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Appendix to the goſpel.</q>
                  <bibl>—Orthodoxy and Charity united, P. 36.</bibl>
               </note> And from what the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays concerning the end of the law's being given, <hi>viz. That the offence might abound;</hi> and that it was <hi>added becauſe of tranſgreſſion.</hi> (Rom. v. 20. Gal. iii. 19.) I humbly conceive that we may learn, that one great thing deſigned in thoſe ceremonies, was to ſhew the heinous nature, and great evil of ſin, and thereby to diſcover more clearly man's awful, and helpleſs Condition, and his neceſſity of a Chriſt.—
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007613_0008_102BA9426E63AFC8"/>
That when he had brought the greateſt, and moſt coſtly ſacrifices, even thouſands of rams, or ten thouſands of rivers of oil, (<hi>Mic.</hi> vi. 7, 8.) all would avail nothing for the taking away ſin and guilt: As ſays our glorious mediator, ſacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings for ſin, thou wouldeſt not (which are offered by the law;) then ſaid he, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God. He taketh away the firſt, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond.</hi> Heb. x. 8, 9.—Indeed it is plain that the body of the forms and ordinances of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a yoke of bondage. In the council at <hi>Jeruſalem, Peter</hi> calls them, <hi>A yoke which neither they, nor their fathers were able to bear.</hi> Acts xv. 10. And in our context, <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews that one part of the bondage which he warned them people againſt, conſiſted in being held under thoſe <hi>beggarly elements;</hi> and in obſerving ceremonial <hi>days, months</hi> and <hi>years.</hi> ver. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>And further, by the bond-woman, ſeems to be intended the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, in her legal ſtanding: hence the apoſtle adds; <hi>And anſwereth to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem that now is, and is in bondage with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> ver. 25. and in the beginning of the next chapter, he warns them as they would keep clear of this bondage, to beware of <hi>circumciſion.</hi>—Should it be ſaid that what is here deſigned, is not, that them ordinances were ſuch a yoke in themſelves; but only that the <hi>Jews</hi> had perverted them from their proper uſe. I reply, that 'tis in a meaſure ſo; though in themſelves they were an inſupportable taſk. In ſhort by the bond-woman I underſtand the covenant of works in general, and all the ways in particular, wherein men ſeek for life, by what they can do; and think either in whole, or in part to ſatisfy for their ſins, and purchaſe divine favours,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007613_0009_102BA9117A541548"/>
either by duties of morality, or by obſerving any ordinances and forms of worſhip whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us conſider who her children are, and what a condition they are in.</p>
            <p>And here the caſe is very plain that the children of the bond-woman, are all that are <hi>born after the fleſh</hi> (ver. 23.) that is, all mankind in their natural condition. But ſhould any ſay that <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s being born after the fleſh, intends an unlawful birth, his mother not being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s lawful wife. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no, by no means for then he would have been a baſtard, and ſuch an one muſt not come into the congregation of the Lord. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.—but he was circumciſed and admitted to outward privileges as well as <hi>Iſaac.</hi> This objection might as well be laid againſt four of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſons, as againſt this, their mothers being maids or handmaids before; yet they are ever reckned to make up the 12 tribes of God's <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But it is evident beyond diſpute, that his being born after the fleſh, does not intend a being <hi>illegitimate,</hi> but only that he had no other than a natural birth: he was never <hi>born again,</hi> without which none can enter into the kingdom of God. And ſo now all who have only a natural birth are children of the bond-woman. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of himſelf, and other Saints,—<hi>We are by nature, children of wrath, even as others.</hi> Eph. ii. 3. and he tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he had proved both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they are all under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 9—<hi>Jews, Phariſees,</hi> and all the world are guilty before God ver. 19.</p>
            <p>And never did a child more naturally run to its mother for help, than man when wounded with a ſenſe of guilt flies to his own works for relief: his cry is, <hi>Have patience with me, and I'll pay thee
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007613_0010_102BA944F25550A0"/>
all:</hi> but very ſad is the condition of ſuch ſouls. They may juſtly be called children of the bond-woman for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe their work is hard. Slaves have often both hard work to do, and are drove hard in it to do a great deal: So is the caſe here; the law requires not only that which is hard, but that which is impoſſible, for us to do. It requires us to make us a new heart, and a new ſpirit, as we would eſcape death. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xviii. 31. And it demands that we make recompence for all paſt faults, and walk in the ſtatutes of life, without committing iniquity, as we would hope to live. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiii. 15. Yea, it follows the ſoul up ſo, that it ſays, <hi>If thou keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, thou art guilty of all.</hi> Jam. ii. 10. I know ſome ſay that God cannot juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us more than we can do. But this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers men's awful blindneſs, What! is it become an unjuſt thing for this glorious Creditor to demand his full due, becauſe man is turned bankrupt, and is no way able to pay it! (<hi>Luk.</hi> vii. 42.) O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-daring madneſs! Nay this ſets aſide all that Chriſt has done as vain, for he came upon this very footing; namely becauſe we were <hi>without ſtrength, therefore in due time he died for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. v. 6. <hi>And what the law could not do,</hi> (i. e. juſtify a ſinner) <hi>God ſent his ſon</hi> to do. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. Souls under the old covenant are like bond-ſervants in this, that they can claim no right to the inheritance, or even to a continuance in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but may be ſold away, or ſhut up in priſon, notwithſtanding all that they have done when the maſter thinks proper.—<hi>The ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever; but the ſon abideth ever.</hi> Joh. viii. 35. Since the law is broken, man can claim nothing by it, but wrath and damnation.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007613_0011_102BA913026E5468"/>
               <hi>The law worketh wrath.</hi> (Rom. iv. 15.) <hi>and as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe.</hi> Gal. iii. 10. So that after all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances which they boaſt themſelves in, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will juſtly be given out, and executed upon them.—<hi>Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon; for the ſon of the bond-woman, ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free-woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Bond-ſervants, when they have toiled and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured many years, are no more releaſt from their bondage, than when they began: ſo all that are under the law, let them faſt twice in the week, and make many and long prayers, and be as exact as ever the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, in all their walk; yet our Lord aſſures us, that they muſt have a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beyond all this, or they can in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven. <hi>Matt.</hi> v. 20.—By the deeds of the law, no fleſh living can be juſtified in the ſight of God. So that every unbeliever, will eternally remain under condemnation after all their doing. Ah! deplorable caſe indeed! well might the apoſtle think that thoſe who deſired to be under the law, did not hear it, nor know its true nature and ſtrictneſs. Surely if they did, they would ſoon cry (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did at <hi>Sinai</hi>) for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to ſtand between God and them.—Hence I proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhew who the free-woman is, here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. And by this I underſtand, firſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious covenant of grace, made between the Father, and the Son, before the world began. Therefore God ſays, <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen, —I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one choſen out of the people.</hi> Pſal. lxxxix. 3, 19. The ſum of which covenant (for I cannot
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007613_0012_102BA947463708B0"/>
be large in deſcribing of it) is, That the Son of God ſhould aſſume our nature, and in that nature perfectly obey the law which we have broken, and bear the puniſhment due unto us for ſin, and ſo make reconcilation for iniquity, and bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, thro' which God could be juſt, and yet the juſtifier of the ungodly: —As the fruit of which, the Father engaged by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the holy Spirit, effectually to draw many of the ſons of men to Chriſt; work faith in their hearts, juſtify and ſanctify their ſouls, and keep them by his power, thro' faith unto eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9—17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6—8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>John</hi> 16.7—13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2—5.</p>
            <p>Which glorious plan, is ſo far from deſtroying, or ſetting aſide the law, that it eſtabliſhes, yea magnifies, and makes it honourable (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.21.) and ſhews how heinous every breach of it is, even ſo great that no tranſgreſſor of that law could eſcape eternal puniſhment without a perfect ſatisfaction for every offence againſt it. But by Chriſt's obedience and ſufferings there is a way opened wherein the greateſt ſinner may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and God's image be re-inſtamped on his heart, and that he may come to enjoy all divine bleſſings here, and for ever more. Hence the Lord ſays, <hi>This is the covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe days;—I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> Heb. viii. 10.</p>
            <p>Further, by the free-woman is intended the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-church in her pure ſtanding—Hence in our context ſhe is called <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above— which is the mother of us all (<hi>ver.</hi> 26.) So in <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 18—24. it is ſaid that we <hi>are not come to the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007613_0013_102BA91498EAE030"/>
mount that burned with fire,</hi> but we <hi>are come to mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem,—<hi>to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, which are written in heaven—and to Jeſus the mediator of the new-covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling that ſpeaketh better things than that of</hi> Abel.— On mount <hi>Sinai</hi> the fiery law was proclaimed, ed, which gendereth to bondage; but now on mount <hi>Sion,</hi> or in the church of the living God, is proclaimed the goſpel of peace, and ſalvation: and ſouls are brought to embrace the ſame. All the ſaints in heaven and earth, make but one catholic church: but it is in the goſpel church here below that God appears to publiſh his grace, and to draw others in: therefore we are told that, <hi>The law ſhall go forth out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem, and many nations ſhall flock in, <hi>Iſai.</hi> ii.—And again, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of his ſtrength out of</hi> Zion;—the effect of which will be, that his <hi>people ſhall be willing, in the day of his power.</hi> Pſal. cx. 2, 3.—In ſhort, by the free-woman, we may underſtand the glorious plan of ſalvation, laid in the eternal mind from everlaſting, which in time has been made manifeſt, firſt by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual diſcoveries thereof in the old teſtament, and then by Chriſt's actually coming in the fleſh, and working out ſalvation, which he began to preach himſelf, and 'twas afterwards confirmed unto us, by them that heard him, whereby the goſpel church was gathered, and increaſed: His uſual way of bringing others in, being to cauſe <hi>Zion</hi> to travel, and ſo to bring forth children; for God is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the church the mother, of all the ſaints.— The apoſtle here (ver. 27.) adds a paſſage from the 54th of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where, note, that the foregoing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007613_0014_102BA948F00F0250"/>
chapter concludes, with the happy fruits of Chriſt's ſufferings, viz. That he ſhould <hi>ſee his ſeed, juſtify many,</hi> &amp;c. upon which the church who had been deſolate as a widow, is comforted with a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that her maker is her huſband, and that ſhe ſhould have a numerous offspring, and her ſeed ſhould inherit the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c.—Which leads us</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To deſcribe the character and State of her children. And here we are told, that (as the child of the bond-woman was <hi>born after the fleſh,</hi> ſo) the child of the free-woman was <hi>by promiſe.</hi> God promis'd that ſon to <hi>Abraham</hi> long before he was conceived in the womb; and he exerciſed a ſtrong faith in that promiſe, by which <hi>he gave glory to God.</hi> Rom. 4.20. And 'twas thro' faith that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> alſo received ſtrength to conceive this ſeed. <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 11.—There appear'd nothing more than the actings of nature in <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s birth: but in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s there was faith on both ſides; which made him a wonderful type of the ſeed here pointed at. He was promiſed before he had a being; and ſo was every child of the free-woman here ſpoken of: They were <hi>choſen in Chriſt, before the world began.</hi> Eph. i. 4. And <hi>God that cannot lie, promiſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> ſo early. Tit. i. 2. Therefore Chriſt refers to this promiſe, in his glorious prayer. <hi>Joh.</hi> xvii. 1, 2. <hi>Father,—glorify thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorify thee. As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life, to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> But this election of grace is not known to us, 'till we are born again: therefore, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born according to promiſe; ſo every one of theſe who are promiſed to Chriſt ſhall be converted in due time: hence he ſays, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007613_0015_102BA9169BD7B368"/>
him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Joh. vi. 37. Such are <hi>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Joh. i. 13.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſouls may well be called children of the free-woman, becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are ſet <hi>free</hi> from that condemnation, and dreadful load of guilt which they lay under before. <hi>There is now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus,—for the law of the ſpirit of life, in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made them</hi> free <hi>from the law of ſin and death;</hi> yea <hi>ſo that no things preſent, nor things to come, ſhall ever be able to ſeparate them from his love.</hi> Rom. viii. 1, 2, 38, 39. Agreable to this is what our divine Maſter tells us. <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 24. <hi>that he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation; but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe children are ſet free from ſatan's tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. By nature they are his ſlaves: he is called the <hi>prince of this world; and the ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience.</hi> Joh. xii. 31. Eph. ii. 2. Hence we are told that, <hi>Foraſmuch as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood,</hi> Chriſt <hi>took part of the ſame: that through death he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil; and deliver them who thro' fear of death, were all their life-time ſubject to bondage.</hi> Heb. ii. 14, 15. Chriſt caſteth ſatan out, and takes from him all his armour, wherein he truſted, and <hi>divideth the ſpoils.</hi> Luk. xi. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They may be called children of the <hi>free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> becauſe they are made free from the dominion of ſin.—Chriſt tells us that, <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if the Son ſhall make
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007613_0016_102BA94B6C1FB720"/>
us free, we ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Joh. viii. 34, 36. And <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Romans,</hi> that being made <hi>free from ſin,</hi> they <hi>became the ſervants of God,</hi> had their <hi>fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life:</hi> yea ſays he, <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over you;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> Rom. vi. 14, 22. Sin takes occaſion by the law, and often beats down, and overcomes ſouls, when they eſſay to reform and turn to the Lord, by throwing their paſt tranſgreſſions and guilt in their way, and repreſenting to them, that ſuch guilty creatures as they, can never come to a holy God; and therefore they had better go on and get what pleaſure they can in ſin, for they'll never have any thing better.—And God's own children are often woried here, when they have backſliden from him; and ſatan will not be wanting, to help to keep them back:—hence he is called <hi>the accuſer of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which accuſeth them before God day and night.</hi>—The ſpirit of God <hi>convinceth</hi> of ſin, and the devil <hi>accuſeth</hi> of ſin; but one ſpecial difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them lies here,—The one ſhews us our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions in order to awaken us to repentance and reformation, and ſays, <hi>It is high time to awake out of ſleep,</hi> and <hi>the time paſt of our lives may ſuffice, and more than ſuffice, wherein we have ſerved ſin:</hi> but ſatan ſays, 'tis in vain to turn now for there is no help for you. Nay becauſe ſouls are got once into his ſnare, he claims a ſort of propriety in them, and if at any time they would attempt to reprove another for iniquity, he will immediately throw their own faults in their teeth, and tell them that 'tis in vain to pretend to deal with another, when they are ſo vile themſelves; and ſo becauſe we have once done <hi>wrong,</hi> he would make <hi>that</hi> a ſufficient argument againſt our even doing right again. O this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007613_0017_102BA91892B52F40"/>
cruel adverſary! how miſerably are ſinners befooled, that they'll hearken to him more than to Jeſus Chriſt!—But what ſhall a poor ſoul do when the tempter throws ſuch things in his way as he knows he is guilty of? he can't deny the charge. Why we are told that <hi>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> Rev. xii. 11. Therefore, O <hi>Soul,</hi> if ſatan tells thee of thy guilt, learn to overcome him by flying immediately to the blood of the Lamb; who, if we confeſs our ſins, is (not only merciful and gracious, but alſo) <hi>juſt and faithful to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> 1 Joh. i. 9. Does the tempter ſay thy ſins are very heinous? learn to make that an argument with Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Pardon O Lord mine iniquity; for it is great.</hi> Pſal. xxv. 11.—Which leads me</p>
            <p n="4">4. To another point of their freedom, which is <hi>open acceſs to God.</hi>—When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, he was turn'd out of Paradiſe, and cherubims, and a flaming ſword were ſet to keep him off, and to guard the way of the tree of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. But now thro' Chriſt we have acceſs by one Spirit to the Father. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. Saints have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear; but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of adoption, whereby they cry <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Father.</hi> Rom. 8.15. And they may come with as great freedom as children do to a father, for the bleſſings they need. <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.13. Yea, we are bid to be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication, with thanſgiving to let our requeſt be made known to God. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. —</p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are made free to ſerve God, and walk in his ways, ſo that his commands are not a yoke of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007613_0018_102BA94E42B5D518"/>
bondage; but a law of liberty to their ſouls. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25. And as on the other ſide, the children of the bond-woman drag on like ſlaves, and they ſay of Gods ſervice, <hi>what a wearineſs is it:</hi> ſo the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the free-woman obey him, not out of ſlaviſh dread; (but like free born ſouls) they ſerve him WITHOUT FEAR, in holineſs and righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all the days of their lives. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74.75. Hence <hi>David</hi> reckons it his freedom to obſerve the divine will; ſays he, <hi>I will walk at</hi> LIBERTY: <hi>for I ſeek thy precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119, 45. And the ſaints at <hi>Galatia,</hi> being brought into this freedom, the Apoſtle (in the words next after our text) chargeth them to ſtand faſt in that liberty, wherewith Chriſt had made them free; and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the children of the free-woman are freed from the condemnation of the law, from the power of ſin and ſatan, and have freedom of approach to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt; and it is made their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty to walk in holineſs all their days, and they have the liberty of Chriſt's houſe, and have a right to all the priviledges of the ſons of God here, and are heirs of an incorruptible inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance above; and by and by they ſhall be received to that glory: and in the great day, their bodies ſhall be raiſed from the duſt, and ſhall be delivered from the <hi>bondage of corruption into the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſons of God.</hi> Rom. 8.21, 23.—And when the bond-woman, and all her children ſhall be caſt out into outer-darkneſs: then ſhall theſe children of the free-woman be openly received to enjoy the kingdom, prepared for them before the foundation of the world.—<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.—</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to ſome Improvement of what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007613_0019_102BA91B18A989A0"/>
               <hi>USE</hi> I. We may here ſee the great folly of all thoſe that ſeek ſalvation, either in whole, or in part by their own doings. This mount <hi>Sinai</hi> gendreth to bondage, and thoſe who would get life by the law, let 'em come before it and ſee the darkneſs, fire and ſmoke, and hear the thundrings and the fiery law, that comes from thence. Surely if ſouls come here, they will ſoon ſee the need of a Mediator to ſtand between them and this God, who is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire. Alas! how blind are men, that they ſhould ever imagine that they can ſatisfy divine juſtice, or get life by a broken law! <hi>Tell me ye that deſire to be under the law; do you not hear the law?</hi> What does it ſay? Why it ſays, <hi>If the wicked reſtore the pledge, give again</hi> that <hi>he had robbed, walk in the ſtatutes of life</hi> WITHOUT COMMITTING <hi>iniquity, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> Ezek. 33.15. Obſerve the terms well, you muſt reſtore the pledge, give again that you have robbed; not only what you have unlawfully taken, from your fellow men, but alſo what you have done againſt the eternal God; for he ſays, <hi>you have robbed me, even this whole nation.</hi> Mal. 3.9. You muſt fully pay that dreadful debt, and walk in the ſtatutes of life for the future, without ever committing another ſin, elſe there's no life by that law.—If you ſay, that this is too ſtrait; be intreated to look a little farther into the nature of the law, and you will find it is ſo ſtrait, that Heaven and Earth will paſs away, before one tittle of the law can paſs away, 'till all be fulfilled. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.18. When God treats with men in the old covenant, he deals with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrict tenor of it: and when he treats with them in the covenant of grace, then tho' their debts are very great, yet, <hi>when they have nothing to pay he frankly forgives them</hi> all. <hi>Luk</hi> 7.42. But
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007613_0020_102BA95039C6E0D8"/>
ſinners vainly expect ſome of the bleſſings of grace, while they yet cleave to the law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE</hi> II. Hence we may learn who have a right to the privileges of the new covenant: <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe (and thoſe only) who are born again. The children of the free-woman partake of her bleſſings; but the children of the bond-woman, ſhall not be heirs with the children of the free-woman.—I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there are many contentions among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of religion about theſe things. Many think that ſinners may claim a right to ſome of the <hi>pomiſes</hi> of grace: particularly ſuch as theſe,—<hi>Aſk and ye ſhall receive, ſeek and ye ſhall find.</hi> And <hi>if any man lack Wiſdom, let him aſk of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him.</hi>—But if they look a little further, they are told that they muſt <hi>aſk in faith,</hi> if they would think to receive any thing from the Lord. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. Indeed here God appeals to their conſciences, and ſays, <hi>are not my ways equal?</hi> (Ezek. 18.) <hi>are not your ways unequal?</hi> If you keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old covenant, I deal with you according to the tenor of it: if you perfectly obey it's precepts, you ſhall have the bleſſings promiſed: but he that offends in one point is guilty of all; and then there is <hi>tribulation and wrath, upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil.</hi> Rom. 2.9. The promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the old covenant belong to the children of the old covenant: and the promiſes of the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant belong only to her children. Hence ſuch alone are ſtil'd <hi>heirs of promiſe,</hi> who have <hi>fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope ſet before us:</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18. None others can claim the promiſes of grace, for, <hi>All the promiſes of God</hi> IN <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, are yea, and</hi> IN <hi>him amen:</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007613_0021_102BA91DFA13F350"/>
to thoſe only that come to, and receive him does he give power (or privilege) to become the ſons of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. And if ſons, than heirs to all the bleſſings of heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.—And as theſe alone are heirs to thoſe eternal bleſſings; ſo none others have a right to the ſpecial privileges of Chriſt's houſe here below:—this I ſhall enlarge more upon.</p>
            <p>As for preaching, exhortation, &amp;c. God has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them forth in general to the world, and calls all men every where to repent: But ſome imagine that the Lord's ſupper was appointed for a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinance; and ſo that unconverted perſons, if moral, ought to come to it. But if it was appoint- for converſion, ſurely the profane have as much need of that as any; though 'tis evident that this is children's bread, and therefore by no means to be given to dogs. <hi>Matt.</hi> vii. 6. Many others think that Baptiſm is not confined only to ſaints, but that their natural off-ſpring are alſo to partake of it. And I find that the main arguments for both, are fetcht from the conſtitution of the old-teſtament-church, holding that to be modled according to the new covenant:—though here in our text we are told that, <hi>This Agar is mount Sinai,—and anſwereth to Jeruſalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children:</hi> i. e. the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church in her legal ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that church and the goſpel-church are ſet as wide apart as the old covenant and the new. In <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. the covenant at <hi>Sinai,</hi> is called <hi>Old;</hi> and God ſays expreſly that the new-covenant is <hi>not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to</hi> that: and that old conſtitution we are told, was then <hi>ready to vaniſh away,</hi> ver. 9, 13. The original conſtitution of that church was ſuch, that it took in whole houſholds, and ſo a whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Natural generation (being born of profeſſors of that religion) gave a right to circumciſion, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007613_0022_102BA95285402590"/>
ſo to all the privileges of that church: and a being bought with an <hi>Hebrews</hi> money, gave the ſervant a right both to circumciſion and the paſſover. <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 44. And the covenant that <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxix. took in ſuch as had not an <hi>heart to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, eyes to ſee,</hi> nor <hi>ears to hear.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews clearly that in the new-teſtament, <hi>The children of the fleſh are not the children of God: but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> Rom. ix. 8. And leaſt any ſhould ſay that a being born after the fleſh, meant an unlawful birth, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately adds the inſtance of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly parallel, who were not only both born of one mother, but alſo at one time; and yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was in as bad a caſe as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> ver. 10,—13.</p>
            <p>But what will, I apprehend, ſet this matter in the cleareſt light, is, to conſider it in the line of <hi>type</hi> and <hi>antitype.</hi>—It is abundantly ſhewn in Scripture, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, and the forms and ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances thereof, did ſhadow forth, and typify heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 2—6. and ix. 9, 23, 24, &amp;c. The ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s being ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of other nations, and being redeem'd with almighty power, and bro't near to God, to be his peculiar people, and to partake of thoſe ordinances and privileges which no other nation then enjoyed, did remarkably ſhadow forth God's ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he hath choſen and by almighty grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; <hi>Out of every kindred, tongue people and nation.</hi> Rev. v. 9. And as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Sinai; Ye ſhall be unto me a kingdom of prieſts, (Exod.</hi> xix. 6.) ſo theſe ſaints ſay, <hi>Thou haſt made us unto our God kings and prieſts,</hi> ver. 10. And in the fore-mention'd 9th of <hi>Romans Paul</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhews, that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> literally, was choſen out of other people: ſo that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpiritually
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007613_0023_102BA9202E2C9650"/>
are choſen out, from among both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> The ſame apoſtle calls the old teſtament diſpenſation the <hi>Letter;</hi> and the new-teſtament, the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 6. That church had a literal houſe and temple where God's name was fixed, and his worſhip confined. <hi>Deut.</hi> xii. 13. 1 <hi>King.</hi> viii. 29.</p>
            <p>But in the new-teſtament we are confined to no place, (<hi>John</hi> iv. 21.) but the <hi>ſaints are God's houſe,</hi> who are <hi>builded for his habitation thro' the ſpirit.</hi> Eph. ii. 20,—22. That old temple was built with ſtones which <hi>Hiram</hi>'s ſervants hewed: but this with <hi>lively</hi> (or living) <hi>ſtones;</hi> that was a <hi>worldly ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> (Heb. ix. 1.) but this is a <hi>ſpiritual houſe;</hi>— there was offered fleſhly ſacrifices; but here <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> ones, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 5.—<note n="†" place="bottom">Should any think that my diſcourſe here, too much favours the ſcheme of thoſe who deny the outward uſe of Baptiſm. I reply, that a perſon's experiencing of this, ſpiritually is ſo far from diſproving the need of the outward uſe of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes the evidence of perſons being baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, to be a ſufficient proof that ſuch are meet ſubjects <hi>of,</hi> and ought to be baptized <hi>with</hi> water Baptiſm. <hi>Act.</hi> x. 47, 48. and xi. 16. which is ſuch an evidence for our practice, as I never yet ſee any writings on that ſide pretend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </note> Hence, an outward cleanſing was requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to receive the ordinances of that church: but here that which is ſpiritual, even the <hi>purging of our conſciences from dead works,</hi> in order to <hi>ſerve the living God.</hi> Heb. ix. 13, 14. And here let me remark one thing that is not generally obſerved, and that is, that a ceremonial cleanneſs was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly requir'd in a child, before he might be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; which plainly appears in the firſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that ordinance, in that he muſt not be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed 'till eight Days old. <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 12. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is ſhewn in <hi>Lev.</hi> xii. 2, 3. which is that when a woman had born a man-child, ſhe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007613_0024_102BA954FA9BC0F0"/>
ſhould be unclean ſeven days; and in the eighth day he ſhould be circumciſed: <hi>i. e.</hi> he muſt be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed as ſoon as he was clean; which by the way proves undeniably, that circumciſion in it's original appointment, was deſign'd to be a part of the ceremonial law; notwithſtanding what many ſay to the contrary. Therefore from hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as outward cleanneſs was neceſſary in order for circumciſion; and none might partake of it without; ſo that ſpiritual cleanneſs is abſolutely neceſſary now, in order for any to receive Baptiſm, or the Lord's Supper aright.—</p>
            <p>Theſe brief hints may furniſh us with an eaſy anſwer to many objections, that are often urged againſt our refuſing to give theſe precious ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to the unconverted. I ſhall ſpeak more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulary as to Baptiſm, and that will ſufficiently anſwer the other; for none will plead for perſons coming to the Lord's Supper, who have not a right to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Object. God ſays to <hi>Noah, With thee will I establiſh my covenant</hi>— and <hi>come thou and all thy houſe into the ark.</hi> Gen. vii. 18. And <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that the <hi>like figure whereunto, even baptiſm doth now ſave us, (not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God) by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet. iii. 21. Hence we conclude that now, children are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into covenant with their parents, and they ought to anſwer a good conſcience in having of them baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That which ſav'd 'em was the ark that <hi>Noah</hi> built, which was a clear type of Chriſt: and as the old world was deſtroy'd when <hi>Noah</hi> enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ark: So ſhall the wicked when the Son of Man cometh for the ſalvation of his people. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiv.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007613_0025_102BA921B1DCF038"/>
38.39. But what is moſtly hinged upon, is <hi>Noah</hi>'s children's going in, on their fathers right. Tho' they were ſav'd only with a temporal ſalvation, which can't entitle to goſpel church-privileges. But what will you do with this here? the diſpute is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about <hi>infant baptiſm:</hi> but here is nothing like an infant, for they were all married men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>wife,</hi> and his <hi>ſons</hi> and their <hi>wives:</hi> and where is the perſon in our days that will baptize ſuch, only on their parents right? Thus by jumbling type and antetype together, perſons run themſelves into a ſad <hi>dilemma:</hi> whereas if we take them diſtinct, the caſe is eaſy. <hi>Noah,</hi> as well as the ark he built, did tipify Chriſt: his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were ſaved, ſo are all Chriſt's children: <hi>Noah's</hi> children went voluntarily into the ark, at God's command. <hi>Gen.</hi> vii. 1, 7; ſo muſt each one of us perſonally believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and anſwer a good conſcience towards God in obeying his commands; or elſe <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> nor <hi>Job</hi> can never deliver ſon nor daughter from deſtruction. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xiv. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But the Lord made the covenant of grace with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I will be a God to thee &amp; to thy ſeed after thee;</hi> and ſo took his ſeed into covenant with himſelf, which is called an <hi>everlaſting covenant;</hi> and as a token thereof, ordered him to circumciſe his children, <hi>Gen</hi> xvii. So we believe that now children are in covenant with their parents and ought to be baptized:—hence <hi>Peter</hi> ſays on the day of penticoſt, to thoſe who were pricked to the heart, <hi>Repent and be baptized,—for the promiſe is unto you, and your children.</hi> Acts ii. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is the main hinge on which all the controverſy turns; therefore I will be a little more particular upon it. And firſt let us obſerve that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007613_0026_102BA957F3966BC0"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood in a double capacity.—As he ſtood perſonally before God, the covenant of grace was no more made with him, than with any ſaint in the world. The goſpel was preached unto him, (<hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 8.) and he believed it, and it was counted unto him for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 3.—But as he ſtood a type of Chriſt, he appear'd as the viſible head of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the covenant was made with him, and his ſeed after him, and they were all taken into the church, and many favours were granted, or promiſed to them,—Nextly, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine who his <hi>ſeed</hi> are: —and here I find that his ſeed is taken in three ſenſes in ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His natural ſeed, which includes all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from his loins: Theſe were all taken into that typical covenant: and they had the privilege of the oracles of God, and the outward ordinances of his woriſhip, which no other nation then enjoy'd: they had the promiſe of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of many outward bleſſings there; and in concluſion that Chriſt ſhould come out of that nation;— and they had the firſt offer of the goſpel <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 1, 2, and 9, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt is <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, <hi>in whom all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> Gal. iii. 16. and ſundry of them ancient promiſes evidently point directly to him, in whom alone they are fulfilled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All ſaints are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual children.— <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who is the father of us all.</hi> Rom. iv. 16. Now as to theſe ſeed, God is indeed their God in covenant, which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the bleſſings of it are everlaſting. But then take notice that, though all ſaints are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007613_0027_102BA9242E0A77F0"/>
children,</hi> yet they are not all made <hi>fathers</hi> as he was. He is the father of us all; and they that be of faith are his children. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 7. As he ſtood the head and father of that nation and church, he was as has been obſerved, a type of Chriſt who is our <hi>everlaſting father. (Iſa.</hi> ix. 6.) and is <hi>head over all things to his church.</hi> (Eph. i. 22.) In which ſenſe no meer man upon earth now ſtands as <hi>Abraham</hi> did.—Now if we take theſe things diſtinct, there is no difficulty; but to jumble them together leads into endleſs confuſion.—Typically, all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s poſterity were in covenant, both believers and unbelievers: and ante-typically all his ſpiritual ſeed are in the covenant of grace, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> Rom. iv. 11, 12. And ſo that text is limited in <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 39. which is ſo much inſiſted upon. <hi>The promiſe is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off,</hi> EVEN as MANY <hi>as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> There is the limits; as many of us, and of our children as are effectually called, are <hi>heirs of promiſe,</hi> and no others. <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 17, 18, and ix. 15. And to cut this matter ſhort, we in general don't pretend to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed; then ſhew me if you can, how the natural ſeed of believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> as ſuch, ever become <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual children: <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh:</hi> and how came thoſe who are only your fleſhly poſterity, any way to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed?— If you ſay that you are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, and they ſtand to you, as his did to him.—Then let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire where God has ſhewn you that you ſhall be a father of many nations, and that a church ſhall ſpring from you which ſhall be large, and that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> birth ſhall bring perſons into it? Here lies the pinch of the point; a being born after the fleſh did bring them into <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007613_0028_102BA95976F26FD0"/>
church, which is evident becauſe, if they were not circumciſed, they muſt be cut off from their people. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 14.) which could not be if they were not in; for there is no caſting any out of the church that are not in it. Which if it be the caſe now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel, then we have a fleſhly and not a ſpiritual church, directly contrary to many texts that I have mentioned, and ſcores more that might be brought to the fame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Here ſome bring <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. to prove that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the church ſtand the ſame now as formerly, only is changed into different hands. Becauſe from a ſimilitude of the <hi>olive-tree,</hi> is repreſented the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the reception of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> to partake of that which is called the <hi>root and fatneſs of the olive-tree;</hi> which they take to be a partaking of the ſame, or like, external, as well as internal, privileges: from whence is argued the right of profeſſors now to baptize their children, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> circumciſed theirs.—But by the root and olive-tree, I underſtand, <hi>Abraham</hi> typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and Chriſt ſpiritually, who is plainly pointed at in ver. 26.27. He <hi>is the vine,</hi> his people <hi>are the branches.</hi> (Joh. xv. 5.) The <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off thro' unbelief, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ffed in, and ſtand only by <hi>faith.</hi> ver. 20. So that what appears from hence is, that true faith is abſolutey neceſſary, in order for any ſoul now to partake of theſe great bleſſings, deſcribed by the root, and fatneſs of the olive; which bleſſings the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt by unbelief, though it is called <hi>their own olive-tree,</hi> ver. 24. and they had the firſt offer of grace when Chriſt came.—</p>
            <p>Therefore whatever privileges are intended by the root, and fatneſs of the olive, it is evident that as the branch muſt have a living union to the tree.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007613_0029_102BA9262D488F50"/>
or vine, in order to receive nouriſhment therefrom; ſo every perſon, both great and ſmall, muſt by faith be united to Chriſt, in order to partake of them favours: which ſhews, that no arguments can be drawn from hence to prove that any others are ſubjects of baptiſm but real ſaints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But it is evident that in old time, God did grant to the children of thoſe who were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently godly, many favours and privileges that he did not to others: and ſo the prophet ſpeaking concerning the laſt times, tells the ſaints that they ſhall be <hi>the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off-ſpring with them,</hi> Iſa. lxv. 23. and there is much more in Scripture to the ſame purpoſe; from whence we cannot but think, that children now are taken into covenant with their parents, and therefore have a right to baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The firſt part of this objection is undoubted truth, but the conſequence drawn from it, I think has no foundation in ſcripture: for a great part of the favours thus granted, are only of a temporal nature; and that not only to children, but alſo to other friends round. Thus for inſtance, not only <hi>Noah</hi>'s and <hi>Lot</hi>'s children were ſaved from being drowned and burnt up: but <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlots fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, brothers and ſiſters, alſo were preſerved from being ſlain, for her ſake, becauſe ſhe received the ſpies with peace. <hi>Joſh.</hi> ii. 13. and 6.23, 24.—And how often does God ſpeak of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the kingdom, and the privileges of it, in the hands of the poſterity of <hi>David</hi> his ſervant, for their fathers ſake. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.13, 32, 34, 36. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.35. So that it appears that a great part of the favours, thus given are of a temporal nature, which no ways entitles to goſpel church privileges:—If it did, parents or brethren
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007613_0030_102BA95C09493668"/>
of the godly might claim a right to them, as well as children, Yet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If any ſpiritual favours are ſhewn to children for their parents ſake, they are either the advantage of their godly examples, counſels and inſtructions, and the enjoyment of the outward means of grace, (<hi>chiefly becauſe unto them are committed the oracles of God.</hi> Rom. iii.—) Or elſe out of regard to his ſaints, and in anſwer to their prayers, the Lord is pleas'd to power out his ſpirit on them, and ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn 'em to himſelf: then we readily own that they have a right to all the privileges of the ſons of God.—<hi>I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring:</hi>— What then is the conſequence? why, <hi>one ſhall ſay, I am the Lords: and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of</hi> Jacob: <hi>and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſir-name himſelf by the name of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Iſai.</hi> xliv. 3, 5. Note, firſt God's ſpirit is pour'd upon 'em, and then they openly confeſs him. But what proof is there from hence, that unconverted children have a right to church privileges? The Lord in comforting Zion, in Iſa. liv. 13. ſays, <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of God:</hi> which chapter the apoſtle quotes in our context, to deſcribe the free-woman; and then adds, <hi>We, brethren are her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> all which ſhews, that the churches children in a goſpel ſenſe, are only real ſaints. The ſame appears alſo from what God ſaid to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the new covenant, that he would make with his people: not according to the covenant that he made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> which new covenant, is a writing his law in their hearts, &amp;c. and in deſcribing the extent of it, he ſays, <hi>They ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007613_0031_102BA927C3BF55D8"/>
forgive their iniquity; and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> From which it is evident to a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that none are actually in the covenant, but ſuch as know God, and have their ſins forgiven. This is applied to the goſpel-ſtate in <hi>Heb.</hi> viii.</p>
            <p>Further let it be obſerved, that this point, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours being ſhewn to children for their godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſake, was no ways confined to circumciſion of old, becauſe it appears before, in the time, and after that was inſtituted.—<hi>Before,</hi> it appeared in <hi>Noah</hi>'s family, as obſerved above.—<hi>In the time</hi> of it, we may ſee the ſame in <hi>Lot</hi>'s houſe, and that not only to his immediate off-ſpring, but alſo many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after, God ſhews ſome regard to his poſterity for his ſake, <hi>Deut.</hi> ii. 9, 19. Yet none of them were circumciſed.—And <hi>after</hi> circumciſion was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſame appears without any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reference to that, as may be ſeen in the family of <hi>Phinehas, David,</hi> and others, though all the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were circumciſed as well as they: which proves that God's beſtowing ſome favours on ſaints children, that he did'nt to others of old, never could argue any right to circumciſion, without an expreſs command: then ſurely no proof can from hence be drawn for baptizing believers ſeed now, without the plain direction of the lawgiver.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. According to this, you make as tho' ſaints in goſpel-times have not ſo great privileges as they had under the law: but we believe them to be greater now than then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In order to ſolve this difficulty, 'tis neceſſary to conſider what were truly the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that they enjoy'd, under the law. And <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſhews that their chief privileges were the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the oracles of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 1, 2. which were as means for their converſion and ſalvation:
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007613_0032_102BA95DDD112D68"/>
and that they might not partake of theſe means without being circumciſed is manifeſt, becauſe that Chriſt himſelf when he ſent out his apoſtles before he had by his death aboliſhed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, forbid their preaching to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> but only to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Matt. x. 5, 6. But now our children may enjoy theſe means with vaſtly greater clearneſs than they, without being baptized.—</p>
            <p>Should any here ſay that Baptiſm is a means for converſion, and as ſuch ought to be uſed for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. I reply, that I conceive this was the footing upon which the baptizing of infants was firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the world: though I don't pretend to be much acquainted with the hiſtory of thoſe times, yet I gather this from the account that <hi>Paedobaptiſts</hi> themſelves give of this affair. Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his late defence of the divine right of Infant-Baptiſm: though he can produce no expreſs mention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being baptized in the two firſt hundred years after Chriſt; yet he would perſwade us that the fathers of the third century had the apoſtles minds and practice right in this matter, who plainly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it. But one of the firſt paſſages that he cites is from St. <hi>Origen</hi> in theſe expreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>It is for that reaſon becauſe by the ſacrament of Baptiſm the <hi>pollution of our birth is taken away,</hi> that infants are baptized.</q> P. 111. And hence they frequently called Baptiſm, <hi>regeneration:</hi> which language the church of <hi>England</hi> retain to this day. But if all were regenerated who are ſprinkled in infancy, ſurely we ſhould ſee other men of them, than multitudes of them appear to be. And the notion of the pollution of our births, being waſhed away by this outward application of water, looks ſo abſurd, that I would perſwade myſelf that 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007613_0033_102BA92A70632D30"/>
leſs among us to ſtand to confute it.—Were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, what the noted Mr. <hi>Joſeph Allen</hi> (a <hi>Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>) in his alarm to the unconverted, P. 10. lays down, is ſomewhat to the purpoſe. Says he, <q>It is not the end of Baptiſm to regenerate, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then there would be no reaſon why it ſhould be confined only to the ſeed of believers, for both the law of God, and the nature of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity requires us to uſe the means of converſion for all, as far as we can have opportunity. Were this true, no ſuch charity as to catch the children of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> and baptize them, and diſpatch them to heaven out of hand, like the bloody wretches that made the poor proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants (to ſave their lives) ſwear they would come to <hi>Maſs,</hi> and that they would never depart from it, and then put them forthwith to death ſaying, <hi>They would hang them while in a good mind.</hi> 2. Becauſe it pre-ſuppoſeth regeneration, and therefore can't be intended to confer it. In all the expreſs inſtances in ſcripture, we find that Baptiſm doth ſuppoſe their repenting, believing receiving the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Act.</hi> viii. 37. and ii. 38. and x. 37. <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I alſo obſerve in Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> that there is as early mention of <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> as there is of infants right to Baptiſm. P. 105. He likewiſe ſpeaks of a diſpute that after roſe among the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es whether infants might be baptized as ſoon as they were born, or not till eight days old; which affair was ſettled by a council in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. All which make me think that inſtead of having this pattern from the apoſtles, theſe things were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced gradually among many other corruptions of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. If you think we muſt have as many
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007613_0034_102BA960D6793068"/>
external ordinances of worſhip as they of old, or elſe that our privileges are leſs, you are greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, for 'tis juſtly reckoned a great favour to have that large <hi>hand-writing of ordinances taken out of the way.</hi> Col. ii. 14.—The <hi>Jews</hi> had three ſtated <hi>feaſts</hi> in which all their Males were to appear before God. (<hi>Deut.</hi> xvi. 16.) But there is but one ſtated ordinance in the goſpel-church which is ſo called. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 8. and who will ſay that our privileges are leſs than the <hi>Jews</hi> becauſe of that? Much of the glory of that church was outward (as of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion the Lord ſays, <hi>My covenant ſhall be in your fleſh.</hi> Gen. xvii. 13.) and they had a great deal of outward ſplendor:—in particular their temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> doubtleſs far ſurpaſſed any houſe that any goſpel-church now on earth have to meet in; yet that don't prove our privileges to be leſs than theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Aaron</hi> was choſen God's high-prieſt of old, and then the pieſthood was limittd to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed; and the Lord ſays of his grandſon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas, Behold I give unto him my covenant of peace: and he ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the covenant of an everlaſting prieſthood; becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Iſrael.</hi> Num. xxv. 12.13. Now mark— here is an <hi>everlaſting covenant,</hi> made with <hi>Phinehas,</hi> as well as with <hi>Abraham;</hi> but who will ſay, that goſpel miniſters privileges are leſs now, than thoſe miniſters of God's ſanctuary were then; unleſs the miniſtry may now be limited to their natural poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity? A part of the prieſts work was to <hi>teach Jacob Gods Judgments, and Iſrael his law.</hi> (Deut. xxxiii. 10.) which is the work of goſpel-miniſters now. Natural birth, and ſome outward ceremonies then bro't perſons into the church, and into the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007613_0035_102BA92D01615520"/>
prieſthood: but now ſpiritual birth, and the work of God's grace is neceſſary, in order to bring ſouls aright, into the church and into the miniſtry. As to both, it then ran in a <hi>natural,</hi> but now in a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> line: and there is every whit as much reaſon to plead that miniſters in theſe times, muſt have all their off-ſpring maintained by the offerings of the people; and that none may come into the miniſtry, but their ſeed; (<hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 1—5.) or elſe their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges are cut ſhort; as to ſay, that church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers now muſt have all their children baptized, to prevent a complaint of their privileges being abrid'd.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid may be ſufficient to anſwer that objection that is often urged, <hi>viz.</hi> That chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were once in covenant, and where were they cut off? For they were only in a typical covenant, as has been ſhewn: But when <hi>John</hi> the baptiſt came to prepare the way for the evangelical adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he told the <hi>Jews</hi> to think no more about having <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father; for God was able of ſtones to raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> q. d. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children are now to be reckoned in another line; therefore think no more of having a right to ordinances, only by virtue of natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And he plainly ſhews that evidences of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are neceſſary now in order for any to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of baptiſm; <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.8, 9. So that unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted children were only in that old covenant, which was then <hi>ready to vaniſh away</hi> (Heb. 8.13.) None are in the new covenant, 'till God's law is written in their hearts (ver. 10.) and ſuch never can be cut off.</p>
            <p>Neither will there need much more to be ſaid upon the diſtinction that is made between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adminiſtration and internal efficacy of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. This Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> a late writer inſiſts much
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007613_0036_102BA962D8557A18"/>
upon <note n="*" place="bottom">In his anſwer to Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> on infant baptiſm; I will recite ſome of his words, p. 246. He ſays, <q>A man may be in the covenant of grace, in reſpect of it's viſible adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—and yet he may not be in the covenant of grace in regard of it's ſpiritual diſpenſation and efficacy. This is the caſe of all thoſe hypocrites. p. 248. The inviſible church conſiſts of all, and only real Saints,— all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this inviſible church, it will be granted, are in the covenant of grace, in regard of its ſpiritual efficacy.</q>

                  </gap> Mr <hi>Clark</hi> got in the church to put children in before they believe? I confeſs I can ſee none but only along with hypocrites, to whom he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges Chriſt has not promiſed ſalvation, but to thoſe <hi>only</hi> who believe in their hearts: and if it be a very great privilege to be in ſuch a place, then he may have ſome colour for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of our cutting children off from ſome valuable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, by not baptizing of them before they are converted.</note>: And he owns that none are in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the latter ſenſe, but real ſaints; but their children were in the former external adminiſtration, and ſo he thinks they are now. But if the former adminiſtration was <hi>typical,</hi> and the latter <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as has been ſufficiently ſhewn; and if he is not now a <hi>Jew,</hi> which is not one <hi>outwardly.</hi>—But that he only is a <hi>Jew</hi> which is one <hi>inwardly;</hi> and if now circumciſion is that of the <hi>heart,</hi> in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and not in the <hi>letter,</hi> whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. then ſurely there is no more place here for children, than any others, till their hearts are chang'd.</p>
            <p>And a few words may alſo ſuffice to confute the argument that is fram'd from the ſimilitude of a

king's giving out a patent, or grant of land, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain privileges to a number of perſons, and their heirs ſealed with red wax; and afterwards ſhould call it in, and put a new ſeal, in white wax to to the ſame patent: that in ſuch a caſe there would be no need of expreſſing anew, who were intereſted in it: from whence is argued that 'tis the ſame covenant and grant that believers have now, which was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> only that was ſeal'd with a red or bloody ſeal, and this with a white one <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s dialogue on infant-baptiſm.</note>. But, (to uſe this way of ſpeaking) the difference appears vaſtly great, for the old patent to <hi>Abraham</hi> contained a promiſe of a numerous off-ſpring, that he ſhould be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many nations, and kings ſhould come out of his loins, that they ſhould be God's viſible cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant people, and they ſhould have the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 2—8. The head and capital of which country was <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>—Whereas the new patent is given to Jeſus Chriſt the antetype of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is juſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a better covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> Heb. viii. 6. He has the promiſe of the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion; and all that can claim a right to the bleſſings of this teſtament, are ſuch as are effectually <hi>called:</hi> ſuch have the promiſe of a better land than the old <hi>Canaan</hi> ever was, even an <hi>eternal inheritance,</hi> Heb. ix. 15. The old patent promiſed that <hi>ſome</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity ſhould be made <hi>kings;</hi> but this new one makes <hi>all</hi> Chriſt's ſeed <hi>kings,</hi> as well as <hi>prieſts</hi> to God; who ſhall reign, not for a few years only, but for ever and ever. <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 6. and xxii. 25. The royal ſeat of them old kings, was Jeruſalem below; which in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time was in <hi>bondage with her children:</hi> but

theſe kings ſhall reign in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above, and is <hi>free, which is the mother of us all.</hi>—They of old were God's covenant people for a while, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for their breaking his covenant, he ſays, he <hi>regarded them not.</hi> (Heb. viii. 9.) But thoſe that are in this new covenant, <hi>There is nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent nor to come, that ſhall ever ſeparate them from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Rom. viii.—And as the articles in theſe two teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are very different one from the other; ſo, ſhould we ſuppoſe (but not grant) theſe external ordinances to be <hi>ſeals,</hi> yet there is a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them alſo. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Circumciſion was only for the males; baptiſm is both for males and females.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Circumciſion might be adminiſtered by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſons: <hi>Moſes</hi>'s wife circumciſed his ſon, (<hi>Exod.</hi> iv. 25.) and <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s neighbours came to circumciſe <hi>John; Luke</hi> i. 58, 59.—But Baptiſm is to be adminiſtred only by Chriſt's meſſengers. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 19, 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Circumciſion was not to be adminiſtred 'till eight days old; but baptiſm has no other age fixed than only, if they believe with all the heart, they may be baptized. <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 37.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Circumciſion bound 'em to obſerve all thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ceremonies, which baptiſm, does not. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5—</p>
            <p n="5">5. Circumciſion was a type of what ſhould come, even of Chriſt's being cut off, and alſo of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. Whereas baptiſm is not a type of what is to come; but is an outward ſign or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of what is inwardly wrought. <hi>As many as are baptized into Chriſt</hi> HAVE <hi>put on Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 3, 27.—Here lies one ſpecial difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ordinances of the old teſtament, and the new. Old teſtament ordinances were typical of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007613_0039_102BA9309B60AAC0"/>
what was to come: Whereas the ordinances of the new, are open declarations of what is actually done. Thus for inſtance, in the Lord's ſupper, we do <hi>ſhew forth the Lord's Death:</hi> or from time to time, hold up a publick witneſs to the world that Chriſt has really died for ſinners; and this we are to continue in the practice of, till his ſecond coming. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 26.</p>
            <p>Hence we may ſee the reaſon, why thoſe might be the ſubjects of circumciſion, that may not of baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe that pointed forward to what was to be, and ſo might be adminiſtred to ſubjects who had not the thing typified, wrought in their hearts: but baptiſm is not a type that the ſubjects ſhall be converted; but an open ſign or witneſs that he is ſo; and thus the worthy ſubject in attending that ordinance declares, that he has been <hi>crucified with Chriſt, and is made dead unto ſin and alive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Rom. vi.—</p>
            <p>This view I conceive may give us a true idea of that text which is conſiderably uſed in this affair. <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 11. <hi>And he received the ſign of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith.</hi>— From whence many conclude, that the covenant of circumciſion was the pure covenant of grace: and that circumciſion then, and baptiſm now are ſeals thereof. But you may obſerve, that what the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is upon, is proving that great point of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith alone: and he brings in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi> as an evidence in the caſe, and ſhews that he was juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the law. Upon this there ariſes another queſtion, which is, whether this great bleſſings comes only on the circumciſion, or on others alſo? to decide which he takes a review of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe; from whence it appears that <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007613_0040_102BA967629E9450"/>
was juſtified by faith, long before circumciſion was inſtituted. <hi>And he received the ſign of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumciſed.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Circumciſion (as has been ſhewn) was a ſign of what was to come; but <hi>Abraham</hi> had the thing ſignified then wrought in his ſoul; ſo that he had both the type and antetype, and thus it was to him a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith which he then had: but how could it be a ſeal to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and thouſands of others of the righteouſneſs of the faith which they had not?—The apoſtle from hence goes on to ſhew that thus ſtanding, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a father to all that believ'd, tho' not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: and a father to thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were not only circumciſed; but alſo walked in the ſame faith that he had before he was circumciſed; which brings out juſt the ſame thing, that has been obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>viz.</hi> that typically he was father of all that church, both believers and unbelievers, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually he is the father of all the ſaints, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And without this diſtinction it ſeems impoſſible to reconcile many paſſages of ſcripture together.</p>
            <p>Before I diſmiſs this point, I would ſhew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the abſurdities and enlargements which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, upon holding, that all ſaints natural ſeed now are in covenant with 'em, according to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s covenant. This leaves men at a loſs about how large the church is; and who have a right to its ordinances. Some hold, that church members ſhould baptize both their children and their ſervants; only it muſt be ſuch as are young: yet then they can never tell exactly, what age to fix.—Numbers there are, who inſiſt upon all baptized children's coming to the Lord's Supper at ſixteen years old, if not openly
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007613_0041_102BA933909F4B78"/>
ſcandalous: but moſt of the firſt Settlers of <hi>New-England,</hi> would receive none to the Supper, but ſuch as they counted godly, and would baptize no children, but only where one of the parents were church-members: yet when theſe children were grown up, they began to plead that they were in covenant, and therefore muſt have their children baptized; or elſe they would be like heathens: and ſo by degrees they got into the practice of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch to own the covenant (as 'tis call'd,) and have their children baptized, who did not think themſelves fit to come to the Lord's Supper: which ſeems to bring in a ſort of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or half way between the church and the world. This has been renounced by many in the preſent day, who ſtill hold to infant-baptiſm: tho' other godly and learned men when they have owned ſome ſcruple in the caſe, yet have ſaid, "What ſhall we do? they are in the covenant who have been baptized, and how can we deny 'em the privileges?"—Others ſay that tho' children baptized, have not a right to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nor to bring their ſeed to baptiſm, till conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet they are under the watch and care of the church, and if they are found obſtinate tranſgreſſors, they muſt be diſciplin'd and caſt out. But we are commanded in any wiſe to rebuke our neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him; and to reprove even the unfruitful works of darkneſs, and would you caſt 'em out from this? that is a great length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe profeſs to hold to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that they will ſhew themſelves to be his children by doing his works; and yet there is not one of them all, that come up to what they profeſs: for <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſed himſelf, his ſon and all the MEN of his houſe; of which there were
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007613_0042_102BA96960405CE8"/>
318 trained ſoldiers. <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 23. and xiv. 14. But theſe ſeveral ſorts of perſons diſcover ſomething in the new-teſtament that contradicts ſo large a practice as that,—therefore they take a part of it; ſome a greater part, and others leſs, according as it appears cleareſt to them.—The chief reaſon of all this confuſion, I conceive to be men's jumbling the conſtitution of the old teſtament church, and the new together: whereas if we take them diſtant, the limits of each are expreſt very plain. The limits of the old church are expreſt as plain by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they were to <hi>Abraham.</hi>—If any man would join with that church and come to the paſſover, he muſt have all his males circumciſed: and every man's ſervant, bought with money, when he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, then ſhould he eat the paſſover. A foreign and an hired ſervant might not eat thereof: but all the congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould keep it. <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 44,—48. There are the bounds ſet exactly; and as plain are they in the new-teſtament. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.—They that gladly received the word were baptized; and the ſame day were added to the church: and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in her fellowſhip.—And the Lord added to the church daily, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved. <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41,—47.— All who by <hi>birth</hi> or <hi>purchaſe</hi> were incorporated into an <hi>Hebrew</hi>'s family, had a right to all the ordinances of that church:— So all that by Chriſt's <hi>purchaſe</hi> and the <hi>new-birth,</hi> are bro't into the <hi>houſhold of God;</hi> have a right to all the privileges of the goſpel church. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 19. —22. And to vary a ſtep from this, leads men into a jumble; and rather than yield the caſe, they will ſay, that the ſcriptures have left this matter in the dark, about the ſubjects of baptiſm: when in truth all the darkneſs is in their own minds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:007613_0043_102BA93513CD1780"/>Let none improve any of theſe things, to leſſen their obligations of diſcharging their duty faithfully towards their children's ſouls as well as bodies. I believe that thoſe to whom God hath given chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ought to give them up to him again, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their obligations to bring them up in his ways; and let us bring them to Chriſt for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as they did of old. But ſome ſay, <q>How can we bring them to him, but in the way of his ordinances? we know not how to bring them to him but by baptizing of them, as the ſeal of our faith.</q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sick perſons were then frequently brought to Chriſt as well as children: and can't you find a way not to bring your ſick to Chriſt either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly or privately without baptizing of them? ſurely you can.—And ſince there is no more hint of baptiſm in one caſe, than the other, I think you may raiſe as good an argument from hence, for having baptiſm adminiſtred as a ſeal of your faith in bringing your <hi>ſick</hi> to Chriſt, as your <hi>children.</hi> If it be urged that Chriſt ſays, <hi>Of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> I reply, that he does not ſay <hi>all</hi> ſuch, but <hi>of</hi> ſuch is the kingdom of God: and he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately adds (both in <hi>Mark</hi> x. 15. and <hi>Luk.</hi> xviii. 17.) an aſſertion that, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein.</hi> Which ſeems to relate rather to the <hi>tempers,</hi> than to the <hi>perſons</hi> of little children. But let all who have an intereſt at the throne of grace implore it for their children as well as others: and alſo uſe all their endeavours with them to bring them to know God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt: and when once there appears evidence of their being in ſuch a happy condition, then let them be as ſmall as they will, it is readily granted that they have a right to all the privileges of the ſons of God.</p>

               <hi>USE</hi> III. What has been ſaid may lead us to an examination of our condition. Since all the world is divided into two families, as Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that is not for us, is againſt us;</hi> ſo here, all are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren either of the bondwoman or, the free. Then ſurely 'tis of infinite importance for each ſoul to know which mother they belong to: and the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have given many plain marks whereby we may come to know how our caſe is.—For brevity's ſake I ſhall inſtance in but one, which is that, <hi>If thou art a child of the free-woman, it is become thy</hi> LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY <hi>to walk in holineſs.</hi> Herein lies a ſpecial difference between the leaſt chriſtian and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hypocrite in the world. Both of them pay ſome regard to the ſame commands, and in many things their external walk may appear alike: but then the ſprings and motives of their obedience are vaſtly different. The hypocrite ſometimes does things to be ſeen of men, though what moſt commonly moves him, is fear of hell if he neglects duty, and hopes of eſcaping it by his performances. Hence you'll often hear them pleading, that 'tis dangerous for perſons to be too confident; and that 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for to always have ſome fear of miſcarrying at laſt, leſt we ſhould grow remiſs and careleſs in duty; and ſome will plainly ſay, that if the doctrine which many hold concerning perſeverance and aſſurance is true, and if they knew that they were in Chriſt, and ſhould never periſh, they would not care how they lived, for all would end well at laſt. But how plainly do theſe men diſcover themſelves to be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the bond-woman, for they look no further than their ways, or to eſcape the whip? We all know that the greater confirmations an obedient child has of his father's love, and the ſecurity of his favour, the more chearful, active and diligent he
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007613_0045_102BA937D88B5B10"/>
will be in doing his father's will, and careful not to do any thing to offend him. And ſince it is ſo often aſſerted, that ſaints love and delight in God's law, how can any rational ſoul, (if they would let reaſon, inſtead of their own experience decide the caſe) imagine that clear diſcoveries of God's love and favour, would make men leſs careful to ſerve him!—Don't we all know that what men love and delight in, they will ſeek and perſue after, without being drove? as for inſtance, food that we love, we labour for earneſtly, and eat of it frequently, without being told that we ſhall die if we don't. And <hi>Job</hi> ſays, that he <hi>eſteemed the words of God's mouth more than his neceſſary food.</hi> chap. xxiii, 12. and <hi>David</hi> counted the divine law, to be <hi>ſweeter than the honey-comb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Pſal. xix. 10. Alſo <hi>perſons</hi> that we love;—without driving, we ſeek all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to enjoy their company. So will all thoſe that truly love God, and his ſaints,—yea ſuch as love the riches, honours, or pleaſures of this world, not only voluntarily run after them, but they alſo earneſtly crave a great deal of them: and ſo do thoſe who love Chriſt and holineſs; and they that are content with a little degree of grace; never knew the glory and excellency of divine things. <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> Pſal. xvii. 15. Nothing ſhort of this can fill the deſires of a gracious ſoul. The firſt epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> is peculiarly calculated to detect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious hypocrites, and to preſs home a holy life upon all profeſſors of religion: and obſerve well the beloved diſciples method.—<hi>My little children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not.</hi>—But what if they ſhould happen to be enſnared in ſin? does he then ſet the terrors of hell before them? No, he preſents the grace and bleſſings of heaven;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007613_0046_102BA96D72301D30"/>
—<hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the father;</hi>—and <hi>if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> chap. i. 9. and ii. 1. And further to attain this glorious end, he ſets ſaints to admiring the wondrous love of God in taking them to be his children, and aſſerts that now they are the ſons of God, but what they ſhall be advanced to, does not yer appear; but ſays he, <hi>We</hi> KNOW <hi>that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> There is the ſtrongeſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance expreſt; but will that make them ſlack in their obedience? No, quite the contrary, for <hi>every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure;</hi>—and he declares, that he that can run on in ſin, <hi>Hath not ſeen</hi> Chriſt, <hi>neither known him.</hi> chap. iii. 1, 2, 3, 6. And now, are not hypocrites aſhamed of their notion that aſſurance is a licentious doctrine?—O my readers, I intreat and charge you before God, who ſhall judge us all, to ſearch critically your own hearts, and ſee whether you are governed by a ſpirit of bondage, and ſlaviſh fear, or by the ſpirit of adoption, whereby you can cry <hi>Abba Father.</hi> Rom. viii. 15.—</p>
            <p>I ſhall only anſwer a ſcruple that may ariſe here in ſome gracious ſouls, and then diſmiſs this head.— Methinks I hear ſome ſuch ſay, <q>Alas, I fear that I am a child of the bond-woman, for I often drag on heavily in duty, and I feel my heart ſo dull and backward to ſpiritual exerciſes, that I can't think there is any grace in it.</q> But this ſhort queſtion may eaſily decide the caſe, viz. Is it the divine command which are burdenſome to thee, or thy vile heart that often hinders thee from doing the things that thou wouldeſt?—God's ſervice is a <hi>Wearineſs</hi> to hypocrites. <hi>Amos</hi> viii. 5. <hi>Mal.</hi> i. 13.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007613_0047_102BA93CA0AE8038"/>
But ſaints delight in his law after the inward man, tho' they find a law in their members warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 21, 22, 23. Carefully obſerve this diſtinction, and you may come to know what your condition is.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, I ſhall cloſe with a ſhort addreſs to two or three ſorts of perſons. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> to thoſe that hold the contrary from me concerning the ſubjects of baptiſm, many of whom are very near to me. <hi>My dear friends,</hi> it may be ſome of you will be offended, and others grieved with me, when you ſee the foregoing lines. But I think I can truly ſay, that 'tis not out of bitterneſs, but rather out of love to you, that I have pen'd what you here ſee. Therefore I would only beg this one favour of you, namely, that you would candidly weigh what is here ſaid, in the balances of the ſanctuary, before you cenſure or caſt it by: and in order for this, let the characters of all that have held the one ſide or the other of this principle be put intirely out of the queſtion, or you'll never come to the right of the caſe. That there have been good Men of both ſentiments is no ſcruple to me, and I believe not to you neither; and 'tis as evident that there has been bad men on both ſides: and ſhould you try to find out which had the greateſt number, it would be little to the purpoſe. —The miſchiefs that I have found by experience in theſe things makes me caution you againſt them. <hi>David</hi> was a man of a much better character than <hi>Jacob;</hi> yet <hi>Jacob</hi> had the right of the caſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing numbering the people. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us all obey the divine command to <hi>ceaſe from man,</hi> viewing that all fleſh is but fadeing graſs: and be willing that this matter ſhould be decided alone by <hi>the word of our God that ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> (Iſa. ii. 22. and xl. 8.) And if after a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007613_0048_102BA96EF5950698"/>
ſearching of the ſcriptures, you ſtill remain of a different mind from me; yet ſtill remember that to his own maſter each ſoul ſtands or falls, and ſo forbare all bitter cenſures. And O that each one would with greater earneſtneſs <hi>forget the things that are behind, and preſs towards the glorious mark;</hi> believing that wherein we are differently minded, God ſhall in his own time reveal the whole truth unto us. <hi>Phill.</hi> iii. 14, 15. Oh, when ſhall that bleſſed day come, when ſaints will have done with all miſunderſtandings of each other; when they ſhall all join with one heart and ſoul to praiſe our glorious King for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſay a word to ſuch as are of my ſentiments concerning baptiſm.—Brethren, what I have to ſpeak to you is, <hi>Live up to your principles.</hi> —How inexcuſable will thoſe appear, who inſiſt upon it that perſons muſt believe in order to be baptized; and yet admit ſuch to this ordinance who give no proper evidence of any thing more than an hiſtorical or doctrinal faith? whereas a believing with all the heart is neceſſary to give a right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>Act.</hi> viii. 37. And though God alone can ſearch the heart; yet <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>repentance</hi> ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked after in this caſe.—And as little excuſe can be found for them, that while they plead that we muſt be <hi>buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have as though ſin lived and reigned in their hearts ſtill, inſtead of being <hi>dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Rom. vi. 4, 11. Therefore let none while they profeſs to know God, deny him in works: but be exhorted ſo to walk as to <hi>adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi>—This would have a much greater ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to bring others to imbrace the truth in theſe things, than many warm diſputes without a good life. 'Tis not eaſy to imagine how much uſe is
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007613_0049_102BA98D52FF0D68"/>
made of the corrupt lives of numbers of thoſe in the land who are called <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> to bar the minds of thouſands againſt <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or even candidly <hi>weighing</hi> and <hi>examining</hi> what I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are truths which they hold. And tho' I am not excuſing ſuch conduct; yet I would earneſtly perſwade you all as much as may be to <hi>cut off occaſion from thoſe that deſire occaſion</hi> thus to treat the truth and them that hold it. And if others ſay that we diſregard, and are cruel to our children, becauſe we don't baptize them before they are converted: let each head of a family, walk in his houſe with a perfect heart, and behave ſo towards the little ones that God has given him, as to evidence that he has a much greater regard for the ſpiritual, than the temporal welfare of his children.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I will cloſe with a word to all the children of the bond-woman, <hi>My dear fellow Men,</hi> be intreated to conſider how ſad your caſe and condition is. If you flouriſh in the world more than the ſaints, and are let alone to live as you liſt: this is but a miſerable portion, which preſently will be all ſtript from you, and God will ſay, <hi>How much they have glorified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give them.</hi> Jam. 5— Rev. 18.7.—Many of you are ready to think, that there is too much ado made about religion, and can laugh at the devotions of the godly. But Oh! remember and take warning by your old father <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> he made a <hi>mock</hi> of his fathers joy, in ſeeing the accompliſhment of God's promiſe; which is here (ver. 29) call'd <hi>perſecution,</hi> for which he was <hi>caſt out,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his fathers houſe, but alſo from the bleſſings of Salvation, which he had deſpiſed. <hi>Now therefore be ye not mockers leaſt your bands, be made ſtrong,</hi> (Iſa. 28, 22) but fly to Chriſt, that your ſouls may live.— And are there any of you that are ſeeking help by the life of your own hands; how does Chriſt expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with you (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, 3) ſaying, <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight itſelf in fatneſs. Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear and your ſouls ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David. AMEN.</p>
